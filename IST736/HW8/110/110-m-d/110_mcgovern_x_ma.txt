<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 5501, TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. I want to thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding me the time.  
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and in support of the underlying bill. 
   Madam Speaker, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act is one of the most important foreign policy and global health bills this Congress will pass. We have literally gone from 5 years ago from standing helplessly by and watching people die of HIV/AIDS to watching people live and take up productive lives in their communities. The impact is far-reaching, and it wasn't a miracle. It is the result of presidential leadership and broad bipartisan support, and the bill that we take up later today, the Senate amendment to H.R. 5501, continues and strengthens this legacy. And it merits the support of every single Member of this House. 
   Madam Speaker, on April 2, when the House first debated H.R. 5501, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Berman, Africa and Global Health Subcommittee Chairman Payne, Congresswoman Emerson, and I entered into a bipartisan colloquy on the importance of food and nutrition for successful HIV/AIDS programs. The colloquy also emphasized how funding for such initiatives needs to be provided for PEPFAR programs but without taking money away from other global food aid and nutrition programs and priorities. 
   It is my understanding that later today when the House takes up the Senate amendment to H.R. 5501, Chairman Berman will enter into the Record a Statement of Legislative Intent reiterating the conclusions of that April colloquy. I want to thank Chairman Berman for his important Statement of Legislative Intent. I also want to express my appreciation for his leadership and his commitment to food and nutrition as important health initiatives and for his determination to safeguard the scarce resources already dedicated to carrying out other U.S. global food aid and nutrition programs. 
   Again, Madam Speaker, I urge that every single Member support the rule and especially the underlying bill. 
   Colloquy: Food Security and Nutrition in H.R. 5501--PEPFAR Reauthorization--April 2, 2008 
   Berman: I yield three minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. McGovern, for purposes of a colloquy. 
   McGovern: I thank the Chairman and for time for the gentlelady from Missouri and I to enter into a colloquy with the Chairman on the importance of integrating food and nutrition programs with the prevention, care, and treatment of HIV/AIDS affected individuals, families, and communities. 
   McGovern: As the Chairman is aware, last year I traveled to Africa and had the opportunity to see first-hand many of our programs related to food security. In Ethiopia and Kenya, I visited HIV/AIDS programs to look at how food and nutrition were included. At that time, I heard from local communities, NGO partners, and our embassy staff how restrictive guidance for global HIV/AIDS assistance often hindered their ability to design and carry out effective food and nutrition programs targeted at HIV/AIDS affected individuals, families, and communities. The lack of resources available for food and nutrition programs within global HIV/AIDS assistance and from other sources also posed a significant barrier. 
   I very much appreciate and support the work of the Committee in ensuring H.R. 5501 addresses these concerns throughout the bill, and especially in the section entitled ``Food Security and Nutrition Support.'' The bill recognizes that strengthening the linkages and enhancing coordination among HIV/AIDS programs and other vital development programs, like food and nutrition programs, will significantly increase our effectiveness in the fight against HIV/AIDS while we advance other essential U.S. development priorities. I remain concerned, however, that the bill is less clear on where or how such funding will be provided for these purposes. It is not clear on how much funding will come from the Global HIV/AIDS program, versus other sources of funding. I am concerned that without adequate resources through the global HIV/AIDS program or necessary increases for current food and nutrition services through programs like Food for Peace, USAID will be faced with the possibility of having to divert funding from programs that address long-term chronic hunger and food insecurity to meet the enhanced mandates of H.R. 5501. 
   I know the Chairman will agree that we want to avoid the scenario of robbing Peter to pay Paul, so that we do not end up short-changing other communities suffering from hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity. I yield to the gentlelady from Missouri in this regard. 
   Emerson: Mr. Chairman, I am also concerned that the situation will become even worse because the cost of food, commodities, and transportation is skyrocketing. Just last month, on February 12th, USAID's Office of Food for Peace announced that the cost of wheat and other food the United States donates to poor countries jumped 41% in the first half of Fiscal Year 2008. According to USAID, this means $120 million in food assistance will not be available for people who are malnourished or food insecure. 
   I would ask the Chairman to work on strengthening the language in the bill as it moves through the legislative process and into conference negotiations to clarify how the necessary level of funding for food security and nutrition will be provided, especially in light of rising food and transportation costs, so that funds will not be diverted from U.S. programs addressing chronic hunger and emergency operations. I would yield back to the gentleman from Massachusetts. 
   McGovern: I yield back to the Chairman to express his views. 
   Berman: I yield one minute to the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Payne to express his views on this matter. 
   Payne: Mr. Chairman, as you know, the provision on food and nutrition security in the bill currently under consideration is drawn directly from a bill that I introduced in December, H.R. 4914, the Global HIV/AIDS Food Security, and Nutrition Support Act of 2007. I introduced the bill after chairing a hearing in the Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health to determine whether the Global HIV/AIDS program was adequately addressing the nutritional needs of its beneficiaries. 
   The hearing corroborated what I have heard in the field during numerous visits to Africa over the past five years: PEPFAR is falling short in this critical area. I share the concerns of the gentleman from Massachusetts and the gentle lady from Missouri about the increasing cost of food aid. Just last week the World Food Program had to issue an appeal for an additional $500 million to offset the increased cost of food and fuel. Without the extra funds, 73 million people who rely on WFP for their daily sustenance may have their rations cut. This is a truly alarming situation, and it is not my intent for the provisions in this bill to exacerbate it. The language under consideration very clearly states that these activities are to be funded from amounts authorized under section 401 of the bill. I used this language deliberately, as I strongly believe that the food assistance and nutritional support we are providing under the Global HIV/AIDS program must be on top of the food aid we are already providing. 
   Payne: I thank the Chairman and yield back to him. 
   Berman: I yield myself one minute. I thank my colleagues for raising these important concerns. H.R. 5501 provides clear and specific instructions to the USAID Administrator and the Global AIDS Coordinator to address the food and nutrition needs of individuals with HIV/AIDS and other affected individuals, including orphans and vulnerable children; and to fully integrate food and nutrition support in HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care programs carried out under this Act. 
   I would like to emphasize that the Committee and I, personally, share our colleagues' concerns about the negative effect rising costs are having on our long-term and emergency food aid programs. This is a matter that has our most serious attention because it affects a wide array of our food aid and development programs, including the effectiveness and success of our Global HIV/AIDS programs. 
   I want to reassure my colleagues that I will be working over the coming weeks to strengthen and clarify in the bill that food security and nutrition programs, especially those referred to as wraparound services, are not to be funded with monies diverted from other standing commitments to address food insecurity elsewhere in the world or in these countries. I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Massachusetts. 
   McGovern: I thank the Chairman for that assurance. I know many Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, stand ready to support him in these efforts. I yield back.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (NATIONAL HIGHWAY BRIDGE RECONSTRUCTION AND INSPECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   With respect to the gentlemen from Texas and New Mexico, they don't know what they are talking about. I mean, this is ridiculous. We are talking about a bridge in Fall River, Massachusetts. This is a bridge that is owned by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. It is not owned by the Federal Government; it is owned by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the city of Fall River and the people of that community have decided that they want to preserve this bridge. Why, one of the reasons why is for an evacuation route. And another reason why is they want to turn it into a biking path and a walking path to help revitalize the waterfront in Fall River and Somerset. 
   The community is almost unanimous in their support for this effort. There is no controversy in Fall River. There is no controversy in Massachusetts about this. 
   And as far as the debate about LNG, this is the least of the problems for a potential LNG facility in the middle of Fall River. The Coast Guard has said it is an unacceptable risk. The U.S. Navy has said it is a mistake. The Secretary of Commerce has said it is a bad idea. This has nothing to do with LNG. This has everything to do with whether or not we are going to allow some people on that side of the aisle to attack the hardworking families of Fall River who last week they verbally assaulted because they said they were not entitled to any kind of environmental benefit. This week they want to take away a bridge that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts owns that the people of Fall River want to protect. 
   Massachusetts, by the way, in terms of LNG, is doing more than almost every other State in this country. We have two up and running and another being licensed. So this has nothing to do with energy. This has nothing to do with LNG. This has everything to do with whether or not the people of Fall River, the hardworking people of Fall River, deserve to determine what to do with a little measly bridge that they want to preserve to help revitalize their waterfront. 
   So enough of this nonsense; vote down this motion.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, our economy is at a crossroads. Low- and middle-income families are struggling to make ends meet. Rising food, energy, and housing prices combined with slow job creation and lower wages are straining our economy. The Federal Reserve continues to act, but it is clear that Congress must enact a temporary, targeted, and timely economic stimulus package. The American economy needs a quick stimulus, and low- and middle-income Americans need swift action as our economy works through these difficult times. 
   I rise to commend the bipartisan leadership of Speaker Pelosi and Leader BOEHNER who, along with President Bush, crafted an economic stimulus package that will not only provide the assistance our economy needs, but also will provide a helping hand to the American families currently struggling with the slowing economy. 
   It is refreshing to see Republicans and Democrats come together and put partisanship aside and develop this critical legislation together. The American people should be proud of this effort, and I am pleased to have supported this important first step earlier today. 
   Mr. Speaker, while important, the stimulus package this House voted on today is simply a first step in the road toward stimulating our economy. Speaker Pelosi deserves incredible credit for negotiating the inclusion of a refundable tax rebate that will be delivered to anyone earning $3,000 or more and the inclusion of a $300 per-child rebate. Again, this is a good start. 
   Yet there are millions of Americans who will not benefit from this current stimulus package because they do not file income taxes. Any American who has exhausted or will exhaust their unemployment will not receive the help they need. States struggling with higher health care costs will be forced to balance their budgets on the backs of low-income individuals because there is no Medicaid assistance included in this package. And most importantly, a temporary extension of the food stamp program is sorely missing from this economic stimulus package. 
   Experts across the political and ideological spectrum agree that we must develop a plan that helps the most vulnerable people and households and that allows currency to flow. Former Reagan economic adviser, Martin Feldstein; former Clinton Treasury Secretary, Lawrence Summers; the Congressional Budget Office; economists at Goldman Sachs; and the chief economist at Moodys.com all agree that food stamps give the biggest bang for the buck and should be part of an economic stimulus. 
   According to the Congressional Budget Office: ``The vast majority of food stamp benefits are spent extremely rapidly. And because food stamp recipients have low income and few assets, most of any additional benefits would probably be spent quickly.'' 
   Administrative costs of such an increase are negligible, meaning that the majority of this stimulus will go directly into the economy. A 10 percent temporary increase in food stamps would result in an increase of almost 50 cents per day per person or $14 per month in the food stamp benefit. That may not seem like much, but an extra 50 cents a day can make the world of difference for someone struggling to feed themselves. 
   More importantly, a temporary increase in food stamp benefits would generate $1.73 in economic activity for every dollar in cost, and we know that a temporary increase in food stamps can be delivered quickly and will be spent right away. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan economic stimulus package is not perfect. But as I said earlier, it is a good first step. The Senate has a chance to make some improvements in this bill, most notably targeted and temporary increases in food stamps and unemployment insurance. I, for one, hope the United States Senate acts responsibly by including these important programs in their version of the stimulus package. 
   It is critical that this stimulus package move quickly, but it is just as critical that it include stimulus that jump-  starts the economy and gives assistance to those who truly need it. 
   And if the Senate includes funding for these critical programs, I strongly urge all my colleagues to support it, and I urge President Bush to then sign it into law. It is the right thing to do for our economy, and it is the right thing to do for the millions of low-income Americans who will not benefit from this stimulus package as it is currently written.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (HONORING THE SERVICE OF LANDING SHIP TANK VETERANS -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Indiana, who represents the home base of the USS LST Memorial Ship, the LST-325, for yielding me the time. 
   Madam Speaker, I could not be more proud to see this resolution come before the House today for consideration. The Navy and Coast Guard sailors and seamen who served on these LSTs are true American heroes. They fought for this country in some of the most decisive battles in our history, from the 1940s to the early 1990s, and they deserve to be recognized. 
   I am glad that the United States Congress will be going on record in commending these veterans for their service, and it's especially nice that this resolution comes up today before the LST veterans have their national convention in Washington, D.C. at the end of August. 
   I want to express special appreciation to Armed Services Committee Chairman IKE SKELTON and to Ranking Member Duncan Hunter for moving this bill forward in order to honor these veterans and their service. 
   Madam Speaker, this resolution would not have happened without a number of veterans who have remained active in preserving the heritage of the LSTs. Peter Leasca from Worcester, Massachusetts deserves a lot of the credit. He has really educated me and a lot of my colleagues about what these ships meant to the Navy, what they meant to the Allies in World War II and what they meant and still mean to the people who served on them. 
   I also want to express my gratitude to Mike and Linda Gunjak, at the United States LST Association, and to Captain Bob Jornlin, at the USS LST Memorial Ship, for all of their help, support and guidance on this resolution. 
   A few years ago, in working with Congressman RALPH HALL, I was able to get language in a defense authorization bill that allowed the Government of Greece to transfer ownership of the USS LST-325 to the USS LST Memorial Ship, Inc., the nonprofit organization set up by LST veterans to bring the LST-325 home and to turn it into an operational memorial and living museum. 
   LST veterans went to Greece; they refurbished by the sweat of their own brow the LST-325, and sailed her home. Now it's here in the United States so that all Americans can learn about the essential role the LSTs played in our history and about the service and sacrifices made by their crews. 
   World War II naval historian Samuel Eliot Morison described the LST as the ``most useful all-around craft invented by the Navy,'' but a lot of people don't fully appreciate just how important the LSTs were to achieving victory in World War II, not only during the D-day invasion but also throughout the Pacific theater, including the liberation of the Philippines and the capture of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. They were reliable and flexible just like their crews, and the image of men and of equipment off-loading on the beaches of Normandy is burned into the imagination of the American people and of all World War II-era veterans. 
   After World War II, the LSTs were put to great use in the Korean War, in the Vietnam War and in other military conflicts, but they were also used to deliver humanitarian assistance, which helped to literally save the lives of thousands of people and win a lot of hearts and minds around the world for the United States. Beginning in World  War II, when the LSTs evacuated over 41,000 wounded men back across the English Channel from Normandy, to Operation Sea Angel in Bangladesh, the LSTs have also been a symbol of hope to those in grave need or peril. 
   On Easter Sunday morning in 1945, Peter Leasca was aboard LST-824, carrying men and armored vehicles onto the heavily defended beaches of Okinawa, just 340 miles from the Japanese mainland. He was a 20-year-old naval medical corpsman. He witnessed the fierce fighting from the Japanese holding the island. He saw a kamikaze pilot slam his plane into the battleship USS New Mexico, killing 30 sailors and setting the ship ablaze. 
   Now at the age of 83, this very special World War II veteran and his fellow LST veterans across the country are being recognized by a grateful Congress for their service and for the essential role the LSTs played so long ago. 
   I thank them for their service. I thank them for their sacrifice. I thank them for keeping this history alive. May God bless them all. 
   I would again like to thank my colleague from Indiana (Mr. Ellsworth) for his generosity in yielding me this time, for his leadership in this Congress and for his friendship.  
   Navy Veterans Tribute Bill Lands in Congress  
   On Easter Sunday morning, 1945, Peter Leasca rode aboard a Landing Ship, Tank or LST carrying men and armored vehicles onto the heavily defended beaches of Okinawa just 340 miles from the Japanese mainland. 
   Throughout that day, the then-20-year-old naval medical corpsman witnessed ``fierce fighting'' from Japanese defenders and a Kamikaze slamming into the battleship USS New Mexico, killing 30 sailors and setting it ablaze. 
   Four-and-a-half months later, Japan surrendered and a year after that Leasca returned home, attended college, married and raised four children while working as a stockbroker. 
   If all goes as planned, the 83-year-old veteran from Worcester and his shrinking ``Band of Brothers'' who served on amphibious vessels will be thanked by the U.S. government for their service during World War II. 
   Recognition has been a long time coming. 
   Local World War II veterans, like Howard Rouse and Rosario George Puliafico, who served aboard LSTs or similar craft, are grateful for the belated recognition but hope the honors extend to those in all branches who lost their lives defending their country. 
   ``LSTs and ships like them were the keys to victory. But a lot of guys lost their lives,'' said Rouse, a Framingham resident who retired after 40 years in broadcasting. ``I think what they did shortened the war. I think they should be recognized.'' 
   With an estimated 1,025 World War II veterans dying every day, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs, Leasca is getting closer to winning his last battle to earn recognition for the men who served aboard amphibious landing craft. 
   ``Guys like us are a vanishing group,'' said Leasca. ``We're in our twilight years.'' 
   On the floor of the U.S. Congress, Rep. James McGovern will call for a vote Wednesday, July 30 on a resolution he authored with input from naval veterans to honor all who served aboard amphibious landing craft in World War II, Korea, Vietnam and Operation Desert Storm through 2002. 
   McGovern predicts the bill, House Resolution 1316, will pass and be sent to the Senate and the President for confirmation. 
   McGovern said veterans, like Leasca, Rouse and Puliafico, ``who served on these LSTs are true American heroes.'' 
   ``They fought for this country in some of the most decisive battles in our history. And they deserve to be recognized,'' he said. 
   McGovern added the vote was scheduled for this month so it would precede the LST veterans' annual convention in Washington, D.C., in August. 
   He credited Leasca for ``really educating me'' and congressional colleagues about the contributions and sacrifices made by those who served aboard amphibious vehicles. U.S. Rep. William Delahunt is also one of the resolution's sponsors. 
   Decades after the war's end, Leasca fought a successful rearguard action to honor his martial colleagues and return to the U.S. the 64-year-old LST-325 from Greece, where it served the Greek navy for 20 years. 
   For years he's been one of the most active members and former president of the Amphibious Veterans of Massachusetts. 
   Leasca said the 328-foot-long LSTs lacked modern amenities but inspired loyalty from the crews of about 120 men who served aboard them. 
   Waxing nostalgically, he recalled living on his LST as it wove the arduous voyage through the Panama Canal, into submarine-infested waters and on to Hawaii. 
   ``We went up and down, rocked left and right. Sometimes it got pretty rough,'' Leasca remembered. ``It was a long voyage like an ocean cruiser. I saw porpoises and sights I'd never seen before.'' 
   He pointed out the World War II naval historian Samuel Eliot Morrison described LSTs as ``the most useful all-around craft invented by the Navy.'' 
   As time passes and veterans of amphibious craft fade away, Leasca ``wants to do everything I can for the ungainly ships and the men who sailed them into combat. 
   ``I want to do something for all the vets of America,'' he said. ``And I want to give recognition to a glamorous ship. Too often, historians don't mention the LSTs. So we've got to toot our own horn to get recognition.''

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I appreciate the words of my colleagues from Texas and Florida. And I should remind my colleague from Florida when you are in the majority, you get to close debates. And he should have known that since he was in the majority for 12 years. 
   And I think for anybody to talk about abuse of power, it takes a lot of chutzpah. I would suggest to the gentleman from Texas to look at what happened over the last 12 years in this Congress. 
   Madam Speaker, this is the final title of the rules package. It consists of basic technical changes to the House rules. 
   First, this title gives the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform authority to adopt a rule, allowing committee members and staff to conduct depositions in the course of committee investigations.     
   Second, it shields the Rules Committee reports from a point of order if they are filed without a complete list of record votes taken during the consideration of a special rule. This provision allows the Rules Committee to publish recorded votes taken during committee hearings and committee reports and/or through other means, such as the Internet. 
   Third, it allows for the consideration of several pieces of legislation that are part of the first 100 hours agenda, if special rules for those provisions are not separately reported. 
   Fourth, this title continues the budget deeming resolution for the second session of the 109th Congress until such time as a conference report establishing a budget for the fiscal year 2008 is adopted. 
   Fifth and finally, this title renews the standing order approved during the 109th Congress that prohibits registered lobbyists from using Members' exercise facilities, which is something I know is very important to the Members on the other side of the aisle. 
   Now, my friends on the other side of the aisle have focused a lot of attention incorrectly on the second provision regarding the publishing of votes taken in the Rules Committee. 
   Let me explain in detail what this provision actually accomplishes and why we have included it in this package. Section 503 is a straightforward clerical change to clause 3(b), rule XIII, that will make it a little easier for the Rules Committee to transmit its work product to the House in a timely manner. 
   Despite what you may hear from the other side of the aisle, this section will not reduce the amount of information available to the public about what we do in the Rules Committee, and it will not stop us from taking public votes in the committee. 
   Let me make something else clear. The House rules already require committees to keep a record of all recorded votes and to make those votes available publicly. 
   That requirement has been in the permanent rules since 1953. The Rules Committee has always and will always comply with that rule. In fact, it is our goal to make Rules Committee votes available to the public more quickly  than they do under the current practices. Our committee often meets on short notice and under severe time restrictions. 
   Unlike other committees, which usually have several days to put together reports, our committee is often required to assemble large, complex reports in a matter of hours. The proper reporting and filing of these reports in the House is essential to the efficient operation of the House.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. No, I will not. We sometimes report and file a special rule late one night, and the next morning the rule and the bill are on the House floor. There is just not much room for even minor clerical errors when you are under such tight deadlines. This rules change does not mean that the public will have any less access to what happens in the Rules Committee, Madam Speaker. 
   We plan to include record votes in the Rules Committee reports and, even better, we intend to post committee votes on the Rules Committee Web site as soon as they have them, so that the American people will know what is going on. 
   Even better than that, we plan to have more meetings during the daylight hours so that the public and the press know what we are doing in the Rules Committee. 
   Well, let me say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, if you feel that the votes taken in the Rules Committee are not being made public fast enough, or are clear enough, you have my word that we will work to fix it, and we will work with you. You have my word on that. 
   More importantly, Madam Speaker, after our business here in the House concludes today, we will have made historic progress. We will have ended the culture of corruption that has plagued this House for the past dozen years. We will have paved the way to accomplishing what the American people voted for, to give minimum wage workers a raise. 
   Right now the average CEO of a Fortune 500 Company earns $10,712 in 1 hour 16 minutes. It takes an average minimum wage worker 52, 40-hour weeks, an entire year, to earn the same $10,712. It is wrong, and we are going to fix it. 
   We will have paved a way to make college tuition and prescription drugs more affordable, to make our homeland safer, by implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations, and to invest in lifesaving stem cell research. All of these measures, Madam Speaker, have been the subject of hearings. Many of them have been voted on. But the majority on the other side has stalled and undermined these measure at every step. No more. 
   Finally, Madam Speaker, let me assure my friends, including the distinguished gentleman from Florida, that we will conduct the business of this House in a much more fair, civil and open way than has been the norm of the last 12 years. Your views will be heard more than ours were. Your ideas will be given more consideration than ours were. Your voices will be more respected than ours were, because that is the right way to run the people's House.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2764, THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS, AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings), for yielding me the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this open rule and the underlying bill, H.R. 2764, the State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2008. There is so much to praise in this bill: its emphasis on funding our core bilateral development programs; its emphasis on funding basic education, child survival and global health initiatives. And most importantly, its emphasis on providing for our national security and our global economic interests. 
   I would like to praise Subcommittee Chairwoman Lowey and Ranking Member Wolf and the Foreign Operations Subcommittee in particular for the work they have done on aid to Colombia. This bill makes some badly needed and long overdue changes to our aid program for Colombia. The results of the past several years, particularly where illegal drugs are concerned, made clear that it is time to try a different and more comprehensive approach. 
   The 2008 bill rebalances our priorities in Colombia. It recognizes that the response to violence, narcotrafficking and instability in our South American neighbor must be multifaceted, helping to guarantee lasting security through good governance. 
   Colombia is an important friend of the United States and it is the largest recipient of U.S. assistance outside the troubled Middle East region. Colombia deserves our support; and even though I have been a critic of many of our past policies, I have never and I will never advocate walking away from Colombia or its people. 
   The new approach in this bill will make our counternarcotics policy more effective by helping small farmers transition permanently away from illegal drug production, increasing funds to investigate and prosecute major drug traffickers, and continuing drug interdiction programs. Aerial fumigation and sporadic military offenses are no substitute for helping Colombia to govern its own territory. The results make that clear: 7 years and $5.4 billion later, the old policy has resulted in more coca growing in Colombia, and the price of cocaine on the streets of America is actually lower than before we started. 
   It is time for a change, for a new more balanced direction, and this bill provides more funding for judges and prosecutors, roads, clean water, jobs and aid for vulnerable people. It looks to fund the need of today's Colombia, not yesterday's. Many Colombians are working today to clean house in Colombia, going after politically powerful criminals who send drugs to our shores and wreak violence and mayhem in Colombia. The aid in this bill will help them. Success hinges on Colombia's judicial system which faces serious challenges. This bill provides them with new resources to meet those challenges. 
   Mr. Speaker, unless Colombia deals with the overriding issue of impunity, many of us are going to continue to fight for even more changes in our policy, restricting security assistance to the Colombian military which is responsible for a lot of the human rights  violations, and we are going to continue to insist that no free trade agreement move forward until the human rights situation improves in Colombia. 
   If the United States of America stands for anything, it should stand out loud and foursquare for human rights. And for too many years, we have turned our backs on the harsh reality in Colombia where thousands of trade unionists have disappeared or been murdered, thousands of people have been victimized by security forces and their allies in the paramilitary forces. 
   We should not be sending money in a way that does not acknowledge that those security forces need to do better. Mr. Speaker, success also depends on Colombia's ability to govern and create employment, especially in the lawless zones where drug traffickers and paramilitary groups still operate. This bill allows USAID to expand badly needed efforts to those communities in coca-growing areas that up until now have been beyond our reach due to lack of funds. 
   Finally, success depends on Colombia's ability to care for and reintegrate victims of violence. This includes helping Colombia's internally displaced population which is second in the world only to Sudan. That is not a list you want to be on, Mr. Speaker. It means protecting people coming forward to testify who are seeking redress. It also means helping people recover stolen land through violence and helping Afro-Colombian and indigenous people who have been disproportionately hit by violence. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill does a good job of achieving balance between economic development and security aid for Colombia. It demonstrates a level of support for Colombia's democratic future that we have not been able to articulate before now. I support this new balanced direction for Colombia, and I applaud the work of the Appropriations Committee for not only these provisions but for its judicious approach of supporting what works best in our global development programs.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENTS TO H.R. 976, CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 6 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 675 provides a rule for consideration of the Senate amendments to H.R. 976, the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act. 
   The rule permits the chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce to move that the House concur in the Senate amendments with the amendments printed in the Rules Committee report. 
   The rule waives all points of order against the motion except those arising under clause 10 of rule XXI. 
   Finally, the rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided among and controlled by the chairmen and ranking minority members of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on Ways and Means. 
   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today represents a defining historic moment for this House. Members of this body will be faced with the simple choice: Will you vote to provide health insurance to millions of children, or will you vote to take health insurance away from the children who currently have it? 
   Today, over 45 million people living in this country woke up without health care. Millions of them are children whose families make too much to be eligible for Medicaid but not enough to purchase their own insurance. 
   Studies have shown that the number of uninsured children jumped by 710,000  last year. That is unconscionable; and under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi and the new Democratic Congress, we have begun to change it. 
   The State Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP, currently provides health care to over 6 million children; but the program will expire in just 6 days unless we act to reauthorize it. 
   Historically, the SCHIP program has enjoyed bipartisan support. The bill before us today represents a careful, bipartisan compromise that enjoys the support of people like Senator Chuck Grassley, Senator Orrin Hatch, Congressman Ray LaHood, and Congresswoman Heather Wilson.  
   Frankly, Mr. Speaker, the bill before us does not go as far as I would like. I prefer the bill this House passed a few weeks ago. The House-passed bill not only expanded the SCHIP program to 1 million more children than the bill we'll be voting on today; it also leveled the playing field by adjusting the reimbursements for the Medicare Advantage Program, a program that is in dire need of reform. But I will not and I cannot allow the perfect to be the enemy of the very good, and this is a very good bill. 
   Under this agreement, health insurance coverage will be provided to millions of children who do not have it today. Quality dental coverage will be provided to all enrolled children. The agreement ensures that States will offer mental health services on par with medical and surgical benefits covered under SCHIP, and the bill also provides States the option to cover prenatal care, ensuring healthy babies and healthy moms. 
   Now, contrary to the White House rhetoric, the bulk of the children who would gain coverage are poor and near-poor children who are uninsured, not middle-income children with private coverage.     
   The President would like to suggest that SCHIP is Congress's way of socializing medicine and undermining private health insurance plans, which is interesting, considering that just yesterday this bill was endorsed by America's Health Insurance Plans, the Nation's largest insurance lobbying group. It is also important to note, Mr. Speaker, that this bill is fully paid for. This represents a sharp change from earlier bills that the President enthusiastically supported from the 2003 Medicare prescription drug bill to the Republican energy plans to his tax cuts for the rich, which were all financed by massive amounts of deficit spending. 
   The President has threatened to veto this bill, Mr. Speaker. That takes my breath away. He didn't veto billions of dollars in tax breaks to oil companies that were gouging people at the pump. He didn't veto billions of dollars in no-bid defense contracts. But he will veto a modest bipartisan bill to provide health care coverage for millions of low- and moderate-income American children? 
   Now, some of my friends on the other side of the aisle would say that we should simply extend the current SCHIP program, but what they won't tell you is that the spending level supported by the President is not enough even to provide continued coverage for all the children who are currently enrolled. In other words, Mr. Speaker, those who support the President would take health care away from over 800,000 kids who have it today. That is not acceptable. That is cruel. 
   As the Catholic Health Association has said, ``Temporary extensions and/or inadequate funding levels will lead to children losing coverage. That would be an enormous step back for our Nation and a retreat from our collective commitment to cover uninsured children.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a defining moment for this Congress. With a ``yes'' vote on this bill, we can improve the lives of millions of children and their families. A ``no'' vote is a vote to take health care away from some of the most vulnerable members of the American family. 
   The choice is clear. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the underlying bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, before I yield to our next speaker, I just respond to the gentleman from Texas by saying, he talks about this Republican vision for health care; but if my memory is serving me correctly, the Republicans were in charge of the Congress for many years, too many years, if you ask me, and they had the President of the United States of the same party while they were in control of both Congresses. 
   What they presided over with all their control, this Republican vision that the gentleman from Texas talks about, resulted in more and more and more, millions and millions more Americans falling into the ranks of the uninsured. And many of them are children. Too many are children. We are trying to fix that here. We think it is unconscionable in the richest country on the face of this Earth that millions of children go without health insurance. 
   Let me just say one other thing. The gentleman made an allusion, too, that this bill would make it easier to enroll illegal immigrants. I want to ask my friend from Texas to read the bill. Section 605, no Federal funds for illegal immigrants. Nothing in this Act allows Federal payment for residents who are not legal residents. 
   Now, I know that immigrant bashing is the last bastion of the politically desperate, but the fact of the matter is facts are facts. And on documentation, only my Republican friends would argue that poor children should have passports as though they are jetting off to Paris for the spring fashion shows. 
   The bottom line is, what the gentleman is raising on that level is totally unwarranted. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Loebsack).

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I'm sorry that the gentleman from California wasn't impressed with the names of the Republican legislators that I met who, I think, have impeccable conservative credentials. But this is a bipartisan effort. In fact, unlike when he was the chairman of the Rules Committee and his party was in control of Congress, bipartisanship now means more than just one Member of the opposing party. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to insert in the Record a letter that's in enthusiastic support of this bill sent to Speaker Pelosi signed by 16 other Republicans, and there are many, many more who I hope will support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me just say a couple of things with regard to process. The gentleman knows, everybody else knows, the gentleman should know that his Republican colleagues in the Senate blocked a motion to go to conference. 
   The SCHIP program expires in 6 days, and we don't have time for a House version of a filibuster. A dozen States will run out of SCHIP funding if we do not act. Now is the time to act. So if you want to make sure that those currently enrolled continue to get the health care coverage, then you've got to vote for this. And if you want more children to be enrolled, then you have to vote for this. 
   On the issue of legal immigrants, I agree. I think all of us here agree that the legal immigrants should be included. The reality is there were not enough Republicans who agree. The Republican leadership has been awful on this issue. And the Republicans in the Senate have said that adding a legal immigrant provision would have killed the bill in the Senate. That is the gentleman's party. 
   Let me also remind Members of this House that you had an opportunity to vote for an SCHIP that covered legal immigrants. That is what we voted on here in the House, and you all voted ``no.'' You voted ``no'' on that. You voted not to extend coverage for those legal immigrants in this country, those children of legal immigrants. So I'm not quite sure what you're trying to do here, other than trying to delay this process so we don't get this bill passed. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'd like to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me remind my colleagues that this program expires in 6 days and that the Republicans in the Senate blocked a motion to go to conference. That's why we are here.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by saying that this is a proud day for the House of Representatives. If we can pass the bill and send it to the President, that will guarantee 10 million children who don't have health insurance currently that they will get health insurance. That is something we can be proud of. That is an accomplishment. That is results. 
   We have heard a lot of excuses from the other side. A lot of my friends say, ``I love SCHIP, but I just don't want to vote for it. I love all of our children in this country. I believe everybody should have insurance, but I am not willing to vote to make sure that they have insurance.'' 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, that doesn't cut it. The American people are sick of the stalling tactics. They are sick of the excuses. They are sick of the lack of results that they have seen in the area of making sure that everybody in this country gets health insurance. And that is one of the reasons why, I should tell the gentleman from Texas, why his party lost in the last election, because it was perceived by the American people that his party wasn't responding to the real challenges and the real needs of the American people, that they were indifferent to the plight of uninsured children across this country.  
   It is time to do the right thing, Mr. Speaker. As I said in the very beginning of this debate, the choice really is very simple, will you vote to provide health insurance to millions of children, or will you vote to take health insurance away from children who currently have it? This is the choice. Voting ``no'' or voting for all the procedural motions that the gentleman from Texas has put forward will basically result in children currently who have insurance losing that insurance, because the President's plan doesn't provide nearly enough money to cover those who are already enrolled in the program. But we need to do better. 
   The bottom line is that we are the richest country on the face of the Earth. It is unconscionable that every person in this country does not have health care. It is even more outrageous that our children don't have health insurance. It is, quite frankly, outrageous that the President of the United States is holding a veto threat over this bill, a bill to guarantee that more of our children have health insurance. Of all the things he could possibly veto, this is where he draws the line in the sand when it comes to making sure that our kids get the health care they deserve? It takes my breath away when I think that this is the issue that he chooses to have a fight over, health insurance for our children. I am grateful that there are Republicans who are going to join with us on this vote. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I visited DC Central Kitchen, where I learned about an innovative program, the Campus Kitchens Project. This is a program that uses high school and college dining facilities when the kitchen is normally closed to prepare meals for area soup kitchens and shelters. 
   College and high school students involved in this program take a large leadership role in starting and maintaining the kitchens. Campus Kitchens helps feed hungry people in our communities today, while building tomorrow's leaders committed to ending hunger. 
   Hunger is a political condition, and we need government action to end it, but we also need people from all sectors dedicated to doing more to end hunger. There are over 400 high schools and 100 colleges in Massachusetts alone. If each school organized a group to fight hunger in their community, just think of what could be done. 
   I congratulate DC Central Kitchen and the Campus Kitchens project for their work, and I thank the staff and students for their commitment to ending hunger.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 5 years ago in a well-orchestrated public relations stunt that featured landing on an aircraft carrier, President Bush proclaimed, ``In the battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed.'' 
   Just 2 weeks ago, on the fifth anniversary of ``Mission Accomplished,'' the White House could only express exasperation that anyone would even make a fuss that 5 years have gone by and we're still in Iraq, deeper than ever. 
   Well, here's why people are making such a fuss, Madam Speaker: Over 4,000 American service men and women killed in Iraq; over 30,000 of our troops wounded or maimed; a continuing U.S. occupation of Iraq; and a mission that is never ending, never defined, and completely open-ended. 
   Ironically, the USS Abraham Lincoln, the aircraft carrier where President Bush declared victory in Iraq, was just deployed last week for another tour of duty in the Persian Gulf. 
   Today this House will have a choice to make, whether to continue this war well into next year. Today we will choose whether to support the George Bush strategy of keeping the war going until he can safely get out of town.     
   Once again, U.S. forces are engaged in some of the most intense combat since the height of the insurgency. Once again, they are battling Iraqi militias, not al Qaeda, in the markets, homes and alleyways of Baghdad. April 2008 was the deadliest month for Iraqi civilians since last August.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from California (Ms. Matsui) for yielding me the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this ground-breaking legislation, S. 5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007, and I want to commend the bipartisan leadership of Senator Reid and Senator Harkin and Senator Orrin Hatch for their hard work in crafting and passing this legislation. And I also want to thank the bipartisan leadership of Congresswoman Diana DeGette and Congressman Mike Castle for their tireless work on stem cell research funding. 
   Mr. Speaker, Democrats have fought long and hard in the name of science  and innovation. Here in the House of Representatives on January 11 of this year, as part of the 100 hours legislation led by Speaker Pelosi, we saw the unlocked potential held in stem cell research. We saw the potential to cure the diseases that affect 100 million Americans, debilitating diseases such as Parkinson's, diabetes, Alzheimer's, Lou Gehrig's, multiple sclerosis and cancer, and I could go and on and on and on. 
   In my district of Massachusetts, my constituents see the value of progress and want to invest in the life sciences. As part of the life science initiative by the State, a stem cell bank will be created at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester. It will be part of the largest repository of stem cell lines in the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, embryonic stem cell research has the support of over 500 organizations, including the American Medical Association, AARP, the Association of American Medical Colleges, American Diabetes Association and Paralyzed Veterans of America, and I could go on. I believe we owe the American people the promise of science and medicine. 
   The legislation before us reflects the best science in the world. The legislation before us holds out the hope for a better life for millions of people all throughout the world. 
   It is time that President Bush stop being an obstructionist on this issue. It is time that he gets out of the way and listens to the will of the American people. 
   The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions), my colleague, says that this is about politics. It is not about politics. This has nothing to do with politics, and it is sad that so many people who oppose this want to politicize this issue. It isn't about politics. 
   It is about life and death. It is about improving the quality of life through the best science that is available to us. 
   So it is time for this Congress to at long last do the right thing. We have debated this issue over and over and over and over and over. It is time for this Congress to do the right thing, to listen to the will of the American people, to listen to the best science and finally pass this bill. 
   Governor Patrick Announces Massachusetts's New Life Science Initiative 
   BOSTON.--Tuesday, May 8--Governor Deval Patrick today announced his plan to make Massachusetts the global leader in life sciences, unveiling for the first time ever a comprehensive, collaborative Massachusetts Life Science Strategy. 
   The plan, outlined during a speech at the BIO 2007 convention, includes a 10 year, $1 billion investment package that will both enhance the state's already nationally recognized assets in the fields of medicine and science and fill gaps in federal funding to ensure the state's ability to support life science progress from the idea stage through the production stage. The Patrick Administration's strategy brings together industry, academic research hospitals, and public and private colleges and universities to coordinate these efforts, spur new research, strengthen investments, create new jobs and produce new therapies for a better quality of life. 
   ``There is no place in the world with as much talent in life sciences and biotech as here in Massachusetts,'' said Governor Patrick. ``Now is the time for us to invest in that talent and bring together the resources of our unparalleled research universities, teaching hospitals, and industry to work towards a common goal--to grow ideas into products to create cures and jobs.'' 
   Key to the Governor's Life Science Initiative is new legislation that will strengthen the Massachusetts Life Science Center and charge it with the execution of a life science mission focused on science and economic development, strategic investments at critical stages of the development cycle, and collaboration with the private sector to create innovation infrastructure critical to both researchers and companies. The Governor also announced his commitment to making targeted investments in companies that encourage life science economic development in the Commonwealth. 
   ``I commend the Governor for reaching out to all sectors of our life science cluster in order to craft a stem cell/life science package that recognizes the unique institutional assets and intellectual firepower in our region,'' said Steven Hyman, Professor of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School and Chairman of the Massachusetts. ``The Governor allocates state resources in effective ways to enhance our traditional strengths, buttress areas that need attention, and encourage powerful collaborations between our leading edge institutions.'' 
   Today's announcement at the BIO 2007 Convention highlighted the following: 
   A $1 billion investment package that includes funds to: 
   Bridge the NIH funding gap--A competitive grant program during the current downturn in federal support to sustain key programs in the state. Our collective success during the 1998-2003 period when the NIH budget doubled from $14 billion to $28 billion only solidified Massachusetts' dominance in the area of biomedical research. However, the subsequent four years of flat funding since 2003 has caused a 13 percent loss of funding power by NIH and a 35 percent reduction in support for clinical trials. The Patrick administration will make surgical investments during the downturn to sustain key programs here in Massachusetts in order that our position is sustained to once again capture large percentages of new funding when it materializes. 
   Create the Massachusetts Stem Cell Bank--A first in the nation centralized repository of new stem cell lines available to all sectors, public and private, of research enterprise. Boston University, Brigham & Women's, Children's Hospital, Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Partners HealthCare and the University of Massachusetts have already agreed to participate in the Bank when it is completed. 
   Establish Massachusetts Life Science Fellowship Grants--Grant packages for research institutions in Massachusetts to attract and retain the rising stars of life sciences research in the Commonwealth, and ensure Massachusetts is competitive with other states and nations. 
   Establish Massachusetts Life Science Innovation Centers--Centerbased research facilities that streamline technology transfer, development time and funding opportunity. 
   ``As the president of the University of Massachusetts, the leading public academic research institution in the Commonwealth, I applaud Governor Patrick for making such a strong commitment to the life sciences, particularly stem cell research and RNAi-related research and development,'' said University of Massachusetts President Jack M. Wilson. ``The announcement today is an important step in developing a world-class life sciences strategy for the Commonwealth that will foster scientific innovation, including unlocking the mysteries of debilitating diseases, and spur economic growth. The University of Massachusetts is proud to be able to play an important role in this strategy and I truly believe this proposal is far-reaching, comprehensive and of sufficient scope and scale to enable Massachusetts to continue and expand its national and global leadership in biotechnology and the life sciences.'' 
   ``It is clear to me that scientific innovation and cutting-edge research help set Massachusetts apart in the eyes of the life sciences and greater scientific community. Today's announcement of this significant, new state funding is an important signal that the opportunities to do cutting-edge research in this state are expanding. I am proud that RNAi is already changing the scientific landscape, offering new tools in the effort to better human health; my colleagues at the UMass Medical School and I see great promise in our continued work with RNAi and RNAi Therapeutics. Support of this type from the government, academic institutions and society allows us to further advance science and to conduct important basic, clinical and translational research,'' Nobel Laureate Craig Mello, Ph.D. of the University of Massachusetts Medical School said. 
   ``The future of life sciences is here in Massachusetts.'' Governor Patrick said. ``We have the talent. We have the entrepreneurial spirit. Now let's seize the future.''

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2446, AFGHANISTAN FREEDOM AND SECURITY SUPPORT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 453 provides for consideration of H.R. 2446, the Afghanistan Freedom and Security Support Act of 2007 under a structured rule that makes in order all of the amendments that were submitted to the Rules Committee, except for those withdrawn by their sponsors. 
   I want to acknowledge and express my respect for the work of Chairman Lantos and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen for bringing such a fine example of bipartisan cooperation and collaboration before the House for consideration. 
   Following the ouster of the Taliban regime in late 2001, the United States, the United Nations and the international community embarked on what they hoped would be a comprehensive assistance program to help the new Afghan president, of President Hamid Karzai, establish a new democracy, rebuild the Afghan economy and provide for the general well-being of the Afghan people. 
   Regrettably, after a most promising start, progress has slowed in most parts of the country. Remnants of the Taliban continue to resist the new government and are reorganizing and strengthening their networks from neighboring countries. Instability has increased, including the introduction of suicide bombings against U.S. soldiers, NATO troops, Afghan officials, and civilians and international and Afghan humanitarian aid workers. 
   Narcotics production threatens to overwhelm the country. According to UN studies, a large percentage of Afghans, including farmers, laborers, traffickers, war lords, insurgents, and officials participate in and benefit from illegal poppy trade. 
   Congress first addressed the issue aiding Afghanistan by passing the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002, which established a reconstruction program, mandated a relief coordinator, provided support to the NATO-led international security forces, and gave new security assistance authority to our President. 
   In addition to food aid, refugee relief and other forms of emergency disaster assistance, the United States implemented a wide-ranging assistance program for Afghanistan, including aid for schools, hospitals and farms, and support to reestablish the participation of women and girls in society, education and the workplace. 
   The legislation the House will take up today, H.R. 2446, reauthorizes programs created by the original Afghanistan Freedom Support Act, creates a new focus on counternarcotics efforts, and provides for stronger and more enhanced oversight of U.S. strategic goals and performance in Afghanistan. 
   Overall, H.R. 2446 provides modest increases in authorized levels for humanitarian, development, democracy building and security assistance. I cannot stress enough how important it is that Afghanistan succeed in establishing and consolidating a representative government and rebuilding the country's economy and civil society. 
   When we overthrew the Taliban regime, we made promises to the Afghan people with the full backing of the international community. We cannot renege on those promises. We cannot fail the people of Afghanistan who came together in support of a common vision for the future. 
   I am very, very concerned that many of the difficulties confronting Afghanistan today, especially in the areas of security, are due in large part to taking our eye off the ball in Afghanistan and exhausting our economic and military resources in Iraq. We had the chance to make Afghanistan secure. We failed to do so because we chose not to invest the necessary resources in Afghanistan, but, rather, to transfer our attention and our resources to Iraq. We are now playing catch up in Afghanistan as the situation there is deteriorating. 
   I applaud the chairman and members of the Foreign Affairs Committee for this timely reauthorization. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Let me just say that, again, the underlying legislation is incredibly important. We do have an obligation, a moral obligation, to the people of Afghanistan. And, quite frankly, from a national security perspective, that is where our attention should be and where our attention should have been. It is regrettable, it is regrettable that the President of the United States and his administration and many in this Chamber have chosen to take their eye off what our responsibility is in Afghanistan over these last several years, and instead, we find ourselves bogged down in a quagmire in Iraq. 
   Those who are responsible for September 11, those who are responsible for the murder of so many of our citizens, they were in Afghanistan. That is where al Qaeda was. And instead of holding al Qaeda accountable in Afghanistan, instead of making sure that our resources go to promoting democracy and stability in Afghanistan, instead of focusing on this ever-growing drug problem in Afghanistan, we have spent over half a trillion dollars in Iraq. And that is regrettable. And, quite frankly, when history looks back on how these last few years were conducted, they are going to take note of the fact that we missed important opportunities to better protect our country by taking our eye off of what our responsibility was in Afghanistan. 
   And let me just say about the rule, I will apologize to my colleague from Florida for a rule that we bring to the floor today that makes every single amendment that was offered in the Rules Committee and not withdrawn by its author in order. Every Republican amendment, every Democratic amendment. And I know that that is different from the way things used to be when the Republicans were in charge of the Rules Committee. They had a tendency to just shut us all out routinely. But things are different now, and under the Democratic administration here in the Congress, we are trying to make sure that all points of view have an opportunity to be heard on the floor. 
   So I am happy that we have this rule, and, again, I apologize to the gentleman that it is not like what they used to do. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Vermont, a member of the Rules Committee (Mr. Welch).

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, again, I regret that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are not pleased with the rule that makes all of the amendments that were offered in order, but I think that that is the way we should do business around here. It is in sharp contrast to the way they used to do business when the Republicans were in the majority, where there was a tendency to shut everything down, to close everything up, to not allow Members of the minority to be able to have amendments. But we're different, and I'm glad we are different. 
   On the underlying legislation, there should be unanimity in this House about the importance of passing this legislation. It is important that we keep our commitment to the people of Afghanistan. It is important that we keep our commitment to the people of the United States, who after September 11 we said, in the Congress and in the White House, that we are going to do everything we can do bring to justice, to hold to account those who are responsible for September 11. 
   Unfortunately, today, we are not anywhere near where we should be in Afghanistan; and the reason for that is because we have diverted our resources, we have diverted our soldiers and our political capital to a never-ending war in Iraq. We have put our soldiers in the middle of a civil war in Iraq. We have spent over half a trillion dollars in Iraq; and, as a result, those resources have not been sent to Afghanistan; and I think that is regrettable. 
   But we need to pass this bill today. I hope it passes with a unanimous vote. I urge my colleagues to support the rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. 
   The previous question was ordered.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 720, WATER QUALITY FINANCING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me first thank my colleague from Texas (Mr. Sessions) for his courtesy and also thank the gentlewoman from Florida for her leadership on the Rules Committee and for her spectacular handling of this rule today before us. I appreciate all of her insights and advocacy on behalf of clean water and environmental issues. I want to make clear for the record that this entire House should be grateful for her leadership. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule. It is a fair rule. There are three Democratic amendments and three Republican amendments. They cover the many issues brought before the Rules Committee last night. 
   I want to take a moment to address one issue, and that is the issue of Davis-Bacon. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions) said that the Democrats are going to win and the Republicans are going to lose on this vote. Well, let me say I would recharacterize it. I think the American people and the American workers are going to win if we keep the Davis-Bacon provisions. 
   I know many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't like Davis-Bacon and who don't believe that people should be paid the prevailing wage, who don't believe that the workers of this country should be paid a livable wage. 
   Well, the majority in this Congress today believes the opposite. I bet many people on the gentleman's side of the aisle believe as well. Workers in this country are working longer hours and harder than ever before, and they can't make ends meet. We shouldn't have a rush to the bottom when it comes to the wages of the workers in this country. We need to stand firm and stand tall for the workers of this country to ensure that they get paid a livable wage so they can support their families, so they have health care and pension benefits. That is what this debate is about. 
   So, today, my colleagues who don't like Davis-Bacon will have a choice.  They have an amendment in order that can rip Davis-Bacon out of this bill. They can eliminate Davis-Bacon. They can eliminate the prevailing wage. They can eliminate a livable wage for workers. Or you can stand with the majority in this Congress for workers, for the prevailing wage, for Davis-Bacon, for a livable wage; and that is the right thing to do.

   Mr. McGOVERN. I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. 
   It is this gentleman's opinion that what the gentleman is trying to do is to chip away at Davis-Bacon, chip away at workers' rights and chip away at the prevailing wage and chip away at making sure that workers get a livable wage, and this gentleman is very much opposed to that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, for the purposes of debate only, I yield my friend from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart) 30 minutes, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 66 is a closed rule that allows the House to consider the final piece of the first-100-hours agenda. This rule, as has been mentioned, provides 3 hours of debate in the House, with 60 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means, 60 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Natural Resources, 30 minutes equally divided and controlled by the Committee on Agriculture, and 30 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member on the Committee on Science and Technology. 
   Mr. Speaker, I expect that we will hear a great deal from my friends on the other side of the aisle about process, and they will be upset that this is a closed rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, Democrats campaigned on changing the culture in Washington. We campaigned on ending the culture of corruption and on draining the swamp, and we have done that. We campaigned most importantly, Mr. Speaker, on doing what is right for hardworking American families whose priorities and whose concerns have been ignored for the last 12 years. 
   Over the last 100 hours, Mr. Speaker, the House has voted to clean up the ethical mess in Congress, to strengthen homeland security, to combat the Federal deficit by instituting pay-as-you-go rules, to invest in lifesaving stem cell research, to make college more affordable by lowering the interest rates on student loans, to reduce prescription drug prices for seniors by allowing the government to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, and to increase the minimum wage for millions of hardworking and underpaid workers in America. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to note that each of these initiatives not only has passed the House of Representatives, but has enjoyed strong bipartisan support. 
   And in a difference in approach to legislation compared to the Republican majority in the past, who used to subscribe to the rule that they would only bring measures to the floor if a majority of the majority on their side supported it, I am happy to report that yesterday's vote on making college tuition more affordable for our young people not only enjoyed a majority of the majority in terms of support, but a majority of the minority actually voted in support, and that is refreshing. 
   Mr. Speaker, we made a promise to the American people that we would achieve these goals quickly, and that is what we have done. And in order to keep that promise to the voters, we have utilized an expedited process. 
   With the passage of this rule, the House will consider H.R. 6, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007. As an original cosponsor of this legislation, I am proud to stand here in support of this initiative. 
   The voters sent us a message in November. They called us to account for bill after bill of kickbacks to special interests like Big Oil. We were not sent here to allow huge corporations to continue to reap the benefits of tax breaks while gouging their customers at the gas pump. I commend Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer for holding true to their commitments and listening to the American people by bringing this legislation to the floor for a vote. 
   The distinguished chairmen of the Committees on Ways and Means, Mr. Rangel, and Natural Resources, Mr. Rahall, crafted this legislation to balance fiscal responsibility with our Nation's growing energy needs. 
   At long last, Mr. Speaker, Congress is putting its money where its mouth is and increasing our investment in renewable energy. We are not just talking the talk; we are walking the walk. We promised no quick fixes. It took years of failed legislative policy to dig us into this hole. But the bill before us today will set us on the path toward energy independence. 
   For years, experts have warned of an impending energy crisis. They pointed to the Nation's increasing oil and gas consumption and called attention to our limited supply of these natural resources. Unfortunately, Congress and the Bush administration failed to heed these warnings. In fact, under the Republican-controlled Congress, Federal investment in alternative energy sources actually decreased over the past decade. And at the same time, the administration prescribed more of the same, giveaways to the oil and gas industries. 
   During the 109th Congress, President Bush heralded the Republican Energy Policy Act of 2005 as a necessary approach to the Nation's energy crisis. In all, it provided $8.1 billion, let me repeat that, $8.1 billion in tax incentives for the entire energy industry. And despite their record profits, oil and gas companies took 93 percent of these tax breaks, $7.5 billion. 
   Now, I suppose that that shouldn't be a surprise to many people here, given the fact that in the 2006 elections the oil companies gave $17.5 million to candidates running for Congress. $14.5 million of that money went to Republicans. 
   Mr. Speaker, all that money going to the oil industry did not leave very much money for alternative and renewable energy supplies. So, Mr. Speaker, when that energy bill was debated, many of us on this side of the aisle voiced concerns that the bill would do nothing to ease the price of gas at the pump or decrease our dependence on foreign oil or provide significant investment in renewable sources of energy. 
   I should say, Mr. Speaker, there is study after study after study, news article after news article after news article which support our concerns, unfortunately. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6 is a critical step in the right direction. It closes the tax loophole for oil companies which provided Conoco Phillips $106 million in 2005, even as that company enjoyed profits totaling $13.5 billion. It rolls back tax breaks for geological studies for oil exploration and repeals five royalty relief provisions from the 2005 energy bill.     
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, and I think most importantly, for a lot of us who believe that we need to do more to achieve energy independence, it reinvests those funds into clean, renewable energy and energy efficiency. Certainly, there are no easy solutions to remedy our energy crisis. 
   But we know one thing for certain, if we fail to pass this bill and make the necessary changes and investments now, our dependency on foreign oil will continue to worsen. The time to is now. For those who want the same old, same old, who are married to the status quo, vote the rule down. But for those who are tired of being dictated to by big oil companies, for those who believe that we should reinvest in renewable energy, for those who believe that citizens matter more than campaign contributions, vote ``yes'' on this rule. 
   Chairman Rahall said in his testimony before the Rules Committee 2 days ago that what we are considering today is just the first step. We have much more that we need to do. I look forward to working with him and other Members of this Congress and moving this country forward. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend the leadership, Mr. Rangel and Mr. Rahall, for their work. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the rule and supporting the supporting bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

What we are doing today really is responding to the outcry of the American people who are outraged by the fact that in the midst of being gouged by Big Oil, the previous Congress decided to pass a bill to provide billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks to those very companies.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me, first, begin by reiterating something that has been said many times here. 
   One of the great features of H.R. 6 is that it would create a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve. It could be used to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Everybody talks about wanting to become energy independent, but they don't want to do anything about it; and this would actually create a reserve to do that, to accelerate the use of clean domestic renewable energy resources and alternative fuels, to promote the utilization of energy-efficient products and practices and conservation, and to increase research development and deployment of clean renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies. 
   Again, this is the beginning of our dealing with this issue. There is a lot more to do. And I look forward to more debates and hearings and more ideas from Members from both sides of the aisle to figure out how we can achieve our goal of energy independence. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for participating in the debate today. Over the past 100 hours, this House has made tremendous progress in addressing the needs of the American people. We have strengthened the ethical rules of this House. We have made the homeland safer by adopting the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. We have given low-wage workers a much needed raise. We have embraced the promise of stem cell research. We have made student loans and prescription drugs more affordable. 
   And with the passage of this rule and the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007, we will take our energy policy in a new direction, toward cleaner, renewable energy and away from tax giveaways to huge oil and gas companies. 
   If you want the same old same old, vote against this rule and vote against the underlying bill. If you want a new direction, then support the rule and support the underlying bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me close with a word about process. I understand the concerns expressed by my friends on the other side of the aisle. I served in the minority party during the last Congress, and I suspect my friends are worried that they will be treated as poorly and disrespectfully as we were. 
   I was here when the Republican majority passed exactly one open rule on a non appropriations bill. I was here when votes were held open for 3 hours to change people's votes. I was here when special interests provisions were tucked into conference reports after they were signed. 
   This House is broken, Mr. Speaker, and the Democratic majority was elected to fix it, and that is what we are going to do. 
   All I can tell my friends on the other side of the aisle is what I believe. I believe that every Member of this House deserves to be respected. I believe that one party does not hold a monopoly on good ideas; and I believe that openness should be the rule, and not the exception. And all I can offer my friends is my word that I will work as hard as I possibly can to make sure that this  House runs in a more open, democratic fashion than was the norm over the past 12 years. We will not be perfect, because human endeavors never are. But we will be better.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H. CON. RES. 63, IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by first thanking my colleagues, Tom Lantos, Ike Skelton and Walter Jones for working together in a bipartisan way to create this very simple, straightforward and clear resolution. Their work will allow this House to have a full and fair debate and, at the end of this week, have a clear up-or-down vote on whether or not we support or oppose the President's plan to escalate this war in Iraq. 
   I also want to thank all my colleagues on the Rules Committee for a very thoughtful and productive debate last night. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people are way ahead of the politicians in Washington on this issue. They want this war ended, and they want our troops to come home. Any Member of this House who has been home recently knows that the questions are increasing, the concern is growing, and the patience is running out. 
   The American people are tired of the bickering and partisan posturing. They are also tired of people trying to muddy the waters and confuse the issue. They want their leaders to be less concerned with saving political face and more concerned with saving lives. 
   It is my hope that at the end of this debate, the House will send a strong bipartisan message to the President of the United States that it is time to change course in Iraq. 
   I hope that the President will listen and will take the opportunity to sit down with us, roll up his sleeves and do the hard but necessary work of bringing this tragic war to an end. 
   If he does not, if he continues to ignore the will of the Congress and of the American people, then we will have no choice but to go beyond nonbinding resolutions. 
   Mr. Speaker, Members like me, who believe it is time to exercise the power of the purse, will get that opportunity when we take up the President's supplemental appropriations request and the fiscal year 2008 defense bills. 
   The best way to support our troops is to bring them home safely to their families. The best way to protect them is to begin their immediate, safe and orderly withdrawal from Iraq. 
   But this week we are focused, rightly in my opinion, on the narrow and important question of whether we support the President's desire to escalate the war. 
   The irony is that Members of this House will be given more time to debate this nonbinding resolution than they were given by the previous majority on the question of authorizing the war itself. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is not a meaningless exercise, which is what some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said. For the first time in 4 years, the people's House will be on record opposing the President's policy in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people are watching. They want to know where each Member stands on the issue of escalating the war in Iraq. That is the issue before us today. That is the only issue we shall be debating. It is what the American people want to know, and it is what the President of the United States needs to hear.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (SAVING ENERGY THROUGH PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Madam Chairman, first of all, I would like to thank the gentleman from Minnesota and the gentleman from Florida for their hard work on this important legislation. I am offering an amendment, along with my colleague from Virginia (Mr. Davis). He has been a very important collaborator in this effort. 
   Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Davis-McGovern amendment. Like the underlying legislation, the purpose of this amendment is to reduce energy consumption by promoting public transportation. This amendment seeks to equalize the current transportation fringe benefit offered to Federal employees who commute to work via public transportation  with the current benefit for those who drive to work by themselves. 
   Currently, $220 per month in pretax benefits can be offered to Federal employees who drive to work and pay for parking, while these who opt to take a train, bus, or other form of public transit are only eligible for $115 a month. This disparity has had the reverse effect of what the transportation fringe benefit was geared to do, and that is to take commuters out of their personal automobiles by incentivizing them to use public transportation. 
   Madam Chairman, this bipartisan amendment will do much more than get people to use public transportation. With fewer people driving to work, less gasoline is consumed, less wear and tear is done to our roads and bridges, and less emissions are released into the air. As Congress seeks ways to combat climate change and become energy independent, one of the best ways to make an immediate impact is by offering cleaner, greener commuting options for our workforce. 
   According to the current estimates, Americans save $340 million a year in fuel costs as a result of the transit benefit. Increasing the transit benefit will result in a corresponding increase in that savings. As we look for ways to provide relief from skyrocketing fuel prices, the transit benefit is a proven part of the solution. 
   I ask my colleagues to support the Davis-McGovern amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, this fall, the rising cost of food will be felt by schools from Massachusetts to Hawaii, an impact that will severely strain the budgets of school districts across this great land. 
   Today, Chairman George Miller and the Education and Labor Committee will hold a hearing on the rising cost of food and the impact on the school meal programs. Sadly, healthier food choices may be scrapped for cheaper, less nutritious food. After-school meal programs may be scaled back or eliminated. Our kids will pay the price. 
   There is no easy answer to this problem, but we can all agree that we cannot let this food price crisis result in our school-aged children going without food simply because school districts are struggling with these rising prices. 
   I commend Chairman Miller for holding this hearing, and I look forward to working with him on this important issue.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, yesterday morning a woman in my district shouted at me, ``Tell all those guys on Wall Street to''--how should I put this?--``take a long walk off a short pier.'' 
   I can appreciate how she feels, Madam Speaker. I kind of feel the same way. I would very much like someone to pay a price, or to at least assume some responsibility for this economic mess before we do anything else. But while that might be good therapy, it's not good economic policy. 
   Anger won't keep anybody in their house. Anger won't help anybody get a car loan or a student loan. Anger won't help small businesses get the credit they need to maintain inventory or pay their employees. 
   Madam Speaker, the bill before us is far from perfect. I wanted stronger bankruptcy protection language. I wanted the economic stimulus package included in this bill. I wanted tougher language on banning golden parachutes for CEOs, and I wanted firmer pay-back provisions so taxpayers don't get stuck paying for any of this. 
   And while some of the new tax provisions that the Senate added are good, most are not paid for, which troubles me very much, given the fact that we have the biggest debt in the history of our country. 
   But the way I see it, we don't have much of a choice. The bill will, hopefully, help stabilize our economy. I can't guarantee that it will work, but I do know that killing this package today would be a serious mistake. The credit markets would further tighten, and the people that I represent, even those who want me to vote ``no,'' would be hurt very badly. 
   It's hard to get anything done around here with a divided government. I'm hopeful that next year we can do some of the things that we are failing to do today. We need to enact a stimulus package that will invest in our infrastructure, schools and housing. We need health care for all. We need to revolutionize our energy system. We need to tackle hunger, poverty and homelessness. 
   But I have come to the conclusion that none of that, none of those priorities will be possible if the financial system of this country collapses. So I will vote ``yes,'' and I would urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   Finally, Madam Speaker, I want to pay tribute to my colleague from Massachusetts, Barney Frank, who I think has done an incredible job for championing the causes and the voices of middle class Americans and those who are struggling in poverty. All of us are grateful for his leadership.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (NATIONAL SCHOOL BREAKFAST PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. We all know that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. We also know that it's nearly impossible to learn on an empty stomach. These are two of the most important reasons why the school breakfast program is so important. 
   I'm pleased to be a cosponsor of this important resolution recognizing the importance of school breakfasts. I want to commend the gentlewoman from Wisconsin, Congresswoman Moore, for introducing this important resolution and I want to recognize and honor the members of the School Nutrition Association who are here in Washington, DC, this week for their national conference. 
   The school breakfast program allows qualified students to eat a meal at school for either free or for a reduced price. Together with the school lunch program and after school meal programs, the school breakfast program allows America's school-aged children to receive nutritious meals while at school. 
   Unfortunately, there are shortcomings in the school meal program that need to be addressed in the future. 
   One issue is the underfunding of summer feeding programs. The Federal Government does not fund summer meals at the same level as it funds meals delivered at school. Any child who receives a meal at school shouldn't have to go without a meal during the summer months simply because Congress doesn't properly fund that part of the program. 
   Another is obesity and nutritious foods. Obesity is a real crisis and we need to ensure that our children are eating the most nutritious foods available. School meals must meet rigorous nutritional standards and they should be consistent nationwide. We also have to be conscious about the rising cost of food and the impact of these rising costs on the school meal programs. 
   A third issue is the difference between free and reduced price meals. Unfortunately, some qualified children receive free meals at school while others must pay a portion of the meal price. 
   Finally, I want to express my strong support for school breakfast programs that begin when class starts, or ``at the bell.'' Most children who eat school breakfast must arrive at school before class starts. That can be both a hardship for the children and their families in trying to get them to school in time to eat. But it can also be a social stigma for these children who arrive early to eat because it's clear which children must arrive early to eat. We can eliminate that social stigma by serving school breakfasts at the bell. 
   The Child Nutrition Act will be reauthorized next year, and we will have an opportunity to make substantive improvements in these important school meal programs. But today, we are recognizing the importance of the school breakfast programs and honoring the people who administer and work on these programs in school districts across the country.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (THE TIME IS NOW TO PLAN SAFE AND ORDERLY DEPARTURE FROM IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - September 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, there is a great deal of spin coming from the White House on why America needs to stay the course in Iraq, and why we must keep the surge going on and on and on, on how victory is near if we simply escalate the number of troops we have in this region of Iraq or another region of Iraq. 
   Enough, Mr. Speaker, enough. It seems the President hasn't read his own National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq. If he had, he would find a grim picture of the political and security reality in Iraq, one quite different from his own. 
   Let me read just a few conclusions from this August 23 report: 
   One, the level of overall violence, including attacks on and casualties among civilians, remains high; Iraq's sectarian groups remain unreconciled; al Qaeda in Iraq retains the ability to conduct high-profile attacks; and to date, Iraqi political leaders remain unable to govern effectively. 
   Two, population displacement resulting from sectarian violence continues, imposing burdens on provincial governments and some neighboring states and increasing the danger of destabilizing influences spreading across Iraq's borders over the next 6 to 12 months. 
   Three, broadly accepted political compromises required for sustained security, long-term political progress and economic development are unlikely to emerge unless there is a fundamental shift in the factors driving Iraqi political and security developments. 
   Mr. Speaker, just the first few pages of the NIE on Iraq should concern everyone. Also on the President's reading list should be the August 30 draft GAO report on Iraq, which also paints a very pessimistic picture of Iraq. It concludes that Iraq has failed to meet all but three of the 18 required benchmarks for political and military progress. Rather than embrace these nonpartisan findings, the White House has actually denounced the GAO report for holding Iraq to too high a set of standards. 
   Mr. Speaker, while the White House speaks of how violence has been reduced in Baghdad, it ignores how the number of Iraqi civilian deaths across the country rose by about 20 percent in July. This is not the time to paint rosy scenarios and declare victory is at hand if only Congress coughs up another $200 billion to cover the costs of the war over the next few months. 
   Mr. Speaker, the President and we in Congress must face the facts. We need a plan on how to leave Iraq in a safe and orderly manner in 2008. We need the President to meet with congressional leaders and map out a concrete plan for how to draw down our forces and leave Iraq over the next 9 to 12 months. It can be done, and it must be done. 
   We can redeploy troops to Kuwait in the surrounding region. We can safeguard the Kurdish north. We can redeploy troops to Afghanistan. And we can bring troops home to their families, friends and communities. We need the Pentagon to provide a realistic plan for withdrawal, one that is logistically sound and can be achieved over the next year. 
   President Bush, with great fanfare, recently invoked the Vietnam analogy to support our continued escalation in Iraq. If anything, Vietnam and Iraq prove that wars are a lot easier to get into than out of. If we want to avoid the haste, confusion and humiliation of our final departure from Vietnam, a withdrawal that occurred almost entirely without planning and hurt U.S. military prestige more than any other single action, then we must plan now for our departure from Iraq. If we fail to plan and control the safe and orderly withdrawal of our forces, then we will surely fail our troops once again, holding them hostage to events on the ground beyond their control. 
   The administration lacked a plan for what to do in Iraq the day after the fall of Saddam Hussein. We must not repeat that mistake when it comes to the welfare and the safety of our troops as they leave Iraq. 
   For far too long, Congress failed to live up to its responsibilities. We must not continue to send blank checks to the White House. 
   Mr. Speaker, this House should not consider the President's supplemental request until we come to an agreement with him on how to bring our troops home in a safe, orderly and timely way. 
   Let me be clear. This means we should not consider on the floor of this House any additional funding for this war until we have a plan to end it. 
   As The New York Times stated last Friday, ``In Vietnam, like Iraq, American Presidents and military leaders went to great lengths to pretend that victory was at hand when nothing could be further from the truth.'' 
   We don't need more spin, Mr. Speaker. What we need is a plan to end the war in Iraq, and we need it now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, every five seconds, a child dies from hunger-related causes. That's the equivalent of 21 school busses full of children being killed every day. With the current food crisis, even more people are being put at risk of starvation as the prices of daily food staples move out of reach. This is not just tragic; it is shameful. We have the resources necessary to end hunger. What we need is the political will to do so. 
   Madam Speaker, I've never heard any Member of Congress declare that he or she is pro-hunger. But regrettably, too few are actively working to rid our Nation and the world of this terrible scourge. I am very proud of the members of the bipartisan House Hunger Caucus who have taken up the task of raising the profile of this domestic and global issue and helping to educate their colleagues about how we can address and end not just the crisis caused by rising food costs, but hunger itself. 
   As the world faces a crisis of hunger, it is increasingly more important that Members of Congress speak out against hunger and take action to ensure that action is taken to truly address the crisis. Thank you to Yvette Clarke and Sheila Jackson-Lee for their leadership in organizing this Special Order Hour and for all those participating tonight. The time to end hunger is now. We cannot wait while more children and families go without food, or even starve to death. 
   Tonight, in the aftermath of the earthquake in China and the cyclone in Burma, we hold the victims of these disasters in our thoughts. We see, once again, the generosity of the world in reaching out to these victims of natural catastrophe. 
   But the children of Haiti, the urban poor of Manila, the refugees in Darfur--and, literally, the hundreds of millions of people around the world and in our own country who do not know whether there will be food on the table tonight or tomorrow--our thoughts and our prayers are with them, too. But more importantly, we send to them our commitment to take action on their behalf, and to take action in support of their own efforts to help themselves. Together we can overcome this current crisis, and together we can end hunger in our lifetime.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (TAKING THE FOOD STAMP CHALLENGE -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, this week, I am joined by three of my esteemed colleagues, Congresswoman Jo Ann Emerson from Missouri, Congressman Tim Ryan from Ohio and Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky from Illinois, in taking the Food Stamp Challenge. 
   The Food Stamp Challenge is an initiative begun by nonprofit and religious community groups. Public officials agree to live on a food stamp budget for 1 week in order to raise awareness of the food stamp program and the inadequacy of the current benefit. Under the Food Stamp Challenge, we will only be allowed to eat food totaling $21 for the week, $3 a day, or $1 per meal, which is the national average food stamp benefit. In other words, no lattes at Starbucks, no organic chicken at home and no wine or shrimp at receptions this week. 
   Yesterday, Congresswoman Emerson and I went grocery shopping at the Capitol Hill Safeway for the week. However, she was a more efficient shopper than I was. While she made it through the checkout line in 30 minutes, it took me almost an hour and a half to find food that fit my budget, and that was even with the much-appreciated assistance of Ms. Toinette Wilson, a DC food stamp recipient, who assisted my wife Lisa and me with our shopping. 
   Oregon Governor Ted Kulongoski successfully took the challenge with his wife a few weeks ago, and Utah Governor John Huntsman, Jr., is currently living on a food stamp budget with his household of eight. In New York City, where over 1 million people depend on food stamps each month, New York City Councilman Eric Gioia is participating in the Food Stamp Challenge. 
   This diverse group of public leaders who all feel compelled to take on this challenge demonstrates the importance of the food stamp program for all Americans: from California to Massachusetts, Michigan to Texas, Republican and Democrat, urban and rural, the food stamp program represents the moral values of America: compassion, thoughtfulness and community spirit. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am taking this Food Stamp Challenge as a way of saying that as Americans, we need to do more to eliminate hunger and poverty in this country. One in nine U.S. households, nearly 36 million Americans, does not consistently have enough food to feed themselves or their families according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. There is no excuse for this. 
   In the wealthiest country on earth, it is not about finding the resources. It is about mustering the political will. 
   Established in 1939, the food stamp program helps families in need buy food so that they do not have to make difficult choices, such as choosing between paying a utility bill, addressing health care needs or buying food. It truly is the safety net for America's hungry. 
   Despite what some critics like to say, the food stamp program is not a government handout, but it is a true safety net program that provides access to food for people who cannot afford to choose between rent, medicine, child care and transportation. Gone are the days of the inefficient program ravaged by fraud, waste and abuse. In fact, National Journal recently named the food stamp program as one of the government's top successes. And the GAO has repeatedly reported on the successes of this important program. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me take a moment to share with you who benefits from the food stamp program. According to USDA, over 26 million people benefited from the food stamp program last year, including 452,000 individuals from my State of Massachusetts. Over 80 percent of food stamp benefits go to families with children. One in five food stamp households has an elderly family member, and one in four has a disabled member. Increasingly, working families must rely on food stamps to supplement their wages in low-paying jobs. 
   Some may question the motives of elected officials taking this 1-week challenge. These critics, Mr. Speaker, are missing the point. It's time for a much greater public debate to take place around this issue. It is time to end hunger in America, and we can do  so starting by focusing on the food stamp program. 
   The food stamp program is our government's first line of defense against hunger and malnutrition and it should be better equipped to accomplish that task. Merely 60 percent of those who are eligible to receive food stamps currently do, and in Massachusetts that participation rate is only 49 percent. The participation rate is particularly low for immigrants and the elderly. 
   Last week, Congresswoman Emerson and I introduced H.R. 2129, the Feeding America's Families Act, which would greatly improve the food stamp program as well as other Federal hunger and nutrition programs scheduled for reauthorization in the farm bill. We encourage each of our colleagues to consider cosponsoring this important piece of legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, although some judge the health of our Nation by how the wealthiest are faring, others, including myself, believe we must measure the morality and prosperity of our society by the status and mobility of those at the bottom of the economic ladder. Through this challenge, I hope my constituents, the American people and my colleagues in Washington, DC, will learn more about the vital role the food stamp program plays in the lives of low-income people.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (VISITING FOOD AND FRIENDS, A D.C.-BASED ANTI-HUNGER ORGANIZATION -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, last week I had the privilege of spending a morning at Food and Friends, an organization that provides high-nutrient meals and nutrition therapy for people living with life-threatening illnesses, like HIV/AIDS, cancer and diabetes. It's located right here in Washington, DC. Five of my esteemed colleagues joined me on this visit, Representatives Jo Ann Emerson, Lois Capps, Jan Schakowsky, Barbara Lee, and Eleanor Holmes Norton. Our visit was enlightening and inspiring. 
   Food and Friends began in 1988 when Reverend Carla Gorrell began making lunch for her friend who was so sick with AIDS that she was unable to leave the house. Reverend Gorrell recognized what is so basic, and yet so often overlooked. When we treat people with diseases, she recognized that nutritious food is an essential component of any medical regimen. Today, almost 20 years later, Food and Friends remains steadfast in its mission to provide high-nutrient meals, with care and compassion, to the critically ill in Washington, DC, Maryland and Virginia. Since 1988, Food and Friends has delivered more than 10 million meals to nearly 16,000 individuals. The organization that began in a church basement now operates in a multifaceted facility with over 50 staff members and, most impressively, 1,500 dedicated volunteers. 
   While my colleagues and I were at Food and Friends, we learned a tremendous amount about the significance of nutritious food for those suffering from critical illnesses. Laura Otolski, one of the three full-time dieticians on staff, educated us about the importance of individually treating each client's nutritional needs. To this end, the dieticians assess clients and then collaborate with chefs to prepare 14 different meal plans, including pureed meals for individuals who cannot chew solid food and meals for the homeless who may not have access to refrigerators and ovens. 
   Food and Friends staff members also recognize that to treat an individual, you must also provide food for his or her children and caretakers. For example, if a mother is too sick to cook and a volunteer only delivers a meal for her, she will give it to her children and go without food. Therefore, Food and Friends delivers meals for the whole family, including a specially designed children's meal plan. For those who live beyond Food and Friends' delivery area, they are eligible for the Groceries to Go service that provides two bags of nonperishable groceries as well as perishable frozen meals prepared by Food and Friends kitchen staff. In addition to providing food, Food and Friends offers cooking classes, nutritional counseling and even a photography workshop for clients to express themselves through art. Through its diverse programs, Food and Friends nourishes the body as well as the mind and soul. 
   Without a doubt, the highlight of our visit was hearing from two Food and Friends clients, Ajani Johnson and Crystal Wood. They described the hopelessness they felt when first learning about their illnesses. How quickly he felt sick. How far her cancer had spread. But then they told us about the gift of food that changed the course of their lives. The food--and the friendship of staff and volunteers that accompanied it--renewed their physical strength and belief in their ability to fight the disease. They became passionate when talking about the power of food to improve their quality of life while battling deadly illnesses. They also wanted us to know that they're not just clients of Food and Friends, they are also volunteers of the organization. They want others to experience the nourishment and compassion that was freely offered to them. 
   Mr. Speaker, Food and Friends is not alone in serving meals to the sick in this country. It is part of a national and international network of 120 agencies collectively serving 10 million meals to individuals each year. The Association of Nutrition Services Agencies is currently working with the Congressional Hunger Center on a Food as  Medicine initiative. The purpose of the Food as Medicine campaign is to educate local and national leaders, academics and citizens about the value of nutrition services for those fighting disease. 
   We have the information we need to make great strides in recognizing the therapeutic effects of nutrition for those living with life-threatening illnesses, and I urge my colleagues to work together to ensure that all critically ill Americans have access to food and nutrition therapy as part of their treatment plans. These services improve the efficacy of medications and the quality of life of those suffering and their families. It is a simple but crucial step in improving the quality of health care in this country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, House Resolution 581 is a traditional open rule for appropriations bills. This open rule allows any amendment to be offered as long as the amendment complies with House rules. 
   Madam Speaker, the Agriculture appropriations bill may not get as much attention as some of the others, but it is incredibly important to the Nation. For the past 6 years, the bill has been underfunded by President Bush and the Republican Congress. 
   This year, the subcommittee chairwoman, Rosa DeLauro, and her colleagues have put together a bill that begins to restore cuts in funding to the Department of Agriculture; cuts that have left too many people hungry here at home and around the world; cuts that have threatened America's food security and food safety; and cuts that have denied rural America improvements and access to better technology, better housing and a better environment. 
   Madam Speaker, today I am pleased to say that with this bill, we have turned the corner. The fiscal year 2008 Agriculture appropriations bill makes new and important investments in our people. This is not a perfect bill, but it is a big step in the right direction. I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   I am proud, Madam Speaker, to serve as the Cochair of the bipartisan House Hunger Caucus along with my good friend from Missouri, Jo Ann Emerson. I have a strong interest in making sure that our domestic and international hunger programs get the funding that they need. 
   With this bill, more pregnant women and infants will get the nutritious food they need through the WIC program. With this bill, more children who eat a school breakfast or lunch will receive meals during the summer months, when school is out of session, just like they do during the school year. With this bill, the food that they are served in school will be healthier, including more fresh fruits and vegetables. With this bill, the Commodity Food Supplemental Program can expand participation in existing States and can also begin participating in five new States. 
   The bill continues funding to combat hunger around the world through programs like Food for Peace and the George McGovern-Robert Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program. There is increased funding for the Food and Drug Administration and the Food Safety and Inspection Service, allowing USDA to better oversee our Nation's food safety, and more importantly, root out any food contamination and threats to America's food supply. 
   Providing these agencies with the proper tools, including proper staffing, is an important part of USDA's mission that usually goes unnoticed unless a problem arises. 
   Finally, Madam Speaker, this bill increases funding for programs that directly affect rural America. For far too long, rural America has been underfunded and, in many cases, underappreciated. This bill increases funding for programs important to rural America, including crop insurance integrity, livestock competition, enforcement efforts at the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the Rural Community Advancement Program, clean water and business loans and grants. 
   Finally, there are increases in funds for technology access that will provide grants for distance learning, telemedicine and broadband development in rural areas. 
   Madam Speaker, before I conclude my opening remarks, I want to address one more subject in a little bit of detail. For years we have not done nearly enough, Democrats and Republicans alike, to end hunger. I will say it again: Hunger is a political condition. We have the resources to end it. We have the infrastructure. What we need is the political will and determination to make it happen. 
   With passage of the fiscal year 2008 Agriculture appropriations bill and the  recently approved farm bill, this new Democratic Congress is taking a major step forward in the fight to end hunger in America and around the world. We are moving in a new direction toward a place where everybody in this world has enough to eat. We have much more work to do, but today we can make an important down payment. 
   Now, during consideration of this bill, we may see attempts to cut these vital, proven programs. Members will say that they, too, are troubled by hunger, but they don't want to spend the money to address it. It is the same old argument. 
   Additionally, during consideration of this bill, there may be an amendment offered by my friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway) that would allow State governments to privatize the Food Stamp program. 
   Madam Speaker, this open rule allows the gentleman from Texas to offer this amendment. I support his right to do so. However, this is bad policy that was rejected in the farm bill. As a supporter of the Food Stamp program, a program proven to provide food to hungry Americans, I strongly oppose this amendment. The State of Texas has experimented with privatizing food stamps. That experiment failed. According to a letter signed by 21 organizations opposed to the privatization of the Food Stamp program, ``before the State canceled its contract with the private contractors, hundreds of thousands of low-income children and adults were unable to access nutrition and health care assistance that they desperately needed and to which they were entitled by law.'' 
   Privatization of the Food Stamp program failed in Texas. We should not put more families at risk by extending that failed experiment to other States. The amendment deserves to be defeated. I urge my colleagues to vote no if, in fact, the amendment is offered. 
   Madam Speaker, I will insert letters opposing privatization of the Food Stamp program into the Record at this point.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, before I yield to the next speaker, I just want to make a couple of observations. I find it somewhat ironic that my Republican friends, on the one hand, complain about the size of the bill, the overall amount of money that has been put into this bill; and then they complain about the programs that haven't been funded enough on the other hand. You can't have it both ways. I guess there is no pleasing them. 
   The other thing, too, is the vote on the previous question has nothing to do with the underlying bill. But I will remind my colleagues that in addition to the many good things that this bill does for rural America and for farmers and for feeding hungry people, there is a national security component to this bill as well. This bill contains money to help protect the American people from contaminated food that may cross our borders into our country. This is about food security. So this is a vital part of protecting the American people, and I don't think that should be lost. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to my good friend, the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Cardoza), my colleague on the Rules Committee.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I am sorry my friends on the other side of the aisle don't seem to put a high priority on agriculture and on the need to support our farmers and the need to feed hungry people in this country. 
   You want to talk about a national security challenge, there are 35 million Americans in this country today who are either hungry or food insecure, in large part because of the Republican agenda to erode the safety net over the last several years. 
   There is money in this bill for food safety and inspection, money to support the Food and Drug Administration so people don't get contaminated drugs. 
   No, I am not going to yield to the gentleman. 
   These are vital national security interests. And it is about time we get our priorities straight. We need to pass this bill, just as we needed to pass the farm bill to help fix the damage that they have done over the last several years. So enough is enough. This is an important bill. If you don't think it is an important bill, then vote down the rule. Defeat the rule so we don't debate issues like agriculture and food security and support for the hungry in this country. 
   I would strongly urge my colleagues to vote for this rule. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch).

   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, let me just respond to the gentleman briefly by saying if the Republican Congress over the years has done such a good job in combating hunger and food insecurity in this country, why are there 35 million Americans that are categorized as hungry and food insecure? 
   In response to the idea that we want more Americans to be ``independent,'' we all want that. The bottom line is that Republican policies which took away indexing of food stamps back in 1996 has made it possible for many people not to be able to transition for food stamps. 
   The fact of the matter is the majority of people who are on food stamps today are working families. They are trying to be independent. They're working hard, and yet because we have failed to index food stamps to keep up with the cost of living, we've all given ourselves pay raises here. So obviously we feel the cost of living does have an impact, but yet we haven't done it to the most vulnerable. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, let me just say I am disappointed with my colleague from Washington and others who have come to the floor to try to bring back an oldy but goody that the Republicans like to invoke, and that is the politics of fear. Maybe Karl Rove went down to the Republican National Committee and briefed them and said everything else is failing for the Republicans, they are at an all-time low in the public opinion poll, so trot out the politics of fear again and scare the American people. 
   Well, the fact of the matter is, as the gentleman knows, the administration, the Bush administration, and the Speaker's Office are in negotiations on trying to reach an accommodation on this FISA issue. If you don't believe me, it was in Congressional Quarterly. What Congressional Quarterly also stated was that the Republicans in the House, however, were trying to drag their feet. 
   If you don't want to join in the deliberation, that's your problem. We will work something out, hopefully with the administration, and bring this issue to closure. 
   But let me say one other thing why we need to be very, very careful on this. We need to be very, very careful about giving even more broad unchecked authority to Alberto Gonzales and his crew. Quite frankly, I wouldn't trust the Attorney General to tell me the correct time, never mind stand up and defend the civil liberties of anybody. That's why Democrats are continuing to work with the White House to get a tough, smart FISA bill to put together, and I expect that we will do that. What the gentleman and others are going to decide to do right now is plain politics.  
   Back to the main subject here, which is the farm bill. This is a good bill for farmers. This is a good bill for people who are vulnerable, who have been shortchanged by the administration in the Republican Congresses when it comes to food security. This is a good bill for America. 
   I congratulate the distinguished gentlelady from Connecticut for working together so hard to put together a bill we can be proud of. Vote ``yes'' on the previous question, and vote ``yes'' on the rule.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, get this. The Secretary of Agriculture has publicly stated that he is not enthusiastic about increasing spending for nutrition programs above the $9.5 billion currently being discussed as part of the farm bill conference. I have news for the Secretary. Families going to food banks aren't enthusiastic about their struggles. People applying for food stamps aren't enthusiastic about the tough choices they are forced to make because their food stamp benefit isn't keeping up with the price of milk. Seniors aren't enthusiastic about having to take their medicines on an empty stomach. 
   The Secretary should get out more into the real world and meet with some of these families. $9.5 billion is simply not enough, not when families are choosing between food and heat; not when the minimum food stamp benefit is still $10 a month, unchanged since 1977; not when the price of milk eats more of the food stamp dollar today, than last year, simply because food stamps aren't indexed for inflation. 
   The farm bill conferees should do the right thing and properly fund the nutrition title. Anything less is shameful.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, last year the House did its job and passed a fully funded farm bill with important improvements in the food stamp and TEFAP programs. The Senate, unfortunately, was not so responsible. 
   Now that the farm bill negotiations are under way, we hear that reducing funding for food stamps and food banks is on the table. 
   Mr. Speaker, this farm bill should not be negotiated on the backs of the hungry. Feeding hungry people is never wrong, but taking food out of their mouths is, and that's what a reduction in the House-passed domestic nutrition title would do. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must draw a line in the sand and say enough is enough. House farm bill negotiators must stand up to the Senate and say, ``Not this time.'' 
   The recently passed stimulus package does not include food stamp provisions, even though economists across the political spectrum agree that food stamps are one of the best ways to stimulate the economy. 
   And now food stamps may be cut below the House-passed levels? We can and must do better.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (FATHER ROBERT DRINAN -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, Father Robert Drinan, a former Member of this House and a champion for the cause of peace and justice, died yesterday. 
   Father Drinan was a hero and a friend. He recognized early the folly of the Vietnam War, and he fought to end it. He was a critic of the current and senseless war in Iraq. He was outspoken and not faint on issues of human rights here at home and around the world. He was a friend to the poor, a courageous advocate for civil rights and civil liberties, and a well-respected legal scholar. He was also a Jesuit priest who was proud of his vocation and dedicated to the teachings of the Church. 
   We developed a strong friendship over the years. I certainly sought his advice and counsel on many, many issues; and he never hesitated to provide it. He called regularly, sent me articles and speeches, and always urged me to stand strong for what is right. 
   Mr. Speaker, our country, and indeed the world, is better off because of Bob Drinan. My condolences go out to his family and friends. He was a remarkable man and a true inspiration and he will be missed.  
   Mr. Speaker, I ask to insert in the RECORD a copy of an article which appeared in today's Boston Globe honoring Father Drinan.  
   Congressman-Priest Drinan Dies  
   The Rev. Robert F. Drinan, who left Boston College's administration to become the first Roman Catholic priest elected to Congress and who in 1973 filed the initial impeachment resolution against President Richard M. Nixon, died yesterday at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C. He was 86. 
   The cause of death was pneumonia and congestive heart failure, said a spokeswoman for Georgetown University, where Father Drinan taught legal ethics and other subjects to more than 6,000 students during the past 26 years. 
   ``Father Drinan was a forever gentle, resilient, tenacious advocate for social justice and fundamental decency,'' said Senator John F. Kerry, who was Father Drinan's campaign manager in 1970. ``He lived out in public life the whole cloth of Catholic teachings. In the most divisive days of Vietnam when things were coming apart, this incredible man and most unlikely of candidates showed America how a man of faith could be a man of peace .'' 
   A five-term member of the House of Representatives, Father Drinan was one of its most liberal members. His strong anti-administration stands earned him a place on the Nixon ``enemies list.'' His upset victory over U.S. Representative Philip J. Philbin, a 14-term incumbent who was vice chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, in the 1970 Democratic primary in Massachusetts Third Congressional District was a high-water mark in the New Politics, which brought the antiwar movement to the ballot box. 
   Father Drinan's election was also a landmark in U.S. church-state relations.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support this bill. I want to commend Representative Hare and Representative LaHood for their support on this bill, and I appreciate their eloquence in support of a truly great man and a great friend. 
   I was on the staff of Congressman Joe Moakley of Massachusetts when Lane Evans first came to Washington. Immediately, Joe knew that he had a new ally in the fight to protect human rights in El Salvador. Lane regularly met with people from Central America here in Washington and in his district. He traveled to the region, did his homework, and became an active Member in the effort to change U.S. policy and bring peace to that troubled region. 
   As a marine who served in Vietnam, Lane chaired the Vietnam Era Veterans Caucus in the House. Having seen war up close and personal, he worked with David Bonior, Jack Quinn, Senator Leahy and Senator Hagel and the Vietnam Veterans of America to push for a U.S. and international ban on the production and use of anti-personnel landmines. When I was privileged to be elected to Congress in 1996, one of the first things I did was go to Lane Evans and pledge my support for his work on landmines. 
   Lane's personal experience made him the champion of two other important causes. As the son of a union member, Lane consistently spoke out against the abuses facing so many workers around the world as they struggled to achieve their most basic rights. As a veteran himself, he made sure that we don't treat with suspicion the questions raised by those returning from war, whether on the effects of agent orange, gulf war syndrome or post-traumatic stress; and we must never reward their service with neglect, homelessness, underfunded health care, or reduced benefits. 
   When I think of Lane Evans, I think of an easy-going, likeable Midwesterner. I also think of courage and conviction in how he lives his own life and how he continues to confront the challenges facing America. 
   Mr. Speaker, I miss his voice and his presence in this House, and I urge all my colleagues to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 6842, NATIONAL CAPITAL SECURITY AND SAFETY ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 1434 provides for the consideration of H.R. 6842, the National Capital Security and Safety Act, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. The rule makes in order the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in the report if offered by Representative Childers. That amendment is debatable for 1 hour. The rule also provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, I stand before this House as a supporter of the second amendment, but also as a strong supporter of sensible gun safety legislation. I also stand here as a strong supporter of the elected Government of the District of Columbia, and I respect their right to enact and execute their own laws. 
   Apparently, and unfortunately, not all of my colleagues agree. They believe that Members of Congress from other States have the right to dictate matters that are best left to local governments. 
   On June 26, 2008, by a 5-4 decision in the Heller case, the Supreme Court upheld a ruling of the Federal Appeals Court which found the District's ban on handgun possession to be unconstitutional. It is important to note that the court stipulated that this right is not unlimited; they reaffirmed that ``any gun, anywhere'' is not constitutionally protected. 
   In response to the ruling, the D.C. City Council passed, and the mayor signed, emergency legislation to temporarily allow District residents to  have pistols in their homes. The council will continue their work this week by making those changes permanent. 
   Mr. Speaker, the elected D.C. City Council and the elected mayor are committed to complying with the Heller decision. The plaintiff in the case, Dick Heller, was quickly allowed to keep a gun in his home. 
   But that is not good enough for my friends on the other side of this debate. They believe it is not good enough for the D.C. Government to comply with the court's ruling. They believe they can take this opportunity to shove the agenda of a single special interest, the gun lobby, down the throats of the citizens of the District of Columbia. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is beyond insulting; it is arrogant. I ask my friends on the other side, how would they like it if Congress enacted laws that took away local control in their own communities? Maybe Congress should decide whether the ``Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' can be assigned in the Dallas County schools. Maybe Congress should decide whether a new Wal-Mart can be built in Tupelo, Mississippi. Maybe Congress should decide how many firefighters the Macon, Georgia Fire Department should have. 
   I promise you, Mr. Speaker, that if we tried to bring any of those things to the House floor, my friends on the other side of the aisle would be down here screaming about big government and local control. But when it comes to doing the bidding of the gun lobby, they have decided that Congress knows best. 
   It is bad enough that the citizens of the District of Columbia have to endure taxation without representation every single day. And it is bad enough that even though soldiers from the District of Columbia can fight and die wearing the uniform of the United States, they do not have the right to a full vote in the United States Congress. 
   We should be strengthening the District's right to govern itself, not trouncing on it. For years, Congress treated the District of Columbia as its little fiefdom. The amendment made in order under this rule would take us back to those bad old days. 
   Again, the purpose of the underlying bipartisan legislation before us today is to require that the D.C. Government comply with the Heller decision within 180 days. There is simply no need, there is no justification for this Congress to go beyond the Heller decision and impose sweeping changes to the self-governance of D.C. But that is exactly what the Heller amendment would do, easing access to guns, eliminating gun registration, and making D.C. law enforcement's job to protect its residents and the visitors that come here that much harder.     
   This will, in no way, make our Nation's capital a safer place. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman Holmes Norton for her steadfast representation of the District, and for bringing H.R. 6842 to the floor today. I urge my colleagues to support her legislation and to vote ``no'' on the Childers amendment, and I look forward to the debate today. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, this debate is nuts. The Childers amendment, among other things, would allow stockpiling of military-style weapons with high capacity ammunition magazines. It would undermine Federal anti-gun trafficking laws. It would prohibit D.C. from enacting commonsense gun laws. It would repeal commonsense restrictions on gun possession by dangerous unqualified persons. It repeals all age limits for the possession and carrying of long guns, including assault rifles. It allows gun possession by many persons who have committed violent or drug-related misdemeanor crimes. It allows many persons who are dangerously mentally ill to obtain firearms. It repeals registration requirements for firearms. It repeals all safe storage laws. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is my view that, if, in fact, we enacted the Childers amendment, that we would create a situation where we put more people in danger. 
   This is not about security for the citizens of D.C. This, quite frankly, is about insecurity. What this amendment is is one big fat wet kiss to the National Rifle Association. 
   At this point, Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia, Ms. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, before I use my time, I would like to insert in the Record a statement by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence; a statement by Stop Handgun Violence; a letter signed by a number of religious organizations opposed to the Childers amendment; and a letter from D.C. Vote, which includes the D.C. Republican Committee, which opposes the Childers amendment. 
   Childers Amendment Would Repeal D.C. Gun Laws, Endanger Public Safety and Threaten Homeland Security 
   The House may soon consider legislation concerning D.C. gun laws. We support H.R. 6842, the bipartisan Norton/Issa bill to require that D.C. conform its laws to the Supreme Court ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller. The D.C. Council is already in the process of amending its gun laws in response to Heller, and this bill requires D.C. to act within 180 days. 
   A dangerous NRA-backed amendment, proposed by Rep. Childers, would repeal D.C. gun laws and go far beyond authorizing gun possession for self-defense in the home. The amendment is based on H.R. 6691, a reckless bill so broad it even would have allowed the carrying of assault rifles on D.C. streets. After the NRA repeatedly claimed that nothing in H.R. 6691 ``would allow people to carry loaded firearms outside of their home,'' it apparently agreed to undo dangerous provisions that did in fact allow the carrying of assault rifles in public. Yet the rest of the Childers amendment remains almost identical to H.R. 6691--it still undermines gun laws and endangers homeland security. 
   After repeatedly misleading Congress about the scope of H.R. 6691, the NRA has no credibility on this issue. Last week, the NRA's chief lobbyist, Chris Cox, was quoted repeatedly stating that the bill would not allow the open carrying of assault weapons, and ridiculing those who claimed otherwise. The NRA has now implicitly conceded that its repeated prior statements were false, as the revisions are aimed at a problem that the NRA claimed did not exist. Either the NRA was intentionally misleading Congress and the public about the bill, or it did not understand what its top legislative priority would do. It is hard to know which is worse. 
   The NRA-backed Childers amendment still creates serious threats to public safety and homeland security by allowing dangerous persons to stockpile semiautomatic assault weapons with high capacity ammunition magazines in D.C., undermining federal laws to curtail gun trafficking, and prohibiting D.C. from passing laws that could ``discourage'' gun possession or use, even basic safe storage requirements or age limits for the possession of assault rifles. We oppose the dangerous Childers amendment to H.R. 6842. 
    BACKGROUND 
   H.R. 6691 was introduced following the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller that D.C.'s ban on handguns in the home for self-defense was unconstitutional. Justice Scalia's majority opinion in Heller, however, was narrow and limited. He specifically noted that a wide range of gun laws are ``presumptively lawful''--everything from laws ``forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places'' to ``conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.'' 
   After Heller, D.C. passed temporary, emergency regulations to comply with the Supreme Court ruling, and the plaintiff in the case, Dick Heller, was approved by the city to keep a gun in his home. D.C. is currently developing permanent regulations to adapt all of its gun laws to the Court's ruling. Yet instead of giving D.C.'s elected officials a fair and reasonable opportunity to enact permanent regulations, the gun lobby is pushing Congress to enact dangerous and sweeping legislation that goes far beyond the mandates of Heller. 
   Even though the bipartisan Norton/Issa bill to require D.C. to conform to Heller was supported by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform by a 21-1 vote, the gun lobby is still pushing for a broad repeal of D.C. gun laws. It now supports the Childers amendment to H.R. 6842, which would bar the city from enacting measures to curb gun crime and weaken federal anti-gun trafficking laws. 
   The Childers amendment would endanger not only D.C. residents but also all those who work in and visit the capital. At a time when terrorists continue to look for ways to attack our nation, passing this amendment would be reckless and irresponsible. Congress should reject the dangerous Childers amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 7110, JOB CREATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1507 provides for the consideration of H.R. 7110, the Job Creation and Unemployment Relief Act of 2008. The rule provides 1 hour of debate on the motion equally divided and controlled by the Committee on Appropriations. 
   Mr. Speaker, the past 8 years have not been kind to American workers and their families. Since President Bush was inaugurated 8 years ago, people's wages have stagnated while the cost of food and energy have skyrocketed.  
   Over the past 8 years, more people have been forced into poverty. Over the past 8 years, student loans have become even harder to get, denying access to a college education. Over the past 8 years, more people have trouble putting food on their table. Over the past 8 years, more people have lost their jobs. Over the past 8 years, our infrastructure, our roads and our bridges and levees have deteriorated, and in some cases have collapsed. I hope that the American public sees a pattern here. 
   And these problems didn't just magically happen. We're in this mess today because of the way the Republican party has turned their backs on anyone not fortunate to make millions of dollars, because of President Bush's insistence on tax cuts for the wealthy, and because of the reckless spending originating from the then Republican-controlled Congress. 
   My friends, we are in this mess today because of reckless fiscal and financial mismanagement proposed by this President and rubber-stamped by the Republicans in Congress. And now that the past 8 years has led us to the biggest and most desperate financial crisis since the Great Depression, the Republicans in the House are proposing more tax breaks for their rich friends on Wall Street. Their answer to a frozen market is more tax cuts for the people who got us into this mess in the first place. 
   When the times get tough, the Republicans try to cut taxes for the rich. That's not leadership, Mr. Speaker; that's just more of the same bad policies that got us here. There is a different way, a way that looks out for Main Street. 
   We recognize, those of us in the Democratic Caucus, we recognize that everyday Americans, not the Donald Trumps of the world or the big oil companies, need help in these very tough times. We know that rising food prices are causing people to cut back on the food that they're putting on their tables. We know that jobs are increasingly hard to find, and that unemployed Americans are exhausting the unemployment benefits that are helping them scrape by as they look for new jobs. We know that the crumbling infrastructure in our Nation must be fixed, that we cannot risk another bridge collapse like the one that took place in Minnesota last year. And we know that investments in infrastructure will create new jobs and make our people safer. 
   The people who are calling our offices angry about the bailout for Wall Street are saying, ``Wait a minute. What about us? What about us?'' And that is exactly the question we are here to answer today. Today, Democrats are saying to the American people, to the people of Massachusetts, ``We hear you.'' That's why we have an economic stimulus bill that will provide a $60 billion jump start to the economy. 
   In this bill, Democrats will provide almost $37 billion in infrastructure development. That means more highway construction, funding for passenger rail improvements, increases in clean water and flood control. There is funding for school modernization and public housing in this bill. These are not just improvements in our infrastructure--which are badly needed after years of neglect by this President and his allies in this Congress, these are jobs programs. More funding for infrastructure programs will mean more people being hired to build roads and bridges, to repair schools, and to improve our waterways. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am particularly pleased that we are providing funding for communities like those in my district that are struggling with complying with clean water requirements and are looking to the Federal Government for just a little bit of help. 
   As a Member of Congress who represents a regional airport, I know how important airport improvement grants really are. In this bill, Democrats provide $600 million for AIG grants to help regional airports alleviate the massive congestion at our major hubs. 
   In this bill, Democrats provide $1.6 billion for development of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. In particular, $1 billion will be dedicated to an advanced battery loan program, which will allow for U.S. companies to invest and develop technology for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. 
   In this bill, Democrats provide an increase in the Medicaid matching rate to prevent cuts in health insurance and health care services for low-income children and families. 
   And in this bill, Democrats provided an additional 7 weeks of extended benefits for workers who have exhausted regular unemployment compensation. Extending unemployment benefits is one of the quickest, most cost-effective forms of economic stimulus because workers who have lost their paychecks spend benefits quickly. 
   And very importantly, Mr. Speaker, in this bill, Democrats provide $2.6 billion to address rising food costs for seniors, people with disabilities, and very poor families with children. We know that millions of our fellow citizens are struggling to put food on the table. Seniors are being forced to choose between eating and taking their medications. And we know food stamps will provide a targeted stimulus to the economy. We know that every Federal food dollar generates twice that in economic activity. Experts at CBO and Moody's, as well as economists from across the political spectrum, agree that increasing money for food stamps is a powerful economic stimulus that can reach the low-income families who may not have benefited from the first stimulus package. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am extremely grateful to Chairman Obey for including this provision in this bill. I am also grateful for the leadership of Congressman JESSE JACKSON, Jr. and Congresswoman ROSA DELAURO for their advocacy on behalf of food and nutrition programs. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I expect many of my friends on the other side of the aisle to oppose this package. I expect them to say that it's too much money and that it's unnecessary. Well, if I'm right, then it will show the American people just how out of touch they really are. 
   Mr. Speaker, we need a stimulus package today, not just for Wall Street, but for Main Street. People are struggling, and they need and deserve our help. They don't need your empathy, they don't need your sympathy, they don't need your kind words, they don't want you to feel their pain, what they want is your vote, your vote on a stimulus package that will help them, that will benefit everyday people on Main Street. 
   So I hope the Republicans, Mr. Speaker, will finally join us in meeting the real needs of the working families of this Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I would just say that I think my friends on the Republican side just don't get it. This President, with their help, has driven this economy into a ditch. And we need to take the responsibility to get us out of that ditch. And that is what this stimulus package in part is about. 
   People are hurting, not just people on Wall Street, but people on Main Street. People are hurting all over this country. People have lost their jobs. There are more people after 8 years of this President who are unemployed. There are more people who are hungry. There are more people without health care. I could go on and on and on. And our infrastructure is crumbling. This is an attempt to help those people. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me just say I have a great deal of respect for my friend from Arizona, but I have to respond by saying that another tax cut is not going to rebuild a broken bridge in Massachusetts that because of years of underfunding and years of a lack of commitment by the Federal Government is now dangerous. A tax giveaway to an oil company, another tax giveaway to an oil company is not going to build a school in California or Arizona or anywhere else, and another corporate tax break is not going to provide anybody health care. 
   The bottom line is that I will respectfully say to the gentleman that this Democratic Congress has been way more fiscally responsible, by light-years, than his party has been. Bill Clinton left office and left this country with a surplus. We now have the biggest debt in the history of this country. We have a war in Iraq that is $10 billion a month, and nobody on the other side believes that we have an obligation to pay for it. It goes on our credit card. 
   We cannot neglect the basic needs of this country, which we have been doing, unfortunately, for the last 8 years. We need to get back to basics. 
   I yield the gentleman 30 seconds.

   Mr. McGOVERN. I appreciate the gentleman's comments, but again I disagree with him. What I am talking about is investing in infrastructure to make our roads and our bridges safer, to create more jobs, to help stimulate this economy. So we have a very different approach. 
   We need to do something. We are in a fiscal emergency. The President is asking for $700 billion, don't pay for it, $700 billion to bail out Wall Street, and what we are saying is, look, we have to do a little something for Main Street, in the area of infrastructure, education, health care. 
   I don't think that is too much to ask. Yet this is a big deal to my friends on the Republican side, that we can't do this. It is too much. No, we can't do this. Everyday people don't deserve the  same consideration that the President of the United States is now asking that we give to big companies on Wall Street. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller), the chairman of the Education and Labor Committee.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Again, I think I responded to the gentleman. I would just say two other things that I think are important to make note of. 
   The gentleman, while his party was in control for 12 years, consistently voted for budgets that underfunded the very programs that we are talking about. Secondly, when he talks about a closed process, I don't recall a single incidence when the gentleman ever voted against his party on a closed rule when in fact his party was in control. 
   So let's get back to the point of this bill, which is to provide everyday people, who have been neglected by this President and by his allies in the Republican Congress for too long, this is to provide a little relief, to try to stimulate some job creation, to try to help with infrastructure, with rebuilding schools, with health care. I mean, the President of the United States is coming before the Nation saying $700 billion, I don't want to pay for it, for a bailout for Wall Street, and then he is telling us we can't do anything to help people on Main Street. 
   I would like to yield a minute to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey).

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me say with regard to the rural school issue, I was very proud to be able to vote on behalf of rural schools when the gentleman voted against it. I'm sorry he did that. But what we are talking about here today is an economic stimulus package to help everyday people. This is to help working people, to help people who have lost their jobs, to help people afford their health care, to help communities rebuild their roads and bridges and put people back to work. This is to help rebuild our schools. This is a bill to provide much-needed resources to our communities who have been neglected for far too long by this President and his Republican allies in this Congress. 
   This country, this economy, is in trouble. That is no secret to anyone here. Read the newspapers, turn on the news, it is there. We need to do something. What we need to do is not just bail out Wall Street, we need to help people on Main Street. People are tired. They are sick and tired of the rhetoric, the expressions of sympathy and the speeches by politicians who say ``I get it.'' ``I know things are bad in your community, I feel your pain.'' What they want us to do is to take action, to actually vote on something that means something in their lives. 
   This economic stimulus package invests in highway infrastructure. It invests to help rebuild our crumbling schools. It invests in clean water projects and in transit and Amtrak. It invests in public housing. It invests in energy development to help create green-collar jobs to get this economy moving in the right direction. It extends unemployment benefits. The gentleman from Michigan talked about the plight of so many workers who, because of this lousy economy, have lost their jobs and have exhausted their unemployment benefits. We are all talking about bailing out Wall Street, but we can't extend unemployment benefits to these workers? I mean, shame on us if you can't vote for that. 
   Medicaid assistance is in this bill. 
   Food assistance is in this bill. There is not a community in the United States of America, I am sad to say, that is hunger free. Go to any grocery store in your district and people will complain about the high cost of food. There are people in poverty and there are people who are working families who cannot afford their groceries. They need help. That is what this bill is all about. 
   So for the life of me, with all that is going on in this country, with all that is happening to this economy, for the life of me I can't understand why anyone would vote against this stimulus package. 
   This is a good bill. Chairman Obey deserves great credit for putting this together the way he did. It is not perfect. It doesn't include everything, but it is help. It is real help to real people, to everyday people, to working people, to people who have lost their jobs. This is absolutely necessary that we pass it. And we need to work with the President to make this part of the package.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 1157 provides for the consideration of H.R. 5522, the Combustible Dust Explosion and Fire Prevention Act of 2008, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate controlled by the Committee on Education and Labor, and makes in order the committee-reported substitute. It also makes in order two amendments printed in the Rules report, with a manager's amendment debatable for 10 minutes and the Wilson substitute debatable for 30 minutes. 
   Finally, the rule provides one motion to recommit, with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and the underlying legislation, H.R. 5522, the Worker Protection Against Combustible Dust Explosion and Fire Act of 2008. It directs the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to issue rules regulating combustible industrial dust that can build up to hazardous levels and explode. 
   Combustible dust has caused deaths and injuries to workers in our Nation, deaths and injuries that could have been prevented. Most recently, everyone can recall the enormous explosion in February at the Imperial Sugar refinery in Savannah, Georgia, which claimed the lives of 13 workers and injured over 60. Many of these workers remain hospitalized today, receiving care for the severe burns they received on that awful day. 
   While OSHA has marginally improved dust inspection procedures, this legislation goes further to bring combustible dust emissions under control by establishing stronger standards. Included are engineering controls, hazardous inspection, security assessments, housekeeping and explosion protection standards.     
   Specifically, the Worker Protection Against Combustible Dust Explosion and Fire Act requires OSHA to issue an interim final standard to control the risk of combustible dust explosions. The standard would contain provisions for housekeeping, engineering controls, and worker training. 
   Mr. Speaker, in 2003, there was a series of similar explosions at various factories due to combustible dust. The U.S. government undertook a study carried out by the Chemical Safety Board to determine the causes and make recommendations to OSHA. That report came out 2 years ago in 2006. OSHA has yet to issue standards to control the risks to workers and companies on the hazards of combustible dust. 
   For this reason, the bill requires an interim standard to be issued. OSHA would then be required to issue a final standard within 18 months through its regular procedures. OSHA would be required to ``include relevant and appropriate provisions of National Fire Protection Association combustible dust standards.'' 
   H.R. 5522 would also direct OSHA to explicitly list combustible dusts as a ``physical hazard'' in the Hazard Communication Standard, which requires employers to train workers about the chemical hazards that they are exposed to. 
   Mr. Speaker, every worker in this country deserves a safe and healthy work environment. The AFL-CIO, the UAW, the International Association of Firefighters, the American Industrial Hygiene Association, the SEIU, the Teamsters, and the United Food and Commercial Workers Union all strongly support this important legislation. 
   By establishing stronger protections and safer standards, this legislation better ensures thousands of workers in refineries, mills, and plants from risk of death or injury. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the rule, and I support the underlying legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me remind my colleagues that the underlying bill that we are dealing with is a bill that would actually protect workers in the workplace, the Combustible Dust Explosion and Fire Prevention Act of 2008, and it's a bill that responds to a terrible tragedy that has killed a number of workers and injured a number of workers. We need to pass this bill, and I hope we will pass the rule and pass the underlying bill. 
   But I have to say, Mr. Speaker, it is almost laughable to hear a member of the minority get up and talk about energy prices. The Republicans have controlled the White House for 8 years. They controlled the Congress for 12 years, and we have seen energy costs rise and rise and rise under their leadership; and we have seen their policy, which is to give more subsidies and more tax breaks to Big Oil, and they have fought us consistently in trying to invest resources into alternative sources of energy, into forms of energy to help make us more independent from foreign oil. 
   Speaker Pelosi called on President Bush to suspend purchases of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve temporarily. You know, filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, Mr. Speaker, takes 70,000 barrels of oil off the market each day even though the reserve is 97 percent full with enough to meet our national security needs. That's a good idea. Republicans opposed that. 
   At a time of record gas prices, suspending these government purchases, as we have done in the past, could reduce gas prices by 5 to 24 cents a gallon, a critical first step for America's families, businesses and the economy. 
   For years, Mr. Speaker, Democrats fought to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices and launch a cleaner, smarter energy future for America. Yet with Republican obstructionism, American consumers and businesses have had more pain at the pump paying a record $3.56 a gallon. 
   President Bush and congressional Republicans have spent all of their time in power doling out billions and billions and billions of dollars in subsidies to big oil companies instead of working for energy independence plans for America. 
   We have had a number of important pieces of legislation that we have brought to the floor such as H.R. 1252, the Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act, to crack down on gas price gouging, something that is a reality in this market.     
   It was opposed by 140 Republicans. 
   We had a bill, H.R. 2264, the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act, to hold OPEC accountable for oil price fixing. That was opposed by 67 Republicans, including almost the entire Republican leadership. 
   We have had a bill to repeal the subsidies to profit-rich big oil companies and invest in renewable energy, which was H.R. 5351, the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2008. It passed on February 27, 236-182. One hundred seventy-four Republicans opposed that, including the President of the United States. Now, get this, Mr. Speaker, the Republicans have opposed a measure that would take away the taxpayer-funded subsidies from the five biggest oil companies in this country that are making record profits, historic profits, it would take those subsidies and put it into renewable energy to help us become more energy independent, and they opposed it, and the President said he would veto it. And they have stopped progress on that measure. 
   They opposed the Energy Independence and Security Act, which would be an energy independence law with a market manipulation ban and new vehicle mileage standards. Again, the majority of the Republicans stood up and opposed these commonsense measures to help us become more energy independent and to help bring these gas prices down. 
   So their record is clear. It has been one of obstructionism. And it has been a record that has always been in the corner of Big Oil and against investing properly in some of these new technologies. 
   So President Bush and the Republicans have blocked our efforts virtually every step of the way. I hope that that will change after the next election. I expect that will change after the next election. But it is time for the Republicans to change their habit of saying ``no'' to consumers and American business on gas prices and always saying ``yes'' to Big Oil. 
   Enough is enough. It is time for House Republicans to provide the critical votes needed for a veto-proof majority for the legislation that I have outlined here today. 
   Americans are paying a heavy price for the obstructionism of the Republicans in this Congress and the President of the United States. They don't want to give any more taxpayer subsidies to the big oil companies. They want us to redirect those resources into commonsense, clean, renewable, alternative sources of energy. If we do that, Mr. Speaker, then we will get these gas prices under control, and we will also take a big step forward in cleaning up our environment. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker, I would urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (RECOGNIZING 2007 AS THE YEAR OF THE RIGHTS OF INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS IN COLOMBIA -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. I want to thank my colleague from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee) for her generous words and for yielding me the time and for all of her work on behalf of human rights. 
   I want to thank the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Lantos, for his leadership throughout the years on behalf of those who have lost their homes, their livelihoods, and their land through violence or natural disaster. 
   I would also like to recognize the ranking member for her work in educating Members of Congress about the suffering of refugees and the internally displaced. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 426, which shines a light on Colombia's more than 3 million internally displaced people, or IDPs, a number second only to Sudan.     
   In 2005, the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees described the IDP situation in Colombia as one of the most invisible humanitarian crises in the world. This is a crisis that the government of Colombia cannot handle alone. 
   Earlier this year, the UNHCR, the Colombian Catholic Church, and the Consultancy for Human Rights and Internal Displacement jointly declared 2007 as the Year of the Rights of the Internally Displaced People in Colombia. This resolution commends this initiative and encourages the United States and the Colombian governments and other donor nations to place greater priority on providing the necessary resources to aid and protect Colombia's internally displaced so that they might rebuild their lives. 
   Mr. Speaker, an estimated 3.8 million people have been displaced inside Colombia over the past two decades. This is approximately 8 percent of Colombia's total population. Currently, 200,000 people continue to be internally displaced every year. Almost one-third of these people are Afro-Colombian and indigenous peoples, and with conflict escalating in the regions of Narino and Choco, this number is likely to increase. A large majority, like displaced people all around the world, are women and children. Very few can return to their original homes. Many are displaced multiple times, finding no safety anywhere. It comes as no surprise then that Colombia's IDPs are poorer and more disenfranchised than the general population. Around three-quarters suffer from lack of food, inadequate shelter, and limited health care and other services. And, sadly, the harsh realities of life faced by the internally displaced are invisible even to most Colombians. They are a forgotten people, a marginalized people. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have traveled to Colombia several times, and on each trip, I have included a trip to internally displaced communities. On my very first trip in 2001, I went to Barrio Kennedy in the slums of Bogota. The majority of these families are from Tolima. They had been violently displaced by attacks mainly from FARC guerillas. They were rural families used to growing their own food and making a living by farming. In the capital, they were lost. They had no jobs. They couldn't grow their own food. They would get up early in the morning and hang around the trucks that brought in produce for the markets and gather up the food that fell off the trucks into the mud. They picked through the garbage looking for food to eat or items to barter. Alcoholism and domestic violence were rising. They lived in horrible conditions with a growing sense of hopelessness. 
   In 2003, I traveled north to the Department of Sucre. In Sincelejo, I visited the community of Cristo Viene. These families had been violently displaced by paramilitaries from their  communities in the mountains of Maria. They had small shacks for shelter. They had organized their teenagers into a group making bracelets and other items to sell in order to give purpose to the young people and generate some income for their community. All the youngest children had the rusty colored hair indicative of malnutrition. Nearly all the infants and toddlers had serious eye disorders or were already blind from vitamin deficiency. They could get access to rudimentary electricity and water, but only if they sold their vote to a corrupt local politician. 
   The Colombian Catholic Church and the Mennonite churches had joined together in their first ecumenical initiative to provide schools of basic humanitarian aid for these people. 
   In 2001 and 2007, I visited IDP communities perched precariously on barren hills next to the municipality of Soacha, on the outskirts of Bogota. On my first visit, I saw a school and a school feeding program, both funded by the United States and carried out by World Vision and the World Food Programme. For these children, these programs were the only stability in an insecure world. Paramilitary and FARC agents roamed freely trying to recruit children into their ranks. A mother came up to me and thanked the United States for supporting the school and free meals. She told me that if these programs didn't exist, her 11-year-old son would have gone into one of the armed groups just so he could get something to eat. 
   When I returned to Soacha this March, little had changed. If anything, things were worse. Over the past 6 years, violence has forced hundreds of thousands out of the countryside. Many ended up in Bogota, settling in the Soacha slum. They were from all over the country. So-called landlords are charging them outrageous rents when IDPs build themselves a shack. Children can't walk to school without fear of being assaulted, robbed or raped. The price of water was several times higher than that of regular Bogota residents. IDP community leaders working with Colombian and international NGOs were doing their best to address the community's problems but lacked the necessary resources. And the local officials of Soacha were struggling to meet basic needs. 
   Madam Speaker, I am proud that the United States has always targeted resources for IDP communities, and the recent House-passed Foreign Operations appropriations bill increases that funding. 
   Madam Speaker, H. Res. 426 is a bipartisan bill, and I want to thank my colleague, Congressman JOE PITTS of Pennsylvania, for joining me in introducing this legislation. It is supported by Refugees International, Catholic Relief Services, the Mennonite Central Committee, Jesuit Refugee Services USA, the Jesuit Conference of the United States, Lutheran World Relief, the International Rescue Committee, Mercy Corps and several other national organizations. 
   Madam Speaker, I commend the UNHCR, the Colombian Catholic Church and CODHES for bringing attention to this humanitarian crisis facing Colombia's internally displaced. I hope that there will be a renewed effort by the United States and the world community to help these people. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 426.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2669, COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. I thank my colleague from Ohio for yielding me the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, my home State of Massachusetts is famous for the quality of its colleges and universities. In the Third Congressional District alone, which I represent, there are 15 colleges and universities. Some of these schools specialize in the fields of medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and health sciences. Others are community and other 2-year colleges that provide education and training for students to earn associate degrees, transfer to 4-year institutions, or upgrade their skills and experience in order to become more productive in their chosen careers. 
   We are privileged to have such internationally recognized colleges as Clark University, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and Holy Cross College in my district. I have many public and private institutions, such as Worcester State College and Assumption College, which provide students with a well-rounded advanced education. 
   These schools attract a great diversity of students to central Massachusetts each year, over 30,000 in the Worcester area alone. H.R. 2669, the College Cost Reduction Act, will help these students realize the dream of a college education without mortgaging their futures in the process. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill overhauls the student aid system and provides debt relief in order to make college more affordable for students and their parents. As others have noted, it is the single largest investment in higher education since the GI Bill. And it provides these new benefits at no new cost to the taxpayer, reducing excess subsidies that have been paid by the Federal Government to lenders in the student loan industry. 
   But this bill also supports and protects the 90 percent of student loan lenders that are nonprofit lenders or smaller community-based lenders. H.R. 2669 recognizes their unique mission, putting all their profits back into students and into our communities. 
   The College Cost Reduction Act provides a fee reduction for these lenders, making them better able to compete with large national lenders and serve students and their families. The small lenders that make up the Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority, for example, provide students and families with straightforward information and advice on how to apply for and choose a college financing plan. Along with free financial aid seminars and advice, they also provide low-cost loan programs for parents and students. H.R. 2669 will allow these types of lenders to better serve the students and families of central Massachusetts by making their loans even more affordable. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Miller and the members of the Education and Workforce Committee for bringing us a bill that provides such substantial increases for the Pell Grant program, initiatives to help control colleges costs, increased funding for Perkins loans, greater support for the critical Upward Bound program, and restructuring the way in which students repay their loans. If we look at the Pell Grant alone, over 87,000 Massachusetts students will benefit over the next 5 years from an estimated $357 million in additional Pell Grant funding. 
   Mr. Speaker, the challenge of affordable education affects not just the poor, but the middle class as well. Parents and students alike have been frustrated by the lack of action by the previous congressional leadership. I love when I hear my colleague from Washington say we all share the goal of helping struggling students be able to afford a college education. Well, students don't need our sympathy. They don't want us to feel their pain. They want us to do something. And for years they haven't done anything. Well, today we are going to do something. 
   Times have changed. And today we will pass a bill that will make higher education a reality for countless students and contribute greatly to a brighter economic future. We will not be able to compete in a global economy unless we have a well-educated workforce, and we need to invest in our students, and this bill does it. 
   I urge bipartisan support for the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (PRESIDENT BUSH MUST END HIS WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, tonight we will once again listen to President Bush as he describes yet another strategy for the war in Iraq. By all accounts from the media, the President will tell the Nation that he intends to send more U.S. troops to fight and die in Iraq. 
   This is not ``stay the course,'' Mr. Speaker, this is escalation. 
   And at a bare minimum, Congress must find the wisdom and the courage to require and vote upon specific new authorization to escalate the number of troops in Iraq. 
   This is what Senator Kennedy called for yesterday. He has introduced legislation that prohibits any Federal funds from being used to increase the number of U.S. forces in Iraq without a specific authorization of Congress by law for such an increase. 
   It is the very minimum we can do, Mr. Speaker, for Congress to finally take some responsibility for this war and exercise some accountability. 
   What do you do, Mr. Speaker, when a President fails to listen to the military advice of his generals? When he consistently changes generals when their experience and best counsel does not match his own preconceived ideas? 
   What do you do, Mr. Speaker, when a President ignores the recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group? 
   What do you do when a President, whose idea of a exit strategy is to kick the ball down field, is determined to dump this mess on whoever will be the next President of the United States? 
   Mr. Speaker, this President lost the mid-term elections. He lost because the American people voted against the war, and they want a new direction. This is George Bush's war, and he should end it on his watch. If he is not going to listen to his own generals, the counsel of the Iraq Study Group or the American people, then Congress must confront him and begin to deny him the means and the ability to carry out the next disastrous step of his policy.     
   It is my view that too many in Washington are consumed with saving face,  rather than saving lives. Political expediency, political cover and political posturing must not be the guiding principles on how we proceed in Iraq. Instead, we must be focused on the men and women we put in harm's way. 
   And everyone in this Chamber should be haunted by the fact that Congress has acquiesced too many times in one of the worst foreign policy blunders in United States history. Over 3,000 American military personnel have been killed in this war. Are we going to stand here next January and talk about the 4,000 or 5,000 who will have died? Well over 22,000 American troops have been wounded, some injured for life, and over tens of thousands of Iraqi men, women and children are dead. 
   It is long past time for this Congress to accept responsibility for having given this President a blank check and a free pass for nearly 4 years. 
   It is simply false to argue that placing any restrictions on funding for this disastrous war somehow shortchanges our troops. Redeployment from Iraq does not shortchange our troops. Bringing them home to their families does not shortchange our troops. 
   I will tell you what shortchanges our troops. Making them serve two, three or possibly even four tours of duty in Iraq, that shortchanges our troops. Failing to provide the veterans of this war with health care, that shortchanges our troops. Increasing by more than five times the backlog on veterans' disability claims so that those injured in Iraq and those suffering from PTSD don't get the help they need when they return home, that shortchanges our troops, Mr. Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is no military victory to be had in Iraq. It is time George Bush ended his war and brought our uniformed men and women home. To do that, we must change the dynamic in Iraq. We must end our occupation, let the Iraqi people determine their own destiny and engage the countries of the region and the international community while we withdraw. 
   We can start by voting not to escalate this war, even if that means conditioning or withholding funds. I, for one, Mr. Speaker, will not vote for any so-called emergency supplemental appropriations bill that escalates the war in Iraq, that fails to offer a clear plan for when our troops will be coming home. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people get it. They are far ahead of the politicians in Washington. They want leadership. They want us to do what is right. They want us to end the war.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, after a decade of inaction by the Republican majority, we stand to vote today on one of the most critical issues facing working Americans. 
   For years, the chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, Mr. MILLER, led our efforts to bring the minimum wage more in line with this country's growing cost of living. We pushed for a clean, up or down vote. But instead, as the 109th Congress winded down, we were presented with a muddled package of bills, and once again, the will of the American people was pushed aside to accommodate corporate interests. 
   So, I must commend Speaker PELOSI and Majority Leader HOYER for including this minimum wage increase in our first 100 hour commitment to working Americans. For the 6.5 million minimum wage earners throughout the country, this bill amounts to an additional $4,400 each year. That alone would cover: 15 months of groceries; over two years of health care; and two and a half years of college tuition at a public, 2 year college. 
   Ultimately, up to 13 million low-wage workers will be helped by this increase. 
   Right now the average CEO of a Fortune 500 Company earns $10,712 in 1 hour and 16 minutes. It takes the average minimum wage worker 52 40-hour weeks--an entire year to earn the same $10,712. That's wrong, and we're going to fix it. 
   And, let's be clear, there is no evidence to support the Republican claim that an increase in minimum wage leads to job loss. For proof, we only need to look at the twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia that have set minimum wages that are higher than the federal minimum wage. In fact, a May 2006 study released by the Center for American Progress and Policy Matters found that employment in small businesses grew more than 9.4% in states with higher minimum wage; and inflation-adjusted business payroll growth was over 5% stronger in high minimum wage states. A 1998 study by the Economic Policy Institute found that unemployment and poverty rates actually dropped after the last increase in the federal minimum wage in 1997. 
   Working Americans are the backbone of our nation, and this increase is long overdue. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. MCGOVERN. (COLLEGE STUDENT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5, the College Student Relief Act of 2007. Currently, Massachusetts has about 99,000 undergraduate students attending 4-year colleges and universities who receive federal need-based college loans--or Stafford Loans. 
   In my own district, the 3rd Congressional District of Massachusetts, at Worcester State College, a 4-year public college, more than 1,300 students have Stafford Loans; and at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, a 4-year private college, more than 1,700 students have Stafford Loans. 
   In Massachusetts, the average Stafford Loan Debt is about $14,000 ($13,994). 
   Even though, under H.R. 5, the full reduction to the interest rate takes five years to achieve--because Democrats believe in making sure their proposals are fully paid for--Massachusetts students starting college in 2007 will benefit immediately from these changes to the interest rates. The savings for the average student in Massachusetts receiving a Stafford Loan who starts school in 2007 will be $2,310. That translates into $1,760 for that student at Worcester State College and $2,750 for the student at WPI. 
   And for the students who start school in 2011, when the interest rate reduction is fully phased in, their savings will increase to $4,470. Or once again, about $3,420 for the student at Worcester State College, and about $5,330 for the student at WPI. 
   These figures have real meaning to low- and middle-income students and their families. They are targeted at families whose annual income is less than $70,000. These are the families and individuals who most need our support to achieve the dream of a college education. According to the Congressional Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance, financial barriers will prevent at least 4.4 million high school graduates from attending 4-year public colleges over the next decade--and another 2 million high school graduates from attending any college at all. 
   These reductions won't cost the U.S. taxpayer a single dime. 
   They will barely cause a ripple in the profitability of banks and lenders currently doing business with the federal government in managing Stafford Loans--no matter how much complaining and moaning we're likely to hear from them. 
   And let me emphasize one other point--I agree with my friends on the other side of the aisle that there are many reasons why a higher education is increasingly out of reach for many American families: The failure over the past several years to increase the maximum Pell Grant level, the stagnation of funding for campus-based aid programs, and the soaring costs of college tuition, fees, room and board--to name just a few. As my colleagues know, I have been a particular champion of significant increases both to the Pell Grant maximum level and overall funding of the program. 
   It's my understanding that the gentleman from California, Chairman GEORGE MILLER, will begin hearings on these and other issues related to the affordability of a college education. Working through the Education and the Workforce Committee, legislation will be drafted and marked up through regular Committee process, reported out, and hopefully be scheduled on the House legislative calendar in the 110th Congress. So these profound issues that concern Republicans and Democrats alike will proceed through regular order with the full participation of the Minority.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Let me begin by thanking Chairman Skelton for his generosity and his support of this amendment. I also want to thank Defense Appropriations Chair Murtha for supporting this amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, this amendment is quite simple. For over 40 years, the names of graduates and instructors at the former U.S. Army School of the Americas, and now the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, were available to the public. All that was required was a phone call or a letter to school officials or to file a Freedom of Information Act request, and the names were provided. Suddenly, in August 2006, the names were classified. The only reason cited by the Defense Department for denying the names was that the list includes personal information. 
   But nothing about the request had changed. No one had asked for new information, and certainly none of a personal nature. So for the past 2 years, the names of graduates and instructors at the WHINSEC have remained secret. Well, almost secret. Names constantly pop up in WHINSEC PR material like this with the nice color pictures and names underneath them, but the public is still denied access. There doesn't seem to be a security concern when it comes to press releases. 
   It is difficult, Madam Chairman, to understand the national security or privacy concerns raised by some when this information has been available for so many years. The WHINSEC and Defense Department have never, ever cited personal security or national security as the reason for denying the names. In over four decades of public access, not once has there ever been a whisper that military officers attending WHINSEC were targets. And these were turbulent years, with coups in the southern cones, civil wars in Central America, and insurgencies, drug lords, and armed groups in the Andes, especially in Colombia and Peru. Not a hint that attending the school was dangerous. 
   The WHINSEC is supposed to be a model for transparency, accountability, and respect for civil society, including human rights groups and critics. What signal does the school send to its Latin American counterparts about our democratic values when it denies NGOs access to information that has been available for decades? I urge my colleagues to vote to restore public access this information. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Madam Chairman, look at these lists: all blacked out. Does this look like transparency? Is this what we mean by transparency? Is this democracy at work? Is this the model that we want Latin American militaries to copy? Is this what we stand for? 
   The names were public for decades, decades, until August of 2006, and the world all of a sudden didn't just become dangerous, the world has been dangerous, especially in Latin America, for decades. 
   Openness was the norm, not secrecy. Now, all of a sudden, everything is secret. Why? Because there is some who don't want accountability. There are some who don't want the sunshine in on those who attend this school. 
   There are no new threats to justifying denying these names. When I visited the school a few months back, no one, nobody came forward and said to me, Please do not make the names public because it will threaten somebody. Or nobody said that the reason why all of a sudden the names became classified was because of an increase in threats. That is just not the case. That's just an excuse. 
   The bottom line is that there are no new threats to justify denying these names to the public. We need to restore public access. This is the right thing to do. Transparency is a good thing for this Congress to support. 
   Support the McGovern amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4156, ORDERLY AND RESPONSIBLE IRAQ REDEPLOYMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 818 provides for consideration of H.R. 4156, the Orderly and Responsible Iraq Redeployment Appropriations Act of 2008. The rule provides 2 hours of debate and provides for one motion to recommit. 
   Mr. Speaker, the war in Iraq has gone on for nearly 5 years. Thousands of our brave men and women have lost their lives. Many more thousands have returned home with injuries so severe that they will require a lifetime of medical treatments. 
   We have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on the war, virtually none of it paid for, almost all of it on our national credit card. That means that the bill will be paid for not by us, but by our kids and our grandkids. 
   The war has diminished our standing in the world. It has distracted us from the war in Afghanistan, the very place where those responsible for 9/11 are now regrouping. And it has put incredible strain on the readiness of our Armed Forces. 
   The President of the United States and many of my Republican friends have argued fiercely over the years for a blank check. They want no strings, no conditions, no benchmarks, no end dates, no accountability, no nothing. 
   Today, they will tell us that the President's strategy is working; that the recent decrease in deaths and casualties in certain areas of Iraq prove it, and, therefore, we should provide yet another blank check. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me caution my friends about declaring ``mission accomplished'' yet again. While all of us pray that the violence continues to subside, we should also appreciate history enough to know that lulls in intense violence are not always permanent. Let me also state that the current levels of violence in Iraq are still unacceptably high. 
   As Joe Christoff of the Government Accountability Office recently testified, this recent reduction in violence should be put into the proper context as it coincides with increased sectarian cleansing and a massive refugee displacement. Let me quote: 
   ``You know, we look at the attack data going down, but it's not taking into consideration that there might be fewer attacks because you have ethnically cleansed neighborhoods, particularly in the Baghdad area. It's produced 2.2 million refugees that have left, and it's produced 2 million internally displaced persons within the country as well.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, we must remember that the justification for the surge and the justification for the Bush military strategy in Iraq has always been to foster Iraqi political reconciliation. And there is precious little evidence of any such thing. 
   Over 10 months ago, President Bush said, ``A successful strategy for Iraq goes beyond military operations. Ordinary Iraqi citizens must see that military operations are accompanied by visible improvements in their neighborhoods and communities. So America will hold the Iraqi Government to the benchmarks it has announced.'' 
   But, Mr. Speaker, as the GAO reported last month, ``Iraq has not yet advanced key legislation on equitably sharing oil revenues and holding provincial elections. In addition, sectarian influences within Iraqi ministries continue while militia influences divide the loyalties of Iraqi security forces.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, the Maliki government continues to be corrupt, inept and without the support of the vast majority of the Iraqi people. When will the Bush administration live up to its word and hold the Iraqi Government accountable for its actions, or inaction? 
   The fundamental crisis facing Iraq remains the same: the inability of Sunni, Shiites and Kurds to agree to set aside their sectarian divisions and live in peace. As long as we remain there indefinitely, Mr. Speaker, there is no incentive for anything to change. 
   Mr. Speaker, our soldiers have already given so much to create an opportunity for the Iraqi Government, an opportunity that that government has squandered. So, today, we are saying we want a different course. We reject the President's vision of an endless war that will cost more lives and bankrupt our Nation. 
   Today, we will vote on a bill that requires the redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq to begin within 30 days of enactment, with a target for completion of December 15, 2008. It would prohibit the deployment of U.S. troops to Iraq who are not fully trained and equipped. And it changes the mission of our forces. 
   It also extends to all government agencies and personnel the limitations in the Army Field Manual on permissible interrogation techniques, which means that torture will be absolutely banned, and anyone who engages in such practices will be committing a crime under U.S. law, no ands, ifs or buts. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is no longer acceptable for Congress to simply write yet another blank check. It is not acceptable for the President to simply run out the clock and hand this problem off to his successor. 
   This is a war that George Bush started, and this is a war that he needs to end. For the sake of our troops, for the sake of our country, we need to support this legislation. Enough is enough. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me go back to the subject that we are debating here today, and that is the war in Iraq. Mr. Speaker, we have been fighting this war for nearly 5 years. That's longer than we fought World War II. My friends on the other side of the aisle have said over and over and over, just give the Iraqi Government a chance. Well, Mr. Speaker, after 5 years, I say, give me a break. 
   It is not us, not any of us in this Chamber who are in harm's way. But we have sent thousands and thousands and thousands of our fellow citizens to battle in Iraq. They are in harm's way. They wake up tomorrow in a situation where they are refereeing a civil war, and that, Mr. Speaker, in my opinion, is wrong. 
   My friends on the other side of the aisle talk about al Qaeda. Well, we're all worried about al Qaeda, too. That's why we wish we were doing the job in Afghanistan better. That's why we wish we weren't so diverted from that mission in Iraq that we could actually have better results in Afghanistan than we're having right now. We are worried, Mr. Speaker, about the fact that al Qaeda is regrouping in Afghanistan, is regrouping in Pakistan. That should be a worry to every single Member in this Chamber. And yet we are stretched so thin, we are so preoccupied in Iraq that we have lost sight of what our central mission needs to be. 
   Mr. Speaker, victory is what is in the best interest of the American people. And this war in Iraq has not only diminished our standing in the world, it has spread our troops so thin that we can't complete missions like the one that we need to be completing in Afghanistan. 
   Mr. Speaker, too often in this place we talk about numbers instead of the people behind those numbers. Yesterday, as I mentioned earlier, another three American soldiers lost their lives in Iraq, bringing the total to 3,858. Also yesterday, Mr. Speaker, CBS News reported that there is an epidemic of suicide among our soldiers and our veterans. Thousands and thousands of these men and women have taken their own lives. For too many, the war does not end when they return home. And behind each one of those numbers is a devastated family, a heartbroken father, a new widow, a child without a father. Mr. Speaker, we will be paying for this war for a very long, long time. 
   Now, my friends on the other side of the aisle say we all want the war to end, we all want our troops to come home. Well, I say to my friends, here is your chance. You have a voice. Use it. You have a vote. Use it. You have the opportunity to change the direction of this policy. You have the opportunity to force the Iraqi Government to live up to its promises. You have the opportunity to finally, finally, honor the will of the American people and to safely redeploy our troops. I ask my friends to seize that opportunity and to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, it may seem like the November elections took place ages ago, but the sentiments that created new majorities in the House and Senate are still strong. 
   The American people spoke loud and clear on November 7. Together, Republicans and Democrats and independents from across this great Nation voted for change. They voted to end the cycle of corruption, pay to play, and junkets. 
   Today, Mr. Speaker, the new Democratic majority is fulfilling the pledge we made to the voters. We are going to clean up Washington, D.C. We are going to give the people their House back. 
   Two years ago my friends on the other side of the aisle brought forward a rules package that, in my opinion, did not go nearly far enough in upholding the highest ethical standards. Today we offer a package that is based on real change. Members of Congress are elected to serve the American people, not their own individual private interests. And I am proud to say that today, this House of Representatives will enact a reform package that ends the culture of corruption once and for all. The days of the K Street project are over. No longer will Members of this House be able to dictate to any private entity the hiring or firing of anyone based on their political affiliation. 
   This rules package prohibits Members of Congress from traveling on corporate jets. My constituents in Massachusetts don't have the opportunity to get cheap travel on corporate jets and neither should Members of Congress.     
   Mr. Speaker, this rules package also changes the way Members of Congress and staff can travel for official business. I strongly believe that overseas trips and other travel can be important tools to helping Members of Congress understand complex domestic and international issues. 
   But the days of lobbyist-sponsored golf junkets will be relics of the past. The actions this package takes are simple and straightforward: no more junkets, no more gifts from lobbyists, no more travel on corporate jets. 
   This rules package is comprehensive, and it is historic. We are going to change the way this place is run, and we are going to change the way people look at the Congress. The American people don't want to pick up their morning newspapers and read about golf junkets to St. Andrews. They don't want to hear stories about how their Congressman or Congresswoman was wined and dined with $100 steak dinners. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is not complicated. These are commonsense items that should have been dealt with years ago. The time has come to do what is right, to hold Members of this House to the highest ethical standards. 
   With the election of NANCY PELOSI as Speaker of the House, the first woman Speaker in the history of the United States, Democrats are ushering in a new era and putting an end to the culture of corruption. We are changing the tone in Washington, and we are changing the way we conduct business. 
   Now, I know full well that the ethical problems of the past were not limited to one side of the aisle, and the solutions to those problems can and should come from both Democrats and Republicans. I know that many of my Republican friends agree that change is needed, and they wish that their leadership in the past would have moved forward on some of these changes. I look forward to working closely with them in the weeks and the months ahead. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people demand, and they deserve, a higher standard of conduct from their elected officials. Today, we are raising the bar for how Members of the 110th Congress will carry out their duties and do their jobs. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

I have got to say to the gentleman that we include a little bit more than just banning lobbyists from the locker rooms. They are banned  from the locker rooms in this bill, but there is a heck of a lot more.

   Mr. McGOVERN. I am in the middle of my statement. I would also say to the gentleman that his party has been in control for 12 years, and there has been ample opportunity to change the status quo. The gentleman's party not only embraced the status quo, but we saw a proliferation of the culture of corruption, and that is what this is a response to. In answer to the gentleman's question as to this March 1 deadline, that is to give the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct ample time to put the rules and regulations and the disclosure requirements into place so that this can be an effective change. 
   So this is real historic change. We are going to end the culture of corruption in this Congress today. I am glad that the gentleman has said that he is going to support it. I hope that this is a bipartisan vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes, for the purpose of debate, to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Space).

   Let me just educate the gentleman that the change that he is asking for requires a statutory change. Today we are dealing with the House rules. I will assure the gentleman and his constituents in Nebraska and people all over the United States who agree with him that we will have the opportunity to do that. We will go through House Administration and you will have the opportunity to do that. We will hopefully have a unanimous vote on that.     
   I am also happy to hear the gentleman and others on the other side of the aisle all of a sudden speak in favor of ethics reform and real change and ending the culture of corruption in this House. It is amazing what an election will do. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Sutton), a new member of the Rules Committee.

Mr. Speaker, let me just respond to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kirk) by saying I know I am from Massachusetts, and you may think I have a funny accent and you have trouble understanding me. But let me repeat what I said before. In order to make the changes on the pension issue that he is asking for, which we all support, it requires a statutory change. And I think the staff over there will help clarify that. We are all for that. 
   In H.R. 4011, which Ms. Pelosi supported that you mentioned was a statute. We are going to do that. 
   Let me just say one other thing to the gentleman. You keep on referring to your ethics reform package as if it was some kind of this monumental change and reform. 
   You didn't ban the K Street Project, which has really resulted in so much outrage across the country. You had a temporary suspension on the issue of travel, and you had no ban on lobbyists' gifts. 
   This is real reform. We are going to end the culture of corruption. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield for the purpose of debate only 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Gillibrand).

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Let me just say, respond to my good friend from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey), who I am going to miss on the Rules Committee, if he thinks that the Republican reform package was meaningful reform, I will lend you my bifocals so you can read it more carefully. What ended up happening, what you ended up enacting essentially, after 12 years in the majority, was banning lobbyists from the locker room. That is all that became law. 
   You controlled the House of Representatives. You controlled the Congress. And you controlled the United States Senate, and that is basically all that you did. 
   So I would just say to the gentleman, if he wants to vote ``no'' on this, he can go right ahead and vote ``no'' on it. But that is defending the status quo. 
   I think the American people made it very clear during the last election that they are sick of the culture of corruption; that they want a ban on lobbyists' gifts; that they want an end to the K Street Project. They want a ban on Members using corporate jets to fly around the country. And so if you want to vote for the status quo, vote ``no'' on this. If you want to vote for real meaningful change, vote ``yes.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Hodes).

   Let me also, Mr. Speaker, correct the record. The distinguished former chairman of the Rules Committee said none of this ethics reform takes place for 4 months. That is true on the travel, and I clarified that earlier as to why that is the case, so we had time to implement the rules and regulations of disclosure. But everything else, I will assure him, takes place immediately. 
   So once this ethics package passes, I would urge my colleague from California not to go out to dinner with any of his lobbyist friends because he might be breaking the law.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to say to my colleague from California (Mr. Dreier) that I appreciate his words of cooperation and bipartisanship, and I do hope, and it is my belief, that you will see a change in terms of more outreach across the aisle and more respect, quite frankly, for the opinions of every single Member of this House. 
   I agree this is a historic day. This is not only a historic day because we have elected the first woman Speaker of the House in the history of the United States of America, but this is also a historic day for what we are about to vote on. We are about to change the way we do business here in Washington. We are responding to what the American people made very clear on election day, that they are tired of the ethical lapses of their leaders in government; that they want an end to the culture of corruption; that they want a government that has high ethical standards; that they want Members of Congress to adhere to those high ethical standards and, if they do not, that they will be held accountable. So what we are doing today in this ethics package, I think, is also an important moment in our history. 
   What we are doing is we are doing what is right. We are holding the Members of this House to the very highest ethical standards. And I want to say to my colleague from Arizona (Mr. Shadegg) that I agree with him on the pension issue. So do, I think, everybody on our side of the aisle. And we are going to address that and we are going to hopefully get a unanimous vote on that issue, because he is right on that issue. But, again, we are not dealing with that. That requires a statutory change, and today we are dealing with the House rules. 
   Mr. Speaker, what we are doing here today, I will remind my colleagues again, is very important. We are ending gifts by lobbyists to Members of Congress, we are banning the use of corporate jets for Members of Congress for a minimal price so that they can take a corporate jet and fly anywhere in this country. No one else can do that, yet that has been a practice by too many Members in this Congress. That will be banned. 
   We will end the lobbyist-sponsored golf junkets. They will be relics of the past. This is a new day. This is a day where ethics and where integrity are going to hold a very, very high place. We are going to end the culture of corruption with this vote, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' on that.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (TOM LANTOS HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION ESTABLISHMENT RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding and for his generous words. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to express my appreciation to the many Members and staff who worked on the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission Establishment Act. It was truly a collaborative, bipartisan effort, and a genuine desire to pay tribute to the work and legacy of our former colleague, Tom Lantos. 
   I want to thank Chairman HOWARD BERMAN and Ranking Member ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN for all of the support and guidance they have provided. They, and their incredible staffs, were true partners in crafting this resolution. I especially want to thank my colleague from Virginia, my fellow cochair of the Human Rights Caucus, FRANK WOLF, for welcoming me as his new partner and for his leadership in shaping this resolution. 
   I also want to thank his staff, Molly Miller, Elizabeth Hoffman, and Elyse Anderson, who contributed so much time and careful attention to the resolution before us today. 
   I also want to thank my staff, Cindy Buhl and Keith Stern, who have done magnificent work in making this resolution a reality. 
   Madam Speaker, I can't think of a more fitting tribute to Congressman Tom Lantos than institutionalizing human rights work by Members of this House. This commission will be a living, breathing legacy to the vision and inspiration of Tom Lantos. It reminds us that protecting and promoting human rights is not just the right thing to do, but it has the capacity of transforming us, of making us better people, better Members of Congress, and better citizens of the world. That's what helping to save lives around the world can do to you. That is what giving voice to the voiceless can do to you. That is what standing up for something, standing for the universal declaration of human rights can do to you. 
   The Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission will promote and protect human rights, whether that is the freedom to worship as you choose, run a newspaper or be a journalist without interference, organize a union, expect fair and equal justice before the courts, or receive fair treatment regardless of your gender, race, or your sexual orientation or your racial or ethnic heritage. And most importantly, it is the right to live your life, raise your family, and carry out your daily activities without the constant threat of being killed, jailed or disappearing. 
   When Speaker Pelosi appointed me to be just the second Democratic cochair in the history of the Human Rights Caucus, I couldn't quite grasp what it would mean to try to follow in the footsteps of Tom Lantos. Then Annette Lantos gave me a call, and Kathryn Cameron Porter came in to visit me, and they gave me their support and their blessing. We talked about how to strengthen the structure and permanence of the caucus, how to encourage and support other Members, especially new Members of Congress to become active on human rights issues so the United States will continue to be recognized throughout the world as a leader in the defense of human rights. 
   It was in this spirit that the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission Establishment Act gradually took form and came into being. 
   Madam Speaker, there is one other person I would like to recognize and thank for all his knowledge and insights in the many discussions and process of establishing this commission, and that is Hans Hogrefe. Hans handles the human rights portfolio for the Foreign Affairs Committee, and he also staffs the Congressional Human Rights Caucus. I cannot think of anyone else on the Hill who has his institutional memory on human rights legislation and the many human rights issues that Members have worked on over the past 25 years. He is a human rights encyclopedia, and I want to thank him for his dedication to the cause of human rights. 
   Madam Speaker, I believe establishing the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission will allow Members of Congress to take human rights work to a new level, and it will better serve and support the Members of this House as they take up human rights issues. 
   As I have often said, it is my strong belief that if the United States is going to stand for anything, it needs to stand out loud and foursquare for human rights. I look forward to working with FRANK WOLF and taking on this task, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution and join us in our work.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1591, U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by saying that this is a difficult day for me. 
   I voted against this war from the very beginning when this vote was not politically popular. I was an original member of the Out of Iraq Caucus. 
   As far back as 2005 I introduced legislation to end funding for the war, which I believe has been one of the worst political, military, diplomatic and moral blunders in our Nation's history. 
   My bill calls for the immediate, safe and orderly withdrawal of all of our troops from Iraq, and I urge my colleagues to join me in that legislation. 
   I want this war to come to an end today. Unfortunately, and to my deep disappointment, not enough of my colleagues, Democrat or Republican, believe as I do. 
   I have come to the conclusion that defeating the supplemental bill before us today would send a message to George Bush and Dick Cheney that they will continue to have a free pass  from this Congress to do whatever the hell they want to do. 
   The Bush administration, with their ``Mission Accomplished'' banners and their shifting rationales, must be held to account. We simply cannot trust them any longer. I lost my trust in this administration a long, long time ago. 
   I fear that defeating this bill would result in more of the same, more deceit and empty promises, more ignored benchmarks and missed deadlines, more American casualties, more debt passed on to our children and our grandchildren, more harm to our reputation around the world, and more war. 
   I cannot do that. I will not do that. So I will vote ``yes.'' 
   This is not the bill that I want. This is not the bill that I would have written. But it is the bill that the Appropriations Committee has presented to us today, and it is a bill that reflects the hard reality that this is the toughest measure that we can get passed and get 218 votes for. 
   For the first time, we can mandate real and meaningful deadlines that clearly reflect the disgust so many of us have with how this war has been conducted. 
   This bill also provides $1.7 billion to address the health care needs of our veterans, particularly those suffering from traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. Too many of our veterans can't even get diagnosed, let alone treated. That is wrong, and this bill begins to fix it. 
   Quite frankly, I have concluded that this bill is the best that we can do, for now. I say that very deliberately, ``for now,'' because those of us who oppose this war will continue our efforts to end it. I want all of our troops out of Iraq and back home with their families where they belong. 
   I will propose much stronger language and, indeed, continue to press for the immediate withdrawal of all of our troops in the defense bills that are coming in the weeks ahead. 
   My old boss, Joe Moakley, stares at me from his portrait every day in the Rules Committee. He used to say that if the Democratic Party were in Europe, we would be 16 different parties. 
   So I want to just take a moment to commend the leadership of Dave Obey and Jack Murtha and Steny Hoyer, Jim Clyburn and Rahm Emanuel for all of their hard work these past few weeks. They have anguished over this issue, as all of us have. 
   And I especially want to commend our Speaker, Nancy Pelosi. She has been a forceful and effective opponent of this war from the very beginning, and I know she will continue to do all that she can to bring all of us, Republicans and Democrats, together to finally bring this terrible war to an end. 
   I am grateful to my colleagues in the Out of Iraq Caucus for their continued and forceful leadership. And I also want to thank all of the national and grass-roots activists and organizations who have done so much to oppose this war. I truly believe that the American people are way ahead of the politicians in Washington on this issue, and it is my hope that some day soon Congress and the White House will catch up.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H. CON. RES. 312, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1036 provides for consideration of House Concurrent Resolution 312, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for FY 2009, under a structured rule. 
   The rule provides a total of 4 hours of general debate, 3 hours to be controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Budget and 1 hour on the subject of economic goals and policies to be controlled by Representative Maloney of New York and Representative Saxton of New Jersey. 
   The rule makes in order the three substitute amendments: one by Representative Kilpatrick of Michigan; one by Representative Lee of California; and a final substitute by Representative Ryan of Wisconsin. Each amendment is debatable for 60 minutes. The rule also permits the chairman of the Budget Committee to offer amendments in the House to achieve mathematical consistency. Finally, the rule provides that the concurrent resolution shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question of its adoption. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is the traditional rule for consideration of the budget resolution, and I welcome today's debate on the alternative budgets that will be presented by the Republican leadership, the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Progressive Caucus. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by expressing my thanks and appreciation to Budget Committee Chairman Spratt and Ranking Member Ryan for their leadership and hard work on the House Budget Committee. Although they hold very different points of view, the committee always operates in a cordial and collegial manner. I have served on the Budget Committee for 2 years, and it has been a privilege to learn from two such distinguished Members how to work in a bipartisan way despite sharp philosophical differences. And all of us are supported, Mr. Speaker, by a superb and dedicated committee staff. 
   Mr. Speaker, budgets are moral documents. They reflect our priorities. And for too long, this Congress passed budgets with the wrong priorities. For too long, our budgets put the desires of the powerful before the needs of the poor. For too long, our budgets pretended that people who were struggling didn't even exist, let alone matter. That has begun to change. The Democratic budget before us today is a budget with a conscience. 
   Today, we continue the new direction set last year to bring the Federal budget back to fiscal health and responsibility. As we begin this debate, our country faces major challenges: a looming recession, a crisis in the credit markets, a plunging housing market, rising unemployment, declining family income, skyrocketing costs in health care, aging infrastructure, and a safety net struggling to keep up with the growing number of Americans unable to meet their basic needs. 
   Faced with these challenges, President Bush proposed the same tired, worn-out, failed fiscal and economic policies. After 7 years, the Bush legacy is the highest deficits in our Nation's history. Let us remember, Mr. Speaker, when President Bush took office, when the Republicans had total control over the White House, the Senate and this House, they were welcomed with a $5.6 trillion projected 10-year budget surplus, the financial gift of the last Democrat to sit in the White House. That has been completely squandered, resulting in the largest fiscal deterioration in American history. And the President's FY 2009 budget proposed only more of the same. 
   The national debt exploded under President Bush and his Republican rubber-stamp Congress. At the end of 2008, CBO projects a $9.6 trillion debt, an increase of nearly $4 trillion, brought to you courtesy of George Bush. Future generations, our children and our grandchildren, will be forced to pay the price for this unprecedented rise in debt thanks to the Republicans' fiscally reckless and irresponsible policies. 
   And to top it off, the President's budget continues the Bush legacy of deep cuts in many of the most important programs and services for the American people: 
   $500 billion in cuts to Medicare. 
   $100 billion in cuts to Medicaid, which serves the poorest Americans, including families with children. 
   The elimination of the Community Services Block Grant and the Social Services Block Grant, and deep cuts in the Community Development Block Grant, which provides nearly every city and town in America with Federal support for basic services. 
   Elimination of the Community Oriented Policing grants, the COPS grants, and deep cuts for State and local law enforcement at a time when States and local communities are finding it hard to meet the needs of their first responders. 
   And deep cuts in many other vital programs that provide health care, infrastructure, environmental protection, and other services to our States and to our neighborhoods. 
   Let me give but one example, Mr. Speaker, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP. 
   Last week, the worst snow storm in a century hit the people of Ohio and the Midwest. Two weeks ago, the people of central Massachusetts were facing over three feet of snow. Across the country, people are suffering in the cold. Home heating costs have gone up by 80 percent under George Bush. A barrel of oil now costs $108. But President Bush decided to cut $570 million out of the LIHEAP program. The President decided to turn off the heat for 1.2 million households, forcing families to choose either to heat or to eat. And why? So we could continue tax cuts for the wealthiest, most fortunate billionaires in America. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Democratic budget rejects the President's priorities. It rejects the callous view of the Republican Party that tens of millions of American families are expendable, that our communities can manage without basic services, that our roads, bridges and water systems should be allowed to crumble and fail, and that we can run up America's credit card without costs or consequences. 
   Instead, the Democratic budget restores fiscal responsibility to the Federal budget, returning it to balance in the year 2012. It rejects the President's harmful cuts to basic services, and invests in proven programs that boost economic growth, create jobs, and make America safer. 
   The Democratic budget helps families struggling to make ends meet in this economic downturn, and provides fiscally responsible tax relief to millions and millions of households. 
   Finally, the Democratic budget remembers those who serve at home and abroad. It provides strong and substantial funding for national defense, including quality of life for our troops and our families. 
   It provides more funding for homeland security programs, including first responders, than the President would. And finally, it takes care of our veterans and rejects President Bush's cynical new fees for veterans health care.  Instead, the Democratic budget increases health care funding for our veterans well above current services, enough to allow the VA to treat 5.8 million patients in 2009, including over 333,000 Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans. 
   Mr. Speaker, the underlying legislation, House Concurrent Resolution 312, the fiscal year 2009 budget resolution, is a budget all Americans who believe in fiscal responsibility and the common good can support. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The gentleman asked the right question: What are American families facing? What are American families facing after 7 years of Bush budgets and Republican budgets? What they're facing are challenges like never before. 
   According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the real income of a typical family has fallen by almost $1,000 since George Bush became President. The Democratic budget provides funds to keep up with rising food, housing, and heating and transportation costs. 
   In the area of education, the Democratic budget provides $7.1 billion more for education and job training than the Bush budget. It increases funding for Head Start, special education, No Child Left Behind, and title I. Under George Bush, only four out of 10 children eligible for Head Start received services. The Democratic budget increases funding for Head Start so that more children will enter school ready to learn. 
   And, again, let me repeat, Mr. Speaker. The Hamilton Project of the Brookings Institution, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and the Concord Coalition have all sent Members of Congress letters stating emphatically that the Democratic budget does not increase taxes. 
   Let me say one thing the Democratic budget does do, and that is it relieves the burden of debt that has been thrust upon our kids and our grandkids. The Republicans, during these last several years, have increased the debt to historic highs, and in doing so, they have created a debt tax on our kids and our grandkids. We want to remove that tax burden from future generations. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia, a member of the Budget Committee (Mr. Scott).

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me say to my colleagues that security also means the economic well-being of our citizens. And because of Republican priorities over the last 7 years, record numbers of our citizens are struggling like never before. The very rich have done very well. And the rest have not. Those are the facts. 
   The Democratic budget that has been put forward restores fiscal responsibility. It rejects the President's harmful cuts in programs like Medicare and Medicaid. It rejects the President's proposal to impose new fees for our veterans and our military retirees. It strengthens our economy. It invests more in innovation. It invests more in energy, renewable and clean energy. It invests more in education and in our infrastructure. It also provides tax relief to help struggling families. It accommodates the tax relief from the alternative minimum tax for more than 20 million households, as well as middle income tax cuts and other tax relief so long as they comply with the pay-as-you-go rule. 
   It invests more in children's health. It provides more funding for safety net programs. Record numbers of our citizens are literally falling through the cracks in our country. It invests in defense, in veterans, and in homeland security. 
   The facts are, Mr. Speaker, that for years we have been forced to accept the priorities of George Bush and his Republican colleagues who have controlled the Congress. That is now changing. For nearly 7 years, we have watched as they have accumulated huge debt, historical debt. We have watched as they have chipped away at some of the most important programs that help some of the most desperate people in our country. The American people have had enough. That is what the last election was about. They have had their chance. They have shown us their priorities. And the American people have rejected them. It is now time to create a budget that has a conscience that responds to the needs of the struggling middle class in this country. The Democratic budget that will be offered today will do that and change the course of this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3159, ENSURING MILITARY READINESS THROUGH STABILITY AND PREDICTABILITY DEPLOYMENT POLICY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. I thank the distinguished chairwoman of the Rules Committee for yielding me the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3159 is a very straightforward bill with a very straightforward message. Like its name implies, this is a bill to ensure that our military is ready to carry out combat and combat-related missions by having a stable, predictable deployment policy. 
   H.R. 3159 would require that our uniformed men and women, our military units, receive minimum periods of rest and recuperation between their deployments to Iraq. We have been hearing for over a year now about the strain on our active duty, Reserve and Guard units caused by multiple redeployments to Iraq and the ever-shrinking time at home provided by many units between deployments. 
   So why did this legislation work its way through the Armed Services Committee at this time? There is a very simple reason, Mr. Speaker, why this bill is so timely now. On May 9, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates announced a change to deployment policy. Secretary Gates changed the current policy for active Army units from 1 year at home for 1 year deployed to a policy of 15 months deployed for every 12 months at home. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a change that is moving in the wrong direction. Rather than taking care of our troops, this change increases the stress and strain on our servicemen and servicewomen. This change has raised serious concerns about the sustainability and readiness of our active duty Army and whether such a reduced period at their home bases allows sufficient time for units and individuals to adequately train, equip, recover and reconstitute for the next deployment. 
   If anyone in this Chamber is not concerned about the physical, mental, emotional and logistical strain placed on every combat unit and individual subject to multiple deployments to Iraq, then I hope they will stand up during this debate.     
   We hear a lot of talk in this House about ``supporting the troops.'' Only a handful of Members in this body have had to lay it on the line in Iraq. Only a handful had to bid their families farewell and face combat in Iraq. 
   For the rest of us, there is no sacrifice, no strain, no stress placed on us personally or on our families and loved ones. 
   Well, here is our chance to show that we genuinely do understand what we have been asking our troops to do in Iraq, that we genuinely do understand the toll that it takes on each of them individually, as a unit and as a service, that we genuinely do understand the sacrifice that we ask of their families, and that we will require the Pentagon to provide our uniformed men and women a minimum amount of time to recover from combat to reconnect with their families and to prepare again for a return to battle. 
   There are some in this Chamber who will yelp and yowl that this is just a ploy to end the war. 
   Mr. Speaker, as someone who is clearly on record as wanting to end this war as quickly as humanly possible, I can testify that this is not the case. 
   I opposed this war with every fiber of my being, but I strongly believe that for as long as this war endures, the bare minimum this Congress must do is take care of the troops who carry out this mission and make sure this war does not shatter our military from the strain of multiple deployments. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 599 provides for further consideration of the FY 2008 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration appropriations. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule, and I rise in strong support of the underlying bill. 
   I want to thank my dear friend from Connecticut, ROSA DELAURO, the chairwoman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee for her work on this bill and her passion for fighting hunger in this country and around the world. I also want to commend Ranking Member Kingston and Chairman Obey and Ranking Member Lewis for all of their efforts and their hard work. 
   I very much regret that we have gotten to this point. I do not take the idea of structuring debate on appropriation bills lightly. Unfortunately, we have gotten to the point where structuring debate on the Agriculture appropriations bill is the only way to pass the bill before we break for the district work period. 
   As the distinguished majority leader so eloquently noted the other day, we have spent hours and hours and hours, beyond historical norms, to complete our work on the appropriations bills. Last June, Democratic and Republican leaders came to an agreement that, in exchange for allowing full and fair debate with up or down votes on dozens of amendments, Republicans would allow the appropriation bills to proceed through the House. We have been able to come to unanimous consents to consider those bills, and they have largely passed with large bipartisan majorities. 
   Now, I know that some of my friends on the other side of the aisle were upset with the process used to consider the SCHIP bill, and after our discussion in the Rules Committee last night, I understand their concerns. But they have decided to use that frustration as an excuse to prevent completion of our important appropriations work, and we do not believe that that is in the best interest of the Nation. Clearly, my friends on the other side have decided to abandon the June agreement, and that is their right. But it is our responsibility, in the majority, to complete these bills in a timely way. 
   Unfortunately, it has become clear that a small number of Members on the other side was willing to use a filibuster-by-amendment strategy to shut down the House and prevent us from completing our work. Mr. Speaker, if Members wish to filibuster bills, they should run for the United States Senate. 
   There is a difference between serious legislating and obstructionism. And I believe that offering amendments to cut bills by $50,000 and then $100,000 and then $101,000 and so on, and debating these bills forever and ever and ever and using procedural mechanisms to unjustifiably delay the consideration of bills, not to move serious legislation forward, but to delay the consideration of bills, I think that's obstructionism. And I think what we saw on the floor the other day was obstructionism. 
   This rule makes in order 12 amendments, all of them Republican amendments on a variety of issues. Many of what I would call the ``usual suspect'' amendments were made in order, amendments by members of the Republican Study Committee to cut certain programs in the bill, an amendment to cut funding across the board, an amendment from my good friend, Mr. Flake, to eliminate earmarks. 
   Mr. Speaker, I also regret that tensions have risen over the last several days. Perhaps it's inevitable before a break, and perhaps it's the heat and humidity, but I hope that all of us can come back after Labor Day refreshed and rededicated to doing the people's business in a civil way. 
   Mr. Speaker, HILLARY CLINTON says ``it takes a village.'' Maybe for us it takes a recess. In this business, your word is everything; without it, there is no trust. And without any trust, this would be a very, very unhappy place to work. 
   I thought we had a very good discussion in the Rules Committee last night. I believe we understand each other and where we're coming from a bit better. I know my friend, Mr. Dreier, and other members of the Rules Committee are eager to look for ways that we can make this process better. They have my word and I think the word of all of us on the Democratic side that we want to work with them to make that happen. 
   In the meantime, however, we have a responsibility to do the people's business. And the rule before us allows us to do that in an orderly way that allows for vigorous debate and votes on amendments. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   I agree with the distinguished minority leader that this is disappointing. As a member of the Rules Committee, I regret this rule and I don't like it. 
   But what I like less are efforts to obstruct and stop the people's business. There is a difference between legislating and obstructionism. And I would say to the distinguished minority leader that fairness is a two-way street and what happened in this House on Tuesday, in my opinion, was pathetic. 
   What is at stake here is a bill to feed hungry people, is a bill to help rural America, is a bill to provide for better food security, and a bill to help our economy. This is serious business, and this is what we were sent here to deal with. 
   What happened on Tuesday, as I said, was pathetic. It stalled consideration of the Agriculture appropriations bill. It dismantled an agreement that worked well during consideration of the last 10 appropriations bills. 
   And let me say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, where I come from in Massachusetts, a deal is a deal. Your word is everything. So, please, when you break your word, don't act shocked when there is a reaction from this side of the aisle. 
   I will close by saying to my colleagues that it is important for us to move beyond this. It is important for us to work together. It is important for us to be more civil. I will concede to my friends on the other side of the aisle that my side of the aisle can do better, but you need to concede that your side can do better as well. And that is the way we restore the trust that, unfortunately, has been lost. 
   I urge a ``yes'' on the previous question and on the rule.  
   Mr. LEWIS of California, this is a sad day in the history of the Appropriations Committee and the House of Representatives. Meaningful, legitimate debate is being stifled and the voice of the Republican minority is being silenced. Sadly, this is the day that will be remembered as the day that the Democrat majority imposed martial law on the People's House. 
   My colleagues know that I have the highest level of respect for the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Obey. Together, we worked as partners during the 109th Congress, passing Appropriations bills through our committee and through the House. Our committee, and indeed, the House, is at its very best when we work together across patty lines and rise above purely partisan politics. 
   During the last Congress, I was privileged to serve as chairman of the House Appropriations Committee and Mr. Obey was our distinguished ranking member. 
   During my tenure as chairman, the House considered 22 regular order appropriations bills. In each and every instance, I worked closely with my leadership and Chairman Dreier in seeking a rule that allowed for a maximum level of open debate, including amendments, on the House floor. Every one--every one--of those 22 annual spending bills was considered under an open rule. 
   We allowed and even encouraged dissenting voices to be heard on these bills. The result was often vigorous and lively debate on the House floor. But that's precisely why our constituents send us to Washington. 
   I was disappointed that Mr. Obey's first bills as chairman--the fiscal year 2007 continuing resolution and the emergency supplemental--were both considered under a closed rule. Mr. Obey, under direction from his leadership, is now heading down the same road yet gain. 
   The Democrat leadership, with absolutely no consultation with the minority, has adopted a closed rule for the consideration of the Agriculture Appropriations bill. As a result, scores of legitimate policy amendments offered by the minority have not been made in order. 
   This is a dangerous and perilous precedent that sets precisely the wrong tone as we attempt to complete work on our annual spending bills. A closed rule leaves the minority little choice but to walk away from the tradition of comity that has marked our longstaning work on this committee. 
   I find it interesting that we had only spent 3-4 hours debating this bill before the Democrat majority decided to pull the plug. I find it troubling that the decision was made by the Democrat leadership to impose a martial law, closed rule on the Ag bill in their rush to begin their month-long August vacation. 
   This legislation is simply too important to have it rushed through the House with no debate and no opportunity for the body to consider amendments. An open rule is the only proper way for the House to consider this legislation. 
   I certainly hope that this lock-down martial law rule on the Ag Appropriations bill isn't a preview of what the House can expect tomorrow as we consider the DoD Appropriations bill, legislation that comprises roughly one-half of all discretionary spending. 
   The Democratic leadership, which promised the most open and transparent legislative process in history, is now showing its true colors. It has failed to fulfill its commitment to the Members of this body by not affording all Members an opportunity to openly amend and debate this bill. 
   I urge my I colleagues to oppose this rule and adopt a rule that will allow free and open debate on this and other pending spending bills.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, time and time again, the American people have spoken on this issue--they overwhelmingly support the expansion of embryonic stem cell research. And today, Congress has the opportunity to take heed and do the bidding of the people by passing H.R. 3. 
   Recent developments have proven that we are not far off from recognizing the true potential of embryonic stem cell research. In meetings with researchers at ViaCell and New World Laboratories, two small biotech companies in my home state of Massachusetts, I have seen first-hand the notable progress made in their research on spinal cord injuries and tissue regeneration. All around the world, researchers are gaining similar ground. However, our nation's current policy stands to limit such critical advancements. 
   And that is why I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 3. It marks the way for an increased number of embryonic stem cell lines while also developing strong ethical guidelines to protect the integrity of this research. 
   We have the rare opportunity to help spur scientific innovation that could, with the proper research and development, produce better treatments--or even cures--for diseases like diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and cancer. But absent a federal investment in embryonic stem cell research, we will never witness its true potential. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (THE WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ms. Waters for her leadership on the Out of Iraq Caucus and for her words here today. I want to thank all of my colleagues for participating in this Special Order this evening. 
   We are all here because we love this country, and we are all here because we are outraged by the Bush policy in Iraq. We believe our country is much better than what is on display in Iraq today. We want to change the policies of this country to make our country better, to make it reflect what this country really is all about, the finest and the best traditions of the United States of America. 
   Mr. Speaker, on November 7, George Bush lost the election. The American people made it very clear that they wanted a change in direction in Iraq. That election was about Iraq, and the American people all across this country made it clear that they want a change in direction. 
   Last night the President of the United States gave a speech, and he made it clear that he doesn't care what the people of this country believe. He is ignoring the message and the statement of the mid-term elections. 
   You know, I had hoped, notwithstanding all of the media hype leading up to the President's speech last night, I was hoping maybe, just maybe he was going to do the right thing. That instead of announcing tens of thousands of more American troops in Iraq, that he was going to announce that he was going to withdraw tens of thousands of American troops from Iraq and begin the U.S. withdrawal and begin the end of the U.S. occupation of Iraq. He did not do that. 
   So what do you do, Mr. Speaker? What do you do when you have a President of the United States who ignores the advice of his generals and military leaders who all told him that an escalation of U.S. forces was a bad idea? What do you do, Mr. Speaker, when you have a President of the United States who ignores the work of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group? 
   The group's report by all accounts says our policy in Iraq has been a failure, and it suggested that we find a way out. What do you do when you have a President of the United States who ignores that? What do you do when you have a President of the United States who ignores the will of the American people, who ignores the election last November 7? What do you, Mr. Speaker? 
   Well, all of us here have expressed our concern and our outrage over this policy, most of us since before the war again. But what do you do now? We can give more speeches, which we have been doing. We are sending more letters and issuing more press releases. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, when you have a President of the United States who is behaving as arrogantly as this President is with regard to this war, then Congress must take action. Congress must condition funding. Congress must withhold funding. Congress must cut funding if that is what it takes to end this war. 
   Now, there are those who say if you do that, you are going to shortchange our troops. I hear that from the Bush administration and from some colleagues here in this Congress. Let me tell you what shortchanges our troops is when we keep them in harm's way in a war that makes no sense, when we have them serve as referees in a civil war, when we put more and more of our troops, when we escalate our involvement in this war. That shortchanges our troops. 
   The fact of the matter is this administration has been shortchanging our troops for a long, long time, Mr. Speaker. When wounded veterans come back, when people come back from this war with post-traumatic stress syndrome and they can't get the care that they need, that shortchanges our troops. 
   I don't think it shortchanges our troops to reunite our soldiers with their families and their loved ones back in the safety of this country. That doesn't shortchange our troops. That actually is what our troops deserve. 
   I think we need to understand that all this rhetoric, the constant invocation of 9/11, the constant admonitions that somehow we are not being true to our troops if we talk about cutting aid, withholding funds, stopping funding for this war because this President won't deal with us, we need to put that rhetoric aside.     
   This President will not listen to the American people. Put the rhetoric aside. We have to do what is right. 
   Let me tell you one final thing, Mr. Speaker. All of us who serve in this Congress do not have to wake up in harm's way. We are not on the front lines in Iraq. I would like to have an amendment introduced some day to a bill that says all these people who want to go to war all the time, they should be the ones who lead the charge. Let those who are up here constantly calling for ``stay the course'' and ``let's continue the current policy,'' let them go and fight. 
   The time has come to end this war. That is what the American people want, and this Congress has the guts to do it. I thank the gentlewoman.

<DOCNO>Mr. MCGOVERN. (CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA TO STOP GENOCIDE AND VIOLENCE IN DARFUR, SUDAN -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, a little over a year ago, Chairman LANTOS and I protested in front of the Sudanese Embassy about the  continuing genocide in Darfur. I'm privileged to say that I've shared jail time with the distinguished gentleman from California. 
   I also want to thank Congresswoman LEE for her leadership on this issue, and I'm honored to be an original cosponsor of this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, others have already described the terrible humanitarian crisis affecting the civilian population of Darfur. Crimes against humanity are committed on a daily basis. President Bush and the Congress have determined the systematic killings and deprivations in Darfur constitute acts of genocide. 
   These serious matters demand a sustained, multilateral response by the United States and the international community. Together, we must pressure the Government of Sudan to stop the killing, stop the arming and support of proxy militias, and negotiate and implement a just and lasting peace. 
   Key to the success of such a strategy is the active support of Sudan's major economic and political partners: China, Russia, Malaysia, Egypt and India. 
   China is Sudan's largest economic partner and its largest provider of military arms and equipment. 
   China can play a significant, perhaps even decisive, role in ending the genocide in Darfur and convincing Khartoum to negotiate a lasting peace accord. 
   But will it? 
   China has taken some steps in the right direction. It supported the deployment of a joint United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force, and recently appointed a special envoy to Darfur. 
   But rather than condemn the violence against defenseless civilians, China's envoy cited poverty as the reason for Darfur's suffering. 
   Did poverty displace over two-and-a-half million people into camps, Mr. Speaker? 
   Did poverty force another half a million to flee the country and live in refugee camps? 
   I visited some of these camps in eastern Chad, Mr. Speaker. I saw first-hand how the conflict in Darfur is destabilizing Sudan's neighbors. 
   Did poverty burn Darfur's villages to the ground, poison water wells, rape women, murder men, and leave children to die of hunger and thirst? 
   No, Mr. Speaker. The regime sitting in Khartoum has orchestrated and condoned these actions. 
   This resolution asks China to acknowledge this violence and use its influence to stop the death and destruction taking place in Darfur. 
   To stop selling military arms and equipment to Sudan. 
   To exercise its considerable economic leverage by suspending its economic ties until Khartoum stops the killing, complies fully with U.N. Security Council resolutions, and enters good faith negotiations to end the fighting in Darfur. 
   Next year, China will host the 2008 Summer Olympics. It has chosen as its theme for the Games a motto filled with hope: ``One World, One Dream.'' 
   But life in Darfur is no dream, Mr. Speaker. It's an unspeakable nightmare. 
   China has the ability to change that reality. 
   It is, as always, Mr. Speaker, a matter of political will. 
   Is China's so-called dream for the world nothing more than a paper banner carried around by a cute and cuddly mascot? 
   Or does China genuinely want to play a responsible role in world and human events and help stop the genocide in Darfur? 
   We are watching, Mr. Speaker. 
   The world is watching, Mr. Speaker. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 422.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1257, SHAREHOLDER VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions). All time yielded during consideration of the rule is for debate only. 
   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 301 is an open rule with a preprinting requirement providing for the consideration of H.R.  1257, the Shareholder Vote on Executive Compensation Act. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate, controlled by the Committee on Financial Services. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. The rule makes in order the Committee on Financial Services amendment in the nature of a substitute as an original bill for the purpose of amendment, which shall be considered as read. The rule requires that any amendments to the bill must be preprinted in the Congressional Record on or before Tuesday, April 17, 2007. Finally, the rule provides one motion to recommit, with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this open rule. This is a good, appropriate rule that allows any germane amendment to be debated and voted on by this body, as long as that amendment was preprinted in the Congressional Record. This rule is appropriate because it allows for real debate and for up or down votes on matters related to this bill. I believe this is a good process, and I want to commend both Chairman Frank and Ranking Member Bachus for requesting this rule and for testifying in support of this rule in the Rules Committee yesterday. 
   I also rise in support of the underlying legislation. The purpose of this bill is straightforward. H.R. 1257, the Shareholder Vote on Executive Compensation Act, allows for shareholders of a publicly traded corporation to conduct annual nonbinding advisory votes on the compensation of the corporation's executives. Basically, this bill would allow the shareholders, those with the most vested interests, to express their approval or disapproval of a company's compensation practices. 
   Let me be clear. This bill does not force a company to accede to the vote, nor does it overrule a decision by the board of directors of a corporation. Instead, it allows the shareholders to demonstrate their public approval or disapproval of a corporation's compensation practices. The bill does not allow shareholders to set caps on the size or nature of executive compensation. 
   By allowing for an annual vote by shareholders, H.R. 1257 goes one step beyond the recently enacted regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which only requires that the amount in executive compensation be disclosed. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation would require public companies to include this nonbinding shareholder vote in their annual proxy statement to shareholders. An additional nonbinding advisory would also be provided to shareholders if the company awards a new compensation package while simultaneously negotiating the purchase or sale of the company. 
   By taking this step, H.R. 1257 increases accountability, and also enables the SEC to better monitor the executive compensation practices of corporations. I hope that my former colleague from California, Chris Cox, now the Commissioner of the SEC, feels encouraged by this legislation and works toward further protecting shareholder rights. 
   Over the past year, CEOs of major corporations have received multimillion-dollar severance packages, despite falling stocks and market share drops during their tenures. These so-called ``golden parachutes'' highlight the disparity between shareholders' rights and executive compensation oversight. 
   In addition to neglecting shareholders' interests, current executive compensation practices actually hurt the long-term corporate value of a company. Unprecedented growth in executive compensation over the past two decades has taken money out of the pockets of shareholders and compromised the long-term interests of too many companies. 
   According to the Corporate Library, in 2006, the average CEO of a Standard and Poor's 500 company received $14.78 million in compensation. It is only fair that the shareholders, the people who actually foot the bill for severance packages, have the opportunity to express their support or disapproval of their company's executive compensation. 
   H.R. 1257 empowers shareholders and complements the SEC's current regulations regarding executive compensation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, again I would remind my colleagues that this is an open rule that allowed every Member of this House to be able to offer an amendment if that Member so desired. In fact, as the gentleman from Texas pointed out, he himself will be offering an amendment. And so I think this rule deserves support. 
   I should point out for the record that when the gentleman's party, the Republic Party, was in the majority here, that even though I was on the Rules Committee, routinely Members were denied the right to even offer their amendments. There were 13 Members who have decided to offer amendments. Ten of them are Republican. I think this is a fair process and this rule deserves support. 
   Having said that, I would like to yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor), a member of the Rules Committee.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me first of all say that I apologize to the gentleman from California, the former distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee, for this open rule. I guess he is upset that 13 Members have decided to offer amendments. They have known about this bill, by the way, for close to 3 weeks. So 13 Members, 10 of them Republican, have decided to put forward amendments that will be debated and considered on this floor, including the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions). 
   I do not know whether the gentleman from California wants me to apologize to Mr. Sessions and the other Republicans for allowing their amendments to be made in order, but the bottom line is, what we are trying to do is break the trend that existed in the Rules Committee when they were in charge, which is that nobody would be allowed to offer amendments on the floor. 
   One of the things that this leadership has promised is a more open process, a process that is more fair, and that is what we are trying to do today. There are 13 amendments that have been pre-filed. They will all be considered on the floor unless the people who printed those amendments do not want to offer them. That is a fair process. 
   As somebody who sat on the Rules Committee for many years and who routinely saw closed rules reported under that committee with not a peep from anybody on that side, it is a little bit hard to digest this whining over an open process. I guess my colleagues on the other side of the aisle object to the fact that Members should have a right to read an amendment that they are going to vote on. I can understand that because they would routinely bring huge bills, hundreds of pages in length, to the floor without giving anybody in this Chamber the opportunity to read them. Those practices hopefully are over for good. 
   This is a fair rule. This is an open rule, and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   At this point, let me inquire from the gentleman from Texas whether or not he has any additional speakers, because at this point, I am the last one on this side.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman from Georgia thinks this rule is such a bad idea, I hope that maybe he might reconsider offering the three amendments that he has pre-filed. 
   Let me just say for the record, because I think it is important to state this, the gentleman from Georgia just went on a rant, and in the previous Congress when his party was in control, in the entire Congress there was one open rule that was not an appropriation bill, one, and I do not recall a single instance when the gentleman from Georgia ever came to the floor and complained about that. I do not recall a single instance when the gentleman from Georgia or, quite frankly, anybody on the other side came to the floor and objected when the Republican-controlled Rules Committee waived the requirement that Members have 3 days to be able to read a report before a bill was considered.     
   I don't remember a single instance when the gentleman from Georgia, or, quite frankly, anybody who we have heard complain today, ever came on the House floor and voted against a closed rule. They ran this place under the most restrictive closed process in the history of this Congress. 
   I think that needs to be said for the record because it goes to the point that I was making earlier that I don't understand what all the complaints are about. You have every Member who wanted to offer an amendment to this bill given the opportunity to do so. 
   They knew that this bill was coming 3 weeks in advance. They could have thought about it for 3 weeks, they could have instructed their staff during that period of 3 weeks to come up with something. Obviously, a number of people did, including the gentleman from Georgia, who has three amendments we are going to have to listen to. 
   Let me again urge my colleagues to support this rule. It is a fair rule. It is an open rule. 
   I am sorry if they don't like the fact that Members ought to have an opportunity to read amendments and read bills before they are voted on, but I think that is a fair thing to do. Of course, when they were in charge, they would routinely waive that right. But, you know, we will respect that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time and would ask the gentleman from Texas if he has any additional speakers.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me urge all my colleagues to support the rule and to also support the underlying bill. H.R. 1257 is a good bill. If you want to defend the status quo, then vote against it. But if you want more accountability, more transparency, then vote for it. This should not be a partisan issue, and I hope that it would get a strong bipartisan vote on passage. 
   Let me again urge my colleagues to support the rule, and this is a rule that allows the gentleman from Texas to be able to offer an amendment. It allows the gentleman from Georgia, whom we  heard earlier, to offer three amendments. It allows for every single Member of this House, Democrat or Republican, to be able to offer an amendment to this bill. 
   This is something new compared to the way the Rules Committee was run under the previous leadership. This is a rule that allows people to be able to heard, to be able to bring their views to the floor, and to be able to debate them. For the gentleman from Texas or the gentleman from Georgia or anybody else to complain that somehow this is a restrictive rule just defies the facts. 
   The fact of the matter is that under their leadership, restrictive rules were the norm. Closed rules were the norm. Not once, not once did I hear anybody on the other side complain about the restrictive rule or closed rule or even vote against the closed rule. This allows every single Member who wanted to offer an amendment to offer an amendment. 
   This is an open rule with a preprinted requirement. This is a good rule. I would urge all my colleagues to support the rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, today is the third day of my week on the Food Stamp Challenge, where public officials live for 1 week on a food stamp budget in order to raise awareness about the Food Stamp Program. Representatives Jo Ann Emerson, Tim Ryan, and Jan Schakowsky are also taking part. 
   Although critics of the Food Stamp Program frequently speculate that it runs rampant with fraud, waste, and abuse, this is simply and utterly untrue. Don't just take my word for it. Go ask the Government Accountability Office. According to the GAO, the Food Stamp program currently operates at  historically low error rates. Between 1999 and 2005, the national payment error rate declined 40 percent to an all-time low of 5.84 percent. In addition, there are incentives built into the program so that States are rewarded for low error rates and may be fined if they are underperforming. 
   By any measure the Food Stamp Program is an example of an efficiently run government program. I will insert into the Record the highlights of the GAO testimony before the Senate on payment errors and trafficking.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 364 provides for consideration of H.R. 1592, the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007, under a closed rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. 
   The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill, except those arising under clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. The rule provides that the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, modified by the amendment printed in the Rules Committee report, shall be considered as adopted, and the bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. The rule waives all points of order against the bill, as amended. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and of the underlying legislation. H.R. 1592, the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007, is a bipartisan piece of legislation that has already passed the House multiple times with Members from both sides supporting it. 
   In the 109th Congress, this legislation passed as an amendment to the Child Safety Act by a vote of 223-199. And in both the 108th and 106th Congresses, hate crimes legislation passed with bipartisan support. 
   With such a demonstrated history of strong bipartisan support, it should come as no surprise that this bill has also garnered the support of 171 cosponsors, Republicans as well as Democrats. 
   I would like to take note for my colleagues that H.R. 1592 has the support of more than 210 civil rights, education, religious and civic organizations. Equally as important, it has the support and endorsement of the law enforcement community, including the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the National Sheriffs Association. 
   Mr. Speaker, it makes sense that this bill has attracted such a wide range of support. Hate crimes are a serious problem everywhere. They continue to plague our society, and they happen in every State and in every community. 
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation has documented over 113,000 hate crimes since 1991. In 2005 alone, nearly 7,200 crimes were identified by the FBI as hate crimes. But despite this marked occurrence of violent hate crimes, current law limits the ability of the Federal Government to provide assistance to States and localities to prosecute and investigate these crimes. It is long past time that Congress address these shortcomings. 
   Mr. Speaker, some will claim that this law is not needed. Others will claim that it adversely affects free speech. I strongly, very strongly disagree with both these claims. 
   First, while we have made progress toward equality in many facets of our society, hate crimes continue to spread in cities and towns across the country.  The main reason why we have been unable to aggressively pursue and prosecute hate crimes is because law enforcement agencies in our States and towns lack the tools and resources. 
   I'd like to point out that this legislation has been endorsed by 31 Attorney Generals from all across the country, the very people who can attest to how critical this legislation is to stemming hate crime violence and to prosecuting and punishing the perpetrators of violent hate crimes. 
   Secondly, with respect to whether this legislation will have a negative impact on free speech, simply put, it will not. H.R. 1592 does not punish or prohibit in any way first amendment rights. It does not affect name-calling, verbal abuse, hateful expression or hate-filled speech. It only addresses violent criminal acts. In fact, there is a first amendment free expression and free exercise provision explicitly included in this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1592 solely applies to bias motivated violent crimes. It does not infringe upon freedom of speech. It can only be applied to violent crimes that result in death or bodily injury where the motivation was based on the bias against a person's perceived race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or disability. 
   I want to remind all of my colleagues that behind all of the statistics of hate crimes, there are real people, people who were targeted for violence and who suffered violent attacks simply because of who they are. 
   Let me tell you a story of Lisa Craig, a 35-year old mother of two from my own State of Massachusetts. In 2003, Craig was assaulted on the street by three teenage girls and kicked in the head multiple times, causing her brain to bleed, and requiring 200 stitches in her head. Craig's partner and her two daughters witnessed the attack by these teenagers who, earlier in the evening, had been shouting anti-gay epithets at the couple. 
   Lisa Craig's case is just one of thousands, but it demonstrates the bloody results of hate crimes. We need to prevent hate crimes like the one suffered by Lisa Craig from ever occurring again, and we need to give our State and local law enforcement officers and court officials the ability to prosecute and punish the perpetrators of such violent acts for what they are, hate crimes. Passing H.R. 1592 will enable our police, our prosecutors, our judges and our courts to do just that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I submit for the Record a letter signed by 31 State attorneys general, including the Republican attorney general of the State of Washington, in strong support of the underlying legislation.  
   April 16, 2007.  Hon. Nancy Pelosi, Speaker, House of Representatives, The Capitol, Washington, DC.  Hon. Harry Reid, Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC  Hon. John Boehner, Minority Leader, House of Representatives, The Capitol, Washington, DC.  Hon. Mitch McConnell, Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.  
   We, the undersigned Attorneys General, are writing to express our strong support of Congressional efforts towards the immediate passage of federal hate crimes legislation. As the chief legal officers in our respective jurisdictions, State Attorneys General are on the front lines in the fight to protect our citizens' civil rights. Although state and local governments continue to have the primary responsibility for enforcing criminal law, we believe that federal assistance is critical in fighting the invidious effects of hate crimes. 
   This much needed legislation would remove unnecessary jurisdictional barriers to permit the U.S. Department of Justice to  prosecute violent acts motivated by bias and hate and complement existing federal law by providing new authority for crimes where the victim is intentionally selected because of his or her gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, or disability. Under current law, the Justice Department can only prosecute crimes motivated by the victim's race, religion, or national origin when that person is engaged in a federally protected activity, such as voting. Legislative proposals, such as the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crime Prevention Act of2007 (LLEHCPA) and others, however, would permit federal prosecution of hate crimes irrespective of whether they were committed while the victim was engaged in protected activity. 
   Removing this outmoded jurisdictional barrier to federal prosecution of hate crimes is critical to protecting our citizens' fundamental civil rights. In 2005, the most recent figures available, the FBI documented 7,163 crimes reported from 12,417 law enforcement agencies across the country. Yet, it is not the frequency or number of hate crimes, alone, that distinguish these acts of violence from other crimes. Rather, our experiences as prosecutors have shown us, that these crimes can have a special impact on victims, their families, their communities and, in some instances, the nation. Indeed, in Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U.S. 47 (1993), Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote for a unanimous Supreme Court in upholding the constitutionality of enhanced penalties for crimes motivated by bias or hate against a person because of race, religion, color, disability, sexual orientation, national origin or ancestry. In so ruling, the Court recognized that ``bias-motivated crimes are more likely to provoke retaliatory crimes, inflict distinct emotional harms on their victims, and incite community unrest.'' Hate crimes have lead to the polarization of communities, increases in security needs at schools and churches, declines in property values and the creation of an overall atmosphere of fear and distrust. All too often that climate has hindered the efforts of local law enforcement and placed the lives of police officers and civilians in jeopardy. 
   As the chief legal and law enforcement officers of our respective states, we are mindful that the overwhelming majority of criminal cases should be brought by local police and prosecutors at the state level. However, in those rare situations in which local authorities are unable to act, measures such as the LLEHCPA and others provide a backstop to state and local law enforcement by allowing federal involvement if it is necessary to provide a just result. These measures would provide invaluable tools to federal law enforcement to help state authorities in their fight against hate crimes. Therefore, we strongly urge the passage of important hate crimes legislation by the 110th Congress. 
   Sincerely, Lisa Madigan, Attorney General of Illinois; Mark Shurtleff, Attorney General of Utah; Terry Goddard, Attorney General of Arizona; Dustin McDaniel, Attorney General of Arkansas; Richard Blumenthal, Attorney General of Connecticut; Linda Singer, Attorney General of District of Columbia; Thurbert E. Baker, Attorney General of Georgia; Mark J. Bennett, Attorney General of Hawaii; Tom Miller, Attorney General of Iowa; Gregory D. Stumbo, Attorney General of Kentucky; Charles C. Foti, Jr., Attorney General of Louisiana; G. Steven Rowe, Attorney General of Maine; Douglas Gansler, Attorney General of Maryland. Martha Coakley, Attorney General of Massachusetts; Lori Swanson, Attorney General of Minnesota; Jeremiah W. Nixon, Attorney General of Missouri; Mike McGrath, Attorney General of Montana; Catherine Cortez Masto, Attorney General of Nevada; Gary King, Attorney General of New Mexico; Andrew Cuomo, Attorney General of New York; Marc Dann, Attorney General of Ohio; Hardy Myers, Attorney General of Oregon; Patrick Lynch, Attorney General of Rhode Island; William H. Sorrell, Attorney General of Vermont; Vincent Frazier, Attorney General of Virgin Islands; Rob McKenna, Attorney General of Washington.  
   Let me also say, Mr. Speaker, that I stand by this rule. We are talking about life and death issues here. We are talking about people's civil rights. And, unfortunately, I think it is clear that there are some on the other side of the aisle who oppose the expansion of civil rights protections for threatened groups living in the United States, and I believe they are flat wrong. But this gives the Members, every Member of the House, the opportunity to vote up or down on whether or not they believe that we should expand protections. I think this is an appropriate rule, and I strongly support the underlying bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time, I would like to yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor), a member of the Rules Committee.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, before I yield to the gentlelady from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee), I would like to give my colleagues a couple of examples of the kinds of crimes that we're talking about here. 
   In Los Angeles, California, 2003, after seeing him hugging another man on the street, three men attacked Treve Broudy, who was 34 years old, with a baseball bat. The incident left Broudy in a coma. Broudy was also hospitalized for approximately 10 weeks after the attack, and has lost half of his vision and has experienced trouble hearing. 
   In Charlottesville, Virginia, in 1997, James Kittredge was attacked by three young men he offered a ride to outside of a gay club in Charlottesville, Virginia. The men offered to take him to party, but instead they dragged Kittredge out of his car, where they beat him, smashing eight of his ribs and eye socket, urinated on him, put cigarettes out on him and locked him in his own trunk. He was found over a day later. 
   I can go on and on and on with examples of these hate crimes, but this is what we are trying to prevent, Mr. Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this point, I would like to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee).

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, the bill before us provides much needed support for local law enforcement agencies in the fight against violent hate crimes. That's why so many law enforcement agencies all across the country are enthusiastically supporting this legislation. That's why 31 State Attorney Generals, including the Republican Attorney General from the State of Washington, supports this bill. 
   Victims have reported an average of 191,000 hate crime incidents annually since the year 2000. Seventy-three percent of Americans support strengthening hate crimes laws. 
   This bill, as I said, is endorsed by virtually every major law enforcement organization in the country. The legislation is also supported by President George H.W. Bush's Attorney General, Dick Thornburg. This legislation is virtually identical to the version approved by a bipartisan majority in the Republican-led 109th Congress. 
   Hate crimes affect more than one individual, Mr. Speaker. It is committed with the intention of terrorizing a group of people or an entire community. 
   Now, we've heard arguments from some on the other side that this bill somehow violates the first amendment. In fact, the measure includes an explicit statement that the bill may not be interpreted as limiting first amendment protections language that is based on the existing Washington State hate crime statute. The provision only applies when a person's conduct, not thought or speech, is being punished. 
   Mr. Speaker, the United States Supreme Court has rejected the claim that a hate crime law is a law against thoughts. The Supreme Court recognized in Wisconsin v. Mitchell that it is common to take motive into account in criminal law. 
   So to those of my colleagues who are worried about protecting bigoted speech, they can stop worrying because this bill, sadly, will not affect that kind of speech. 
   Now, some have argued that this law is an unnecessary extension of the Federal Government. The bill provides support and resources to assist local law enforcement agencies. The majority of hate crimes will still be prosecuted at the State level. The Federal Government only has jurisdiction in certainly limited and extreme circumstances. 
   The Federal Government has the responsibility, Mr. Speaker, to protect all Americans against bigotry and against violent crime. 
   So what we have before us, Mr. Speaker, is relatively simple; you either support providing an expansion of civil liberties and civil rights and civil protections under the law, or you don't. So that is the question that my colleagues have to deal with. 
   I think the answer is simple. I think we should support this legislation. This is a good bill. It should enjoy bipartisanship support because it has in the past. I would urge all of my colleagues to support this rule and to support the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (THE SAFE AND ORDERLY WITHDRAWAL FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, there is no issue more important to the American people and to the Members of this Congress than the war in Iraq. Over 3,000 American military personnel have been killed in this war. Over 22,000 have been wounded in combat-related action. Some have been injured for life. Several thousand more of our troops have sustained serious injuries or suffered sickness while serving in Iraq; and tens of thousands of Iraqi men, women, and children dead. 
   So far, it has cost the United States $387 billion, and next week we will receive another supplemental request from the President in the range of $100 billion to $130 billion more. 
   In blood, in treasure, the costs of the war in Iraq have been high. I believe, Mr. Speaker, that we must change the dynamic in Iraq. We must end our occupation, engage the countries in the region to help the Iraqis negotiate an end to the sectarian violence tearing their country apart, and let the Iraqi people determine their own destiny. 
   I firmly believe, Mr. Speaker, there is no military victory to be had in Iraq. So I am convinced that we must focus our efforts on the uniformed men and women we have put in harm's way and bring them safely home. This is why I am introducing today the Safe and Orderly Withdrawal from Iraq Act. 
   This is a very straightforward bill, Mr. Speaker. Within 30 days of enactment, the United States would initiate a safe, orderly, and responsible withdrawal of all U.S. military forces from Iraq.     
   The withdrawal would take no more than 6 months and include the transfer to the Iraqi government of all bases and facilities that have been operated or occupied by U.S. military personnel. During the withdrawal period, funding is maintained to ensure that our forces have the ability to complete or transfer their duties in an orderly manner, defend themselves as necessary, and be fully supported as they move out of Iraq. Once the withdrawal is completed, defense funding for the war would end. 
   Under this bill, financial support and equipment could continue to be provided to the Iraqi security forces or to a multilateral force the Iraqi government might request for help in continuing the training of their forces and in providing security during the period of withdrawal and afterwards. 
   Nothing in this bill affects U.S. funding for economic and social reconstruction projects. The bill also allows the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to complete reconstruction projects currently under way should the Iraqi government make such a request. 
   Finally, the bill asserts the authority of the President to arrange asylum for those Iraqi citizens who might be physically endangered by the withdrawal of our military presence. As we all know, many Iraqi civilians have bravely served our Armed Forces as translators, drivers, administrative staff and in other capacities. Should they be threatened with violence or retaliation because of their association with our forces, we should extend to them the protection they require and that they deserve. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill does not walk away from Iraq. It maintains financial equipment and material support for the Iraqi military and security forces. It continues economic, social and reconstruction assistance for Iraq, and its impact would trigger greater diplomatic engagement in the region which is missing at the present moment. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are no easy answers for the many questions facing Iraq's future. There is no perfect legislative answer for the situation in Iraq. But I do know that our troops do not belong in the crossfire of a violent Iraqi sectarian war. The American people understand this. They are far ahead of the politicians in Washington. They want us to do what is right. They want us to bring our troops home, and they want that to happen in a safe, orderly and responsible manner. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that this war in Iraq is a moral blunder. I believe that the war in Iraq represents one of the biggest political, diplomatic and military mistakes in our history. It is time for us to end this war. I urge my colleagues to support the Safe and Orderly Withdrawal from Iraq Act.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I am proud of what the Democratic Rules Committee did last night. I think the gentleman has a little problem saying Democratic, but that's what it is, Democratic Rules Committee. 
   Yes, this is an open rule that calls for a preprinting requirement so that people can actually read what we're going to debate. I'm sorry that the gentleman from Texas doesn't believe that Members of Congress deserve the courtesy of being able to read what they should vote on. 
   I should also say that the gentleman, if he's got a brilliant idea along the way, that his leadership can work with our leadership and maybe we can come to some sort of accommodation if there's another amendment that hasn't been offered. But I will remind him that the majority of amendments that have been preprinted are Republican amendments. 
   I will also remind him, in case he forgot, that last night in the Rules Committee when we called for a roll call vote, the former chairman of the Rules Committee, the distinguished Republican from California (Mr. Dreier) voted ``yes'' for the rule. The distinguished Republican gentleman from Florida (Mr. Lincoln Diaz-Balart) voted ``yes'' for the rule. 
   So I'm not quite sure what the controversy is. 
   Having said that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve my time at this point.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I would close by simply saying that this is a good underlying bill. I hope it passes, but this is also a good rule. It is an open rule that requires the preprinting of amendments so that Members who come to the floor can have an opportunity to read and to study what they're going to vote on. 
   This was a rule that had strong bipartisan support in the Rules Committee last night, including from the distinguished former chairman, the ranking Republican from California (Mr. Dreier); from Mr. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, the Republican from Florida. 
   This is a good way to approach this issue, and with that, Mr. Speaker, I would urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and I would urge a ``yes'' vote on the underlying bill as well.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, we have been at war in Iraq for 5 years, longer than we fought World War II. And notwithstanding all of the rosy predictions by this President and his staff, we are now stuck refereeing a civil war. 
   Our soldiers are to be praised; they have done an outstanding job. But our political leaders in Washington, including those in this Congress, should be strongly criticized for acquiescing and going along time and time again. 
   We are told that we need to stay the course for the sake of our standing in the world. But, Mr. Speaker, this war has diminished our standing in the world. Enough is enough. It is time to bring this war in Iraq to an end.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 579 provides for the consideration of H.R. 2831, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2007, under a closed rule. 
   The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and Labor. 
   The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except those arising under clauses 9 or 10 of rule XXI. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this rule and the underlying legislation, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. This legislation can be summed up in one word, ``fairness.'' And what better summarizes the idea of fairness than equal pay for equal work. 
   We've all heard it; we've all said it in speeches, but right now we have a real opportunity to make it happen. I wish we did not have to be here today, but the shortsighted and unfortunate recent Supreme Court ruling has forced us to revisit this painful issue from our Nation's past. 
   Lilly Ledbetter spent 19 years of her life working at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company in its Gadsden, Alabama plant. What she did not know for most of that time was that she had been subjected to systematic pay discrimination over the course of 15 years simply because she is a woman. By the time of her retirement, she was earning $45,000 a year. The lowest paid male supervisor at the plant was making $6,500 a year more. 
   As the case of Lilly Ledbetter clearly shows, there is still discrimination in the workplace, and it is our responsibility and it is our duty to ensure that every worker in this Nation receives fair compensation for their work. 
   We had a bipartisan solution to this problem, known as title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. While this legislation was groundbreaking and certainly was a giant step forward for our workers, there was clearly a hole in the law, and that is what we are filling today. 
   Lilly Ledbetter proved her case. A jury found that she had been discriminated against and awarded her the back pay she should have received, attempting to fulfill the purpose of title VII, to make her whole and to discourage other employers from discriminating in the future. But those goals were thwarted by a 5-4 Supreme Court decision earlier this year. The Court held that in order to recover the back wages she was owed, Lilly Ledbetter needed to file a complaint at the time the discrimination began, even though she did not become aware of it until more than a decade later. What we are doing is reclaiming the original purpose, the legislative intent of title VII, which unfortunately the Supreme Court, in one fell swoop, completely, outrageously undermined. 
   Their decision was as if to say that because Lilly Ledbetter didn't know she was being treated unfairly, that therefore she was not being treated unfairly. This was, of course, irrespective of the fact that the Court and those of us here in this Chamber unequivocally know Lilly Ledbetter suffered the consequences of discrimination throughout the course of her life and her career. 
   Mr. Speaker, Lilly Ledbetter joined the workforce and worked hard, assuming that she would receive fair compensation for her efforts. But her story and the stories of countless others is not one of fairness or justice. 
   I will not retell her story because I think we have all heard it and we all understand that she was wronged. Instead, I will share with you some of her testimony before the House Education and Labor Committee in June. And although I was not there to hear her speak, you can feel the passion of someone who knows she was wronged. These are the words of Lilly Ledbetter, and I quote: ``What happened to me is not only an insult to my dignity, but had real consequences for my ability to care for my family. Every paycheck I received I got less than what I was entitled to under the law. The Supreme Court said that this didn't count as illegal discrimination, but it sure feels  like illegal discrimination when you are on the receiving end of that smaller paycheck and trying to support your family with less money than the men are getting for doing the same job.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, what happened to Lilly Ledbetter should not have happened, and today we have an opportunity to make sure it will never happen again. 
   You know, Mr. Speaker, Lilly Ledbetter could be bitter and angry, and most certainly she has every right to be. But instead, her concern is about what will happen in the future. 
   And let me quote her again: ``My case is over, and it is too bad that the Supreme Court decided the way it did. I hope, though, that Congress won't let this happen to anyone else. I would feel that this long fight was worthwhile if at least at the end of it I knew that I played a part in getting the law fixed so that it could provide real protection to real people in the real world.'' 
   Lilly Ledbetter's concern is with those workers who come after her who, just like her, will work hard at their jobs and assume that they are receiving equal pay for equal work. This is not something that they should have to hope for; it is something they deserve and are owed under the law. And this Congress owes these workers and their families, because last November they voted for change because they were tired of the economic injustices that people like Lilly Ledbetter had suffered. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people expect their government to stand up for fairness and justice. And for this reason, let me say how disappointed I am in our President, who has said he will veto this legislation if it comes to his desk. This is a President who, time and time again, stands up before audiences and claims that he is against discrimination in all forms, yet now we get this threat. 
   If this Congress is truly committed to ending discrimination in this Nation, we cannot let this President have the final word. If he vetoes this bill for fairness and justice, I hope that this Congress will stand up and overturn his pen stroke that strikes at the heart of what makes this Nation great. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act is not only about changing the way we treat our working men and women; it's about paying rent, putting food on the table, and paying for our children to go to college. For this to happen, we must return to the roots of a Nation and what has made us great and moved us forward in times of strife. Fairness has been at the heart of all that makes America strong, and this Congress cannot turn away from that. 
   For Lilly Ledbetter and all the workers who simply want to earn a fair wage for the hard work that they do do for their families and for justice, let's pass this important legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me just say in response to the gentleman from California's remarks, that obviously we disagree on the importance of this legislation. Many of us on this side, I hope all of us on this side, and a good number of Members on that side, believe this is serious, a serious bill and a very important bill, and that the issue of discrimination is something we cannot tolerate under any circumstances. 
   The gentleman mentions the promises that the Democrats made when they campaigned in the last election. One of those promises was that we would combat discrimination wherever it existed. That is what we are doing here today. 
   We think it is wrong that women get paid less than men for doing the same job.

   Mr. McGOVERN. I thank the gentleman for his clarification, but the underlying point of this bill is to make sure that there are no more cases like Lilly Ledbetter's case. With almost every piece of legislation that deals with civil rights, the other side always trots out this litigation argument. There will be more lawsuits and more lawsuits and more lawsuits. 
   We hear the lawsuit in D.C. brought up about this man who is suing a dry cleaners for losing his pants. To the best of my knowledge, that has nothing to do with discrimination. I agree with the gentleman that that is a frivolous lawsuit, but to bring that case up in the context of what we are debating here, which is the civil rights and the equal rights and the equal pay protections for women in this country, I don't think is appropriate, quite frankly.

   Again, I say to my colleagues that this issue is very simple. This is about combating discrimination. This is about fairness, and this is the way to do it, and this is the opportunity to do it.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, we hear a lot from the other side about how nobody supports what happened to Lilly Ledbetter, yet it was this Republican President's Solicitor General who argued against Lilly Ledbetter in the Supreme Court. For all of the years I can remember that the Republicans were in the majority in Congress, I don't remember any groundbreaking equal pay for equal work legislation  being brought to the floor to deal with these kinds of issues. 
   So we can talk all we want about the need to eliminate discrimination in the workforce against women, but unless we back those statements up with our votes on legislation that will change that, then those words ring hollow.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me just say that I think it's inconceivable that any Member in this Chamber can stand up and say that they are against discrimination and that they are dedicated to equal pay for equal work and vote against the underlying bill. 
   My friends on the other side of the aisle have talked about how committed they are to this issue of equal rights; yet when they controlled this Congress, I don't recall a single equal pay for equal work bill being brought to this floor. 
   My friends say that this is an issue they feel strongly about, yet I don't recall hearing a single voice on the other side of the aisle complain when George Bush's Solicitor General argued against Lilly Ledbetter. My friends say this is an important issue to them, yet I don't recall anybody on their side of the aisle standing up and decrying the Supreme Court when they came down with this awful decision against Lilly Ledbetter. 
   Today's debate has been about justice and fairness. It is hard to believe this is even an issue that needs to be debated. No one argues that Lilly Ledbetter was denied equal pay for equal work. No one argues against the fact that women in this country still only earn 77 cents for every dollar earned by men. 
   No one will refute the fact that, unfortunately, discrimination in the workplace towards too many Americans is still rampant. But today we can send a message that this unfairness in the workplace is unacceptable and will no longer be tolerated. 
   Those who discriminated against Lilly Ledbetter were wrong, and they deserve to be fired. Because of the insult she suffered, Ms. Ledbetter deserved compensation. 
   What's amazing is that the Supreme Court doesn't deny this. They recognize the problem, yet a bare majority, for some reason, decided that justice was not to be granted. Justice Ginsburg, in her dissent, stated that the opinion did not, and I quote, ``comprehend, or was indifferent, to the insidious way in which women can be victims of pay discrimination.'' Justice Ginsburg also made clear that now it  was up to Congress to act. Today we shall. 
   It does not matter if you suffer pay discrimination on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, national origin, disability or age. It is wrong. If it happens, there must be a system in place to ensure that justice is accomplished. 
   As Lilly Ledbetter said, and I quote, ``I wish my story had a happy ending ..... I hope ..... that what happened to me does not happen to other people who suffered discrimination like I did.'' 
   Let's fulfill Lilly Ledbetter's hope today and ensure that what happened to her never, ever happens to another worker in this great country. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule 
   I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (WATER QUALITY INVESTMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, Congress has long recognized the need to protect our nation's water supply. Over three decades ago, we passed the Clean Water Act (CWA) establishing a federal program to aid wastewater treatment plant construction and upgrades. And, in the years since, over $76.5 billion has been provided to assist cities in building and upgrading sewage infrastructure. 
   Ask any mayor or council member in your district, and I am certain that they will agree this money has been well-spent helping communities to prevent the discharge of waste into surface waters. Unfortunately, while funding needs have increased over the years (21% between 1996 and 2000), Congress has yet to increase its appropriations to meet this growing demand. In the end, our cities and towns have been left to cover many of these costs alone. 
   In my district, the city of Fall River has been undertaking significant wastewater upgrades, costing in excess of $100 million. Within the community, there is strong support for complying with the Clean Water Act, and the city itself has devoted a significant amount of public funds to support this effort. But, the reality is that without federal assistance, they would be unable to meet the standards mandated by the CWA. 
   The towns of Westborough and Shrewsbury share a treatment plant and are facing similar challenges with costly upgrades. And in my hometown, the Upper Blackstone Water Pollution Abatement District servicing the City of Worcester and surrounding communities has found itself in a nearly identical position. 
   Similarly, the city of Marlborough operates two wastewater treatment plants; one on the easterly side of the City discharges into the Hop Brook River and the second on the westerly side of the City discharges into the Assabet River. Under the conditions of the City's NPDES permits, they are required to make substantial upgrades to both of their treatment plants. The City of Marlborough's engineering consultant estimates these upgrades to cost between $60 and $80 million depending on whether the City is required to  recharge into the groundwater as opposed as directly into the river. 
   Over the years, I have worked to obtain some modest direct federal financial relief for these projects, but it has been clear that the needs of these two cities have far exceeded the funding available. In fact, under the Republican-led Congress, funding for the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund, which addresses critical water infrastructure needs, was slashed by 34 percent. And, though sewer overflow grants were authorized for 2002 and 2003, the Republican leadership refused to appropriate any funds and let the authorization expire. 
   In the end, this failure to increase federal funding for these programs is what makes the Clean Water Act an unfunded mandate in the eyes of the cities and towns we are all elected to represent. 
   And that is why this legislation we have before us today, H.R. 569, is so important. It authorizes $1.5 billion in grants to local communities over the next five years to prevent dangerous sewer overflow. Such funding will be invaluable to communities like Fall River and Marlborough, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 569.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (FEDERAL FOOD DONATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from the District of Columbia for yielding me the time and for her support for this bill and for so many other important issues. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4220, the Federal Food Donation Act of 2007. 
   Let me begin by commending the sponsor of this legislation, Congresswoman Jo Ann Emerson. Congresswoman Emerson is a true champion for the hungry in this country. She's a friend who doesn't just talk about hunger, but is a leader in the effort to fight to end hunger in this country. 
   It's not an easy effort, and I know that she has to work to convince people around this country and in this very building that there are people who still go without food in this great Nation of ours. She's a shining example of someone who puts partisanship aside and works towards a goal that should be achievable. 
   So I want to thank Congresswoman Emerson for her steadfast leadership on this issue and for introducing this important legislation. 
   I also want to thank Chairman Waxman and Ranking Member Davis and the other members of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee for their quick and thorough work on this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, hunger is getting worse in America. More than 35.5 million people went hungry in the United States in 2006, an increase of more than 300,000 from 2005. There are many in Congress who talk about the booming economy and economic growth, but it is clear that millions of Americans are not benefiting from this so-called economic expansion. 
   The costs of living in America are rising. Energy costs are increasing, food prices continue to go up, and the housing crisis is straining the budgets of middle- and lower-income families. The reality is that many Americans are walking a fiscal tightrope where any economic change or family crisis, like an unexpected illness or job loss, could force people to go without food for a period of time. 
   That we are even talking about any person going hungry in the richest and most prosperous Nation in the world is an embarrassment, and we should all be ashamed for not doing more to combat hunger here at home. 
   H.R. 4220 is a good step in the fight against hunger. Unfortunately, it's not going to end hunger in America, but it will provide one more way to fight hunger. 
   As has already been described, the Federal Food Donation Act would require executive agencies who serve food on their premises to encourage the donation of excess food to nonprofit organizations. Such food rescue efforts can be particularly useful to the more than 43,000 soup kitchens and food pantries on the front lines battling hunger. The Oversight and Government Reform Committee broadened the scope of this bill, and I'm especially pleased the bill was expanded to include the Department of Defense. 
   The reality is that food costs are increasing; and America's food banks, the safety net of our anti-hunger system, is straining to meet this need. According to a new report released today by the U.S. Conference of Mayors, requests for food increased an average of 12 percent over the last year. Yet at the same time, a recent Washington Post article reports that the Capital Area Food Bank, the emergency food system for Washington, DC, had only 230,000 pounds of food on its shelves, down from 570,000 pounds at this time last year. Nationwide, food donations to food banks are expected to fall short of the need by 15 million pounds. 
   Mr. Speaker, we need to do more to address and ultimately end hunger in America. The Federal safety net developed over the years, the Food Stamp program, Meals on Wheels, school meals and the emergency food system, is working but it is strained. Private organizations like Catholic Charities and the Nation's food banks, just to name two examples, are filling the gaps where they can. It is time we commit to ending hunger once and for all. It's time that we dedicate the resources of our great Nation to ending this scourge. The Federal Food Donation Act is a good first step, and I'm pleased that the House is acting on it today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I insert into the Record at this point two articles documenting the shortage of food for the hungry in this country and one article announcing the U.S. Conference of Mayors report on hunger and homelessness.  
   Blessed Is the Full Plate  
   One of the most majestic dining rooms in New York City is in the Church of the Holy Apostles. After the landmark building was nearly destroyed by fire in 1990, the Episcopal parish made the decision not to replace the pews so that the nave could become a place of various uses. There are traditional Sunday services, of course, and the gay and lesbian synagogue on Friday evenings. And every weekday more than a thousand people eat lunch at round tables beneath 12-foot stained-glass windows and a priceless Dutch pipe organ. 
   ``You can't get more Biblical than feeding the hungry:' says the Rev. William Greenlaw, the rector. 
   Holy Apostles has fed the hungry for 25 years now without missing a single weekday, including the morning after the fire, when the church lay in ruins, still smoldering, and 943 meals were served by candlelight. There's a queue on Ninth Avenue by midmorning;  sometimes tourists think there's a wait for some exclusive New York happening until they notice the shabby clothes, piles of shopping bags and unshaven faces that are the small unmistakable markers of poverty. 
   The poor could be forgiven for feeling somewhat poorer nowadays. The share of the nation's income going to the top 1 percent of its citizens is at its highest level since 1928, just before the big boom went bust. But poverty is not a subject that's been discussed much by the current administration, who were wild to bring freedom to the Iraqis but not bread to the South Bronx. ``Hunger is hard for us as a nation to admit,'' says Clyde Kuemmerle, who oversees the volunteers at Holy Apostles. ``That makes it hard to talk about and impossible to run on.'' 
   At Holy Apostles the issue is measured in mouthfuls. Pasta, collard greens, bread, cling peaches. But in this anniversary year the storage shelves are less full, the pipeline less predictable. The worst emergency food shortage in years is plaguing charities from Maine to California, even while the number of those who need help grows. The director of City Harvest in New York, Jilly Stephens, has told her staff they have to find another million pounds of food over the next few months to make up the shortfall. ``Half as many pantry bags'' is the mantra heard now that the city receives half the amount of emergency food than it once did from the Feds. In Los Angeles 24 million pounds of food in 2002 became 15 million in 2006; in Oregon 13 million pounds dwindled to six. It's a cockamamie new math that denies the reality of hunger amid affluence. 
   There are many reasons why. An agriculture bill that would have increased aid and the food-stamp allotment has been knocking around Congress, where no one ever goes hungry. Donations from a federal program that buys excess crops from farmers and gives them to food banks has shrunk alarmingly. Even the environment and corporate efficiency have contributed to empty pantries: more farmers are producing corn for ethanol, and more companies have conquered quality control, cutting down on those irregular cans and battered boxes that once went to the needy. 
   What hasn't shrunk is the size of the human stomach. At lunchtime at Holy Apostles, Ernest is hungry, his hand bandaged because he got in a fight, even though he is sober now and has his own place in the Bronx. Janice is hungry, too, she of the beautiful manners and carefully knotted headscarf, who sleeps on the train on winter nights and walks with a cane since being hit by a car. There are the two veterans, both Marines, with the raddled faces and slightly unfocused eyes of those who sleep outdoors, which means mostly always being half-awake, and that group of Chinese women who don't speak English, and the Muslim couple who sit alone. Mostly it's single men at Holy Apostles. Some are mentally ill, and some are addicts, and to repair their lives would take a lot of help. But at the moment they have an immediate problem with an immediate answer: pasta, collard greens, bread, cling peaches. 
   This place is a blessing, and an outrage. ``We call these people our guests,'' says the rector. ``They are the children of God.'' That's real God talk. The political arena has been lousy with the talk-show variety in recent years: worrying about whether children could pray in school instead of whether they'd eaten before they got there, obsessing about the beginning of life instead of the end of poverty, concerned with private behavior instead of public generosity. 
   There's a miracle in which an enormous crowd comes to hear Jesus and he feeds them all by turning a bit of bread and fish into enough to serve the multitudes. The truth is that America is so rich that political leaders could actually produce some variant of that miracle if they had the will. And, I suppose, if they thought there were votes in it. Enough with the pious sanctimony about gay marriage and abortion. If elected officials want to bring God talk into public life, let it be the bedrock stuff, about charity and mercy and the least of our brethren. Instead of the performance art of the presidential debate, the candidates should come to Holy Apostles and do what good people, people of faith, do there every day--feed the hungry, comfort the weary, soothe the afflicted. And wipe down the tables after each seating. Here's a prayer for every politician: pasta, collard greens, bread, cling peaches. Amen.   
   Cupboards Are Bare at Food Banks  
   Area food banks are experiencing a critical shortage of supplies as donations drop dramatically and as demand for free and discounted food continues to soar. 
   The Capital Area Food Bank, the region's primary distribution center, reported that it had about 230,000 pounds of goods on its shelves this week, down from 570,000 pounds at this time last year, officials said. 
   The short supplies, which are hitting food banks and soup kitchens across the nation, stem from a combination of factors: Federal supplies of excess farm goods have dropped, in part because of the summer drought and because farmers are selling more of their products internationally. Donations from grocery stores, a major source for food banks, have fallen as supermarket chains consolidate, increase efficiency and tighten inventory controls. 
   Overall this year, the Capital Area Food Bank is projecting totals to fall roughly 6 percent below last year's total of 19.5 million pounds. The situation has been particularly bad in recent weeks, officials said. At the Northeast Washington warehouse earlier this week, some refrigerated shelves, usually stacked with produce and meats, stood empty. 
   ``We're getting a lot less food donated from companies and individuals,'' operations director Christopher Leal said. ``We have really nothing.'' 
   At the same time, economic factors have conspired to force many more people toward the brink of hunger. Calls to the food bank's Hunger Lifeline are up about 37 percent from last year. 
   And it's not just in the District. The Manna Food Center in Montgomery County served more than 2,200 families last month, about 200 more than the previous November. In Fairfax County, Reston Interfaith's food service has doubled over the past three years. 
   ``Good, working people are having a harder time making ends meet,'' said Kerrie Wilson, executive director of Reston Interfaith. ``So far, we've not had to turn folks away, but we have limited the number of times we'll help someone. ..... You do less for more.'' 
   America's Second Harvest, the country's leading hunger-relief charity, is projecting a shortage of 15 million pounds of food this year at its more than 200 network food banks. That would be enough food to serve 11.7 million meals or fill 400 trucks. 
   At food banks from Maine to Florida to California, ``demand is up, and food is flying out the door faster than ever,'' spokesman Ross Fraser said. 
   ``Our inventories are as depleted as they've ever been before,'' Fraser said. ``Our food banks keep calling here saying, `My God, you've got to help us. We desperately need help.' '' 
   Edward Cooney, who has been an anti-hunger activist since 1972, said he has never seen food supplies dwindling and demand rising the way they are now. 
   ``I've been in a few food banks, and I've looked at the shelves,'' said Cooney, executive director of the Washington-based Congressional Hunger Center. ``You just see huge warehouses where you see empty shelves. Ain't nothing there.'' 
   About 85 percent of food donations to the Capital Area Food Bank come from corporations, including grocery chains, chief operating officer Brian Smith said. 
   Just 4 percent are from individuals, and 11 percent are from the federal government. 
   Improvements in inventory controls and store-ordering procedures among supermarket chains have limited the supplies donated to food banks. 
   ``Food retailers are in business to sell food and not to have a lot of discarded food,'' said Giant spokesman Barry F. Scher, who is also vice chairman of the food bank's board of directors. 
   Although the quantity of food that Giant donates has dropped, Scher said, proceeds from in-store campaigns in which customers give money for the hungry are increasing. And the Landover-based chain will continue to donate food to charities, he said. 
   The shortage is exacerbated by a decline in federal assistance. For years, food banks have relied on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's bonus commodity program, which buys surplus crops such as peaches and cranberries, as well as livestock such as turkeys, ducks and bison, from domestic farmers. 
   But the amounts of bonus commodities have dropped. Five years ago, the department bought more than $200 million worth of surplus products. In 2005, that figure fell to $154 million. This year, the agency is projecting $58 million. 
   ``The reason that they're down, obviously, is that the farm market is doing very well,'' said Nancy M. Johner, undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer services. 
   Johner said farmers are selling more of their products internationally. That trend, coupled with a severe drought that affected much of the country this year, has left farmers with relatively few surplus crops, she said. 
   This is difficult news for food pantries and soup kitchens in the Washington region, where the Capital Area Food Bank estimates that more than 600,000 residents are at risk of hunger. 
   Bread for the City, one of the District's largest pantries, has served about 2,000 more families this year than in 2006, executive director George Jones said. 
   ``It's a big jump,'' he said. ``A lot of these families are people that have some resources, are housed, and use our resources to augment their incomes. They really are living on the edge.'' 
   With gasoline prices and utility rates rising and the economy softening amid a mortgage crisis, many of the region's working families are struggling to pay their bills and are seeking help at food banks and soup kitchens. 
   Bertina Fox used to donate clothing to Bread for the City. The 29-year-old from Northwest Washington said she never imagined she would someday come asking for food. But when she quit her job at an AIDS clinic earlier this year, she began coming to Bread for the City each month for a basket of fish and vegetables, as well as frozen pizzas and chicken nuggets for her 5-year-old son. 
   ``When I fell on hard times, I knew of the services there,'' she said. ``A lot of people can't make it day to day without them. I'm certainly one of those people.''  
   Fox was to start a new job at an area hospital yesterday. Once back on her feet, Fox said, she hopes to start donating to the center again.   
   More Families Seek Aid  
   More people are requesting emergency food aid and more homeless families with children are seeking shelter, concludes a 23-city survey released Monday by the U.S. Conference of Mayors. 
   Four of five cities say requests for food aid rose an average of 12% from the previous year, according to the survey for the period covering November 2006 through October 2007. Most cities had reported a jump in such requests the prior year as well. 
   Ten of 14 cities with data on homeless families say more families with children sought emergency shelter and transitional housing. About half of the cities say their overall homeless problem increased. Collectively, the cities report giving shelter to 193,183 people. 
   ``We're heading in the wrong direction because of poverty, unemployment and housing costs,'' says Trenton Mayor Douglas Palmer, president of the mayors conference. He added that the full effects of record mortgage foreclosures have yet to be seen. The report does cite some progress. Of 11 cities with data on homeless adults seeking shelter, five--Louisville; Nashville; Philadelphia; Portland, Ore., and Seattle--report a decline. Also, the length of stays in shelters and transitional housing for single adults and families shortened. 
   Last month, the federal government reported a 12% decline in the number of chronically homeless adults who live on the streets or in emergency shelters. The number fell to 155,623 in January 2006 from 175,914 in January 2005, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (WAIVING REQUIREMENT OF CLAUSE 6(a) OF RULE XIII WITH RESPECT TO CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN RESOLUTIONS -- (House of Representatives - December 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, H. Res. 873 waives clause 6(a) of rule XIII, which requires a two-thirds vote to consider a rule on the same day it is reported from the Rules Committee. This waiver would apply to any rule reported on December 17 that provides for consideration of the omnibus appropriations bill or the Senate-amended energy bill. Madam Speaker, the Rules Committee has reported a separate rule for the energy bill, but the House is not expected to take up the Senate-amended energy bill tonight. 
   With passage of this rule, the House will move one step closer to passing the omnibus appropriations bill that will fund the government outside of the Department of Defense, which we have already funded. It's an important bill, and although it is not everything I wanted, I believe it deserves to be approved in its current form. 
   Madam Speaker, Democrats took over the majority in the House and the Senate with a promise of a new direction for America. The House moved an aggressive and positive agenda forward, including the timely consideration and passage of the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bills. Unfortunately, the President and the Republican leadership of the House and the Senate are still stuck in the past. Instead of working with Democrats in moving towards a new direction, the Republican leaders in the House and Senate did everything they possibly could to delay and obstruct the process until we had no option but to bring an omnibus appropriations bill to the floor. 
   In fact, the Senate minority leader, Senator McConnell, actively blocked consideration of these appropriations bills. Why would the Republican leadership block these bills from even being considered in the Senate? The answer, Madam Speaker, is that they were playing politics. Instead of allowing important funding for our roads and bridges, funding for the sick and the hungry, funding to protect our food system and funding for homeland security, the Republican leadership decided to block these funds to try to score political points. 
   So when my friends on the other side of the aisle complain that we are not considering these bills individually, remember that they were the ones that prevented us from doing just that. That's unfortunate but it's reality. The reality is that because of Senate rules, it takes 60 votes to order pizza, let alone to consider and vote on important pieces of legislation. 
   All told, the Democratic majority wanted to pass appropriations bills that were fully paid for and that increased spending by $22 billion over the President's request. The President and his allies here in Congress said, No, no, that's too much. That's too much for education, too much for health care, too much for medical research, too much for veterans. The irony, of course, is that the President continues to ask for hundreds of billions of dollars for the war in Iraq, none of it paid for. Billions to patch the alternative minimum tax, none of it paid for. 
   Some of my Republican friends, as I read in the press, are now proclaiming a great ``victory'' because the omnibus bill meets the President's top-line number. Let's take a look at that. 
   Because of the Republicans, there will be fewer medical research grants at NIH than Democrats would have liked. ``Congratulations,'' I guess. 
   Because of Republicans, there will be fewer cops on the beat than Democrats would have liked. ``Job well done,'' I suppose. 
   Because of the Republicans, there is less funding for important education programs that Democrats would have liked. ``Mission accomplished,'' my Republican friends. 
   The fact is that this Republican so-called ``victory'' is hollow at best. And I've been wracking my brain all day, but I just can't remember the Republican campaign commercial from last fall that said, ``Vote for me and I'll follow the President off the cliff and spend billions more in Iraq while I cut domestic priorities.'' Maybe that commercial did exist and it just didn't run in Massachusetts. 
   Despite all of that and despite the Republican obstruction, Chairman Obey has put together a bill that makes important new investments in our national priorities. More money than the President wanted for medical research and rural health. More money than the President wanted for K-12 education. More money than the President wanted for renewable energy and energy efficiency. More money than the President wanted for homeland security, for local law enforcement, for our crumbling infrastructure. And perhaps most importantly, more money than the President wanted and requested for our veterans. All of that changed, all of that progress because of this new Democratic majority. 
   Madam Speaker, unlike last year, we are getting our work done. We are completing our appropriations bills, not kicking the can down the road with another continuing resolution, which is what the Republicans did last year when they controlled both Houses of Congress and the White House, I should add. And the same-day rule before us takes us one step closer to making that happen. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I would just like to respond to the gentleman. 
   He talks about process. Let's compare where we are this year compared to where we were last year, when the Republicans had the majority in this Congress. What they did is they avoided doing their work and, instead, they passed a continuing resolution that took us into the following year, and they ran out of town. They left Washington before they had finished their job for the year. That is the process that they had. 
   What we are doing right now is trying to bring up the omnibus bill today, and we would have liked to have done it differently, but unfortunately there are Republicans in the House and there are Republicans especially in the Senate who chose to be obstructionists rather than to be partners in trying to get something done. And so here we are. 
   And so I would say that we're not leaving here until we get our job done. And that's very, very different from the way they conducted business. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, the gentleman from Florida has a flair for the dramatic and held up the omnibus appropriations bill that is before us and says he doesn't know what is in it. Let me just highlight a few of the things that are in it that I think people need to know. In that bill there is more money than the President and the Republicans wanted for medical research and for rural health care. And I am grateful for that. And the American people are grateful for that. 
   In that bill, there is more money than the President and the Republicans wanted for K-12 education. All throughout this country, we hear from teachers, principals and superintendents about how No Child Left Behind is not funded. We hear about the need for more funding for special education. There is more money in this bill for K-12 education than the Republicans and the President of the United States wanted, and I am grateful for that. 
   There is more money than the President and Republicans wanted for renewable energy and energy efficiency. We need to get serious about dealing with global warming. We need to get serious about energy independence, but to do so requires that we fund it. For years, we have heard the Republicans talk the talk but not walk the walk. There is more money in this bill than the Republicans and the President wanted. 
   There is more money in this bill than the Republicans and the President wanted for homeland security, for local law enforcement. I mean, if the Republicans had their way, they would be cutting the COPS programs. The fact of the matter is, homeland security also means homeland security, and it means making sure that our cities and our towns have the law enforcement necessary to protect the people who live there. 
   There is more money in this bill than the President wanted and the Republicans wanted for our crumbling infrastructure. Our roads and our bridges are falling apart all across the country. I come from Massachusetts. We have bridges that are older than some of the other States in this country. Our aging infrastructure is in deep need of repair, and it requires funding to repair that infrastructure. There is more money than the Republicans and the President wanted for our infrastructure. 
   There is more money than the President wanted for our veterans. In fact, there is the largest increase in veterans health benefits in the history of the Veterans Administration in this bill. My friends say, Whoa, that's a bipartisan issue, the Republicans wanted it too. Where have you been for 12 years when you were in the majority? It has taken a Democratic majority to pass a bill that provides the largest single-year increase in veterans health benefits in the 77-year history of the VA. 
   There is more money here to help deal with the fact that so many of our people in our country are food insecure, are hungry. Higher food costs mean we need to help those who need help. There is more money for the supplemental nutrition program for women, infants and children, the WIC program. More money than the Republicans and the President wanted. There is more money for the commodities supplemental food program which is important to improving nutrition, more money than the President and the Republicans wanted. 
   Madam Speaker, let me also say, let me remind people why we are where we are at. This House did all of what was required of it to do. We passed all of our appropriations bills. 
   The problem is that we had to fight tooth and nail to pass them in the House here because of Republican obstructionism in the House. But Republican obstructionism in the Senate reached a new level where they actually blocked not only bringing appropriations bills to the floor, but actually moving to conference on a number of occasions. So here we are not content to do what the Republicans did last year, which is to do nothing, to kick the ball down the court, dump all their problems on another Congress and go home. We are going to finish this year's business. And we are going to do so in a way that maybe is not everything that I would have liked to have seen done, but nonetheless represents a dramatic departure from the priorities of the previous Congress.  
   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (VETERANS GUARANTEED BONUS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. I want to thank the gentlelady from New Hampshire for yielding me the time, and I appreciate her work on behalf of veterans and their families. I would also like to recognize my colleague from Pennsylvania, Representative Altmire, for championing this important legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, a little over a month ago we celebrated Veterans Day and were reminded of the men and women who have served our Nation and continue to wear our country's uniform. These brave men and women have volunteered for service with the assurances of health care and benefits for  them and their families. But despite entering into this solemn pledge, far too often our government has unfairly shortchanged our veterans. 
   With our readiness levels considered to be reaching all-time lows, our military has been attracting recruits via monetary incentives. The Department of Defense has been offering signing bonuses to soldiers in order to entice candidates for longer enlistment periods. But in too many cases, our wounded warriors are having their payments cut short or, in some instances, entirely taken away. Soldiers who sustain a combat-related injury and cannot serve out the entirety of their enlistment period are being forced to return part of or all of their bonuses. That is flat wrong. This is a shameful practice that is unjust and in no way reflects how our Nation's heroes ought to be treated. 
   H.R. 3793, the Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act, remedies this unfair practice by requiring the DOD to uphold their part of the deal and fully pay all bonuses to veterans medically discharged due to combat-related wounds. Injuries sustained on the battlefield which prevent a soldier from completing their enlistment period should not be treated like some type of breach of contract. It is reprehensible to ask our wounded warriors to pay back any bonuses afforded them, as they have already sacrificed an amount for which no price can be named. 
   Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of H.R. 3793 and encourage my colleagues to support its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (ELEANOR McGOVERN POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, during the 1972 presidential campaign, Eleanor McGovern inspired the slogan, ``Put another Eleanor in the White House.'' 
   The comparison to Eleanor Roosevelt is an appropriate one because Eleanor McGovern was a trailblazer and a truly great woman. She was an unapologetic liberal Democrat who cared deeply about people and about this planet. 
   She was outspoken in her support for our nation's children--demanding more attention and resources for early childhood development programs and better schools. She understood the importance of focusing on the needs of children beginning at birth. Had she become First Lady, this country's education system would be much improved and our children would be much better served. 
   She believed we should be better stewards of our precious environment long before ``mainstream America'' began to worry about global warming as an issue. Having just returned from a visit to the beautiful and breathtaking Black Hills of South Dakota, I can better understand Eleanor's love for open space and nature. 
   And like her husband George, Eleanor McGovern was a tireless advocate for peace. She campaigned every bit as hard as George to end the tragic war in Vietnam. She felt equally strong that the current war in Iraq was a mistake. 
   As one who got to know Eleanor pretty well over the years, I always enjoyed our talks and valued her insights. She loved to read and knew the issues better than most members of Congress. In fact she would have made an excellent congresswoman, U.S. Senator or even President. 
   Wherever Eleanor was, there were always plenty of books, magazines and newspapers. She underlined passages that held special meaning and she carefully collected magazine articles that she thought would be of use to George. 
   She also loved her gardens. When they lived in Washington, D.C., Eleanor treasured her small garden. She loved not only the flowers, but also the wildlife they attracted. She regularly fed the birds, raccoons and whatever else inhabited their neighborhood. 
   She was a loving mother who raised five incredible children. Sadly, her daughter Terry died after years of struggling with alcoholism. That terrible tragedy was heartbreaking for all of us who knew Terry, but it took a heavy toll on both Eleanor and George. 
   Eleanor loved George and George loved her. There is no way he would have become a U.S. Congressman or Senator or Presidential nominee without Eleanor. Her intellect, her love for this country and her respect for George were essential throughout her career. 
   Millions of Americans got to know and admire Eleanor in 1972. She campaigned with great enthusiasm for the McGovern-Shriver ticket--often on her own. She was not content to merely pose for pictures with her husband--instead, she gave speeches, attended rallies, appeared on political talk shows and contributed to policy discussions. 
   I will always believe that our country missed out by not electing George McGovern as president in 1972. It's not just because George would have made a superb president, but also because Eleanor would have been an incredible first lady. She would have been an ambassador for all that is good and decent about our country. 
   I am deeply grateful to my colleague from South Dakota, STEPHANIE HERSETH SANDLIN, for her leadership in naming Postal Service facility at 202 South Dumont Avenue in Woonsocket, South Dakota as the ``Eleanor McGovern Post Office Building'' and for her recognition of Eleanor's many contributions. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2654. 
   In closing, let me say very simply--what this world needs is more Eleanor McGoverns.  
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, let me say at the outset that I always enjoy listening to my colleague from Washington State, Mr. Hastings, both on the floor and in the Rules Committee. 
   I want to respond to a couple of things he said. He talked about the Democrats and taxes. Let me remind him that the biggest tax increase that is looming that could impact small businesses is the alternative minimum tax, or so-called AMT. And the Democratic majority is actually working on a solution so that millions of Americans won't be unfairly burdened with that tax. That is an issue that, when the gentleman's party was in the majority, they chose not to deal with. And the Democrats will deal with that. 
   Let me say one other thing, Madam Speaker. It is always interesting to hear the gentleman from Washington complain about the rule.     
   Let me state for my colleagues, both Democrat and Republican, that every single germane amendment that was offered to this bill was made in order by the Rules Committee. That is something that very rarely happened when the gentleman's party was in the majority. So I think this is a good rule. 
   He complains that a nongermane amendment was not made in order, one that deals not with the issue of loans, which the underlying bill deals with, but instead the Buyer amendment deals with contracting. And the gentleman says that we need to do this for our veterans. Well, I want to do all we can for our veterans, and maybe in the right vehicle we can deal with that issue. But I also want to point out to my colleagues here in Congress that when the gentleman's party was in control, veterans health and veterans benefits were woefully underfunded. I mean, we are dealing with scandals at Walter Reed. We are dealing with scandals all over the country dealing with veterans health because of the inadequacy of the funding that came out of the Republican majority, budget after budget after budget after budget. 
   The Democrats take control and have literally pumped billions of dollars more into veterans programs, including veterans health programs. And I will say to the gentleman from Washington that today he will have the opportunity, in the conference report on the supplemental appropriations bill, to vote for a conference report that adds  even billions of dollars more to help our veterans. So if people are concerned about helping our veterans, then they will have an opportunity this afternoon to vote that way.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I would like to reclaim my time, if I may. 
   What the gentleman knows full well is that even with an open rule, the Buyer amendment would still not be germane and subject to a point of order by any Member of this House. I mean, we have germaneness rules for a reason. 
   Let me also point out another interesting fact that I think my colleagues should remember. The gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey), during the last Congress, time and time and time again went before the Republican Rules Committee asking for a waiver on an amendment that would repeal the tax cut for the top 1 percent income earners in this country, the multibillionaires, if you will, so that those savings could be put into veterans programs. He needed a germaneness waiver. Time and time and time again, the Republican Rules Committee denied him the right to offer that amendment. 
   Now, I guess my point is that it is a little bit curious that the gentleman voted routinely to uphold the germaneness rules with regard to amendments to help veterans in the past, but now somehow is complaining that we need a different standard now that they are in the minority. 
   Madam Speaker, I would simply say that this is a fair rule. Every germane amendment that was offered is made in order. Anybody could have offered an amendment. And this is something that was very rarely afforded to us when we were in the minority. And I think it is a good rule. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, let me begin by responding to a couple things the gentleman from Washington said. 
   First of all, on the issue of veterans funding, I don't know too many people who will get up and say that the funding under the previous majority for veterans was anywhere near adequate. The fact of the matter is we have more and more veterans each and every day as a result of the wars that we are involved with. The number of disabled veterans has gone up, and we have seen the direct impact of underfunding veterans health with the terrible tragedy at Walter Reed and so many of our other hospitals. 
   That is one of the reasons why, when the Democratic majority took over this place in January, one of the first items of business was to increase veterans health. And in the conference report on the supplemental appropriations bill that is coming before us today, there are billions of dollars more for veterans health. If you want to help veterans, vote for the money. It is not about rhetoric; it is about action. 
   Secondly, in terms of fiscal policies, I think there was a reason for the result in the last elections. I think Americans, Democrats and Republicans, were horrified with the fiscal policies of the previous Republican majority. We went from huge surpluses under Bill Clinton and a huge economic boom under Bill Clinton to now record deficits. We have the largest debt in the history of our country. And I think most Americans, no matter what their party affiliation is, have been justifiably horrified by that result. They want a change. They want fiscal responsibility. That is why we are back to pay-as-you-go, and that is why we are for responsible tax relief. And that is what the Democratic majority is going to pursue. 
   Madam Speaker, the Small Business Lending Improvements Act will go a long way towards strengthening our Nation's small businesses by establishing much-needed improvements to the SBA's primary loan programs. Today we have an opportunity to encourage entrepreneurship, particularly for those who are socially or economically disadvantaged and those who  serve our Nation in the Armed Forces, and provide some additional opportunities for small business owners looking to expand. 
   I want to again commend my colleague from New York (Ms. Vel&#225;zquez) for her leadership in bringing this promising and long overdue legislation to the floor. 
   I think this is a fair rule. Everybody who wanted to offer a germane amendment to this bill could have done so. All the germane amendments are made in order. That is somewhat of a departure from the previous Congress, where we were routinely handed closed rules. So I would urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished Chair of the Rules Committee for yielding me the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want this war to come to an end now. I had reservations when I voted in support of the supplemental a few weeks ago, and I have misgivings about the conference report that is before us today. I believe very deeply that this war represents one of the biggest blunders in our history and that we must change course and bring it to an end. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, to defeat this conference report tonight would provide President Bush with a victory that he does not deserve and that he has not earned, and it would affirm a disastrous policy in Iraq. A vote against this conference report is a vote to support the status quo, which is essentially a vote to support a failed policy. 
   Since the President decided to escalate the war in Iraq, the violence has gotten worse. This administration has demonstrated a contempt for the American people, who have demanded a change in our Iraq policy. 
   Mr. Speaker, this President is presiding over a policy and a war in Iraq that is making the United States more vulnerable, not more secure. He refuses to listen. He refuses to acknowledge the facts. He refuses to compromise. 
   Now he has threatened to veto this conference report. And if he does so, then this President will make perfectly clear to the American people that the only way this war is going to end, the only way our troops will ever come home to their families and loved ones, the only way the Iraqis will ever be held accountable for governing their own country and ending their sectarian violence, will be if Congress finds a way to end it. 
   Every day it becomes more and more clear that the President has decided to kick the ball down the field to make this war somebody else's problem. Two years ago, President Bush announced his exit strategy for Iraq. He said, ``That's a problem for the next President.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, that is unacceptable and it is false. It is a problem for all of us. None of us in this Chamber wake up each morning in harm's way. None of us stare death in the eye or see our comrades fall to bullets and bombs. Not even the Green Zone provides a sense of security any longer. 
   Instead of demanding reconciliation, we are building walls to keep Shiites away from Sunnis. Every day, thousands of Iraqis are fleeing the horror that has become their country. The best and the brightest are leaving. The average shopkeeper, the next-door neighbor, all are packing their bags and trying to find a way out of town, out of the country, away from the violence, the death and destruction. 
   Mr. Speaker, the reality is that whenever we finally leave Iraq, it will not be pretty. This failed policy has left Iraq with few options. But until we begin to leave, no one has to make the hard choices about how Iraqis are going to live together or die together. 
   Mr. Speaker, this terrible chapter in our history must come to an end, and I urge all my colleagues to join with me in saying to the President of the United States, enough is enough.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5781, FEDERAL EMPLOYEES PAID PARENTAL LEAVE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, H. Res. 1277 provides a structured rule for consideration of H.R. 5781, the Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act of 2008. The resolution provides 1 hour of debate controlled by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and makes in order one of the two amendments submitted for consideration. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this rule and of the underlying legislation, H.R. 5781, the Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act of 2008, which in my opinion is a sensible, compassionate bill that provides Federal employees with 4 weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child. 
   Today the Federal Government does not offer any paid time off specifically to care for an infant or newly adopted child. If a Federal employee needs time to take care of the newest addition to their family, their only option for paid leave is to use their accrued sick days and vacation time. 
   This policy is unfair and disadvantageous to relatively new Federal employees or those who have experienced extended health problems. Having a policy that assumes Federal employees will not get sick or take vacation is unsound and needs to be rectified. 
   Paid parental leave for Federal workers is long overdue, and it is a shame that the Federal Government, our country's largest employer, has not provided it yet. The Federal Government ought to set the standard as a family-friendly workplace, and not fall behind. 
   And even more especially in this economic downturn, the Federal Government needs to step up and provide its families with paid leave. It is unconscionable, Madam Speaker, to ask parents to choose between their job and their new child in these harsh economic times. 
   With two full-time working parents being the standard nowadays, forcing families to lose one salary while they face astronomical food and energy prices is unacceptable. 
   Now some may claim that we are expanding the total amount of time a Federal employee may take off to care for a new child. Let me be clear, this bill does not expand the amount of leave currently available to Federal employees. This bill simply allows for 4 weeks of paid leave out of the 12 weeks that Federal employees currently receive under the Family and Medical Leave Act. The bill does not expand the total amount of time a person may take off under FMLA, and any claims to the contrary are simply false. 
   Madam Speaker, it is also important to note that this legislation will not affect the strength of our Nation's military. Since the Armed Forces set their own policies for leave, active duty soldiers are exempt from H.R. 5781. However, this legislation will provide 4 weeks of paid leave to the 400,000 civilian employees of the Department of Defense that serve with our armed forces at military bases across the country and around the world. 
   We depend on these mothers and fathers to make America safe, and providing them with 4 weeks of paid leave to care for their child is a much needed and much-deserved benefit. 
   Lastly, providing paid parental leave is a good recruitment tool for the Federal Government. In order to attract the best and the brightest and retain talent in our Federal workforce, Congress must provide important incentives like paid parental leave. I encourage my colleagues to stand up for families by supporting this rule and the underlying bill. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I just want to respond by saying that Members on both sides of the aisle like to talk about family values all the time. Well, this is an effort that actually puts some real action behind those words. This is about helping families. I find it somehow puzzling that anybody would think this is a radical idea. And I would say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, you know, you have messed up our economy, you have increased financial insecurity amongst working families in this country, you have done everything you can to help the oil companies at the expense of average citizens who are now paying extraordinary prices at the gas tank. I mean, you have put working families at an extreme disadvantage. 
   This is an effort to provide a little bit of relief when somebody has a new baby or adopts a new child. Boy, to think that is a radical idea just to me defies reason. 
   At this time I would like to yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Maloney), the author of this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, let me reiterate something I said earlier in the debate, and that is the Republican Congress and this Republican President have made a mess of this economy. Their legacy is a lousy economy. There are more people every day losing their jobs. Their legacy is that they have left my kids with a $300 billion deficit and a $9.4 trillion debt, the largest debt in the history of the United States of  America. That's their legacy. That's their great economic achievement. 
   Their legacy is basically no energy policy except whatever the oil companies want, and that's what they have done when they were in power. Whatever the oil companies want, the oil companies get. 
   And quite frankly, it kind of took my breath away when I heard my colleague talk about the oil companies as ``our friends.'' Well, with friends like the oil companies, the consumers do not need enemies. 
   In 2002, the profits of the oil companies were at about $30 billion. In 2007, it's $123.3 billion. And yet we have seen rising gas prices. The consumers have been gouged. These oil companies have ripped off the citizens of this country. 
   The fact of the matter is that there are 68 million acres onshore and offshore in the United States that are leased by oil companies open to drilling and actually under lease, but they're not developed. They have 68 million acres. The fact is if oil companies tapped the 68 million Federal acres of leased land, it could generate an estimated 4.8 million barrels of oil a day, six times what ANWR would produce at its peak. 
   The fact is 80 percent of the oil available on the Outer Continental Shelf is in regions that are already open to leasing, but the oil companies have not decided it's worth their time to drill there. 
   The fact is that drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge wouldn't yield any oil for 10 years and then would only save the consumer 1.8 cents per gallon in 2025. The bottom line is, Madam Speaker, is that these oil companies choose not to drill for more oil. They choose instead to do what they're doing and put the burden on the American consumer. 
   I have heard the issue about we need to expand refinery capacity. Well, we currently have excess oil refinery capacity. According to the Energy Information Administration, our refineries are currently running at 88 percent capacity, well below the 95 to 98 percent capacity, use rates we've seen this time of year for the last decade. 
   Now, no new oil refineries have been built in the last 30 years because major oil companies have not sought to build them. They have the ability. They've not sought to build them. ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, BP, and Shell have publicly stated that they have no plans to build new refineries. Instead, they prefer to expand existing facilities. Shell, ConocoPhillips, and BP all testified that they were unaware of any environmental regulations preventing them from building new refineries or expanding existing ones. So there is nothing in the way that's preventing them from expansion. 
   And internal memos from oil companies make it clear that oil companies have decided that they needed to reduce refinery capacity to drive up their profits. They don't care. They don't care about the consumer. All they care about is profits. And for too long, our energy policy under the Republican Congress and this Republican President has been to give the oil companies whatever they want. We have done that, and we are now paying the price. 
   I should also point out that this Congress has enacted a number of pieces of legislation to try to deal with this issue. Interestingly enough, most of them have been either vetoed or threatened to be vetoed by the President. It's also interesting to note that among those that the President has threatened to veto are legislation that would take away the tax breaks and subsidies that we provide Big Oil, the companies that are making record profits, and put that into renewable clean forms of energy. That's what the administration is aghast at. They can't believe that we'd want to take away taxpayer subsidies to Big Oil, the companies that are now ripping off the American consumer, and put that into alternative energy research and development so that we're not so reliant on oil and we could become more energy independent. 
   We have tried to take the lead on energy independence in this Congress, but we have run into roadblocks by the Republicans here in the House, Republicans in the Senate, and this administration. 
   I would also point out that the American people get it. One of the reasons why Republicans are losing elections is because the American people are fed up with their policies. They want a new direction, and they will get a new direction come November with an expanded Democratic majority here in the House and in the Senate and a Democratic President. 
   Finally, Madam Speaker, let me just once again reiterate to my colleagues the importance of the underlying legislation. The Federal Employees Paid Parents Leave Act does not change the fundamental principles of the Family and Medical Leave Act in any way. The bill does not expand the number of weeks of leave available to workers under FMLA, the bill does not expand the number of employees who are eligible for FMLA leave, and the bill does not grant employees any additional sick leave. 
   For Federal employees who are currently entitled to FMLA coverage, this bill would simply allow them to be paid for four of those weeks if used for parental use, if used to care for a newborn child or a newly adopted child. I mean, this to me is common sense. This is the right thing to do. 
   As I said, Members talk all the time about family values. Well, here is our chance to show that we mean what we say. I would urge my colleagues to support the underlying bill. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. I thank the chairwoman for yielding to me. 
   Mr. Speaker, the rule allows for the supplemental to be considered in two parts. Part 1 is funding for the war and Iraq, and part 2 includes expanded benefits for GI education, expanded unemployment compensation, disaster relief, food aid, and other measures. 
   I want to begin also, Mr. Speaker, by thanking Chairman Obey for his incredible leadership in trying to forge a decent and fair compromise. He has more patience than I. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me start with talking about amendment No. 2. I strongly support the measures contained in this amendment. It expands the GI benefits for the education of our veterans, including those serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, and extends them more equitably for all of our service branches, including the Guard and Reserves. 
   The amendment also extends unemployment benefits by up to 13 weeks in every State for workers who have exhausted their benefits.  
   It places a moratorium on six Medicaid regulations, the costs of which are fully offset. 
   It provides emergency funding to meet critical needs, especially in addressing the global food crisis and disaster and refugee assistance. 
   It includes many other measures, Mr. Speaker, that are worth supporting, that are important, that are vital, and so I urge all my colleagues to support amendment No. 2. 
   Let me now just say a few words about funding for the war in Iraq, Mr. Speaker. 
   Under amendment No. 1, funding for the Iraq war is provided without conditions, a blank check, with no requirements about how or when we might begin removing our military forces from Iraq or prohibiting the Bush administration from moving forward with a Status of Forces Agreement that could tie the hands of the next administration to design a new policy and a new future with Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, how can anyone in this Chamber give this President another blank check for the war in Iraq? This is the same President who rushed us into war under false pretenses. There were no weapons of mass destruction and no ties to al Qaeda. Everything he and his administration have told us has been wrong. Where is the accountability? 
   For me, this is one compromise too many. It represents one cave-in too many. It asks Congress to roll over and be blind to the consequences of the war for the next 9 months or so. 
   Five years after the invasion of Iraq, the Bush administration continues the occupation of Iraq with no end in sight. More than 4,500 American soldiers and tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians have been killed, and over 30,000 Americans wounded. 
   It is long past time for a change in course, and this bill does absolutely nothing to bring that about. 
   This is George Bush's war, and he should end it while he is still President. 
   I urge my colleagues in the strongest possible terms to oppose this amendment, amendment No. 1, and demand that this President and his administration begin the safe and orderly withdrawal of our troops from Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H. RES. 734 EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING WITHHOLDING OF INFORMATION RELATING TO CORRUPTION IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I regret that the intransigence and stonewalling by the Bush administration of Congress' oversight responsibilities have made this legislation necessary. 
   H. Res. 734 rightfully expresses the sense of the House that the Department of State has abused its classification authority by withholding from Congress and the American people information about the extent of corruption in the Iraqi Government. This resolution criticizes the State Department for retroactively classifying public documents that have previously been widely distributed as unclassified. 
   It also calls upon the State Department to rescind its directive that orders officials not to answer questions in an open committee hearing that might characterize the situation of corruption in the Iraqi Government. 
   What is the background on this, Madam Speaker? On October 4, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held a hearing on corruption in Iraq. Mr. Stuart Bowen, the Special Inspector General for Iraq, and Mr. David Walker, the Comptroller General of the United States with the Government Accountability Office, testified that entrenched corruption in the Iraqi Government is fueling the insurgency, undermining the chances of political reconciliation and endangering our troops. Judge Radhi Hamza al-Radhi, the former head of Iraq's own Commission on Public Integrity, stated that his work documented $18 billion stolen by corrupt officials. He also testified that Prime Minister Maliki personally intervened to block further investigations and prosecutions of his relatives and political allies from going forward. 
   Concern about endemic corruption in the Iraqi Government should be of great concern to every single Member of this House. It raises a fundamental question: Is the Iraq Government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Maliki, too corrupt to succeed? 
   It should definitely concern the White House and the State Department. So how did the Bush administration respond? 
   The State Department took the extraordinary step of retroactively classifying corruption reports by its own officials, and even portions of a GAO report already released by Mr. Walker. 
   State Department witnesses appearing before the committee refused to answer even the most basic questions about corruption in Iraq in open session. 
   So imagine my surprise when I opened this morning's Washington Post to find that the State Department told the press yesterday that official corruption in Iraq is ``real, endemic and pernicious,'' and remains a major challenge to building a functioning, stable democracy. 
   Now that wasn't in a classified setting; it was on a conference call with reporters. So it is okay to make such statements to the press but not to a congressional committee? 
   Madam Speaker, we are not talking about state secrets on how to carry out attacks against al Qaeda in Iraq. We are talking about corruption. Government corruption. There is no reason for stonewalling Congress, especially when the topic is discussed freely with reporters in a conference call. 
   Quite simply, Madam Speaker, the Bush administration has abused the classification system and demonstrated its contempt of congressional oversight and accountability. More than 3,800 of our troops have been killed in Iraq and more than 28,000 wounded. Let me repeat that. More than 3,800 of our troops have been killed in Iraq and more than 28,000 wounded. 
   What kind of an Iraqi Government are they fighting for? I think their families and their military comrades deserve to know. President Bush is asking Congress to give him another $150 billion for the war. I think Congress and the American people deserve to know the extent of corruption within the Iraqi Government and how that might affect our chances of success in Iraq.  
   Madam Speaker, the facts about corruption may be embarrassing for the Iraqi Government, but they do not meet the test for secret classification.     
   Every newspaper in America has written stories on corruption in Iraq. Classifying previously released public documents, silencing public officials so that Congress and the American people are unable to get a complete picture, the good and the bad, about corruption in Iraq serve no legitimate purpose. 
   Any Member, Madam Speaker, who stands up on the House floor and says they're against corruption in Iraq has to vote for this measure. 
   The fact is that our occupation of Iraq is, occupation of Iraq is now in its fifth year. For four of those years, when Republicans were in control of Congress, they did nothing and said nothing about corruption. They were silent, while hundreds of billions of dollars were funneled to a government who I wouldn't trust to tell me the correct time. 
   Madam Speaker, talk is cheap, and if you're against corruption, then you should vote for this resolution. The problem is that for too long in this Congress there have been some who have been apologists for bad behavior. They have looked the other way while they have known that corruption in the Iraqi Government has been an increasing problem, not a decreasing problem. 
   So I would say to my friends on the other side of the aisle that if, in fact, you want to change the behavior of the Iraqi Government, if you want to stop the silence and the inaction that characterized your control of this Congress when it came to the issue of corruption in Iraq, then you need to vote for this resolution. The administration's actions need to be denounced and rescinded. 
   I would urge my colleagues to stand up finally and belatedly and do the right thing and support H. Res. 734.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON S. CON. RES. 70, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1214 provides for consideration of the conference report to accompany S. Con. Res. 70, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2009. 
   House resolution 1214 is a traditional conference report rule. It waives all points of order against the conference report and against its consideration and provides that the conference report shall be considered as read. The rule provides for 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Committee on the Budget. 
   Mr. Speaker, budgets are moral documents. They are more than just an accounting of expenditures and revenue. They are statements of our national values and priorities. For too long Congress passed budgets with the wrong priorities. For too long the budget put the interests of the powerful before the needs of working families and those going through hard times. And for too long the budgets of the past pretended that people who were struggling didn't even exist, let alone matter. 
   That has changed now. This Congress, the New Direction Congress, is saying that we value our families and their economic future. This Congress will fight to make sure that their hard work is rewarded and that the American Dream is renewed. 
   This 5-year budget conference agreement charts a new way forward for the country. It makes investments in energy, education, and infrastructure. It provides tax relief for the middle class. It returns the budget to surplus in 2012 and 2013. And it remembers those whose service and sacrifice here at home and abroad provide the rest of us with security and peace of mind. Mr. Speaker, this is a budget with a conscience. 
   Today, as we move to pass this conference agreement on the budget, our country faces major challenges: an economic recession, a crisis in the credit markets, a plunging housing market, rising unemployment, declining family income, skyrocketing costs in health care, aging infrastructure, and a safety net struggling to keep up with the growing number of Americans unable to meet their most basic needs. 
   Faced with these challenges, President Bush and his Republican colleagues proposed the same tired, failed economic and fiscal policies. After 7 years the Bush legacy is the highest deficits in our Nation's history. The Bush legacy is the greatest national debt in our Nation's history. Future generations, our children and our grandchildren, will be forced to pay the  price for this unprecedented rise in debt, a legacy of President George Bush and the Republicans' reckless and irresponsible policies. 
   With this budget resolution, Mr. Speaker, the Democrats are ready to take the necessary steps, as difficult as they may be, to regain our economic health and reclaim our children's future. It is a balanced budget with balanced priorities. 
   It returns the budget to balance with projected surpluses in 2012 and 2013 by adhering to fiscally responsible policies. It strengthens the U.S. economy over the long term while calling for funds to help Americans struggling in the current economic downturn. It rejects, and I repeat, it rejects the Republicans' harmful cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, the Community Development Block Grant program, and LIHEAP. And it protects priorities like SCHIP, infrastructure needs, homeland security, innovation, energy, education, health care, veterans, and the environment. 
   This budget agreement does not include any tax increases, despite the overheated claims of the other side. Quite the contrary, it supports significant tax relief, including extension of marriage penalty relief, the child tax credit, the 10 percent bracket, and allowing for estate tax reform. It includes an additional year of relief for the alternative minimum tax that is fully paid for, Mr. Speaker. And it provides for property tax relief, energy and education tax relief, and extenders. 
   Finally, this budget remembers those who serve at home and abroad. It provides strong and substantial funding for national defense, including quality of life for our troops and their families. It provides more funding for homeland security programs, including first responders, more than the President would. It provides for the care and treatment of all of our veterans but most especially our newest generation of veterans, those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, many of whom are grievously wounded and thousands who will require treatment for posttraumatic stress and serious depression. Finally, Mr. Speaker, it rejects President Bush's cynical new fees for veterans health care. 
   In short, Mr. Speaker, this budget charts a new direction for a stronger, safer, more compassionate America. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are two significant differences between the House- and Senate-passed budgets which this conference report resolves. First were the reconciliation revisions to the alternative minimum tax. And the second is the level of nondefense discretionary funding. 
   On reconciliation, the conference agreement drops the House-passed reconciliation instructions. Instead, it provides for 1 year of AMT relief that is fully paid for. The House will continue to work with the Senate to identify how to pay for permanent relief of the AMT. In the House such a solution is subject to our PAYGO rules of order and must be fully offset. With the passage of this conference report, any AMT fix offered in the Senate that increases the deficit by $10 billion in a year will also be subject to a Senate point of order. 
   On nondefense discretionary spending, the difference between the House and Senate budgets was $3.6 billion, and the conference agreement splits the difference. By holding most nonsecurity spending to a modest 1 percent above inflation, we are able to move the budget out of deficit and into surplus by the year 2012 while still providing substantially greater investment in education, income security, veterans, and natural resources. 
   I urge my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, to adopt this rule and to approve the conference agreement on the fiscal year 2009 budget resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I would just simply respond to the gentleman by saying we have proposed many meaningful measures to try to deal with not only the current energy prices but also to come up with a long-term plan so that we are not so reliant on foreign oil. Unfortunately, it's difficult to get things done with Republican obstructionism and a President who vetoes everything. Any good idea to invest more in renewable clean alternative energy sources, to further develop second or third generation biofuels, this President objects to. The only thing he likes is if we give more to the oil companies. 
   We had the DICK CHENEY ``secret energy task force,'' which we don't know all the details because the public was denied access to this information. But we do know this, that the outcome of that was more of the same. More drilling, more drilling, more reliance on oil, more reliance on oil. The same old, same old. We are done with that. We are done with that. 
   I should remind everybody that when George Bush became President, a gallon of gasoline was $1.47. Now it's in excess of $3.79. In some places, over $4. So that is what has resulted from their policies and their obstructionism. As I said before, and I will say it again, the good news is the American people get it. They are tired of it. That is why we are seeing in hard-core Republican congressional districts Democratic victories. Things are changing. 
   I reserve my time, Mr. Speaker.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, before yielding to the next speaker, I would just respond by saying to my friends on the other side of the aisle, you have had your chance. You were in control of this institution for many years and you had a Republican President, and what you did was create a situation, the one we are in right now, where we have the largest debt in the history of the United States of America. 
   The American people have rejected very clearly your policies and they are looking for a new direction, and that is what Democrats are going to offer.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I am going to urge my colleagues to support this rule and to support the budget. It is amusing to hear my friends on the Republican side try to offer solutions on how to deal with the energy crisis, when they created it. This is their responsibility. This is a direct result of their failed policies; not investing in clean, renewable alternative energy sources; not building the necessary infrastructure to cultivate these new forms of energy; not investing in second and third generation biofuels. Instead, their policies have been the same old, same old. 
   My friend from Florida talks about ANWR. Boy, what a creative idea. Let's rely on the oil companies, the same companies that are gouging American taxpayers each and every day, making record profits. Let's do what they want us to do. Maybe the time has come to set a new direction. 
   With regard to this budget, our budget I think represents responsible governing. Their budgets, when they could ever actually pass budgets--and, by the way, when they were in charge they very rarely did; they especially couldn't muster votes during an election year--represent what I believe is irresponsible governing. They spent a ton of money. They spent too much money, by the way, on oil company subsidies and tax breaks, more and more to the oil companies. They spent too much on the wealthiest Americans, who didn't need any help, who weren't struggling. They spent too much on a misguided war in Iraq that we should never have fought to begin with. And they paid for all of this by passing the costs on to future generations by borrowing from other countries. We are more in debt because of their leadership to China and to India and to other countries. 
   Enough is enough. Again, that is why you are seeing in these hard-core Republican congressional districts Democrats winning, because the American people, Democrats and Republicans and independents, have had it with the Republican priorities. 
   Let me just close by reminding my colleagues that within this budget there are important investments, smart energy investments. This conference agreement on the budget provides $7.7 billion in funding for renewable energy, energy efficiency and other energy programs, which is, by the way, $2.8 billion more than the 2008 level. This budget, this Democratic budget, rejects President Bush's budget cuts to energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, including his proposed cuts to the solar energy program, and we reject his suggestion that we terminate the weatherization assistance program. Boy, talk about going in the wrong direction. 
   This budget, Mr. Speaker, invests $2 billion to create ``green collar'' jobs in our Nation's communities, because Democrats understand that not only do we need to be better stewards of our environment and become energy independent, but we also realize that there is the potential to create countless jobs in the area of environmental technologies. And this budget, Mr. Speaker, also includes a deficit neutral reserve fund to accommodate legislation that provides tax incentives for renewable energy or energy efficiency. 
   This is a good budget. If you want to deal not only with the short-term issues involving energy, but the long-term issues, then this is the budget you should vote for.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE MODERN STATE OF ISRAEL -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the founding of the modern State of Israel. 
   Mr. Speaker, just 60 years after its establishment as a modem state, Israel has flourished as a democracy and has proven to be  a close and trusted friend of the United States. I want to associate myself with the remarks of many of my colleagues, especially those of the Honorable Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and the Honorable Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs Howard Berman. 
   The founding of Israel is a very emotional issue, Mr. Speaker, not just for those who are Jewish by religion and heritage, but for everyone who loves democracy, and who can empathize with the pain of exile, the horror of unfathomable hatred, repression and discrimination, and the yearning for home. 
   In preparing for this anniversary, I came across a copy of the letter signed by President Harry Truman on May 14, 1948 recognizing the new state of Israel. Its simple words reverberate even today: ``This Government has been informed that a Jewish state has been proclaimed in Palestine, and recognition has been requested by the provisional government thereof. The United States recognizes the provisional government as the de facto authority of the new''--and here it scratches out Jewish state and written in by hand are the words--``State of Israel.'' Signed Harry Truman, Approved, May 14, 1948. 
   For the past 60 years, Israel has represented democracy in a region dominated by mainly authoritarian regimes. Despite a constant struggle for survival, Israel has flourished as a center of innovation in the fields of agriculture, medicine, technology and alternative energy. 
   Like the United States, Israel is a nation of immigrants. Since its inception in 1948, Israel's population has grown five-fold. Despite its small size, it has absorbed millions of immigrants from more than 100 countries. A haven for Jewish refugees from around the world, Israel has helped Jews wherever they suffer from persecution and welcomed them into Israeli society. In the 1990s, when the Soviet Union collapsed, Israel absorbed a massive wave of new immigrants. More than one million Jews from the former Soviet Union immigrated to Israel, changing the face of Israeli society. 
   Currently, Israel's 7.1 million residents represent a mosaic of people with varied ethnic backgrounds, lifestyles, religions, cultures and traditions. As we celebrate Israel's 60th anniversary, Jews now comprise 76 percent of the country's population, while the remainder, mostly Arabs, number about 24 percent. Over 90 percent of the population lives in the urban centers, many of which surround ancient historical sites. Only about 5 percent are members of Israel's unique rural cooperatives--the kibbutz and the moshav. 
   Mr. Speaker, in 2005, I had the privilege of traveling to Israel with then Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. It's a visit I will never forget. We were there at Easter. We visited Bethlehem and the holy sites of Jews, Christians, and Muslims. We touched the same stones that had once been touched by David and Solomon. We walked on streets known to Joshua. We were able to walk freely, to talk to people of all stations and professions. We read a free press and heard a range of views, freely spoken, without fear of reprisal. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have been and always will be a friend of Israel. I celebrate this 60th anniversary of her founding. And I pledge to work with my colleagues to bring peace and security to this very special and unique nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA TO END ITS CRACKDOWN IN TIBET -- (House of Representatives - April 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1077 and I want to thank the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, for her leadership and commitment to the people of Tibet. For many years, in both words and deeds, she has stood by the people of Tibet, and called for the respect and support of their dignity, culture, heritage, and religion. And I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I believe Tibet is one of the most serious human rights and political freedom issues of our time. 
   The violent response by Chinese military forces to peaceful protests that began in the Tibetan capital on March 11th is horrifying. I believe the United States and the international community must convey a strong condemnation of these acts, an accounting by China on the welfare and whereabouts of the many detained Buddhist monks and other Tibetan citizens who have been arrested, and facilitate access by international human rights monitors  and journalists to Tibetan areas, as requested by His Holiness, the Dalai Lama. 
   The State Department's 2007 Country Reports on Human Rights describes a human rights situation in China and Tibet that continues to worsen while the repression of religious freedom has increased. There is very disturbing evidence of a pre-Olympic crackdown on religious leaders, journalists and lawyers in recent months. It is long past time for the government in Beijing to respect the human rights and religion of every Tibetan. Further, as the protests in Tibet began calling for greater economic opportunity and equality, they clearly call into question China's claims that its development of Tibet advances the prosperity of Tibetans as well as the ethnic Chinese Han who have been encouraged to migrate to Tibet and establish themselves there. 
   Since I was first elected to Congress, I have worked with many of my House colleagues to press for greater freedom for Tibet and for the release of Tibetan prisoners of conscience who have been jailed by Chinese authorities, most of whom are imprisoned for their political and cultural beliefs. Personally, I believe Tibet should be restored as an independent nation, which it was prior to China's military invasion over 50 years ago. I deeply fear that China is successfully destroying a culture, religion and national heritage that have survived for thousands of years. 
   The legislation before us this evening calls upon the Government of the People's Republic of China to end its crackdown in Tibet and enter into a substantive dialogue with his holiness the Dalai Lama to find a negotiated solution that respects the distinctive language, 
   culture, religious identify, and fundamental freedoms of all Tibetans. It is not a call for independence. But it is a call for the Chinese Government to respond as a mature member of the international community. I hope that Beijing will understand much is required of a nation that desires to be a leader in regional and international affairs, including the capacity to genuinely negotiate differences and find solutions that are meaningful and acceptable to all. 
   Madam Speaker, I have joined with my congressional colleagues, in a bipartisan fashion, on matters to Chinese authorities about the recent protests in Tibet. Over the past years I have also petitioned the Chinese Government on several individual cases, the most high profile of which would be the safety and well-being of the Pachan Lama. I have also asked my own government, at the highest levels, to advocate for the release of particular prisoners and for greater freedoms for the Tibetan people. I must admit, however, that I am very frustrated by the fact that the United States, like the rest of the international community, appears to voice reverence for the Tibetan culture and religion, while standing idly by and watching it be slowly eroded and dismantled year by year by the Chinese authorities. In the meantime, China continues to pursue its policies in Tibet, knowing there is no price to pay for its actions. 
   This time, Madam Speaker, we must all act differently. There must be consequences for the brutal repression of Tibet. I hope the Chinese Government will heed the message of this resolution. I hope it will open a genuine dialogue with His Holiness the Dalai Lama and negotiate in good faith a just solution with and for the people of Tibet. 
   I promise the sponsors of this bill that I will continue to join them and speak out on these matters and press President Bush, the international community, and the Chinese Government to respect the basic human rights of the Tibetan people. And passage of H. Res. 1077 is the first step in moving this process forward.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, for the purposes of debate only, I yield to my friend from California, the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on Rules, Mr. Dreier, 30 minutes; pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. And during consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purposes of debate only. 
   Mr. Speaker, the rule before us provides 1 hour of general debate in the House equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member on the Committee on Rules. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the resolution and provides that the resolution shall be considered as read. The rule makes in order the amendment printed in the Rules report accompanying this resolution, if offered by Representative Kirk of Illinois or his designee. The amendment shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for 20 minutes equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, and shall not be subject to a demand for a division of the question. The rule also waives all points of order against consideration of the amendment printed in the report, and contains one motion to recommit, which may not contain instructions. Finally, the rule provides that, notwithstanding the operation of the previous question, the Chair may postpone further consideration of the bill to a time designated by the Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me clearly state that there is no obligation for any Member to offer the amendment. The rule simply allows Mr. Kirk or his designee the option of offering this amendment if they choose to do so. 
   Also, Mr. Speaker, the Republicans were given the option to offer a substitute, and they declined. 
   This resolution will amend the House rules and allow the five Delegates who were elected to the House of Representatives to vote in the Committee of the Whole. 
   The Committee of the Whole is comprised of all Members of the House of Representatives, and is a procedural forum in which the House considers debates and votes on amendments to most of the legislation reported out of committee. After consideration of amendments in the Committee of the Whole, legislation is reported to the floor of the House for final consideration. 
   As we all know, Mr. Speaker, Delegates and Resident Commissioner have the same powers, rights and responsibilities as full Members of the House, with some exceptions. They cannot vote on the floor in the House or in the Committee of the Whole, they cannot offer a motion to reconsider, and they are not counted for quorum purposes. 
   Mr. Speaker, this resolution provides certain protections that have been ruled constitutional by Federal courts. Specifically, no Delegate or Resident Commissioner can provide the deciding margin of any amendment considered in the Committee of the Whole. In other words, if the vote in the Committee of the Whole is decided by five or fewer votes, it must be reconsidered immediately by the House of Representatives. 
   Let me state this clearly for all my colleagues. No Delegate or Resident Commissioner will provide the margin of victory or defeat of any amendment. It is that clear. 
   Delegates and the Resident Commissioner will not be able to vote on final passage, nor will they be able to vote on procedural motions. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Delegates and Resident Commissioner represent people who serve in our Armed Forces. Thirty thousand residents of Guam are military personnel. Over 2,400 soldiers from the territories and the District of Columbia are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan today, wars that this Chamber voted in favor of. American Samoa has the highest per capita casualty rate of any State or territory for the war in Iraq. 
   We believe that the people who fight and die wearing the uniform of the United States deserve to have their voices heard in the people's House. 
   Beyond that, Mr. Speaker, residents of all territories and the District of Columbia pay Social Security taxes, Medicare taxes under FICA. The people living in the territories and the District of Columbia deserve to have a voice in Congress, and their elected representatives, the Delegates and the Resident Commissioner, deserve to have a vote in the Committee of the Whole. 
   Mr. Speaker, while these voting privileges are in large part symbolic, and I, for one, believe that the District of Columbia, where people actually pay Federal taxes in addition to all the other contributions that they make to this country, deserve to have full voting rights in this Congress, but this is the least, I think, we can do to restore some modicum of representation to these millions of Americans, and I strongly urge my colleagues to support this rule and vote for the resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

I would remind my colleagues in the House that the one Member of the minority who came before the Rules Committee and offered an amendment, that amendment has been made in order if he so chooses to offer it. 
   So I guess, maybe because this is not a closed rule, it does not fit into the Republican talking points today, they are a little bit upset. But the bottom line is that we on the majority side have done our best to try to accommodate the minority.

   Mr. Speaker, let me also say that it is a little bit difficult for any of us on this side of the aisle to stand here and be lectured about process by the distinguished former chairman of the Rules Committee, to be lectured about transparency, and about how the committee should be run. 
   I recall being in the committee when the USA PATRIOT Act was brought before the Rules Committee, went through a process of regular order, bipartisan process, and then was rewritten in the Rules Committees without anybody knowing what was going on, and then brought to the floor under a very closed process. 
   I remember a special interest provision that magically appeared on a conference report after the report was signed and closed. That is not the process that this new Democratic majority wants to be like.

   Mr. McGOVERN. I reclaim my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I could be here all day, all week, all month and perhaps all year documenting and listing occasion after occasion after occasion where the former majority, I think, broke the rules of this House and did a great disservice to the rules of this House. 
   We have done our best to accommodate the minority on this rule. They had the opportunity to offer a substitute, they declined. An amendment that was brought before the Rules Committee has been made in order. If they don't want to offer it, they don't have to offer it. In fact, if they don't want it in the rule, we have made the offer that if they want to offer an amendment to strike the Kirk provision, they can offer an amendment on this floor and we will be happy to accept it. 
   So I think, Mr. Speaker, that this kind of talk of a bad process, and I should also point out just for the record that the Committee on Rules met in the afternoon, Mr. Dreier, not in the evening. Things have changed. We meet in the light of day, not in the middle of the night anymore.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Let me encourage the gentleman from Georgia to read the rule. The Republicans were offered the right for a substitute. They could have had a substitute that null and voided this entire resolution, and they chose not to. 
   There is an amendment made in order under the rule by the gentleman from Illinois or his designee, which I strongly disagree with, that would essentially gut this entire provision. It would allow no one, with the possible exception of the gentlewoman who represents the District of Columbia, to be able to participate. So the opportunity is there. What the gentleman needs to do is read the rule.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remaining time. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me restate what I said earlier: This rule allows for consideration of the only amendment offered in the Rules Committee yesterday. We also offered the minority the opportunity for a substitute, which they declined. If this bill is so awful, they could have introduced a substitute to null and void it. Indeed, the amendment that is made in order practically null and voids this entire bill. As someone who has been around for a few years, I do not think I have ever heard so many complaints about a rule that makes in order every single amendment offered in the Rules Committee. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, let me say, the old days are over. I could stand on this floor all day and cite a list of abuses by the former majority. Instead, let me focus on how this Democratic majority has chosen to operate. 
   For the last few weeks, we have heard complaint after complaint that the Republicans were not allowed to offer amendments on our Six for '06 agenda. Now the gentleman from California and others are complaining that we are allowing a Republican amendment. I have got a case of whiplash. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am afraid that by allowing the other side of the aisle to offer amendments and offer a substitute, we have messed up their talking points. 
   Mr. Kirk from Illinois came before the Rules Committee with a thoughtful amendment, offered in good faith. I happened to disagree very strongly with the substance of his amendment, but I support his right to offer it, debate it and get an up-or-down vote in this House. Indeed, I would urge my colleagues to go to the Rules Committee and to read the testimony of Mr. Kirk and also the statements by members of the Rules Committee, Republican members, who urged that this amendment be made in order. This was  a hearing, I would remind my colleagues, that happened in the light of day, not in the middle of the night. 
   Let me also remind my colleague there is no obligation for the gentleman from Illinois or anybody else to offer the amendment if they choose not to. It is up to them. Indeed, they could offer an amendment to strike this amendment from the rule if they want and have a closed rule, which they have become accustomed to under their leadership. 
   What we are allowing, Mr. Speaker, is for the Delegates and the Resident Commissioner to the House of Representatives to have a symbolic vote that will not count if they are the deciding margin of victory or defeat of any amendment. We are allowing for the possible consideration of an amendment. If the sponsor Member decides to offer the amendment to this resolution, he can offer it, or his designee. Finally, we are protecting that amendment from all points of order. 
   Let me close, Mr. Speaker, by addressing the rank-and-file Members on the Republican side. We believe that you have a right to be heard. If you come before the Rules Committee with thoughtful amendments, we will give you every possible consideration. We will not be perfect. We will do some things that you will not like, but the distinguished chairwoman of the Rules Committee Ms. Slaughter and all of us on this side of the aisle have made it very clear that we will preside over a more open, democratic process than was the norm for the past 12 years. 
   The rule before us is a product of that commitment, and indeed, it responds to the Member who came before the Rules Committee to offer an amendment. I think that is good form. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the previous question and vote ``yes'' on the rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. MCGOVERN. (WORCESTER, MASSACHUSETTS REMEMBERS THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 92nd anniversary and commemoration of the Armenian Genocide. Yesterday, I had the privilege to join the Armenian-American community of Worcester, Massachusetts, including survivors of the Genocide and their families, and many dignitaries of Central Massachusetts and the Commonwealth at an event remembering the Armenian Genocide and the role it plays in understanding contemporary events. 
   I am submitting today for the RECORD a copy of the remarks I made at this special commemoration and an article that appeared in the Worcester Telegram and Gazette.  
   Worcester Armenian Genocide Observance 
   I want to thank Father Terzian and the Armenian Church of Our Savior for inviting me  to participate in this remembrance--and I'm very pleased to be here with Lt. Governor Tim Murray and the Mayor of Worcester, Konstantina Lukes. But I am especially honored to be here with the Worcester Armenian-American community, survivors of the Armenian Genocide, and their families. 
   There are several reasons why I look forward to this event each year. 
   First and foremost, it gives me an opportunity to reconnect with all of you, the Worcester Armenian-American community, and to thank you for all your fine work and contributions to our city. 
   Second, it is a moment when we recommit ourselves to pressing the United States government to officially recognize the Armenian Genocide. 
   And finally, it provides me each year with a moment to reflect on our world; and on how I as an individual, we as a community, and we as a Nation are responding to genocide and crimes against humanity that, sadly and unbelievably, are carried out nearly every day in some part of the world. 
   I believe that this year there is a very good chance that the U.S. House of Representatives might actually pass H. Res. 106, the Armenian Genocide Resolution. 
   I can tell that this is a real possibility because for the first time in years, I'm receiving materials arguing against the resolution and against the official recognition of the Armenian Genocide. 
   I believe adopting the Armenian Genocide Resolution is the right thing to do: 
   As a matter of morality--and in the name of humanity--the United States should recognize and condemn all genocides. 
   In the name of historic truth--and in honor of the historic role so many American diplomatic personnel and humanitarian and relief workers played in saving lives and condemning the genocide as it was taking place--the U.S. especially should recognize the Armenian Genocide.  
   And in the hope of preventing future genocides--we have to recognize and honor the truth of the past. Denial of the Armenian Genocide--just like denial of the Holocaust--makes future genocides more likely, not less. 
   No Nation, not Turkey or any other country, should be allowed to block the official recognition or commemoration or the teaching of historic truth about the Armenian Genocide. 
   It's ironic that the current Turkish government doesn't seem to realize that the more it denies the Armenian Genocide, the more people begin to think that there really is a connection between the Turks who carried out the Armenian Genocide at the beginning of the 20th century and today's 21st century government. 
   By denying the truth, Turkey undermines its own standing throughout the world, blocks its own acceptance into the European family, and increases regional tensions, especially with neighboring Armenia. Turkey's recognition of the Genocide, its reconciliation with the past, would widely be viewed as the act of a mature democracy, which the world would rush to embrace and reward. 
   This is why America must also officially recognize the Armenian Genocide. 
   A couple of weeks ago, I was in eastern Chad. And the reality of genocide was right before my eyes. 
   There are over 250,000 refugees from Darfur, Sudan living in camps inside Chad. Thanks to the many international and humanitarian workers who have chosen to work and help these survivors of the violence taking place every day in Darfur, the camps are well-organized and efficient. 
   But I'd like to describe for you some of what I saw--and what the Darfur refugees told me about what they had witnessed. 
   I met with individuals and families who had been forced to flee their villages in Darfur. Each had a story about loved ones murdered, homes destroyed, people and family left behind. Many didn't know if some of their family or children were even alive. 
   I talked with one woman who was harvesting onions at a small agricultural site in Camp Gaga, a Darfur refugee camp a couple of hours from the town of Abeche in eastern Chad. She held a tiny baby in her arms as she worked on her onion patch. She told me the Janjaweed attacked her village so quickly and so ferociously that she couldn't even bury her husband who was struck down in the attack; she barely had time to cover him with a sheet before she escaped with her baby and children. She feels guilty and thinks about this all the time. And she now hopes to stay alive and return, someday, to her village. 
   I met with several other men and women, refugees from Darfur, at the Goz Amer Camp near the town of Koukou, Chad. This is a much larger and older camp. Many of the people have been here for 3 years or so. These people were being interviewed for the eyewitness testimony regarding crimes against humanity that some day may be reviewed by the International Criminal Court. 
   I went to eastern Chad to meet and talk with refugees from Darfur because the Government of Sudan wouldn't give me a visa to enter their country. 
   But sometimes things happen for a reason, I believe. Because not only did I learn about the reality of Darfur--I personally discovered Chad. 
   The war in Darfur is bleeding into Chad, as well as other neighboring countries. 
   While I was in Chad, two ``towns''--Tiero and Marena, which actually consist of about 31 small villages--were attacked by ``Janjaweed'' militias operating inside Chad. According to the Chadian survivors who I talked to--they described their attackers as a combination of Sudanese Janjaweed and Chadian Janjaweed allies. They were armed. They were on horseback. The attacks started at about five in the morning, and came in about 3 distinct waves of attack. They shot randomly, at everything and everyone. Women, children, men, livestock, fell to the earth dead or wounded. Homes were burned to the ground. Abandoned crockery, left charred and broken. 
   These Chadians--now internally displaced inside their own country--were gathering in the thousands near Koukou--some estimates were 8,000-9,000. Many walked, some arrived on the backs of burros, and many others were being trucked in by humanitarian groups. U.N. agencies and NGOs were rushing to provide them with emergency aid and to set up an emergency operations site where people could receive food, water, medical aid, and some form of shelter from the relentless heat. 
   These new internally displaced now join the more than 140,000 Chadian IDPs. 
   I had the privilege to watch UNHCR, UNICEF, Doctors without Borders (Medicins sans Frontierres), the ICRC, Italian Aid, and the World Food Program work together to provide emergency relief to these traumatized people. 
   So this year, as we meet to remember and commemorate the 92nd Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, I'm struggling to find meaning in the words, ``Never Again.'' 
   I'm thankful to this community especially, which has worked tirelessly for nearly a century, to keep alive the historic memory of the Armenian Genocide and to speak out, condemn and organize against the genocides--too many--that mark the past nine decades of human history. 
   Thank you for your persistence. Thank you for your commitment to take action. Thank you for your generosity and compassion. 
   And thank you, once again, for including me in this special program.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO HOUSE AMENDMENT TO SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 2764, CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, H. Res. 893 provides for consideration of two measures, an amendment to the omnibus appropriations bill to provide funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and a continuing resolution. Each measure is debatable for 1 hour. 
   The continuing resolution is necessary to keep the government open and running while the omnibus bill is processed and sent to the White House for the President's signature. 
   Madam Speaker, while I have no problem with the rule that is before us, I cannot support the underlying funding for Iraq. The tens of billions in new money for the war in Iraq has no timetables for withdrawal, no limitations, no requirements that the Iraqi Government make progress towards reconciliation, no benchmarks, no conditionality, nothing. Madam Speaker, this is a blank check. 
   The new money in this bill represents one cave-in too many. It is an endorsement of George Bush's policy of endless war. It is stunning that so many have gone along for so long asking no questions, giving this President everything he wants. 
   After years of Bush ineptitude, how dare this Congress provide another blank check for this administration. No weapons of mass destruction, a constantly changing rationale for our occupation, benchmarks for the Iraqi Government that never get met, no democracy, no respect for human rights, no reconciliation, a government plagued with corruption, and no end in sight. All this, Madam Speaker, and some of my colleagues still say, ``stay the course.'' 
   Our brave men and women in uniform have done their job. So many have sacrificed, and far too many have made the ultimate sacrifice. They have been successful in some areas of Iraq in quelling some of the violence, essentially providing the chance, the window of opportunity for the Iraqi Government to move ahead with efforts for reconciliation.     
   The response of the Iraqi Government has been to do nothing. No reconciliation. 
   Isn't our responsibility, as Members of Congress, to raise questions? Shouldn't we put pressure on the Iraqi Government to do more? And shouldn't we put pressure on our own government to not be such a cheap date? Don't we owe our soldiers whom we put in harm's way better than acquiescence to a Commander in Chief who is incapable of ever admitting error? 
   Madam Speaker, there is no military victory to be had in Iraq. To the extent that this awful situation becomes less awful depends on political progress, something the Maliki government doesn't want to do, and something our own leaders seem willing to keep putting off. 
   I want more, Madam Speaker, I expect more, for the sacrifice our troops have made. Quite frankly, the status quo is not worth one more American dollar or one more drop of American blood. I am sick to my stomach when I think of the hundreds of billions of dollars that we have already spent in Iraq while we nickel and dime our own people at home. None of this war is paid for. It is all borrowed money. It's all on the backs of our kids. It's all debt that is being bought up every day by China. 
   Madam Speaker, I long for the day when we have a President who will threaten a veto on a bill that fails to provide all our people with health care, or that fails to adequately fund education for our children. Instead, we have a White House that engages in blackmail tactics: Give me what I want on Iraq, with no strings attached, or I'll shut the government down. 
   Those who defend the status quo say that we need to give the President whatever he wants so we can assure ``victory.'' ``Victory'' at the beginning of this war was ridding Saddam Hussein of weapons of mass destruction. When we found that there were none, the definition of ``victory'' changed. In fact, over the last 5 years, the definition of ``victory'' has changed several times. 
   For me, the closest thing to victory is ending this war, getting an Iraqi Government that puts national reconciliation above its own self-interest and getting our troops out of that country and home to their families where they belong. I believe the surest way to get that type of victory is setting a firm timetable for the U.S. occupation of Iraq to end. It will change the dynamic, and it will force the Iraqi Government to embrace, rather than avoid, reconciliation. 
   In fact, in today's Washington Post, the U.S. military has found that the strongest point of agreement among all Iraqis across all sectarian and ethnic groups is the belief that the U.S. military invasion of their country is the primary root of the violent differences among them and that the departure of ``occupying forces,'' their words, is the key to national reconciliation. 
   Madam Speaker, the Iraqi people themselves firmly believe that reconciliation will not happen until we leave. If the Iraqi people want us to  leave, and a majority of the Iraqi Government want us to leave, and a majority of the American people want us to leave, then why on Earth are we staying? 
   Let me also state, Madam Speaker, what ``victory'' is not. It is not allowing this President to kick the ball down the field and dump this war on the next President of the United States. That is called ``passing the buck,'' and that is what we will be doing if we approve this new Iraq money. 
   One final observation. The war in Iraq has not only cost us dearly in terms of human life and treasure, it has also cost us in terms of our standing in the world. We have lost the support and the respect of so many who have looked to us as a force for what is good, decent and positive in world affairs. I warn my colleagues that our lost prestige and standing is also a threat to our national security. Madam Speaker, I want my country back. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First, let me just respond to the gentleman from Texas by saying he is entitled to his own opinions, but he is not entitled to make up the facts. The facts are that the difference between this Congress under the Democratic majority and under the previous Congress under the Republican majority is they left Washington before their work was done. They kicked all their work onto the Democratic Congress that was elected last November. They didn't do their job. If the Congress could be sued for malpractice, they would have been sued for malpractice. 
   The bills that we are dealing with today the House of Representatives passed in a timely manner, all of the appropriations bills, as we were supposed to do. We did it, and they were good bills, and I commend Chairman Obey for his work on those bills. We did that in spite of all the obstructionism and resistance from the Republicans in this House. 
   Unfortunately, because of the Senate rules, an individual Member, and in the case of the Senate, the Senate minority leader, was successful in slowing down the process and preventing conference committees from meeting and preventing the Senate from considering certain bills. Now they can be proud of that. That is just obstructionism. That is not doing the people's business. But the bottom line is that we are here today dealing with an omnibus appropriations bill to get the people's business done; not to kick the ball down the field and dump it on next year's Congress. It is to do it now. 
   One other thing, Madam Speaker, and that is one of the major differences with the new Democratic majority is that we have helped undo some of the damage that the Republicans have done to domestic spending over the years. Because of the Democratic majority and our ability to reorder priority, education is better off today than it would be if the Republicans were in control. Medical research, there is more money for medical research to find lifesaving drugs and to find cures to disease because the Democrats made that a priority, over the Republican objections. Our veterans are getting a better deal today. Under the Democratic majority, there is the largest single-year increase in veterans health in the history of the Veterans Administration. Those are the things that we have done. 
   Today, we are considering a Senate addition to what we did in the House, which I have an objection to, and that is the funding for the war in Iraq. The Republicans, while they were in control, gave the President a blank check; no accountability, no questions asked, nothing. And here we are, the fifth year into this war, with no end in sight, and there are some of us who believe the time has come to call the President to account, to start the process of bringing our troops home so they can be reunited with their families. 
   So there's a huge difference between the Democrats and the Republicans. 
   Madam Speaker, at this time I would like to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Etheridge.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, as of today, 3,893 of our bravest men and women have lost their lives in Iraq. Tens of thousands more have been wounded. They have lost limbs, lost their sight and suffered severe brain injuries. We have spent half a trillion tax dollars, none of it paid for. When is enough enough? When will this Congress finally reflect the will of the American people and begin to bring our men and women in Iraq home to their families? I hope it is today. I think it can be today. 
   As I mentioned earlier, Madam Speaker, in today's Washington Post the U.S. military has found that the strongest point of agreement among all Iraqis across all sectarian and ethnic groups is the belief that the United States' military invasion of their country is the primary root of the violent differences among them and that the departure of ``occupying forces,'' their words, is the key to national reconciliation. 
   Madam Speaker, I include today's Washington Post article for the Record.  
   All Iraqi Groups Blame U.S. Invasion for Discord, Study Shows  
   Iraqis of all sectarian and ethnic groups believe that the U.S. military invasion is the primary root of the violent differences among them, and see the departure of ``occupying forces'' as the key to national reconciliation, according to focus groups conducted for the U.S. military last month. 
   That is good news, according to a military analysis of the results. At the very least, analysts optimistically concluded, the findings indicate that Iraqis hold some ``shared beliefs'' that may eventually allow them to surmount the divisions that have led to a civil war. 
   Conducting the focus groups, in 19 separate sessions organized by outside contractors in five cities, is among the ways in which Multi-National Force-Iraq assesses conditions in the country beyond counting insurgent attacks, casualties and weapons caches. The command, led by Army Gen. David H. Petraeus, devotes more time and resources than any other government or independent entity to measuring various matters, including electricity, satisfaction with trash collection and what Iraqis think it will take for them to get along. 
   The results are analyzed and presented to Petraeus as part of the daily Battle Update Assessment or BUA (pronounced boo-ah). Some of the news has been unarguably good, including the sharply reduced number of roadside bombings and attacks on civilians. But bad news is often presented with a bright side, such as the focus-group results and a November poll, which found that 25 percent of Baghdad residents were satisfied with their local government and that 15 percent said they had enough fuel for heating and cooking. 
   The good news? Those numbers were higher than the figures of the previous month (18 percent and 9 percent, respectively). 
   And Iraqi complaints about matters other than security are seen as progress. Early this year, Maj. Fred Garcia, an MNF-I analyst, said that ``a very large percentage of people would answer questions about security by saying `I don't know.' Now, we get more griping because people feel freer.'' 
   Iraqi political reconciliation, quality-of-life issues and the economy are largely the responsibility of the State Department. But the military, to the occasional consternation of U.S. diplomats who feel vastly outnumbered, has its own ``mirror agencies'' in many areas. Officers in charge of civil-military operations, said senior Petraeus adviser Army Col. William E. Rapp, ``can tell you how many markets are open in Baghdad, how many shops, how many banks are open ..... We have a lot more people'' on the ground. 
   On Iraqi politics, ``we have four to six slides almost every morning on `Where does the Iraqi government stand on de-Baathification legislation?' All these things are embassy things,'' Rapp said. But Petraeus is interested in ``his `feel' for a situation, and he gets that from a bunch of different data points,'' he added. 
   Even though members of the military ``understand the limitations'' of polling data, Rapp said, ``subjective measures'' are an important part of the mix. In July, the military signed a contract with Gallup for four public opinion polls a month in Iraq: three nationwide and one in Baghdad. Lincoln Group, which has conducted surveys for the military since shortly after the invasion, received a year-long contract in January to conduct focus groups. 
   Outside of the military, some of the most widespread polling in Iraq has been done by D3 Systems, a Virginia-based company that maintains offices in each of Iraq's 18 provinces. Its most recent publicly released surveys, conducted in September for several news media organizations, showed the same widespread Iraqi belief voiced by the military's focus groups: that a U.S. departure will make things better. A State Department poll in September 2006 reported a similar finding. 
   Matthew Warshaw, a senior research manager at D3, said that despite security improvements, polling in Iraq remains difficult. ``While violence has gone down, one of the ways it has been achieved is by effectively separating people. That means mobility is limited, with roadblocks by the U.S. and Iraqi military or local militias,'' Warshaw said in an interview. 
   Most of the recent survey results he has seen about political reconciliation, Warshaw said, are ``more about [Iraqis] reconciling with the United States within their own particular territory, like in Anbar. ..... But it doesn't say anything about how Sunni groups feel about Shiite groups in Baghdad.'' 
   Warshaw added: ``In Iraq, I just don't hear statements that come from any of the Sunni, Shiite or Kurdish groups that say `We recognize that we need to share power with the others, that we can't truly dominate.' 
   According to a summary report of the focus-group findings obtained by The Washington Post, Iraqis have a number of ``shared beliefs'' about the current situation that cut across sectarian lines. Participants, in separate groups of men and women, were interviewed in Ramadi, Najaf, Irbil, Abu Ghraib and in Sunni and Shiite neighborhoods in Baghdad. The report does not mention how the participants were selected. 
   Dated December 2007, the report notes that ``the Iraqi government has still made no significant progress toward its fundamental goal of national reconciliation.'' Asked to  describe ``the current situation in Iraq to a foreign visitor,'' some groups focused on positive aspects of the recent security improvements. But ``most would describe the negative elements of life in Iraq beginning with the `U.S. occupation' in March 2003,'' the report says. 
   Some participants also blamed Iranian meddling for Iraq's problems. While the United States was said to want to control Iraq's oil, Iran was seen as seeking to extend its political and religious agendas. 
   Few mentioned Saddam Hussein as a cause of their problems, which the report described as an important finding implying that ``the current strife in Iraq seems to have totally eclipsed any agonies or grievances many Iraqis would have incurred from the past regime, which lasted for nearly four decades--as opposed to the current conflict, which has lasted for five years.'' 
   Overall, the report said that ``these findings may be expected to conclude that national reconciliation is neither anticipated nor possible. In reality, this survey provides very strong evidence that the opposite is true.'' A sense of ``optimistic possibility permeated all focus groups ..... and far more commonalities than differences are found among these seemingly diverse groups of Iraqis.''  
   Madam Speaker, the Iraqi people themselves firmly believe that reconciliation will not happen until we leave. If the Iraqi people want us to leave and a majority of the Iraqi Government wants us to leave and a majority of the American people want us to leave, then why on Earth are we still staying? 
   As I have said on a number of occasions today, what is contained in the underlying bill is a blank check. There are no restrictions on the tens of billions of dollars that we are going to give the President in support of his Iraq policy. There is no conditionality. There are no timetables for withdrawal. There is nothing. This is a blank check. We are into the fifth year of this war, and after all that we have seen, after all that we have been told that has turned out not to be true, it seems unbelievable to me that this Congress would vote for yet another blank check. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this latest blank check, which essentially is in support of an endless war in Iraq, and vote ``no'' on the underlying bill. I ask for support of the rule. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. 
   The previous question was ordered.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (MERIDA INITIATIVE TO COMBAT ILLICIT NARCOTICS AND REDUCE ORGANIZED CRIME AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise reluctantly in opposition to this bill. 
   I applaud the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, my friend and colleague Congressman BERMAN, for asserting the role of the Congress and making sure that new initiatives such as the Merida Initiative are authorized. It is the right thing to do, and I look forward to working with him over the coming weeks on a number of foreign policy matters pending before the Committee. 
   There is much to support in H.R. 6028, and there are also several troubling matters. 
   Regarding the provisions of the bill that deal with Central America--a region of Latin America that is very close to my heart--I believe H.R. 6028 takes several important steps forward, seriously investing in community-based solutions to youth and gang problems. H.R. 6028 provides strong support to non-security programs that address the endemic conditions giving rise to violence related to drugs, arms and human trafficking. It provides support for the U.N. International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), especially in the areas of witness and victim protection, an initiative that merits the very strongest support by the United States and the international community. The bill also seeks to promote transparency and an end to impunity throughout Central America by strengthening police and judicial systems so that they may more effectively and successfully carry out investigations and prosecutions of those responsible for human rights violations and other criminal acts. 
   This is all very good news, Mr. Speaker. 
   I am very concerned that this authorizing bill fails, however, to reflect the thoughtful and critically important human rights conditions contained in the Senate and House versions of the FY 2008 supplemental appropriations on military and security-related aid to Mexico. I understand that those proposed conditions are controversial in Mexico, in large measure because of the history of the very problematic drug certification process that existed in the past. I do not believe that the human rights conditions included in the supplemental appropriations bill bear any resemblance to the flawed drug certification process, and the House and Senate Appropriations Committees took great care not to mirror that flawed certification process. 
   By failing to include the conditions on aid provided for the Merida Initiative that are included in the Senate and House supplemental appropriations bills, passage of this authorizing measure could be viewed as an effort to weaken or eliminate those provisions from the final conference report on the supplemental that will soon be sent to the President for his signature. It is my sincere (hope that this is not the intention of bringing H.R. 6028 to the House floor at such a delicate moment. There was no reason to rush this bill before the House, since we know it has no counterpart on the Senate side. So its consideration today invites concern that its passage is indeed an attempt to influence conference negotiations on the supplemental and to send a message that human rights conditions are not welcome, and certainly not the stronger, more specific  conditionality included in the Senate version of the FY08 supplemental appropriations. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that America wants to be a good partner with Mexico on fighting drugs and ending corruption and human rights violations within Mexico's judicial system and its military and police. Over the past several weeks we have all seen the effects of the bloody rampage carried out by the drug cartels, especially those targeted at assassinating key officers and members of the Mexican National Police. I hope in other legislation that may come before the House this year that we will pay special attention to investing in drug education, prevention and treatment programs, as well as our own law enforcement agencies, so that U.S. demand for illegal drugs will also be forcefully and substantially addressed. 
   But we cannot simply write blank checks and fail to ensure that our aid is not subject to strong conditions on human rights, transparency, justice reform and promoting and protecting the rights of civil society. These concerns are very much at the forefront of the strong Senate conditions in the FY08 appropriations bill, and are also reflected in the slightly less stringent House conditions. They should have been included in H.R. 6028, the authorizing legislation, which is where human rights conditionality appropriately belongs. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, these are my concerns and my hopes regarding H.R. 6028, and I will be following closely the consequences of authorizing and appropriating these funds.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (PROVIDING FOR ADOPTION OF S. CON. RES. 70, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 1190 provides for the adoption of the Senate budget resolution, S. Con. Res. 70, with an amendment consisting of the House-passed budget resolution, H. Con. Res. 312. It also provides that the House request a conference with the Senate. 
   This rule simply allows the House to move quickly and efficiently to a conference on the budget resolution. Let me be clear, the minority still has the right to offer a motion to instruct conferees, and they still have the ability to defeat this rule, denying the opportunity to begin a conference on the budget resolution. 
   It's a simple and straightforward rule that allows the House to do what the American people sent us here to do, legislate. The American people don't want the partisan infighting that is being perpetrated by the minority in this Chamber. Time after time the American people have spoken, and their voices are being heard loud and clear. They want action, not disruption. They want us to do our job. And this rule will allow us to do just that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I always appreciate hearing from my very good friend from Washington State explain his rationale on various issues. But let me just say a couple of things. 
   If we want to have a serious discussion about the cost of energy in this country, let's understand one thing. The Republicans had been in control of this Congress for 12 years and the Republicans have controlled the White House for nearly 8 years. When George Bush went into office on January 22, 2001, the cost of a gallon of gas was $1.47. As of last week, it was $3.61. It's gone up since last week, and part of that is because of the failed, the failed policies of this administration and the Republican Congress. 
   Yesterday, thanks to the leadership of Speaker Pelosi, we voted on a bill to instruct the President not to continue putting oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And guess what. President Bush said he's going to veto it. He's going to veto a measure that will bring down prices for oil and gas in the short term. That's where their priorities are. Siding with Big Oil against the consumer. So enough is enough. 
   And I would say, Mr. Speaker, that what we're trying to do here today is expedite consideration of a budget resolution. After nearly 8 years, the Bush legacy is the highest deficits in our Nation's history. That is what he has left our children and our grandchildren, the greatest amount of national debt in our Nation's history. Future generations, our kids and our grandchildren, will be forced to pay the price for this unprecedented rise in debt and the Republicans' fiscally reckless and irresponsible policies. 
   The budget resolution that Chairman Spratt, our leader here in the House, has fashioned and the one that he is going to conference with is a budget with a conscience. That's something we had not had when the Republicans were in control of this Congress. It is a budget that doesn't cut Medicare and doesn't cut Medicaid and doesn't cut the Community Development Block Grant program and doesn't cut LIHEAP. It is a budget that understands that average people have suffered under the 12 years that Republicans controlled this Congress and under the 8 years that George Bush has been in office. It is a budget that protects priorities like SCHIP, infrastructure needs, homeland security, innovation, energy, education, health care, veterans, and the environment. It protects middle class tax relief, including the alternative minimum tax, the child tax credit, and the marriage penalties. In short, what the Democrats are trying to do is get a budget passed that charts a new direction for a stronger, safer, more compassionate America, a direction very different from the one that this President and the previous Republican Congress has brought us down. 
   Let me finally say, Mr. Speaker, this will be the first budget resolution conference report to be considered in an election year since Bill Clinton was in office. So for all the talk about process, the fact of the matter is we have a Congress, a Democratic Congress, that is actually committed to getting things done, including a budget resolution.     
   And again, when we bring the budget resolution to the floor, it will be the first budget resolution conference report to be considered in an election year since Bill Clinton was in office. And that is something I think we all can be proud of and the American people can be proud of a finished product which will be a budget that will reflect their priorities. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I would urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2419, FOOD, CONSERVATION, AND ENERGY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his work on this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, from my point of view the farm bill conference report is a mixed bag. There are many things in this farm bill that I don't like. I don't like what I consider to be an extravagant disaster assistance program. I don't like the minuscule cuts to direct payments, and I don't like the unnecessary subsidies. And I don't like the fact that this bill reduces the mandatory funding for the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition program by $756 million. 
   This is a program that is close to my heart, Mr. Speaker, a program that is proven to work. Named after George McGovern and Bob Dole, this program feeds hungry children around the world in a school setting. The only thing crueler than not feeding a hungry child is to feed that child for a while and then stop. And that's what has happened, unfortunately, in this process and it's flat wrong. 
   I would like to insert a recently published Washington Post Op-Ed written by both Senators McGovern and Dole into the Congressional Record at the end of my statement. 
   Let me be clear, this is not the end of our fight for funds for McGovern-Dole. And I look forward to working with the appropriators and the authorizers to ensure that there is proper funding for this program in the upcoming appropriations bill. I believe it is a moral imperative. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is not the bill that I would have written. And, Mr. Speaker, I suppose that I could find enough reasons to justify a vote against this conference report. But when I look at the whole bill, I have concluded that a ``no'' vote is the wrong vote to take today. And let me explain why I will vote for this bill today. 
   Thanks to the leadership of Speaker Pelosi and Congresswoman DeLauro and Chairman Peterson, this bill includes the most sweeping expansion in the domestic anti-hunger safety net ever. This bill will do more to fight hunger in America over the next 5 years than anything Congress has done in decades. Over $10 billion will go to improve the food stamp benefit, to provide fresh fruits and vegetables to children in schools around this country, and to invest in America's food banks. 
   Over 73 percent of the spending in this bill will fund the anti-hunger safety net. Damage that has been done over the years, the erosion of both the food stamp benefit and the emergency food assistance system, for example, is fixed in this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, the nutrition title of the farm bill is not perfect, but it is very, very good. I'm voting for this bill on the strength of these improvements, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same. 
   These enhancements will improve the lives of real people around the country, people who desperately need help putting food on their tables in this time of spiking energy costs and rising food prices. This bill will help more than 10 million people afford an adequate diet, including over 200,000 people in my home State of Massachusetts. Unfortunately, though, it will not end hunger in America, and it won't end hunger around the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe strongly that hunger is a political condition. And I believe we can end hunger here at home and around the world if we find the political will to do so. But ending hunger will take leadership, leadership to stand up to the powerful special interests that don't care about ending hunger, leadership to stand up for the people whose interests aren't always represented here in the halls of Congress, leadership to simply do the right thing. And ending hunger is doing the right thing. 
   The face of hunger here in America is not one of sunken eyes and swollen bellies. No, the hungry in America are our neighbors, our children's classmates, and the seniors we see every day. Some serve in the military, and others take their kids to soccer and baseball practice all over this country. 
   The face of hunger is the face of too many in America, but that doesn't have to be the case any longer. This bill, the effort put forth by the anti-hunger community, that deserves such great credit, and by many Members of Congress is just a start. With a continued and dedicated effort, this can truly be the beginning of the end of hunger. 
   This bill is a solid down payment on our efforts to end the scourge of hunger in America once and for all, and for that reason alone it deserves our support.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (TRIBUTE TO FATHER ROBERT F. DRINAN, SJ -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. I want to thank my colleague from Massachusetts, BARNEY FRANK, for organizing this Special Order, and I want to thank him for his beautiful words paying tribute to Father Drinan as well as my other colleague from Massachusetts, ED MARKEY, for his very beautiful words honoring a truly great man. 
   I feel truly privileged to have known Father Drinan. As was made clear by the previous speakers, he was a remarkable man, remarkable in his incredible faith and remarkable in his strong political beliefs. 
   I think all of us who knew Bob Drinan will miss him; however, I believe that even those who didn't know Father Drinan personally will feel a great sense of loss, because we have lost a man who was truly dedicated to good. He was a man of unbelievable intellect, of unbelievable conviction and compassion. He also was a man with a great sense of humor. 
   You know, the day after his passing, I delivered a tribute to him on this House floor, and I recalled his early and steadfast opposition to the war in Vietnam and his most recent opposition to the war in Iraq.     
   He thought both wars were senseless and moral blunders. Father Drinan was someone who spoke his mind, regardless of the political polls or political consequences. Indeed, many of his closest allies would caution him to be careful in some of his pronouncements on some of the more controversial issues that he took on. 
   But even when his words were controversial, he had this kind of uncanny knack of usually being proven right; and whether it was the war in Vietnam or whether it was his call for the impeachment of Richard Nixon, he turned out to be right, on those issues and so many other issues. 
   I admired his commitment to peace and human rights. Whether it was speaking out on behalf of Jews who were being persecuted by the former Soviet Union or, as mentioned, whether it was his advocacy on behalf of so many people in Central America who were victimized by the wars that engulfed that region of the world in the late 1970s and early 1980s, nobody was more dedicated to human rights than Bob Drinan. 
   When raising his voice in Congress and trying to change U.S. policy was not enough, he would travel to the countries where people were being oppressed to speak out. Those of us who were involved in El Salvador during the 1980s recall with great admiration his visit to that country in the midst of a civil war where he said mass alongside of Archbishop Oscar Romero. Only a few months after that visit, Archbishop Romeo was murdered by Salvadoran death squads. 
   We also remember in 1989 when six Jesuit priests were murdered by the Salvadoran military. I was working for Congressman Joe Moakley at the time, who was investigating those killings. Father Drinan spoke up forcefully, demanding justice in that case. 
   It is also important to note that his service to people did not end when he left the House of Representatives. He continued to advocate for what was right and just in his teachings, his lectures, his numerous TV appearances and his writings. 
   Many of us would get calls from him, Did you see my piece in the National Catholic Reporter, he would ask, or we would get letters citing specific passages in a book that he wrote or a book that he read or some article that he thought was worth mentioning. He would sometimes suggest we use the material in a speech or perhaps insert something in the Congressional Record. He never stopped making a difference. 
   I have also had the privilege over the years of attending many dinners with Father Drinan. He always kind of held court. All the attention focused on Father Drinan because he was brilliant, and he had well-thought-out answers to every single policy question that ever existed. 
   Over the last several days, I have attended his calling hours at Georgetown University and his funeral mass at St. Aloysius Church here in Washington. I was struck by how many people whose lives he had touched. So many of them had dedicated their lives and their careers to public service and education. He inspired people, and the only thing that he scorned was indifference. 
   Mark Gearan, who was a former staffer of Father Drinan and who actually met his wife Mary Hurley working on Father Drinan's campaign, is now the President of Hobart and William Smith Colleges in New York, and he recently wrote an article that appeared in the Boston Globe entitled, ``Father Drinan was our unfailing champion.'' I would just like to read a passage here: 
   ``But for me and countless others, it was his role as a mentor that distinguished Father Drinan. Amid the pressures of tough campaigns and congressional duties, he always reached out to young staff and encouraged their interest in politics and policy. He took time to ask your opinion on issues and was genuinely interested in knowing why you felt that way. `Tell me something I don't know,' he would bark out in an elevator ride or driving to the airport. A tough assignment to respond to the author of 12 books with such a keen and inquisitive mind.'' 
   I recall one time attending a speech that Father Drinan gave before the Americas for Democratic Action here in Washington, D.C. When his speech was over with, he asked me what did you think. I said it was a great speech. He said what specifically did you like about the speech. I had to think for a minute. 
   But the bottom line was Bob Drinan was not interested in just empty plaudits. He wanted to know what moved people, what worked, how to get things done, how to move an audience. 
   This country is better off, not just because of Father Drinan. This country is better off because of the countless people he brought into the political process, people who love this country, people who want to make a difference, people who want to change it for the better. 
   Several years ago, I attended a graduation commencement ceremony, and the late John Kenneth Galbraith was the speaker, and he said to the audience of students, I would ask you to go out and comfort the afflicted, but given the current political climate that might be considered eccentric. So instead I will ask you to go out and afflict the comfortable. 
   That is what Father Drinan did, and that is what we are going to miss, a truly great man who did some extraordinary things not only for this country but for people all over the world. 
   Let me close as I began by saying I feel it a great privilege I had the opportunity to get to know this wonderful man, and I thank my colleague.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, some might see this Iraq supplemental as a victory for President Bush in his never-ending quest to secure open-ended, unaccountable funding for his disastrous policy in Iraq. If so, it is a hollow victory. 
   We can debate why and when our Iraq policy turned into the disaster that plays out every day in Baghdad and Dyala. But that debate really doesn't matter anymore, because the President's policy is a failure. And no amount of funding, with or without conditions, can fix it. The only thing that matters now is when and how we end this disaster, and when we bring our uniformed men and women safely home to their families and communities. 
   Our troops did their job. They achieved their mission. They ended the brutal reign of Saddam Hussein, and confirmed for the world that there never were any weapons of mass destruction. 
   They weren't sent to Iraq to take a bullet on behalf of the sectarian religious factions hellbent on civil war. 
   Mr. Speaker, this supplemental only postpones the inevitable. After hundreds of billions of dollars; after more than 3,400 soldiers, marines, sailors and airmen have lost their lives; after nearly 1,000 U.S. defense contractors have been killed; after more than 25,000 uniformed men and women have been wounded or maimed; after tens of thousands of American veterans returning from Iraq will be suffering from the trauma they experienced in combat for the rest of their lives; after hundreds of thousands of Iraqi men, women and children have been killed and millions more have been traumatized by the violence and horror that now marks Iraqi daily life; after the destruction of towns, villages, communities, neighborhoods and infrastructure, we still come back to the same place, the same stark question. 
   Mr. Speaker, how and when is this war and our military occupation of Iraq going to end? 
   The Middle East is going up in flames. Al Qaeda and other terrorist networks remain strong and intact. Their recruitment is growing. Meanwhile, America's standing in the world has never been lower. 
   I ask each of my colleagues, when and how are we going to get out of Iraq? When will each of us be able to tell the families in our districts that their sons and daughters, fathers and mothers, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, will finally be coming home? 
   Mr. Speaker, unbelievably, the President doesn't even want his own policy priorities tied to a time line for removing our troops in Iraq. He wants no accountability on the readiness of our troops, or whether they are adequately trained and equipped. Just show me the money. That's all he wants. 
   Mr. Speaker, I simply can't support it. And I will vote against this blank check of a supplemental. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me just conclude with a few words about the rule. This is not a satisfactory conclusion to the weeks-long debate over funding the war. But the sad reality is that the Senate is too timid and the President too irrational. There was no one with whom the House could forge a genuine compromise to hold the President accountable for the lives he is willing to sacrifice and the money he seeks and move us closer to bringing our troops home. And we do not have the votes in this House, sadly, to override a veto. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Obey for their persistence and their courage in trying to end this tragic war. 
   The rule before us ensures that we do not walk away from this debate or the decision to remove our troops from Iraq. Under this rule, the House must vote on removing our troops from Iraq before any further supplemental funding can be approved for the war. 
   So let's be clear. Those of us who oppose this war will be back again and again and again and again until this war is ended. 
   Mr. Speaker, from the White House to our military field commanders, everyone, including the Republican leader of this House, has said that September is the tipping point. Well, we will vote, and we will vote in September. And we will decide, and I pray that we will then bring our troops home.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (DARFUR: THE GENOCIDE CONTINUES -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 3 years ago the House declared the situation in Darfur a genocide. Since then thousands of people have been killed and 2.5 million displaced. And the situation on the ground grows worse. Attacks against humanitarian workers and African Union peacekeepers are increasing. 
   I was in eastern Chad in April. Over a quarter of a million Darfur refugees live in camps along the Chad-Sudan border. I talked with many of these men, women, and children. I heard about family members slaughtered; villages burned; children who perished from heat, exhaustion, and hunger in the desperate walk to find safe refuge. I was there when the violence of Darfur spilled over into Chad. Janjaweed militias attacked two Chad villages, overnight 8,000 people displaced. I watched the U.N. and NGOs provide emergency food, water, shelter, and medical care in the middle of nowhere under a blistering sun. 
   I say to my colleagues, enough is enough. I say to my colleagues, never again. The time to end the killing in Darfur is now.  
   Violence Impedes Relief Effort in Darfur, UN Food Agency Warns 
   Condemning a sharp escalation in attacks on humanitarian staff and relief convoys in Sudan's Darfur region, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) warned today that violence is hampering its ability to deliver assistance to millions of hungry people there. 
   ``In the last two weeks, nine food convoys have been attacked by gunmen across Darfur,'' said Kenro Oshidari, WFP Sudan Representative. ``WFP staff and contractors are being stopped at gunpoint, dragged out of their vehicles and robbed with alarming frequency.'' 
   Mr. Oshidari called on all parties to the conflict in Darfur to guarantee the safety of humanitarian workers so that the UN food agency and other aid organizations can continue helping Sudanese who rely on outside assistance for survival. 
   ``These abhorrent attacks, which target the very people who are trying to help the most vulnerable in Darfur, must be brought under control,'' he added. 
   So far this year, 18 WFP food convoys have been attacked by gunmen and four of WFP's light vehicles carjacked. Six WFP vehicles, including trucks and light vehicles, have been stolen and 10 staff, including contractors, have been either detained or abducted. 
   The Darfur operation is the agency's biggest, employing some 790 staff who feed more than two million people every month. WFP, which also contracts commercial truck companies to haul food into the region, plans to distribute up to 450,000 metric tons of food in Darfur this year at a cost of about half a billion dollars. 
   A lack of security has prevented WFP from reaching 170,000 people in June in what the agency termed in a news release a ``sizeable increase from the lowest point last March when 60,000 could not be reached.'' 
   As a result of convoy attacks in recent weeks, the road between Nyala, the capital of South Darfur state, and the town of Kass, has been declared a ``no-go'' area for UN staff, while in North Darfur, food dispatches to the town of Kabkabiya have been affected. 
   UN security personnel say attacks on vehicles are now the number one security concern for the aid community in Darfur, according to WFP, which cited a ``recent and deeply troubling trend is that staff are being abducted when their vehicles are stolen, giving robbers time to get away before the alarm is raised.'' 
   To date, all WFP staff have been released, although some were injured and hospitalized.   
   Sudan: UN Reports New Displacement in West Darfur 
   The United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) today reported new population displacements in West Darfur, where it says an estimated 12,000 households were on the move. 
   The newly displaced people said that they were fleeing prevailing insecurity in their areas and in anticipation of a rumored attack by Government forces, UN spokesperson Marie Okabe told reporters in New York. 
   The Mission also reported that over the weekend, a non-governmental organization (NGO) vehicle was carjacked in South Darfur, the latest attack on humanitarian workers in the country's strife-torn region. 
   Last week, an unknown armed man shot at a vehicle in South Darfur hired by an international NGO, while in West Darfur, two men stopped an international NGO convoy comprising two vehicles carrying five staff members and robbed them of personal effects and communication equipment. 
   In addition, harassment of internally displaced persons (IDPs) was reported during a UN assessment visit to an IDP camp near Nyala, the provincial capital of South Darfur. 
   Last month, the Sudanese Government announced its acceptance of a proposal for a hybrid UN-African Union peacekeeping operation to be deployed in Darfur, where more than 200,000 people have been killed and at least 2 million others displaced since clashes erupted in 2003 between Government forces, allied Janjaweed militias and rebel groups.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2419, FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. I thank my colleague from California for yielding me the time and for his work on this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and in support of the underlying legislation. 
   My colleagues, tonight millions of people here in the United States and around the world, many of them children, will go to bed hungry. They may not be in this Chamber, but they must remain in our thoughts. This bill does not go as far as I would like in tackling hunger, but it represents real progress and real reform. 
   I want to commend Chairman Peterson and his colleagues on the committee for their hard work, but I also want to thank Speaker Pelosi and Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, both of whom have worked personally and passionately with us over the last few days to make improvements to the nutrition programs in this bill. 
   The bill before us begins to reverse some of the terrible damage done to nutrition programs over the past several years. For too long, hungry people were an afterthought in this Congress. For too long, people on food stamps fell further and further behind as the Republican Congress searched high and low for more ways to cut taxes for rich people. Those days have come to an end, Mr. Speaker. 
   It has not been easy to find funding for these vital programs, and here's why. Unlike the Republicans, we are actually paying for the bills we pass. It would have been easy to put the cost of this bill on the national credit card. Instead, the increases to the nutrition program in this bill are paid for in this bill. That is an enormous and welcome development. 
   Further, the bill includes increased guaranteed funding for the George McGovern-Robert Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition program. McGovern-Dole has a proven track record of fighting hunger and promoting education by providing meals to chronically hungry school-age children in the world's poorest countries. Where the McGovern-Dole program is offered, enrollment and attendance rates increased significantly, especially for girls. Providing food at school is a simple but effective method to get children into school, improve literacy, and help break the cycle of poverty. 
   These programs demonstrate America's generosity and goodwill, and they reflect our deepest moral values. They promote our national security, and they offer an alternative to children who otherwise might be recruited by groups that provide meals in return for becoming child soldiers or for attendance at extremist schools that serve as a breeding ground for hatred and violence. 
   By making the funding guaranteed, we can stop the practice of beginning a school feeding program only to cut it off when Congress doesn't appropriate enough money, because the only thing more cruel than not feeding a hungry child is feeding a hungry child for a while and then stopping. 
   As I said, Mr. Speaker, the bill before us does not do as much as I would like. And I will keep fighting, through the amendment process and beyond, to increase funding for hunger and nutrition programs here at home and around the world. This is not the beginning of the end. It's the end of the beginning. This is a start. 
   Mr. Speaker, hunger is a political condition. We have the resources to  end hunger. What we need is the political will. Let us rededicate ourselves to helping those who need help the most. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend from Vermont (Mr. Welch) for yielding me the time to speak on this open rule, and I congratulate him for managing his first rule in this body. 
   And I should say that after listening to the previous speaker, my friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions), I have a bad case of whiplash, first, because when his party was in the majority, he routinely supported closed rules and, second, because when his party was in the majority, I can't recall a time when he supported waiving germaneness rules for a Democratic amendment. 
   Now, having said that, I want to tell my colleagues that the gentleman from Vermont is part of an extraordinary new group of Members who are helping to change the culture in Washington. And I thank him for bringing forward this open rule. These new Members, the ``majority makers,'' as the majority  leader likes to call them, were elected to this body because they stand for change. They stand for openness, transparency and honesty. 
   They spoke truth to power during the 2006 elections, Mr. Speaker, and they are here to do what is in the best interests of their constituents and the American people. 
   Mr. Speaker, with this open rule, the gentleman from Vermont is carrying forward the promise these new Members made to the voters. 
   Now, some of us who have been around here for a while and lived under the previous Republican leadership may have forgotten what an open rule looks like. I thought it was extinct, except on appropriations bills. But the rule that we are considering today is open, and that means that any germane amendment offered by any Member, Democrat or Republican, can be debated and voted on by this body. It is the way a deliberative body should act. 
   Now let me assure my friends on the other side of the aisle that this is not the only open rule that you will see in this Congress. This is the return of the House of Representatives as a deliberative body. 
   And I am also pleased to note that with this open rule we have equaled, in 1 month, the number of open rules provided by the previous Republican majority on nonappropriations bills in the 2 years of the 109th Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud that this new majority has moved in such a fashion, and I am proud that we were able to organize this House and, at the same time, pass meaningful legislation that will affect everyday Americans across this great Nation. A higher minimum wage, stem cell research, reduction in student loan interest rates, an increase in Pell Grants, ethics reform to clean up the culture of corruption that existed in the previous Congress, these are just a few of the accomplishments of this new majority in just 1 month. 
   Now we are moving on to the next phase, Mr. Speaker. Most of the House committees are organized, and they are beginning to hold hearings and they are producing legislation. The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Judiciary Committee recently held markups. The Ways and Means Committee and Financial Services Committee are scheduling markups as we speak. Legislation these committees produce will come to the Rules Committee, and we look forward to trying to bring that legislation to the floor in a more open and honest fashion than we experienced in the previous Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, the 110th Congress is a new Congress, but it is also a different Congress, and I am pleased to be able to serve with new Members like Mr. Welch of Vermont, who is managing this open rule; KATHY CASTOR; MIKE ARCURI; BETTY SUTTON; along with DENNIS CARDOZA, who is also new to the Rules Committee. These Members are ushering in a new era in helping shape this new direction for the House of Representatives. 
   So I want to thank my friend from Vermont for the time. I congratulated him on this open rule, his first, but certainly not his last.

   Mr. McGOVERN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule. And I want to take my time to also rise in support of the Blunt amendment on Colombia. 
   Mr. Speaker, I cannot describe the joy and the excitement that I felt on July 2 when I knew the rescue operation had been successful and that Mark Gonsalves, Keith Stansell, Thomas Howes, Ingrid Betancourt and 11 Colombians were finally free after years of torment and brutality suffered at the hands of the FARC. 
   I immediately wrote President Uribe congratulating him on the successful rescue. I also told President Uribe and members of the Colombian families that I remain committed to working for the release of the rest of the hostages. I would like to enter a copy of that letter into the Record. 
   Mr. Speaker, I know I speak for all my colleagues when I say that I want to see an end to the conflict in Colombia. I want to see the dismantling of all paramilitary, FARC, ELN, and other armed groups in Colombia. Clearly, this is in the best interests of the Colombian people as well as the United States. 
   I want to see the Colombian military and security forces finally break their ties to armed groups, drug lords and criminals, and to fully respect the rights of all Colombian citizens. 
   The Blunt amendment notes how intelligence and other cooperation by the United States contributed to weakening all of Colombia's illegal armed actors--the paramilitaries, the FARC and the ELN. It states that such assistance should continue to capitalize on recent successes. Mr. Speaker, I couldn't agree more. According to an analysis by the Center for International Policy, what is most interesting about the hostage rescue operation and other recent successes is how different it is from what has failed in the past, namely, massive and expensive military offenses, fumigation, and racking up civilian body counts. The rescue highlights what has worked--the intelligence and cooperation that the gentleman from Missouri encourages us to continue: 
   A greater intelligence focus aimed at the top leadership of the FARC and the captors of the hostages; 
   A public relations campaign making it clear to the guerrilla rank-and-file that those who desert and who surrender to the government will not be tortured or disappear as in the past, but instead will get job training, a stipend, and the promise of a new life; 
   And an increased presence by security forces in population centers and on main roads aimed at protecting civilians rather than treating them as suspects. 
   Mr. Speaker, most interesting about these strategies is that, with the exception of the cost of increased manpower and protective presence, they are relatively inexpensive. These efforts, which have proven so effective, make up only a sliver of Colombia's defense budget and only a sliver of U.S. assistance. Planners of future aid packages to Colombia should take note. 
   Intelligence and encouragement of desertion work--these relatively cheap but vastly improved capabilities made the bloodless rescue mission possible. It is hard to imagine the Colombian military of even just 2 years ago pulling off an operation like this, but today we celebrate the freedom of 15 Colombians and Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to enter into the Record a letter sent by Senator Richard Lugar to President Uribe urging him to seize this moment and open up negotiations with the FARC and the ELN to end the conflict and release the hundreds of Colombians who remain in captivity. Thus, indeed, will Colombia finally defeat the guerrillas and hopefully reunite the remaining hostages with their families and loved ones. I remain committed to this cause, and every Member of this Chamber should remain committed to this cause. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have many, many deep concerns about the human rights situation in Colombia and some of the aid we send. But the Blunt amendment is not an endorsement of the ``same old, same old.'' It is a recognition of something that has worked. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support the Blunt amendment, and I urge passage of this rule.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me say to my colleagues that this is a good rule, and it deserves to be supported. I would urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule. 
   I would say to my colleagues that what the gentleman from Washington just proposed on energy is yet another smoke screen by the Republicans in their effort to try to cover up their horrendous record on energy. They have been in control of this Congress. They were in control of the White House for years, and what we have seen are skyrocketing gas prices. They have done nothing to make us more energy independent.

   Mr. McGOVERN. No, I will not. 
   They have frustrated efforts by the Democratic majority to try to support alternative renewable, clean sources of energy from solar, to wind, to fuel cell technology, to you name it, and they have been against it. The President has refused to heed the appeal by Democrats and by the Speaker of the House to tap into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to provide the American people with immediate relief from these high gas prices. 
   What we have gotten is the same old, same old. We have two oilmen in the White House, and we have policies being proposed by the other side of the aisle which is the same old same old. Give the oil companies whatever they want. You know what? The oil companies are wrong, and they're gouging the American taxpayer, and it's about time we had a Congress that stood up to them. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1339 provides for the consideration of H.R. 415, to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate segments of the Taunton River in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as a component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. 
   This structured rule provides for 1 hour of general debate to be controlled by the Committee on Natural Resources. The rule makes in order four amendments which are printed in the Rules Committee report. The amendments are each debatable for 10 minutes, and the rule also provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this rule and in strong support of the underlying legislation. Introduced by my colleague from Massachusetts, Chairman Barney Frank, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 415.     
   This legislation would designate portions of the Taunton River in Massachusetts as part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers program. It is important to note that this legislation has support from every House member from Massachusetts and Rhode Island and from every government of the affected communities along the river. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to point out that this designation only affects three congressional districts in Massachusetts and two in Rhode Island. It does not impact any other State in our country.  
   Mr. Speaker, the Taunton River fully qualifies for and deserves this designation. As determined by the National Park Service, and I repeat, as determined by the National Park Service ``the Taunton River is eligible for wild and scenic designation based on its free flowing condition and the presence of outstandingly remarkable natural and cultural resource values.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, it is also important to note that this designation is distinct for different segments along the Taunton. Two segments of the river would be designated ``scenic'' and two as ``recreational.'' 
   Now some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have suggested that the Taunton isn't scenic enough or that it's too urban for this designation. One of my colleagues even went so far as to say that the only thing scenic about this area is the graffiti on the bridges. Mr. Speaker, I find that statement not just wrong-headed but deeply offensive to the people that I represent. That kind of elitism serves no purpose and has no role in this debate. 
   I would ask my friends on the other side of the aisle who believe that the Taunton River doesn't meet the right criteria for this designation to actually pay attention to what those criteria are. The Taunton River is the longest undammed coastal river in New England. It is home to over 150 species of birds, 45 species of fish and 360 plant species. It is the largest contributor of fresh water to Narragansett Bay. And its shoreline provides for a wide variety of recreational opportunities. For the communities of Fall River, Somerset and the others along the Taunton, this designation will support the economic development plans within the area. In my district, the Fall River portion of the river, the ``recreational'' designation complements the city's plan for waterfront revitalization, which includes a marina and a boardwalk. 
   Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I want to address the baseless claim that this legislation is some sort of end around to prevent energy development in Massachusetts. This is an argument cooked up by one particular energy company that wanted to build a liquefied natural gas facility within a stone's throw of people's homes. This company has even purchased full-page newspaper ads in an ill-conceived lobbying campaign. Sadly, some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have bought into their false argument hook, line and sinker. 
   First off, efforts to designation the Taunton began well before any proposal for a liquefied natural gas plant was announced. My mentor, Congressman Joe Moakley, filed legislation to study the river's designation in 1999, while the proposal for LNG was made public 3 years later in 2002. Secondly, this legislation is based on a study compiled by President Bush's National Park Service between 2000 and 2002. 
   And finally, this LNG plant proposal has been roundly rejected by the United States Coast Guard, the United States Navy, and the Commerce Department, due to overwhelming navigational suitability, environmental issues and maritime safety concerns. In other words, there is nothing this legislation can do that hasn't already been done by the people we task to keep our waterways safe. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation has never been about stopping LNG or energy production. In fact, by denying the communities and the Taunton River this designation, we further hinder their ability to utilize the river as a catalyst for economic development. This bill is about protecting the natural and cultural resources of the people who live along the Taunton River. It's about telling the people of southeastern Massachusetts that their environment, their heritage, their recreational opportunities and their economic development matter too. 
   I very much look forward to this debate. And I am eager to hear what my friends on the other side of the aisle have to say about this bill. I encourage my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by saying that I have great respect for the gentleman from Washington State.

   Mr. McGOVERN. I thank the gentleman for has question. I don't recall Mr. Frank's remarks verbatim. I am happy to look at the transcript. I did not say that. Let me respond here. And maybe the gentleman didn't hear my opening statement. But the Taunton River is eligible for a wild and scenic designation. But also part of it is eligible based on ``recreational.'' That is the word that the Bush administration's National Park Service has said is appropriate. Now, I very rarely agree with the Bush administration on anything. And I'm sorry the gentleman disagrees with the Bush administration on this. But what I find particularly cynical is the photograph that the gentleman just held up which is the exact photograph that this big-moneyed energy company published as part of an ad in a number of newspapers.

   Mr. McGOVERN. It is a photograph of the Taunton River. But the interesting thing about that photograph is the angle at which it has been taken. The fact of the matter is that this photograph that this big-moneyed energy company that my friend on the Republican side has held up is saying that this will be part of the, this area will be included in the designation which seeks to prove I think how inappropriate it has become because this industry has actually manipulated this photograph. But in fact much of that photograph is of a park. 
   You will note in the picture a World War II battleship. That is the USS Massachusetts. And let me show you it is no part of any industrial use today. It's part of a recreational area. The battleship is the centerpiece of a very important urban park called the Heritage Park in the city of Fall River. And there is a great deal of open space that is shielded cleverly, very cleverly in that photograph that was paid for by a big-moneyed energy company. On the opposite side of that river are boat ramps and houses that go right to the river for recreational purposes. And it's part of my district. 
   Now the gentleman maybe has a bias against providing working class people who live in urban areas any benefits from any kind of environmental designation. I disagree with him if that is his opinion. But he mentioned that the purpose of all of this was, in fact, to prevent an LNG site facility from being built in the middle of Fall River.     
   Let me put this out there so my colleagues understand this. There are currently only eight LNG terminals in the United States of America. Of those eight, Massachusetts currently has two LNG terminals in operation with a third one that has been approved by FERC. Massachusetts is the only State to permit not one, but two new LNG import facilities this decade in this country. Each of these facilities is authorized to double its output capacity. 
   I will yield after I finish my statement.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Reclaiming my time, the bottom line is we in Massachusetts realize the need for these LNG import facilities. 
   And I would like to point out to the gentleman from Washington, and if my geography is correct, Washington is still a coastal State, unless that has changed, but that his State has no LNG terminal in operation, under construction, or even proposed. 
   So when he implies that somehow the Massachusetts delegation is not stepping up to the plate in terms of making sure that not only New England but this Nation has energy, he is wrong. Massachusetts has been a leader on this. 
   Let me point out one other thing. This is not a Republican-Democrat issue with regard to the LNG facility and the Fall River. Mitt Romney, who the last time I checked was a Republican, and still is a Republican, was a leading opponent in the siting of the LNG facility in the middle of Fall River. In 2006, Governor Romney stated, ``Weaver's Cove and Fall River strike me personally as being an ill-advised site to receive LNG.'' Realizing that they were trying to site an LNG facility in a highly populated area, Governor Romney asserted, ``I don't like the idea of an LNG facility going into a populated area, not in the post-9/11 world.'' 
   We in Massachusetts have worked with energy companies to try to site these LNG facilities safely offshore. The idea that you would site an LNG facility in an area where there are countless people within a 1-mile radius of this facility is crazy. 
   Richard Clarke, the terrorist expert said, ``This is a bad idea.'' Now that is one opinion. Another opinion is the U.S. Coast Guard said it is a bad idea. The U.S. Navy says it is a bad idea. The Commerce Department says it is a bad idea. You are the only one who says it is a good idea, you and a big moneyed energy company. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are hearing all kinds of red herrings here, but understand one thing, this is not about energy. This is about whether or not a working class city, kind of the home base of the industrial revolution that is located on this river, can be designated as a wild and scenic area, whether or not the recreational aspects of this river can be recognized, whether or not we can afford this city of Fall River the benefits to help them use this river as a catalyst for economic environment. 
   It is too bad that this has become an elitist debate about well, no, you don't deserve it because this is a working class, urban area, home of the industrial revolution. You don't deserve that designation. I think that is wrong. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I listened to the previous speaker, and I am confused because he doesn't address what we are talking about here which is the designation of the Taunton River as having a wild and scenic designation. 
   Again that photo that he held up, which my colleague from Washington State held up, which was a photo taken by a big moneyed special interest energy company, is inaccurate. I mean everything below the bridge seen in the middle of that picture is not covered by this bill. 
   Here is if you take a picture from the other side which actually is the part that we are talking about being covered, it is a much, much different picture. It doesn't fit into the strategy of this special interest big moneyed energy company, but the reality is you see a much different picture of what we are trying to protect and what we are trying to preserve. 
   If people want to have a debate on energy, fine. I would simply say Massachusetts is doing its part. We are actually moving forward on licensing more LNG facilities. We recognize the need to do our part. We are doing the right thing. 
   The objection to this site for that LNG facility is that it is in the middle of a densely populated area that when these ships had to go down the Taunton River, three bridges needed to be shut down. The Coast Guard said it was a bad idea. I'm sorry you know more than the Coast Guard, about I trust the Coast Guard to tell me about navigational matters more than I do any of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. The U.S. Navy complained about it. The U.S. Department of Commerce said it didn't make any sense. 
   So this is a smoke screen, and it really is an insult to the people who live in this area. These are hardworking people and they don't deserve to be a pawn in your political debate. So I would urge my colleagues to support the underlying bill and support the rule. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, we have all kinds of inaccurate statements being made here and inaccurate photos being shown here. 
   Let me repeat, as determined by the National Park Service, ``The Taunton River is eligible for wild and scenic designation based on its free-flowing condition and the presence of outstandingly remarkable, natural and cultural resource values.'' That is a quote from the National Park Service. 
   It is also important to note that this designation is distinct for different segments along the Taunton River. Two segments of the river would be designated as scenic and two as recreational. This is not something that Congressman Frank or myself came up with out of the blue. This is what the Bush administration National Park Service has concluded. 
   I mean, I trust the National Park Service to tell me whether or not something fits this designation or it doesn't fit this designation, more so than some of my colleagues who are trying to make this into a political football. 
   Again, I would show this picture which is a more accurate picture of what we are trying to protect. And I would also say again that what I find  particularly offensive about this debate is that the people who are trying to be denied the benefits of this designation are hardworking people from Fall River. These are people who work in factories. These are people who have really been an engine for the economic development of this country over the years. And they are working class people. All of a sudden we are told that somehow they don't deserve this kind of benefit from this designation. Talk about elitism. 
   The National Park Service says this is the right thing to do. The previous designation of the other part of the Taunton River, by the way, when my colleague Joe Moakley brought it up, was voice voted. Everybody here thought it was a good thing. Now because we are all into politics and it is the election season, people are looking for anything to try to make a political point. 
   Enough with the political posturing. Let's once in awhile do the right thing. Let's once in awhile listen to what the National Park Service has said on this issue. Let's do what the people of this community want. Let's help this community benefit from the economic development incentives that will come from this designation.     
   These are good people. This is a good community. I am proud to represent the people of Fall River. Congressman Frank is proud to represent the people of Fall River, and I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to put the politics aside and do the right thing and vote for this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I feel like I'm in a Twilight Zone episode here. This doesn't make any sense. None of this makes any sense. 
   First of all, I would say to the gentleman that we have just as many LNG facilities as you do in Louisiana. I would say to the gentleman that we are moving forward. We just licensed another LNG facility. 
   I don't know what he's talking about. It doesn't make any sense to me when you talk about we are trying to frustrate our efforts. 
   Let me also say to the gentleman, with regard to this particular site, the United States Navy opposed the LNG terminal in Fall River, as they indicated it would disrupt their operations in their nearby Newport, Rhode Island, base. 
   The Commerce Department, Commerce Secretary Gutierrez ruled that Fall River would be an inappropriate site, citing the negative impacts on the flow of commerce along the waterway and environmental concerns. The United States Coast Guard. The Coast Guard. 
   Now you may be an expert on navigational issues, but I trust the Coast Guard more than I trust you on these issues. The Coast Guard has rejected the LNG plant in Fall River three times. 
   Captain Roy Nash, the head of the port of southeastern New England, found that the plan is ``unsuitable from a navigation safety perspective for the type, size and frequency of LNG marine traffic.'' 
   So this site doesn't make any sense. So the State of Massachusetts said, but we want to do our part, so we have licensed another facility. So where are we frustrating attempts on energy?

   Mr. McGOVERN. If I may reclaim my time, the U.S. Navy, the Commerce Department and the Coast Guard said this particular site is unsuitable. Oh, and by the way, here is another photo, not an artist rendition. It looks like it might be an artist. It looks, again, very picturesque, like it could have been done in oil colors. But this is another photo of what we are trying to protect. 
   Let me also say that the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1969 does not discriminate between urban and rural. This bill is consistent with the law and recommended by the Bush administration's National Park Service.

   Mr. McGOVERN. I reclaim my time. 
   The gentleman obviously has not read the Coast Guard's recommendation on this issue. It is more than just about a bridge, and there are many bridges involved. 
   Again, I would say to the gentleman that the debate is not about an LNG facility, it's about whether or not this area deserves the designation that we are debating here today. 
   And I'm sorry, I understand it's a political year, it's an election year, and the people on the other side are just trying to make political points. It's just sad that they are doing so potentially at the expense of some good people in Fall River.

   Mr. McGOVERN. There is a difference between the Boston Globe and the Boston Herald, I should tell the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Bush administration's National Park Service has suggested that this is an appropriate designation. Maybe they were brainwashed, I don't know. But it is just sad that you have, on the other side, some on the other side, have tried to make this a political pawn in your election-year politics. 
   This is really sad, and it's unfortunate, again, that the potential losers on this could be the hardworking people of Fall River and Somerset and the people along the Taunton River. This, to me, makes sense. Again, the Coast Guard has been emphatic in their opposition to this. I am interested. It's fascinating to see some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim they know more than the United States Coast Guard. But when it comes to navigational and safety matters, I trust them. 
   But when it comes to designations, when it comes to parkland designations and wild and scenic designations and recreational designations, I am going to trust the Bush's administration's National Park Service more than some of my colleagues. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McGOVERN. I yield myself the balance of our time, Mr. Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, let me say that this debate has been somewhat unfortunate because it has been about everything but what the underlying bill is about. As determined by the National Park Service, let me quote again, ``The Taunton River is eligible for wild and scenic designation, based on its free flowing condition and the presence of outstandingly remarkable natural and cultural resource values.'' 
   It is also important to note, Mr. Speaker, that this designation is distinct for different segments along the Taunton. Two segments of the river would be designated scenic, and two as recreational. By any measure, this should be a noncontroversial bill. This should be up under suspension. There should be relatively little debate on this. I mean, this is a no-brainer. 
   But my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have tried to make this about everything other than what this truly is about, whether or not this community of Fall River, and the community of Somerset and other communities along the Taunton River can benefit from this designation; whether or not they deserve to be able to get this legislation passed, and use this legislation to help be a catalyst for economic development. 
   This is a hard working city, Mr. Speaker, good people who have hit some tough economic times and who are desperately trying to rebuild the city by bringing the waterfront back, and this would help. 
   And this is not about whether or not a LNG facility should be there or not. I mean, I personally believe it should not be there. But the State, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is doing its part. I mean, it is not like Massachusetts is saying no to any LNG facility. We have two up and running, and we have permitted another. So we are doing our part. 
   My friend from Washington State comes from a coastal State. There are no LNG facilities there. I implore him, help us out. Do your part. We are doing our part in Massachusetts, so this is not about us saying no to LNG. We favor LNG. We favor responsible siting of LNG and we are doing that. We have more LNG facilities than anybody else here. So we are doing our part. This is not about that. That is just a smoke screen. That is just a way to politicize an issue that shouldn't be politicized. 
   Now, the gentleman's suggestion that we need to start drilling in ANWR. The Republicans argue that opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is an imperative for lowering gas prices, although their presidential candidate disagrees with them. 
   ANWR, Mr. Speaker, is a pristine wilderness, one of the most important onshore polar bear denning habitats in the Arctic. But right on the other side of Prudhoe Bay is the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska. This area has been set aside for oil and gas exploration since the 1920s. And according to the U.S. geological survey, it contains more oil than ANWR, over 10 billion barrels of oil total. And it is open for leasing, Mr. Speaker. It is open for leasing. About 3 million acres have already been leased, and about 4 million more will be up for leasing later this year. But there have been only 25 test wells drilled there since the year 2000, and no companies are producing oil from NPRA yet. 
   So why would we need to open ANWR when we have this huge, untapped resource right next to the existing oil infrastructure in Alaska? And when a natural gas pipeline gets built, NPRA will be even more important. It holds over 60 trillion cubic feet of gas, nearly 16 times what ANWR holds. 
   The focus should be on the area that has the most oil and that is open for leasing that isn't a highly sensitive environmental area. 
   Mr. Speaker, we need an energy policy in this country. Unfortunately, from this White House we have gotten zero. Two oil men who are focused on nothing but what the oil companies want, and for too long a Congress that has been complicit in giving the oil companies what they want and not engaged in forward thinking policies to become energy independent. That needs to change. 
   But in the short-term, we also need to do something else because the fact of the matter is that there are citizens in our country right now who are paying record high gas prices, and we have a winter fast approaching where oil is going through the roof. We need relief now as well. 
   And that is why the President should do what the Speaker of the House has urged, and that is to tap in to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve which is now filled at a record high, and put more gas and oil into our market to help stabilize and lower prices to make sure that people in the immediate term can get through these difficult times.     
   And then we need to embrace the energy policy and the energy principles that the Speaker, the Democratic majority has laid out of a way to get to energy independence, a way to drill in a sensible and an environmentally sensible way embracing alternatives, clean renewable sources of energy now and in the future. 
   But what they're proposing is not the way to go. It is a smokescreen. This debate has been politicized unnecessarily. This is all about political points. It is sad that on an issue so noncontroversial that it has come to that, but it has. That's the way they want to play, but it's the wrong way to do things around here. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and a ``yes'' vote on the rule.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Two questions. One is how does LNG reduce the price of gasoline at the pump for the average citizen? And two, how many LNG facilities do you have in Georgia? I think it is one. We have two up and running in Massachusetts and a third one permitted, so don't lecture us about not doing our part in addressing the energy crisis.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman. I have spoken at length about this issue this morning, but this debate is absurd. I mean, we have people holding up pictures that aren't even the right picture. The picture that the gentleman from Georgia held up, I should tell him everything south of that bridge is not covered by this designation. This is fiction that is being brought to the floor today. 
   The gentleman talks about LIHEAP. Yes, we do need emergency fuel assistance in New England. We have cold winters. But LNG doesn't translate into LIHEAP. And in terms of what we are doing to promote liquefied natural gas measures, we are doing much more than you are in Georgia. We have two facilities already up and running, and we have another one licensed. You know, Mr. Gingrey, help us out, do a little more in your State. Join in this cause to help us become more energy independent. Take your responsibility. We are doing it in Massachusetts. So please do not lecture us on the fact that we are not living up to our responsibility. We are. 
   The bottom line is, as Mr. Frank pointed out, this is a debate about whether the hardworking people of Fall River and Somerset and other communities deserve to get this designation on the lower Taunton River. And they do. 
   And it really is offensive to hear the way these people have been characterized, the way these hardworking citizens have been characterized. I am proud to represent Fall River along with Congressman Frank. These are good people and they don't deserve this and this bill, quite frankly, should not be subject to petty politics, and that is what is happening here.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I think we need to have a course in basic energy policy here so my colleagues know the difference between liquefied natural gas and the gasoline you put in your automobile and the oil people use to heat their homes. I mean, listening to this debate here, it seems like you have no clue about the energy that our country relies on. So let's get our facts straight here. Let's stop the fiction and let's do the right thing. Let's pass this bill. The people of Fall River deserve it.

   Mr. McGOVERN. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, this debate has been, to say the least, strange. My friends on the other side of the aisle have come to the floor with pictures of the Taunton River that are not even part of the designation that we're talking about. They have said that this is about LNG and that Massachusetts doesn't want to do its fair share. Yet we have three LNG facilities up and running, and a third that has already been permitted. They have confused their energies. They don't know the difference between liquefied natural gas, oil and the gasoline you put in your automobile. I mean their ignorance on energy is stunning. No wonder why they lost the last election. 
   And finally, they have tried to make political points at the expense of the constituents that I represent and that Barney represents. As Barney said, these are hardworking people. The tone  of this debate and the way my constituents have been characterized is insulting. It's a new low even for some of the people on the other side of the aisle. 
   Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me just say that the Bush administration's National Park Service says that this is a good idea. It was good enough for them. It should be good enough for you. Defeat this motion and vote for the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (PAYING TRIBUTE TO REVEREND WAITSTILL SHARP AND MARTHA SHARP FOR THEIR HEROIC EFFORTS TO SAVE JEWS DURING THE HOLOCAUST -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by thanking the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the distinguished ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee for bringing to the floor today H. Res. 52, legislation that pays tribute to the Reverend Waitstill Sharp and his wife Martha, the couple who fought genocide. I also want to express my gratitude to both of my colleagues for their eloquent words in support of this legislation. 
   Last year on September 14, I was privileged to join the wife of the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Annette Lantos, at a ceremony held at the U.S. Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., honoring the Reverend Waitstill and Martha Sharp as they became the second and third Americans to be added to the honor roll of 21,000 Righteous Gentiles and non-Jews whose efforts saved countless lives during the Holocaust. At that ceremony we were joined by family members of the Sharps in honoring the memory of this distinguished husband and wife team. 
   Mr. Speaker, on that same day The Washington Post wrote an article about the Sharps, calling them ``The Couple Who Fought Genocide'' and I would like to share with my colleagues excerpts from that article: 
   ``As the Nazis marched across Europe in 1939 and 1940, a Unitarian minister from Massachusetts and his wife rushed into the coming Holocaust to save Jews and other refugees, including scores of children. When they set out for Europe in January 1939, Germany had seized the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia and refugees were flowing across the continent. The American Unitarian Association asked numerous ministers to go to Europe before Waitstill, 37, and his social worker wife, Martha, 33, agreed. 
   ``Prague, Czechoslovakia, was home to one of the world's largest Unitarian congregations, which was helping refugees of all stripes--Jews, trade unionists, political dissenters, and others. The Sharps arrived to lend a hand in February 1939, and 1 month later, the city was occupied by the Nazis. 
   ``On March 15, 1939, the day the Germans took Prague, Martha Sharp guided an anti-Nazi leader to asylum at the British Embassy. A few days later, the Reverend Waitstill Sharp arranged for a member of the Czech Parliament to be smuggled out of a hospital morgue in a body bag. The Nazis soon closed the Sharps' office and threw their furniture into the street, but the couple stayed another 5 months and got out just ahead of the Gestapo. 
   ``On their second foray to Europe, they worked in Marseilles, France, and helped smuggle across the Pyrenees into neutral Portugal. One of their close collaborators was Varian Fry, a 32-year-old New York editor who devoted himself to saving European intellectuals and who was the first U.S. citizen placed by Yad Vashem on its `Righteous Among the Nations' honor roll, which includes Oskar Schindler and Raoul Wallenberg. 
   ``Since the Sharps burned most of their records to keep them out of Nazi hands, no one knows how many lives they actually saved. Their grandson, Artemis Joukowsky, III, of Boston, estimates they helped 3,500 refugees in Prague, though it is unclear how many survived. In Marseilles, they pioneered routes that hundreds used to escape. 
   ``Marianne Scheckler-Feder of Laguna Hills, California, has a fuzzy but enduring memory of Martha Sharp, reinforced by a fading black-and-white photograph taken on a sun-dappled street in the French port of Marseilles.     
   `` `I remember a figure. She was a very, very elegant lady. Kind of serious and very concerned. You looked up to her. She demanded respect,' Sheckler-Feder said, who is now 79 years old. 
   ``Thousands of refugees from across Europe had flocked to Marseilles in hopes of gaining passage abroad, only to be interned in work camps when France surrendered to Germany in 1940 and the Nazis set up a collaborationist government in Vichy. Sheckler-Feder was 12. She was one of three Jewish sisters, nearly identical triplets, who had fled with their parents from Vienna, a bare step ahead of the Nazis.  
   ``Marseilles was the end of the road, the end of hope, until they met Martha Sharp. She pestered Vichy officials to issue exit visas for 29 children, including nine Jews. With almost as much difficulty, she persuaded our State Department, which was rife with anti-Semitism at that time, to let the children and 10 adults into the United States. 
   ``Sheckler-Feder and her sisters traveled by train to Lisbon and sailed in December 1940 aboard the Excambion, a ship stripped of all furnishings except sleeping bags, blankets, and pillows to accommodate as many passengers as possible. Their parents eventually followed. 
   ``Sheckler-Feder has no doubt that were it not for Martha Sharp, her family would have perished: `What she did for us is outstanding. It will never be forgotten.' '' 
   Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to have introduced this bill with the esteemed chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Congressman TOM LANTOS, along with House Members of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council, Representatives CANTOR, LATOURETTE, and WAXMAN, the Members of the House congressional delegations representing Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and other bipartisan co-sponsors. 
   I want to thank Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the majority leader and the minority leader, JOHN BOEHNER, for supporting this consideration on the Suspension Calendar. 
   It is my hope that all of us in this House will not only pay tribute to the memory and legacy of Reverend Waitstill and Martha Sharp but will recognize the example they set. There are many urgent situations confronting our world today where people's lives are in grave danger. Many people in communities even face the threat of genocide, as is the case in Darfur. I hope that we can learn from the Sharps' example that each of us can make a difference, can save the lives of others, and all we have to do is step up and answer the call. It is my hope that the inspiration of the Sharps will compel our government and other civilized governments across this world into taking more proactive and more effective steps to stop the genocide that is now going on in the Sudan. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to pass this resolution. Again, I want to thank my friend Mr. Lantos and my friend Ms. Ros-Lehtinen for their eloquent words of support.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (PROVIDING FOR REDEPLOYMENT OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES AND DEFENSE CONTRACTORS FROM IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - May 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, this war is a terrible tragedy, and it is time to bring it to an end. This is a straightforward bill to redeploy our military forces from Iraq and to end the war in Iraq, and I want to thank the leadership for bringing it to the floor today. 
   This bill would allow the administration and joint chiefs 3 months to plan a safe and orderly redeployment process, and then an additional 6 months to carry it out. It provides for the orderly transfer to Iraqi authorities the military bases and facilities we have constructed and occupied on their national territory, as General Petraeus himself has always insisted would happen when we depart from Iraq. 
   The bill permits U.S. Armed Forces to remain deployed in Iraq in order to protect U.S. embassy and diplomatic personnel. It also allows limited special operations to pursue members of al Qaeda and other global terrorist organizations, and it continues the training and equipping of Iraqi security forces. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill does not walk away from Iraq or the Iraqi people. It specifically continues diplomatic, social, economic, and reconstruction aid; and it allows the President to provide asylum or other means of protection to those Iraqi citizens who might be physically endangered by our leaving Iraq because of services they provided to our military personnel. 
   Finally, this bill leaves all the decisions on the locations outside of Iraq to which our troops will be redeployed wholly in the hands of our military commanders. They may be deployed to neighboring countries or transferred to Afghanistan. Many, I hope, would be sent home by commanders, grateful that their service is now completed. And many of our proud Guard and Reserve units would, I hope, return to their stateside duties to protect our homeland. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is no nice, neat, easy way to leave Iraq. Every Member in this Chamber understands that. But it is the right thing to do. The American people have chosen us to act on this matter, and we must act. 
   Redeployment of our troops will set a new dynamic into motion in Iraq and the region. It will force the Iraqis, their neighbors, and the international community to finally confront the tough issues of reconciliation. Until we leave, no one has to make the hard choices about how Iraqis are going to live together or die together. 
   Like all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I stand in awe of our uniformed men and women, who have performed fearlessly and tirelessly in Iraq. But we should no longer demand that their sweat, blood, and lives be sacrificed on the altar of Iraqi sectarian violence. They are needed elsewhere, in Afghanistan, in the region, and here back home. Their duties, their global mission and purpose continue, but Iraq must find its own way. 
   Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. For four long deadly years, this administration and their allies in Congress have been flat wrong about Iraq. The time has come for us to begin redeploying our troops from Iraq in a safe and orderly manner. 
   Now, every one of us, whether we voted for or against the war, has a responsibility for the men and women who have been put in harm's way. It is easy to say stay the course; but I would remind my colleagues, none of us will wake up tomorrow in the midst of a civil war in Iraq. None of us will have to go on patrol in Fallujah or Baghdad. We owe our troops better than rhetoric; we owe them honesty and action. 
   For me, this is a vote of conscience. For me, this is a way to restore the good and decent name of the United States. For me, this is a way to best serve our men and women in uniform, by bringing them home to their families. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill and vote to end the war.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for yielding me the time, and I thank all of those who participated in this debate today. 
   Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other side of the aisle apparently believe in and want to continue the status quo. That is their right. But I believe they are wrong. They have been wrong for 4 long, deadly years. So it is time for new leadership, for a new direction, for a new policy, a policy based on reality, not spin, not press release, not intimidation. 
   My friends say that we can't leave Iraq until the Iraqis ask us to leave. I saw a story that appeared on the Associated Press wire today which states that a majority of Iraqi lawmakers endorsed a draft bill calling for a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign troops and demanding a freeze on the number already in the country. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, we just heard from the gentleman from California that the Iraqi Government represents the Iraqi people, and apparently the Iraqi Government is telling us they want us to have a time certain when we leave. 
   Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. Our friends on the other side of the aisle argue that the best way to support the troops is to ask them to participate in a failed policy. Well, I disagree. 
   The question before us is simple: Do you want to end this war? If you do, then you will vote for the bill before us. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me end this debate the way I began it, by reminding everyone in this Chamber, Republican and Democrat, reminding everybody, whether you supported the war initially or whether you opposed the war, that we all have a responsibility. We have a responsibility to those men and women who we have put in harm's way, and that responsibility is to act responsibly, to make sure that we are giving every consideration before we put them in harm's way. 
   We are now entering the fifth year of this war. We have a President who refuses to admit one error, one misjudgment. The fact of the matter is, there are two ways to end this war: one, with the cooperation and the help of the President, which we all want. The other way is for Congress to do its job, to take its responsibility seriously and to do what is necessary to bring this war to an end. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to vote for the underlying bill.

   Mr. McGOVERN. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I would simply say that obviously this is yet another cynical attempt to try to avoid dealing with the issue that I think both Democrats and Republicans want to deal with, and that is whether or not we should have a timetable for withdrawal and redeployment from Iraq. 
   This is a procedural motion that, as the gentleman from Wisconsin pointed out, is so broad, this could justify keeping us in Iraq forever and ever and ever. And for the ``regional security of the Middle East,'' what does that mean? This is an open-ended invitation for our military involvement and for our permanent occupation of Iraq forever. This in and of itself is not particularly well thought out. 
   I understand what you are trying to do, and that is to avoid giving people the opportunity to vote on this. But essentially what you are doing is gutting this legislation. 
   I would strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this motion. We are on our fifth year, our fifth year of this war, no accountability and no admission that perhaps we need to take a different course; and the best you can do is come before us with this motion that would, again, if passed, would allow us to stay and occupy Iraq indefinitely. 
   I think this is a bad idea. I think it is a cynical idea. I think the people on the other side should have the guts to vote ``no'' on the timetable if you don't want to withdraw our troops. If you want a never-ending war, then have the guts to vote for it, but this is not the way to do it. I urge rejection of this motion.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 370 provides for consideration in the House of S. Con. Res. 21, the Senate version of the concurrent budget resolution for 2008. It also provides for the House to insist on the House-passed version of the budget resolution and to request a conference with the Senate. 
   The rule is very simple. It allows the House to disagree with the Senate budget resolution and request a conference. It doesn't interfere with the motion to instruct conferees; it just allows the House to go to conference and appoint conferees. 
   This rule is necessary, Mr. Speaker, because the Republican leadership refused to agree to the customary unanimous consent request required to go to conference on a Senate numbered bill. In fact, there is no instance in recent memory where a separate rule has been adopted to go to conference with the Senate on a budget resolution due to the objection of a unanimous consent request. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am having a hard time figuring out why my Republican friends are choosing to be obstructionists on even the most routine housekeeping measures. They talk a lot about civility and comity in the House, but apparently it is just that, talk, because their actions point to a very different strategy. 
   The new Democratic majority, on the other hand, is committed to results. We were elected to get things done, and that is exactly what we will do, with or without the cooperation of the Republican minority. 
   This rule does not block a vote on approval of the Senate budget resolution, as amended. It does not interfere with the motion to instruct conferees. It simply allows the House to insist on its version of the budget resolution and to request a conference with the Senate, nothing more. So let's pass this rule and get the budget resolution into conference. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, if I could respond to the gentleman from Texas, I don't know what he's talking about. The fact of the matter is that the Democratic budget resolution does not contain a single tax increase. Period. The Concord Coalition stated that the budget resolution does not call for or require a tax increase. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said the House plan does not include a tax increase. The Hamilton Project of the Brookings Institute says the budget would not raise taxes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I sat on the Budget Committee. I had the honor of serving under Chairman Spratt. And I would say to the gentleman from Texas, if he reads the budget resolution, it actually supports the renewal of the middle-class income tax cut. 
   Section 401 of the budget resolution commits the budget to the support of the middle-class tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003, including the child tax credit, the marriage penalty relief, the 10 percent individual income tax bracket, estate tax reform, research and development tax credit, and the deduction of State and local sales taxes. 
   Section 203 of the budget resolution clearly provides a reserve fund for the extension of those tax cuts so long as the legislation complies with the House pay-as-you-go rule. 
   Now, the gentleman from Texas gets up here and brags about the fiscal record of the Republicans in the Congress. Well, the American people, I think, saw through the misplaced priorities of the Republican Congresses, as evidenced by the results of the November election. 
   But so there is no misunderstanding, let me make it very clear to everybody who is watching. We need to correct the fiscal course of the country because the fiscal outlook that we are confronting has deteriorated dramatically over the past 6 years because of the Republicans misplaced priorities. 
   In 2001, the Bush administration inherited a projected 10-year budget surplus of $5.6 trillion. That's $5.6 trillion. Within 2 years, that surplus was gone, and the United States began accumulating an amount of national debt, adding $2.8 trillion to our Federal debt burden since 2001. 
   Now, to make matters worse, most of that debt has been purchased by foreign investors, making the U.S. economy more vulnerable to economic and political instability and political pressure from abroad. 
   So for anyone to get up here and to brag about the Republican record on fiscal matters, I think, to me, defies comprehension. The record is clear. You have messed up the economy of this country in terms of this incredible debt that we have now put on the backs of our kids and our grandkids and our great grandkids. What the Democratic budget is trying to do is restore some fiscal discipline, pay-as-you-go, and to get this country back on the right course. 
   Having said that, Mr. Speaker, I'd like to yield 8 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from South Carolina, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, Mr. Spratt.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, just because my colleagues on the Republican side say that the Democratic budget raises taxes doesn't mean it's true. Let me repeat that so no one misses this point. The budget resolution that we are talking about does not contain a single tax increase. That is a fact. Sometimes facts are a stubborn thing, but that is the fact. And the Republican spin machine can say whatever it wants; but the fact of the matter is, and I repeat, this budget resolution does not increase any taxes. 
   Secondly, I appreciate the fact that the gentleman from Texas was waxing nostalgic about the Clinton years when President Bill Clinton was the President of the United States and we were getting our fiscal house in order. But what I was talking about was what happened when President Bush became President and we had Republicans in the White House and in the Congress, and that is when we saw the skyrocketing of our Federal debt. 
   You know, budgets do reflect the priorities of a nation. And one of the reasons that I think people decided to vote for change in the last election is because they did not appreciate the priorities that were put forth by the previous Republican Congresses. They did not appreciate our veterans being shortchanged; they did not appreciate the most vulnerable in our country being shortchanged. If anyone has any questions about whether or not we were adequately funding veterans health, just recall the recent scandals of Walter Reed and at so many other of our veteran hospitals all across the country. You know, we voted in this Congress to send our young men and women into war. The least we can do is to make sure that the necessary funding is there to take care of them when they return, and the Democratic budget does that. 
   Let me also say for the record, Mr. Speaker, that notwithstanding all of the flowery language that we've heard from the other side, it is important to remember that in the last 6 years poverty has gotten worse in America. There are more people today than 6 years ago that need to rely on food stamps and other government programs just to get by. 
   So these fiscal policies that have resulted in skyrocketing debt, that have resulted in foreign countries like China purchasing our debt, I don't know how that serves our national interest, have not produced this incredible economic boom that we're hearing today. And I would encourage my colleagues to look at the statistics, to look at the facts, to talk to some of the people who have gone from being in the middle class, who have now fallen below the poverty line. There are far too many people that have done that, and what we are trying to do is to make sure that there is opportunity for everyone. 
   At this point, Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 5 minutes to the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, Mr. Spratt.

   I would simply say to my colleagues that under their watch, that many middle-class taxpayers actually saw their taxes go up, because when the Federal Government cut essential programs to States and cities and towns, people saw their property taxes go through the roof. 
   I think one can make an argument that people are paying far too high gas prices right now because of the years that were squandered under the Republican leadership, emboldened to the oil industry and refusing to invest adequately in alternative sources of energy.

   As I pointed out earlier, Mr. Speaker, there are more people in poverty today than 6 years ago. There are more people who are food insecure today than 6 years ago. That is not a record of accomplishment that I would want to brag about on the House floor. 
   The budget that Mr. Spratt has brought before us achieves key objectives in six areas. It is fiscal responsibility, defending our Nation, putting our children and families first, growing our economy, preserving our planet, and promoting an accountable and efficient government. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have inherited this incredible budget deficit and this debt from the previous majority. It is not easy to try to clean up this mess, but that is what the underlying budget before us tries to do. 
   I would urge all my colleagues to vote for it. It is the right thing to do. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. 
   The previous question was ordered.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (FOOD STAMP CHALLENGE -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, today is my final day on the Food Stamp Challenge, an initiative where public officials eat for 1 week on a food stamp budget, $21 for the week. That is $3 a day, or $1 per meal. This amount reflects the national average of the food stamp benefit. 
   Mr. Speaker, the purpose of the Food Stamp Challenge is to raise awareness of the crucial role the food stamp program serves in the lives of 26 million Americans each month, including over 450,000 in my State of Massachusetts. 
   Three of my esteemed colleagues, Representatives Jo Ann Emerson, Jan Schakowsky and Tim Ryan, joined me in taking the challenge over the past week. And although we may be less energetic and perhaps crankier than when we started the challenge nearly a week ago, each of us has learned a great deal. 
   Certainly my wife, Lisa, and I have gained valuable insights from our experience on a very tight budget. We have much more sympathy over how the lack of energy and the hard choices of  how to stretch the budget and put food on the table might also stretch one's patience and stress a marriage. We can imagine the worry and pain of parents if we had to feed our children on this kind of budget. 
   These are just a few of our reflections over the past week. Yet truly our most valuable lesson came from the scores of individuals who reached out to us to share their personal experiences struggling to put food on the table for their families. Whether they posted comments on our blog or called my office and spoke with my staff, these individuals taught Lisa and me about how hardworking Americans manage to provide for themselves and their families in spite of inadequate food stamp benefit levels. 
   They talked about having to make tough trade-offs between paying utility bills, buying clothes for their children, addressing medical needs and purchasing food. They also described the trade-off between eating to be healthy or eating to be full. These kinds of trade-offs are unfair and unacceptable. 
   Mr. Speaker, America can and should do more for low-income individuals and families working hard to survive each and every day. One way we can do that is through the Feeding America's Families Act, a bill that I introduced earlier this month with my colleague, Congresswoman Jo Ann Emerson. 
   The Feeding America's Families Act would strengthen the food stamp program to better meet the needs of low-income Americans. It raises the minimum benefit from $10 a month--an amount that has not increased since the 1970s--to about $30 a month. It also indexes current benefit levels to the rate of inflation, ensuring that the purchasing power of food stamps remains constant. 
   Furthermore, because access to the food stamp program should be the right of every lawfully residing person in this country, the bill restores eligibility to all legal immigrants, a provision that was removed in 1996. 
   On Sunday, May 13, Mother's Day, the New York Times editorial stated that ``bolstering food stamps must be Congress's top priority in this year's farm bill.'' Well, I could not agree more. My week on the Food Stamp Challenge has not only strengthened my conviction, I encourage all of my colleagues to cosponsor H.R. 2129, Feeding America's Families Act, and other legislative efforts to bolster and improve our Federal hunger and nutrition programs. 
   The cliche tells us that where there's a will there's a way. But in this case, there is a very clear way. The question is, do we have the political will? I believe we do.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (TIME TO LEAVE IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, the time has come for us to leave Iraq. The President intends to continue his war until he leaves office and let the next President clean up his mess. White House advisers debate how to buy more time. 
   Over 3,600 U.S. troops have been killed. Hundreds, perhaps thousands more, will be killed while we wait for this President to end this war. Thirty thousand U.S. troops wounded. Will that number double while we wait for this President to end his war? Thousands of Iraqi men, women, and children dead, $10 billion each month squandered. Are we ready to spend $200 billion more? 
   On Sunday, the New York Times laid out why, how, and when the U.S. should end this war. It pulled no punches about how ugly the aftermath might be. It was a hard and honest statement of where we stand right now and where we need to go. 
   Mr. Speaker, Congress must act. It is time to end this war.  
   The Road Home 
   It is time for the United States to leave Iraq, without any more delay than the Pentagon needs to organize an orderly exit. 
   Like many Americans, we have put off that conclusion, waiting for a sign that President Bush was seriously trying to dig the United States out of the disaster he created by invading Iraq without sufficient cause, in the face of global opposition, and without a plan to stabilize the country afterward. 
   At first, we believed that after destroying Iraq's government, army, police and economic structures, the United States was obliged to try to accomplish some of the goals Mr. Bush claimed to be pursuing, chiefly building a stable, unified Iraq. When it became clear that the president had neither the vision nor the means to do that, we argued against setting a withdrawal date while there was still some chance to mitigate the chaos that would most likely follow. 
   While Mr. Bush scorns deadlines, he kept promising breakthroughs--after elections, after a constitution, after sending in thousands more troops. But those milestones came and went without any progress toward a stable, democratic Iraq or a path for withdrawal. It is frighteningly clear that Mr. Bush's plan is to stay the course as long as he is president and dump the mess on his successor. Whatever his cause was, it is lost. 
   The political leaders Washington has backed are incapable of putting national interests ahead of sectarian score settling. The security forces Washington has trained behave more like partisan militias. Additional military forces poured into the Baghdad region have failed to change anything. 
   Continuing to sacrifice the lives and limbs of American soldiers is wrong. The war is sapping the strength of the nation's alliances and its military forces. It is a dangerous diversion from the life-and-death struggle against terrorists. It is an increasing burden on American taxpayers, and it is a betrayal of a world that needs the wise application of American power and principles. 
   A majority of Americans reached these conclusions months ago. Even in politically polarized Washington, positions on the war no longer divide entirely on party lines. When Congress returns this week, extricating American troops from the war should be at the top of its agenda. 
   That conversation must be candid and focused. Americans must be clear that Iraq, and the region around it, could be even bloodier and more chaotic after Americans leave. There could be reprisals against those who worked with American forces, further ethnic cleansing, even genocide. Potentially destabilizing refugee flows could hit Jordan and Syria. Iran and Turkey could be tempted to make power grabs. Perhaps most important, the invasion has created a new stronghold from which terrorist activity could proliferate. 
   The administration, the Democratic-controlled Congress, the United Nations and America's allies must try to mitigate those outcomes--and they may fail. But Americans must be equally honest about the fact that keeping troops in Iraq will only make things worse. The nation needs a serious discussion, now, about how to accomplish a withdrawal and meet some of the big challenges that will arise.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (ECUADOR FACING HUMANITARIAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL CRISES -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I have just returned from a remarkable trip to Ecuador. From November 8 through 13, I traveled through northern Ecuador looking at the refugee crisis on its border with Colombia and on the effects of oil contamination on the land and people of the Amazon basin. 
   I saw firsthand the terrible human and environmental costs that have resulted from the decades-long failure to properly clean the contamination left by oil drilling and production. Specifically, the sites I visited were those that were under the control of Texaco, now Chevron. I visited oil pits that were poorly constructed, poorly remediated, or remediated not at all. This has left a toxic legacy for poor campesinos and indigenous peoples. 
   I also saw the infrastructure that Chevron/Texaco created that allowed for the wholesale dumping of formation water and other highly toxic materials directly into the Amazon and its waters. 
   As an American citizen, the degradation and contamination left behind in a poor part of the world by this U.S. company made me angry and ashamed. 
   The drinking water for thousands of poor people is horribly unfit, even deadly. Children are drinking and bathing in water that reeks of oil. In one village, San Carlos, I couldn't come across a family that hasn't been touched by cancer. Mothers brought their children to show me the terrible rashes and sores that covered their bodies. 
   A lawsuit has been filed against Chevron by 30,000 Amazon residents demanding that the company accept responsibility for substandard production practices and help with the clean-up efforts. Chevron, for its part, asserts it was released from responsibility in the 1990s, and the release remains in legal dispute. 
   Neither Congress nor the United States Government should get involved in a legal matter that will soon be decided in a court of law. But as the years pass and nothing is done, the situation on the ground has become more and more desperate for thousands of poor people, and the pollution spreads deeper into the soil, the water, and the Amazon basin. 
   I firmly believe these people and their environment need help and they need help now. 
   As I traveled further north towards the border frontier, I found a growing humanitarian and security crisis. Eight years ago, the United States started pouring military aid--$4.8 billion of it--into Colombia, much of it focused on military operations in the violent coca growing zones just across the border from Ecuador. 
   The result has been an alarming spillover of violence into Ecuador's peaceful but impoverished borderlands. Over 200,000 Colombians--a number rivaling many refugee crises in Africa--have fled to Ecuador to escape the violence and intense fighting between guerilla groups, the Colombian military, and Colombian paramilitary militias. 
   As the GAO recently reported, harsh U.S. counter-drug strategies have failed to halt cocaine production in Colombia or ease the violence that comes with this illegal economy. Instead, organized crime has been pushed across the border into Ecuador. 
   Mr. Speaker, I stood on the banks of the San Miguel River, which marks the border between Putumayo, Colombia, and Sucumbios, Ecuador. Only a few hundred yards of water separate the two. 
   Mr. Speaker, Colombia's war is literally bleeding, violently, into Ecuador, which has no history of illegal drug cultivation or insurgency from its own people. Tensions between the two nations are high and diplomatic relations remain cut off. 
   The refugee communities that I spoke with in Lago Agrio, Barranca Bermeja, and Puerto Mestanza feel abandoned and discriminated against.  They long to return to Colombia even as they describe the terror that forced them to seek safe haven in Ecuador.     
   They spoke of the need for community development projects but have no one to turn to to help them help bring their modest ideas into reality. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, is nearly the lone partner with the Ecuadorian government in dealing with the largest refugee crisis in the hemisphere, with some aid from the World Food Programme and the IOM. Where are the other NGOs and U.N. agencies that would normally be involved in a crisis of this magnitude? 
   These crises are not of the making of the government of President Rafael Correa. Ecuador needs and deserves the support of the international community and Congress to address these challenges. They cannot be allowed to remain invisible. 
   Mr. Speaker, I was deeply moved by my visit to Ecuador, and I will never forget the courageous people, Ecuadorians and Colombians, who told me their stories and asked for my help. They deserve to live a much better life. In the weeks ahead, I hope I can count on my House colleagues to help these communities in this effort.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3996, TEMPORARY TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 809 provides for consideration of H.R. 3996, the Temporary Tax Relief Act of 2007, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate controlled by the Committee on Ways and Means. The rule makes in order a substitute amendment to be offered by Representative McCrery of Louisiana or his designee. The amendment is debatable for 1 hour. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3996, the Temporary Tax Relief Act. I want to commend the distinguished chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Congressman CHARLIE RANGEL, for his usual great work on this bill. 
   And I want to say a special thank you to my good friend and colleague and neighbor from Massachusetts, Congressman RICHIE NEAL, who has been a champion on the issue of the alternative minimum tax for a long, long time. RICHIE NEAL has been the canary in the coal mine, talking about the AMT when nobody else was, and he deserves an enormous amount of credit for his work. 
   Mr. Speaker, we all know that the alternative minimum tax was never designed to hit middle-class families, but that's exactly what will happen unless Congress acts. 
   In my district alone, the numbers are staggering. In 2005, 13,000 families were hit with the AMT. That number will jump to nearly 83,000 in 2007, a 517 percent increase, unless we do something about it. 
   These middle-class workers are struggling with enough problems, skyrocketing fuel costs, higher tuition, higher property taxes, higher child care costs. And for years, President Bush and his Republican allies in Congress passed huge tax cuts for the wealthy, while doing very little or nothing to help hardworking middle-class families. That has to stop, and we're going to stop it today. 
   My Republican friends on the Rules Committee often like to talk about how strong the economy is, how GDP is growing at such a rate. Well, I agree to a certain point, Mr. Speaker. Somebody is getting pretty rich in this economy, but I would point out that it usually isn't the workers, and they're the ones that make this country great. Last year, the average CEO made 364 times what the average worker did. Just 25 years ago, CEOs made only 42 times more. 
   So yes, the people at the top are having a blast, but we need to do more for the people in the middle and for those struggling to get into the middle. 
   This bill before us today not only spares these hardworking families from the AMT, but it does so in a fiscally responsible way, and that is at the heart of the argument before us today. 
   Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle believe that we should patch the AMT without paying for it. They believe that we should simply add the cost on to our national debt, a debt, by the way, that has now reached $9 trillion. That's trillion with a ``T.'' 
   Of course, this has been their approach for years. The Iraq War? Not paid for. The Bush tax cuts? Not paid for. The Medicare prescription drug benefit? Not paid for.  
   But, Mr. Speaker, someday, somebody, somewhere is going to have to pay for all of that debt. It's going to be our children and our grandchildren. It's wrong and it's got to stop. 
   It makes no sense to cut taxes for today's middle-class families just to raise taxes on future middle-class families, but that's exactly the kind of debt tax that my Republican friends would like to enact. 
   My friends believe that these tax cuts pay for themselves. They believe that the magic money fairy will drop revenue from the sky with rainbows and butterflies. But in the real world, actions have consequences. The Massachusetts families that I am honored to represent have to make tough choices, and Congress has to make some tough choices, too. 
   These PAYGO rules that Democrats have enacted are tough. This new fiscal discipline isn't easy, but it's the right thing to do. And rescuing tens of thousands of families in my district from the pain of the AMT is also the right thing to do. 
   I thank my colleagues for their hard work, and I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to my colleague from Washington State. He began by saying there is an easy way to do this; there is a way for Washington politicians to do this and that is to provide this relief without paying for it. That is what the Republicans have done while they were in charge here. They have borrowed and spent, borrowed and spent, borrowed and spent; and we have  a debt that is in the trillions and trillions of dollars. 
   The gentleman from Washington says that some people will have to pay more in order to offset this AMT relief package. Well, 50,000 tax returns will be affected, and that is by closing a loophole that, quite frankly, I think, every sensible person believes should be closed. 
   But here is the return: by impacting those 50,000 tax returns, we are going to protect 23 million middle-class families from being hit by the alternative minimum tax. We will provide 30 million homeowners with property tax relief. We will help 12 million children by expanding the child tax credit. We will benefit 11 million families through the State and local sales tax deduction. We will help 4.5 million families better afford college with a tuition deduction. 
   We will save 3.4 million teachers money with a deduction for classroom expenses, and we will provide thousands of American troops in combat with tax relief under the earned income tax credit. 
   So what we are doing here is providing much-needed relief to middle-income families, and we are doing it in a responsible way, and we are not passing the bill onto our kids and our grandkids like they have done for years and years and years. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon of the committee on Ways and Means, Mr. Blumenauer.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, the previous speaker began by saying he is so proud of this economy and it's doing so well. The thing that he may not know is that he thinks it's doing well,  but the majority of the American people do not think it's doing well. A recent poll showed that over 70 percent of people in this country think we are going in the wrong direction. Maybe he needs to get out of Washington a little bit more, outside the Beltway, talk to real people and understand the struggle people are going through. 
   The gentleman also knows that tax bills are traditionally considered under a closed or structured process. Under this rule, the minority has the opportunity to offer a substitute as long as it does not violate any House rules. The Rules Committee made this substitute in order sight unseen and this rule gives the minority an opportunity to amend this bill if they choose. 
   Again, one of the new rules that we are operating under here in the House is that you have to pay for whatever you do. You can't borrow anymore. You can't run up the natural credit card anymore. You can't burden our kids and grandkids anymore. You have to be responsible.

Let me remind him that we did the Defense appropriations bill, which supports our troops. We did the Labor-HHS, which funds, among other things, the National Institutes of Health. We did the Homeowners' Defense bill to deal with natural disasters. There was the Peru Free Trade Agreement. There was the ENDA bill, which ends discrimination against people based on their sexual orientation. We overrode, thankfully, the President's unwarranted veto on WRDA so that we could actually support our infrastructure, which this President and the Republicans in Congress have denied funding for for so many years. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I think we had a good week, and I'm proud of what this Democratic Congress is doing.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the previous question, I urge them to vote ``yes'' on the rule, and I urge them to vote ``yes'' on the underlying bill. 
   Thousands of middle-class families in this country deserve relief from the AMT tax, and that's what this underlying bill is all about. In addition, as we provide relief to these middle-class families, we owe it to our kids not to saddle them with the bill, and that's also the purpose of the underlying bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have two kids, a 9-year-old son and a 6-year-old daughter. I don't want to leave them with a future in which they have to pay for all of the mistakes and all of the mismanagement of my generation. 
   The Republicans want to have it in a way that they can do things and not pay for anything. We have a war in Iraq. It's not paid for. Doesn't bother them in the least. Their prescription for health care is take two tax breaks and call me in the morning. It doesn't bother them in the least that the bill is going to be paid for by our kids and our grandkids. Tax cuts for the rich. Again, put it on the backs of our kids and our grandkids. Mr. Speaker, that is irresponsible. 
   Our Nation is currently burdened with over $9 trillion of national debt. The average daily interest accruing on this debt exceeds $1 billion. Each American share of this debt is more than $30,000. We cannot afford to keep taking on this additional debt. 
   When the Democrats regained control of the Congress, we instituted PAYGO rules, pay as you go. Families in America have to live within their budgets. The United States Congress ought to be able to live within a budget. We need to be fiscally responsible. 
   So, if you want to give your rich friends a tax cut, then pay for it. If you want to have a war, then pay for it. We need to pay as you go. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. Vote ``yes'' on the previous question and ``yes'' on the rule.

   Yes, this represents a compromise. It is better than what President Bush first proposed. But, that's not good enough. That's not a high enough standard. 
   I want to remind my colleagues that what we are debating today is something very serious. We are talking about our most basic civil liberties and civil rights. And when it comes to those issues and principles we must be very, very careful. 
   This compromise still provides immunity for telecom companies that may have participated in President Bush's illegal surveillance program and it fails to adequately protect the privacy rights of law abiding, innocent American citizens. Furthermore, the bill has a four year sunset provision which, in my view, is much too long. 
   I know that we live in a dangerous world. I am well aware that there are some who want to do us harm. It is for that reason I understand the need to update our laws to better protect our people. 
   I continue to believe that we can do that--without turning our backs on the values and principles that make America unique and great. This bill goes too far. I urge a ``no'' vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H. CON. RES. 99, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise in support of this rule and in support of this budget resolution. It provides our families, seniors and children with economic security, health care, and nutrition. 
   Madam Speaker, 5.4 million more people live in poverty today than in the year 2000. That is over 35 million total, and 12.4 million are children. One in every eight Americans is hungry. One in eight does not know whether they will be able to put food on the table. Madam Speaker, every single Member of this Congress should be ashamed of these statistics. The United States is the only wealthy industrialized nation in the world that tolerates widespread hunger amongst its people, including its children.     
   The decision to tolerate hunger in America has serious costs for us as a Nation. We constantly hear that we are a Nation committed to leaving no child behind. But children who are hungry, who live in poverty, cannot keep up. They cannot develop and thrive. They cannot learn or play with energy and enthusiasm. 
   Hunger stunts the physical, mental and emotional growth of millions of our children. When these children become adults, they are more likely to have low earnings and low productivity in the workforce. Their poor health means more illness that requires large health care expenditures. Their early mortality robs our economy of their labor and consumption. They are more likely to engage in crime, which results in monetary and personal cost to their victims and to the taxpayers for the cost of our criminal justice system. And, sadly, they are also more likely to be victims, resulting in similar costs. 
   In other areas, we see the difficulties faced by our seniors, who are dehumanized and demoralized when they have to choose between utilities and food. Many need special diets and adequate nutrition for their medications to work effectively. But, unfortunately, hundreds of thousands lack adequate food. And when we fail to end hunger among our elderly, we choose to add to their immediate and long-term health care costs, even while we hasten their deaths. 
   These are some of the priorities addressed in the Democratic budget resolution. 
   This budget resolution recognizes the burden faced by families when they are forced to choose between rent, food, heat and medicine, and provides funding for children's health care and provides funding for programs like LIHEAP, Head Start and low-income housing. 
   I want to thank Chairman Spratt for holding a budget hearing on hunger and inviting Boston pediatrician Deborah Frank and South Carolina food banker Denise Holland to testify about the urgent need to address hunger in America. I only wish more of my colleagues attended that hearing. 
   We heard how food stamp benefits provide a first defense against hunger but are too meager to solve the problem, how food stamp benefits average just $1 per person per meal, how the minimum monthly benefit is stuck at the decades-old level of $10, and how the program is missing four in every 10 eligible people. 
   Madam Speaker, it is unconscionable that the programs proven to attack hunger in America are continually under attack. The Commodity Food Supplemental Program is continually zeroed out by the Bush administration. The Food Stamp Program is constantly derided, with fraud, waste and abuse cited, when, according to the GAO, it is running at the most productive levels in the history of the program. 
   It is unconscionable, Madam Speaker, that legal immigrants, people here legally with proper documentation, must wait 5 years for the food stamps they may need today, simply because they happen to be newcomers to our Nation. This is simply bad policy, and it needs to be fixed immediately. And it is unconscionable that children in need who receive breakfast and lunches during the school year are denied food during the summer months simply because school isn't in session. 
   The next farm bill needs to invest the additional Federal resources to improve these Federal anti-hunger programs. It should improve the food stamp benefit, open eligibility to vulnerable and underserved groups, and adequately fund and fully utilize USDA resources to support emergency food assistance and other commodity assistance programs that serve the needy. 
   This budget resolution, by providing a $20 billion reserve fund for the farm bill and by rejecting the President's arbitrary eligibility cuts to food stamps and the elimination of the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, not only makes a strong statement on the need to combat hunger in America, it actually takes concrete steps to do so. 
   This resolution deserves support for the economic and food security it provides all our people, but, and let me stress, it is only a beginning. Ending hunger is not and should not be a partisan issue. The moral and economic costs affect every community in America. There is not a single community in America that is hunger-free. 
   So I call upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work together here in the Congress and in our communities to create the sustained and comprehensive investment necessary to end hunger and to make us a stronger Nation. One step in this path is to pass the budget resolution before us.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1065 provides for the consideration of H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008, a structured rule. The rule provides for 2 hours of general debate and makes in order four amendments, each of which is debatable for 10 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, all Members of this House should be very proud of the bipartisan collaboration and careful compromises that have resulted in the underlying bill before us today, H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act. I wish to express my appreciation to the work of the gentleman from New Jersey, Congressman Donald Payne, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health, and Subcommittee Ranking Member Chris Smith, as well as House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Howard Berman and Ranking Member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. And, like all of my House colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I am grateful that the committee named this bill after the great leaders of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Chairmen Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde, who guided the original 2003 act into law. May the collegial spirit of these two great champions for global health guide us all during today's debate. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5501 would authorize $50 billion over the next 5 years for U.S. global programs that address the prevention, care, and treatment of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. It strengthens, sustains, and expands a program that is universally recognized as one of the shining accomplishments of the Bush administration. 
   The challenge for this reauthorization is to move our HIV/AIDS programs beyond the emergency phase first called for under the President's Emergency Program For Aids Relief, or PEPFAR, and make them sustainable over the long term. Over the past 5 years, we have literally gone from watching people die from HIV/AIDS to watching people live and return to productive lives in their communities. 
   The 2003 Act provided $15 billion over 5 years; H.R. 5501 provides $50 billion, a direct response to the needs identified over the past 5 years for life-saving medicines and well-trained, effective national health care systems. 
   The 2003 law relied upon the health care workforce and infrastructure already in place in developing countries. In a farsighted move, Mr. Speaker, today's bill invests in strengthening HIV-related health care systems and building the capacity of the health care workforce in these nations. Under this legislation, funds will be used to train some 144,000 new health care workers over the next 5 years to care for people infected with HIV. 
   This is just a start on easing the severe shortage of health care workers in the developing world, and it is our hope that other donor nations will follow our lead. If there is ever to be a hope that these programs can become self-sustaining, health care capacity must be significantly strengthened in countries hard hit by HIV/AIDS. 
   The 2003 bill focused on creating new programs to tackle the HIV/AIDS crisis. This reauthorization builds stronger linkages between our global HIV/AIDS initiatives and existing programs designed to alleviate hunger, improve health care, bolster education, and increase income security and stable livelihoods, an approach endorsed by the President's Global AIDS Coordinator in February in his annual report to Congress. These changes ensure that our HIV/AIDS programs no longer operate in isolation from our other development priorities, and that the expertise and benefits from these other programs are provided in an effective manner to HIV/AIDS affected individuals, families, and communities. 
   In addition, the bill increases U.S. contributions to the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, and provides benchmarks to improve the transparency and accountability of the Global Fund. 
   And while the majority of the funding authorized in H.R. 5501 is focused on the prevention, care, and treatment of HIV/AIDS-infected people and communities, I would like to emphasize that the bill specifically authorizes $4 billion over 5 years for a comprehensive strategy to combat tuberculosis, and $5 billion for the prevention, treatment, control, and elimination of malaria. In addition, it better integrates our HIV/AIDS programs with the diagnosis, testing, counseling, treatment, prevention, care, and health care treatment needed in the fight against TB and malaria. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5501 also removes the requirement that one-third of all funds for HIV/AIDS prevention be dedicated to abstinence-only programs. Over the past 5 years, this restriction has proven to hamper the effectiveness of our health care efforts in the field, as documented by two recent independent reports produced by the Government Accountability Office, GAO, and President Bush's own Office of Personnel Management. This reauthorization now requires the Executive to promote a balanced prevention program that includes every element of abstinence, being faithful, and condoms, the ABC approach toward HIV transmission prevention. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5501 also allows U.S.-supported family planning organizations to provide HIV/AIDS testing and counseling services. This will ensure that many more women of reproductive age receive vital information related to their HIV status, as well as HIV/AIDS education. 
   Mr. Speaker, we all need to recall that 20 million men, women, and children have perished from HIV/AIDS; 40 million people around the world are HIV positive; and each and every day another 6,000 people are infected with HIV. It is a moral imperative that we act strongly, decisively, and continue to address this crisis in a forward-looking manner. 
   Five years ago, President Bush acted to meet a perceived emergency as the AIDS epidemic spread out of control. During that period, the United States has provided drug treatment to nearly 1.5 million people. We have given supportive care to another 6.6 million, including 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. And, our programs have prevented an estimated 150,000 infant infections. During this first 5-year phase of programming, U.S. bilateral programs to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria were expanded to 114 countries. Today, the U.S. now supports programs in 136 countries, including programs funded by the United States and administered through the Global Fund. 
   We can all be proud of this record of accomplishment, but there is so much more left to do. Now we must work on making these initial gains sustainable, our programs even more effective, and expanding them to reach an even greater number of HIV/AIDS affected communities. 
   Specifically, over the next 5-year period, H.R. 5501 aims to: 
   Prevent 12 million new infections; 
   Provide anti-retroviral treatment for 3 million people, including 450,000 children;  
   Provide medical and other care for 12 million people, including 5 million orphans; 
   And, train over 140,000 health care workers in the developing world. 
   Mr. Speaker, addressing global HIV/AIDS is one of the moral imperatives of our time. And while history will no doubt judge our response, it is more important that each of us recognizes that we can truly make a difference in the lives of millions of people right here and right now. 
   H.R. 5501 represents a genuine bipartisan compromise. I urge my colleagues to adopt this rule and to support the underlying legislation, H.R. 5501. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   To be honest, Mr. Speaker, I find it stunning that a Member from the Republican Party would come up here and talk about the debt that our children have been forced to inherit. I will remind my colleagues that when Bill Clinton left office, we had a surplus. After the leadership of George Bush and the Republican Congresses, we are now in historic record debt. I now have inherited a debt tax. 
   I am all for investing more in medical research. I would much rather do that, quite frankly, than invest in tax cuts for Donald Trump or more subsidies to Big Oil companies or more tax giveaways to big corporations that are gouging the American taxpayer. 
   But what we have here, Mr. Speaker, is a bill to save lives. This is a moral imperative. It is a product of bipartisan collaboration. This is something that we can be proud of. This is something the American people, I think, support overwhelmingly. 
   And so, we don't need any lectures about the mess this economy is in. This President and the Republican Congresses have driven this economy into a ditch, and we're trying to get us out of that ditch. 
   So, I would urge my colleagues to focus on what is being debated here today, which is a bill to save lives, to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. This is a worthy goal. This is something that we should be committed to. And I think that the bipartisan collaboration that has produced this deserves to be praised and not ridiculed.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Again, I find it somewhat ironic to listen to the gentleman's comments who has no problem supporting a $3 trillion war in Iraq that has resulted in 4,000 American soldiers dead, tens of thousands wounded; and on top of all that, not even paying for the war, just putting it on the credit card so our kids and our grandkids have to pay for it. Many of my friends on the other side of the aisle who have supported tax cuts for the richest of the rich and decided that it wasn't important to pay for it; instead, put it on the credit card and on the backs of our kids; who have voted for budgets to cut veterans health and to cut money for health care in general. And what we have been trying to do is to make up for the indifference of so many years. 
   You know, the gentleman presents a false choice. What we're trying to do here is actually respond to a humanitarian crisis in a bipartisan way. I mean, I don't often stand with the President of the United States, but I do on this. He's right. We can't ignore the HIV/AIDS crisis or the crisis with regard to malaria and tuberculosis around the world. 
   This is a moral imperative. And I will tell you, in addition to being a moral imperative, it makes sense for the United States to take a leadership role and encourage the rest of the world to step up and to provide the resources to combat these scourges. 
   This is the right thing to do. I'm proud of this bipartisan collaboration of this bill. And I hope all my colleagues will support it. 
   I want to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida, my colleague on the Rules Committee, Mr. Hastings.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5501 is one of the most important foreign policy global health bills this Congress will pass this year. We have literally gone from, 5 years ago from standing helplessly by and watching people die of HIV/AIDS, to watching people live and take up productive lives in their communities. The impact is far-reaching. 
   For example, Mr. Speaker, let me highlight just one sector of development that has broad bipartisan support in this Congress, basic education. We all know that education is key to lifting countries out of poverty. And HIV/AIDS creates barriers to education. 
   Teacher deaths and absenteeism due to HIV/AIDS compound problems of quality and access in education systems that already face teacher shortages. 
   Children are often pulled out of school to care for a family member with HIV/AIDS or, when a parent dies, they're forced to take care of younger siblings rather than attend school. 
   HIV/AIDS affected children who are able to attend school often face discrimination and are sometimes segregated from other children or denied admission entirely by teachers or school administrators. 
   Young people with little or no education are more than twice as likely to contract HIV as those who have completed primary education. 
   But under this bill, and as we continue to better integrate our HIV/AIDS programs with our other development priorities, schools can become hubs of care and support for orphans and vulnerable children by providing psychological support, nutrition and basic health care and support to OVC caregivers. 
   In a 32-country demographic and health survey, women with post primary education were four times more likely than illiterate women to know the basic facts about HIV/AIDS, and three times more likely to know that HIV can be transmitted from mother to child. 
   Oxfam estimates that if all children completed primary education, 700,000 new cases of HIV/AIDS in young people could be prevented each year, totaling 7 million cases in one decade. 
   Mr. Speaker, for these and so many other reasons, this bipartisan bill deserves our support. I urge my colleagues to support this rule and to support the underlying bill, H.R. 5501.

   Mr. McGOVERN. I thank the chairman, and I ask for time for the purpose of the gentlelady from Missouri and I entering into a colloquy with the chairman on the importance of integrating food and nutrition programs with the prevention, care, and treatment of HIV/AIDS-affected individuals, families, and communities. 
   Last year, I traveled to Africa and had the opportunity to see firsthand many of our programs related to food security. In Ethiopia and Kenya, I visited HIV/AIDS programs to look at how food and nutrition was included. At that time, I heard from local communities, NGO partners, and our embassy staff how restrictive guidance for global HIV/AIDS assistance often hindered their ability to design and carry out effective food and nutrition programs targeted at HIV/AIDS affected individuals, families, and communities. The lack of resources available for food and nutrition programs within the global HIV/AIDS assistance and from other sources also posed a significant barrier. 
   I very much appreciate and support the work of the committee in ensuring that this bill addresses these concerns throughout, and especially in the section entitled ``Food Security and Nutrition Support.'' The bill recognizes that strengthening the linkages and enhancing coordination among HIV/AIDS programs and vital development programs, like food and nutrition programs, will significantly increase our effectiveness in the fight against HIV/AIDS while we advance other essential U.S. development priorities. I remain concerned, however, that the bill is less clear on where or how such funding will be provided for these purposes. It is not clear on how much funding will  come from the Global HIV/AIDS program versus other sources of funding. I am concerned that, without adequate resources through the Global HIV/AIDS program, or necessary increases for current food and nutrition services through programs like Food for Peace, that USAID will be faced with the possibility of having to divert funding from programs that address long-term chronic hunger and food insecurity to meet the enhanced mandates of H.R. 5501. 
   I know the chairman will agree that we want to avoid this scenario of robbing Peter to pay Paul so that we do not end up shortchanging other communities suffering from hunger, malnutrition, and food insecurity. 
   I want to yield to the gentlelady from Missouri in this regard.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act. I thank and commend the distinguished Chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Dingell, and the chair of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Rangel, as well as the subcommittee chairs, Mr. Pallone and Mr. Stark, for their hard work and dedication in bringing this bill to the floor today. I also want to commend the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, for her dedication to the children of America and her steadfast support for a strong, inclusive S-CHIP bill. 
   The issue before us is simple. Either you believe that 10 million low-income kids deserve health care or you don't. 
   I know the President and some of my Republican colleagues don't want to have this debate. They don't want another vote on the S-CHIP bill. They want this issue to just go away. 
   Well, I have some news. 
   This isn't going away. We're going to keep fighting until 10 million kids get the health care they so desperately need. 
   It is astounding to me--it literally takes my breath away--to watch President Bush fight to deny health care to children. It is shameful. 
   From day one, President Bush and the Republican leadership in the House trashed Democratic proposals to insure children who--at no fault of their own--are falling through the cracks of the health care system. 
   It's clear that America's health care system is broken. Too many are uninsured. Too many rely on emergency rooms for their health care. And, at the same time, health care costs continue to rise--making it harder for businesses to provide their workers with the health care they need and 
   making it too expensive for individual families to buy on their own. And God forbid if you have a pre-existing condition--you can forget it. 
   All of us here in Congress have world-class health care, and so do our kids. Maybe the problem is that not enough members of Congress understand what it's like to struggle, to spend sleepless nights worrying about a sick child, wondering how you're going to pay for their doctor's visits. 
   Today, the Democratic majority--with the help of some brave Republican Members--will once again approve an S-CHIP bill that provides health care to 10 million children. 
   This is what we were sent to Congress to do. 
   The only logical conclusion we can take from President Bush's veto, from the partisan political attacks on a 12-year-old boy and his family, and from the continued stonewalling of this bill, is that the majority of Republicans don't want to provide health care to children. 
   It's that simple. Republican leaders tried to block this bill in the Energy and Commerce Committee. Then they stretched the truth about who would be covered. 
   Let's be honest here--the House and the Senate will approve this bill and President Bush--the former compassionate conservative candidate--will veto it. The question is, how many Republicans will continue to vote to deny health care to 10 million children and how many will--for the well-being of these children--decide to stop playing politics and vote to override the veto? 
   Madam Speaker, House Democrats have come more than halfway. This bill doesn't go as far as I would like, but it's a good, bipartisan effort. It addresses the issues raised by some on the other side of the aisle. The bill President Bush vetoed never provided health care to illegal immigrants--despite the incorrect claims coming from the other side. This bill makes that even clearer. The bill President Bush vetoed never provided health care to families making $83,000 a year and 
   neither does this bill. The bill President Bush vetoed took 2 years to phase out adults currently on the S-CHIP program and this bill speeds that timeline up to 1 year. 
   Let me be clear--under this bill, families who can afford health care will not be eligible for S-CHIP. Under this bill, illegal immigrants will not be eligible for S-CHIP. Under this bill, adults will not be eligible for S-CHIP. 
   But 10 million American children who don't have health care will get the help they so desperately need. The time has come for the members of this body to make a choice--will they stand with the children of America, or will they stand with President Bush? 
   I know where I stand, Madam Speaker. 
   It's time to stop playing games with the lives of children. It's time to pass this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, in Massachusetts, we have begun to address the crisis of the uninsured. We believe health care is a right, not a privilege for the wealthy. 
   The president's veto of the bipartisan SCHIP compromise abandons 11 million children, including 90,500 Massachusetts children. That is unacceptable. 
   I wish President Bush would take the time to meet hardworking families like the O'Neils of Fall River. They were just blessed with their first child, Sean. Dad works several jobs while his wife recovers her health. 
   But the cost of all those doctors' visits and immunizations add up. Thanks to SCHIP, Sean is a happy, healthy baby. 
   But thanks to the President's veto, my proactive State exhausted its SCHIP allotment on October 1. Even with the extension, all of its funds will be gone by January 11. 
   To justify his position, the President has decided to distort what this good bill actually does. It doesn't cover well-off families. It doesn't cover illegal immigrants. What it does do is give a hand to millions of families who are struggling to provide health care for their kids. 
   I simply don't understand the President's priorities. He's more than happy to sign bills giving billions of tax breaks to oil companies and multi-millionaires, but he won't sign a modest, fully-paid-for bill that helps millions of low-income children? He's willing to spend hundreds of billions of dollars--none of it paid for--in Iraq but is unwilling to sign a bill that is paid for and will keep children from losing their health care? 
   That makes no sense to me. 
   This bill has the support of the medical community, children's advocates, and even the insurance industry. There is simply no reason for the President to reject it, other than partisan politics. 
   I will continue to fight for this important program, and I urge all of my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, to do the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2956, RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and the underlying bill, H.R. 2956, the Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe this House ought to voice its gratitude to the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Skelton, for bringing before this House a thoughtful, responsible bill that outlines what we must do next in Iraq. 
   The bill clearly notes that our uniformed men and women have carried out and completed their mission for which they were authorized by Congress. The search for weapons of mass destruction is over. There were none, not a single one. The regime that put Iraq in an impossible international position no longer exists. So it's time that we draw down our troops from Iraq and require this administration to clearly define what the troop requirements and costs will be for the next phase of U.S. involvement in Iraq, a far more limited mission to root out al Qaeda and protect our diplomatic personnel inside Iraq. 
   The bill also promotes the kind of active diplomacy with Iraq's neighbors necessary for achieving a more lasting climate of stability in Iraq and throughout the region. Much, much more, Mr. Speaker, must be done. I expect to see stronger legislation in September, but this bill puts us on the right path. 
   For 5 long, deadly years, this Congress has done nothing but rubber-stamp a tragically flawed policy. It is shameful. Whatever the cause the President and many Members of Congress thought they were pursuing in Iraq, it is lost. Political leaders inside Iraq appear incapable of putting national interest ahead of sectarian and personal agendas. Iraqi security forces operate more like sectarian militias. And despite their best efforts, the additional military forces we have poured into the Baghdad region have not been able to change the equation. 
   Over 3,600 of our troops have lost their lives to this battle. Thousands more have been wounded. It is wrong, Mr. Speaker, simply wrong to ask them to continue to sacrifice their lives and their limbs for this failed policy. 
   The war in Iraq is breaking the back of our military. It is causing severe damage to the Federal budget to the tune of $10 billion each month, and causing grave harm to the future fiscal health of our Nation. It continues to undermine our most important political, diplomatic, military and strategic alliances. It saps our ability to focus on global terrorism and to safeguard our own people. And it has contributed to the chaos inside Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is past time for change. And while President Bush keeps scorning deadlines and promising  breakthroughs that never come, it is clear that he lacks the vision, the wisdom or the courage to chart a new course. It is frighteningly clear that the President plans, instead, to stay the course and dump this mess on the next President. 
   It is time for Congress to step up to the plate and change direction in Iraq. It is time for every Member of this House to work together to draw down our forces and bring our troops home to their families and their communities. 
   For too long Congress has been complicit, and the American people are frustrated, and they are angry. We don't need more studies or commissions. We don't need more excuses. We don't need more delay. Too many lives are being lost. What we need is for Members of Congress to make a choice, to stand up and be counted. Will you continue to rubber-stamp the current disastrous policies in Iraq or will you vote for change? 
   We must act now, Mr. Speaker. This is simply too important to wait any longer. Too many lives are on the line. 
   All of us, no matter how we originally voted on the war, share in the responsibility in what is happening in Iraq. All of us, by not voting to change course, are responsible for sending so many of our brave men and women into a civil war where far too many of them have been killed. 
   If the President of the United States will not respect the will of the American people and end this war, then Congress must.  
   U.S. Troop Buildup in Iraq Falling Short  
   BAGHDAD.--In the Ubaidi neighborhood in the eastern part of this city, American soldiers hired a local Iraqi to clean the Porta-Potties at their combat outpost. Before the man could start, members of the local Shiite militia threatened to kill him. 
   Today, the Porta-Potties are roped off, and the U.S. soldiers, who could not promise to protect their sewage man, are forced to burn their waste. 
   As part of the Bush administration's troop ``surge'' strategy, the U.S. unit here had moved into an abandoned potato chip factory hoping to push out the militia, protect existing jobs and provide stability for economic growth. Instead, militia members stymied development projects, cut off the water supply and executed two young Iraqi women seen talking to U.S. soldiers, sending a powerful message about who really controls Ubaidi's streets. 
   In the next few days, the Bush administration is scheduled to release a preliminary assessment of its overall Iraq strategy. Officials may point to signs of progress scattered across the country: a reduction in death-squad killings in Baghdad, agreements with tribal leaders in Al Anbar province, offensives north and south of the capital. 
   President Bush defended his strategy Tuesday, demanding Congress give his administration more time and insisting that America can ``win this fight in Iraq.'' To underscore his request, Bush sent top aides to lobby lawmakers on Capitol Hill. 
   But as the experience of the troops in Ubaidi indicates, U.S. forces so far have been unable to establish security, even for themselves. Iraqis continue to flee their homes, leaving mixed areas and seeking safety in religiously segregated neighborhoods. About 32,000 families fled in June alone, according to figures compiled by the United Nations and the Iraqi government that are due to be released next week. 
   U.S. forces have staged offensives to push insurgents out of some safe havens. But many of the insurgents have escaped to new areas of the country, launching attacks where the U.S. presence is lighter. 
   And there has been no sign of any of the crucial political progress the administration had hoped to see in Iraq. 
   U.S. commanders are painfully aware that they are running out of time to change those realities. Army Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top American commander in Iraq, has made several efforts to slow the clock in Washington. Each time, it has sped up. 
   The full complement of the ``surge'' arrived in Iraq last month, bringing the total to 28,500 additional troops. Military officers originally hoped to have until 2008 before they had to render a verdict on the strategy. Then the Washington timeframe shrank to September. Now, it is shrinking further, with Congress demanding answers even sooner. 
   Supporters of the troop buildup insist that small steps could grow into larger and more long-term successes if lawmakers are patient. 
   ``Right now we are three weeks into this. It's not like flipping a light switch,'' said a military officer in Baghdad, expressing the frustration of many commanders. ``Time has to be given for things to work.'' 
   Commanders point to Ramadi, the capital of Al Anbar province, as a showcase for the kind of results the military wants from the current strategy. Once a battlefield, the city is now largely peaceful, calm enough that in March, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki was able to pay his first official visit. 
   But military officers stress that it took about nine months of sustained effort to make Ramadi a relatively pacified city. And with its volatile mix of Sunni and Shiite Muslims, Baghdad presents a far more complex challenge than all-Sunni Ramadi. 
   The interim progress report that Bush promised to release this week is likely to emphasize the success the military has had in killing Sunni militants in the ``Baghdad belts,'' the cities and towns that dot the major rivers and highways leading to the capital. In recent weeks, the newly arrived U.S. forces have been focused on fighting members of Al Qaeda in Iraq, a militant Sunni group made up of Iraqis and foreign fighters. 
   Top generals say the strategy is crucial to securing Baghdad. Only by controlling the routes into the capital, and denying militants safe havens, can the U.S. and Iraqi militaries keep out the car bombs that stoke sectarian violence inside the capital. 
   But leading Iraqis are less sure of the strategy. 
   Mahmoud Othman, a Kurdish member of the Iraqi parliament, said the U.S. approach may be successful at weakening Al Qaeda in Iraq. But he said Americans would not be able to solve Iraq's sectarian conflict or stop clashes between armed groups in Baghdad neighborhoods. 
   ``The surge has an important effect in fighting Al Qaeda,'' the independent politician said. ``On the Sunni-Shiite conflict, it hasn't had any effect. ..... Extremist Shiites and Sunnis are fighting each other. The Americans can't stop this.'' 
   U.S. officials have made little, if any, progress with their persistent calls for Iraqi officials to take steps toward reconciliation between Shiites and Sunnis. 
   Key administration officials, most prominently Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Vice President Dick Cheney, have visited Iraq to push for passage of an oil-revenue sharing law, provincial elections and reform of rules barring members of the former ruling Baath Party from government jobs. 
   But the Iraqi government is bogged down by fighting among Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish parties. It is unclear whether the oil law, the one piece of benchmark legislation still given hopes for passage before September, will reach a vote any time soon. 
   The number of death-squad killings in the capital, one sign of sectarian divisions, is down from earlier this year. But the number remains roughly at the level seen after the 2006 bombing of Samarra's Golden Mosque, which served as a catalyst for the extreme sectarian violence. 
   In Baghdad, the number of bodies found dumped in the streets dropped to 540 last month from 830 in January. Some American officers say those numbers could rise again. And others say that the decline may simply represent the depressing reality that most Baghdad neighborhoods are now segregated, meaning there are fewer people left for death squads to kill. 
   Maj. Gen. Joseph Fil, Jr., the commander of U.S. forces in Baghdad, said that American troops at the end of June controlled about 42% of the city's neighborhoods, up from 19% in April. 
   But to many Iraqis, that is little comfort. ``The Americans do not make me feel safe,'' said Amin Sadiq, a 30-year-old Shiite worker in the Ghadeer neighborhood of east Baghdad. ``When you hear the speeches of the top U.S. military leaders, you think that everything is ideal and perfect and Iraq will be better. But when you see how the U.S. soldiers behave, I really feel I should not trust the leaders.'' 
   The American military has helped bring a tense truce in some areas, but has not re-integrated once-mixed neighborhoods. 
   The western Baghdad neighborhood of Ghazaliya, once a prosperous mixed middle-class area, was riven by sectarian violence in 2006. It is now divided between Shiites in the northern end and Sunnis in the south, with the U.S. military stuck in the middle, trying to keep the peace. 
   ``Last year, things were bad. This year is worse than before,'' said a man in his 50s who identified himself as Qais Qaisi. 
   The presence of Iraqi and American security forces means that Sunnis cannot fight back against the Shiite militias, which have the tacit support of the Iraqi army unit in the area, Qaisi said. But he nevertheless voiced concern about a possible American pullout. 
   ``If the multinational forces withdraw, there will be very bloody sectarian battles,'' he said. 
   Military officers routinely say that improving the economy is a prerequisite to improving security. And U.S. forces, by putting up barriers and controlling traffic, have been able to reopen some marketplaces that had been targeted by suicide bombers. Although that has allowed some neighborhood commerce, success with other projects has proved more elusive. 
   The Pentagon is working to reopen state-owned factories and has identified several dozen that can be renovated and restarted. But that work is slow, and many residents say they see few improvements in their neighborhoods. 
   Although U.S. forces have been able to overcome militia threats and start small neighborhood projects such as installing streetlights, they are not able to initiate larger undertakings.  
   ``We aren't doing anything meaningful,'' said one mid-level noncommissioned officer. ``Where are the real projects? We aren't offering these people enough safety, or money, or jobs.'' 
   Amid the political setbacks and continuing violence, however, there are signs of relative calm in some areas. 
   Earlier this year, the streets of Baghdad were desolate at sunset. Now, in places, there are signs of life. 
   In Yarmouk, a neighborhood in west Baghdad, 18-year-old Ahmed Shakir used to see bodies on the street every day. Snipers fired from hidden perches and gunmen clashed with U.S. and Iraqi soldiers. But last month, after weeks of U.S. patrols, his neighborhood started to feel safe--safe enough for Shakir to stay outside on the basketball court until 8:30 p.m. 
   ``It is usually me and three of my friends, we always go play basketball,'' he said. ``Now we have U.S. and Iraqi patrols roaming the streets every day. If they continued doing this, things will remain better. If not, then it will get worse for sure.  
   Center for American Progress To: Members of the 110th Congress. From: John Podesta, Lawrence Korb, and Brian Katulis.  Re: Iraq Study Group's Recommendations Overtaken by Events in Iraq. Date: July 11, 2007.  
   Senators Ken Salazar (D-CO) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) have introduced legislation that would adopt all of the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group. There are growing signs that the White House and Republican legislators, having previously rejected the ISG report late last year, will now seek to co-opt the ISG recommendations this summer and fail to provide a bipartisan veneer to their efforts to pretend they are shifting course in Iraq. 
   We acknowledge the important contributions made by the ISG and its co-chairmen James Baker and Lee Hamilton, but progressives need to point out that some of the ISG's recommendations are ambiguous and others have been overtaken by events. Congress needs to understand that the ISG's three main recommendations face five key issues that raise questions about the relevance of the ISG's recommendations today. 
   The ISG report had three main recommendations: 
   1. Place greater emphasis on political benchmarks for the Iraqi government to ensure disaffected groups (specifically the Sunnis) are brought into Iraq's political process. 
   2. Accelerate and increase the training of Iraqi security forces to allow them to take over from U.S. forces and transition U.S. forces from combat missions in 2008. 
   3. Initiate a region-wide diplomatic offensive to contain and resolve Iraq's conflicts. 
   The ISG recommendations now face five practical obstacles: 
   1. Conditioning U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq on the outdated ``We'll stand down when the Iraqis stand up'' formula. 
   The main problem with the ISG report is that it conditions the eventual U.S. troop withdrawal on Iraq's splintered national leadership. The ISG report spells out a long list of preconditions for withdrawing U.S. troops, which actually gets the situation backwards--the United States needs to put Iraqis and the countries in the region on notice to motivate them to act more constructively in their own self-interest in order to contain and resolve Iraq's multiple internal conflicts. 
   The fundamental challenge with Iraq's security forces is not skills building and training. It is instead a problem of motivation and allegiance. The last six months in Iraq have reinforced the point that Iraqis will not take responsibility as long as U.S. forces remain in the country in such large numbers. Despite the latest escalation, the Iraqi government has not made any progress toward reconciliation. 
   The Bush strategy as well as the core ISG recommendations ignore a fundamental reality--that the situation in Iraq has little chance to improve until U.S. troops begin redeploying. 
   2. Placing too much focus on Iraq's central government, a dysfunctional and divided government that lacks the unified support of its own leaders. 
   The ISG recommendations place a strong emphasis on getting the Iraqi national government to meet several political benchmarks that are not only unachievable in the short term but irrelevant today because of changed conditions in Iraq. In fact, the Iraqi national government is increasingly trapped in bitter disputes along sectarian lines that have paralyzed the government. 
   Iraq's leaders fundamentally disagree on what Iraq is and should be. The benchmarks passed by Congress in May--the subject of a forthcoming report from the Bush administration--ignore the key reality that Iraq may suffer from unbridgeable divides. 
   Meeting these political benchmarks will likely have no effect on the major conflicts in Iraq and may well exacerbate the Kurd-Arab and intra-Shi'a conflicts emerging in Iraq's northern and southern regions. As such, these benchmarks provide false hope for resolving a series of conflicts that require a much deeper solution than the United States can provide unilaterally. 
   3. Paying insufficient attention to the 2005 Iraq Constitution and the will of the Iraqi people. 
   The ISG report outlines a course that would lead to the unraveling of Iraq's constitution. One of the ISG's main recommendations is that ``the [United States] should support as much as possible central control by governmental authorities in Baghdad, particularly on the question of oil revenue.'' But this cuts against the grain of what Iraqis supported in their own constitution, passed by popular referendum in 2005. Iraq's constitution establishes a framework for a strongly decentralized federal system. 
   Not surprisingly, many Iraqi leaders objected to the recommendations of the ISG report. Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, rejected the ISG report. In addition to criticisms from Iraq's leaders, the ISG recommendations lack a broad-base of support among Iraqis, a strong majority of whom want U.S. forces to leave Iraq within a year. 
   According to a poll of the Iraqi public conducted in 2006, 71 percent of Iraqis wanted the Iraqi government to ask for U.S.-led forces to be withdrawn from Iraq within a year or less. Another 61 percent support attacks on U.S.-led forces. In short, many Iraqis are opposed to the ISG recommendations, and as a result the United States would face severe problems attempting to implement them. 
   4. Supporting the unconditional training of Iraq's security forces, which is deeply problematic. 
   The core of the ISG report is the recommendation that the United States accelerate and increase the training of Iraqi security forces. It proposes an American advisory effort of between 10,000 and 20,000, comparable to the U.S. advisory strength in Vietnam at its height. Increasing the capacity of the Iraqi security forces, however, won't rectify their three main problems: 
   The Iraqi security forces are far from reliable. The Pentagon estimates that at least one-third of the Iraqi Army is on leave at any one time; desertion and other problems bring the total to over half in some units. Of the 11,000 Iraqi soldiers assigned to the recent U.S.-led offensive in Baquba in June, only 1,500 showed up. Infiltration by sectarian militias into the Interior Ministry has been identified as a severe problem. Many Iraqi security forces have been implicated in sectarian violence, most notably the National Police and certain elements of the Iraqi Army. Allegations have emerged during the Baquba offensive that Sunni and Shiite soldiers cooperated with Sunni insurgents and Shiite militias, respectively. Some have even tried to kill American troops. Giving weapons and training to Iraq's security forces in the absence of a national political consensus in Iraq risks inflaming Iraq's conflicts. In fact, the violence has escalated at the same time as the number of trained Iraqi security forces has increased. 
   Iraq's government has used Iraqi security forces to promote their sectarian interests rather than the national interest. Most troubling is the manner in which the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has used the Iraqi security forces. He has focused primarily on going after Sunni insurgents with Iraqi forces, leaving the impression that he is acting on behalf of Shi'a sectarian interests. Worse still, officials in the prime minister's office have often replaced officers that are perceived as competent and non-sectarian. 
   Force protection concerns for the United States. The ISG's training recommendation suffers from two more flaws: force protection and time. The number of troops dedicated to protecting American advisors from insurgents would drain resources needed to perform other missions crucial to U.S. interests such as counterterrorism. In addition, many experts observe that it takes years if not decades to train a professional, competent army. Past experiences of unpopular foreign military forces facing an insurgency while training local security forces do not inspire confidence in the success of future efforts. There is no reason to presume we will be able to do any better even if we had unlimited time in Iraq (which we don't). 
   5. Offering undeveloped ideas on a regional diplomatic offensive. 
   The ISG proposed creating a regional contact group to help solve Iraq's internal and external problems diplomatically. While it is important for the United States to undertake a diplomatic offensive as it begins a phased redeployment from Iraq, the ISG approach is too broad. 
   Rather than dealing with Iraq's multiple internal conflicts as discrete problems that require separate attention, the ISG approach could result in a ``one-size-fits-all'' diplomatic package. Progressives should recognize that each of Iraq's neighbors have differing interests in each ofIraq's conflicts, and then advocate that the United States tailor its diplomacy to each conflict in an attempt to deal individually with the myriad problems confronting Iraq. 
   CONCLUSION 
   Progressives should not allow the recommendations of the ISG report to be accepted without question. Nor should they allow the White House to legitimate its still-stay-the course policy by paying lip service to the ISG recommendations. 
   Rather, progressives should advocate a policy that allows us to strategically reset our military forces, our diplomatic personnel, and our intelligence operations by redeploying out troops in 12 months, partitioning our diplomatic effort to better deal with Iraq's multiple conflict, rethinking our approach to Iraq's government and its security  forces, and redirecting our immense national power toward destroying those terrorists who attacked us on 9/11. The time is past for more half-way measures. 
   The United States needs to move toward a ``Strategic Reset'' of its policy in Iraq and the Middle East, one that recognizes the increasingly fragmented situation on the ground and build a more sustainable approach to advancing long-term U.S. interests in the region.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from New York for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I oppose the escalation of U.S. forces in Iraq and I strongly oppose this war. We had no basis or justification or right to invade Iraq. It was a mistake. There are no easy answers or solutions before us. No matter what option we pursue, there is no  nice, neat, happy ending. Sometimes you can't fix mistakes. 
   Hopefully we can make this awful situation less awful. This war should never have happened. That is not just my opinion, it is the opinion of many of the top military leaders in our country. The war has diminished our standing in the world. It has been used as a recruiting tool by the very terrorists we say we want to defeat. It has cost us hundreds of billions of dollars. And, most significantly, we have sacrificed the precious lives of so many of our brave servicemen and women, and thousands more have returned home severely wounded. 
   Now, I have listened as many of my colleagues have come to the floor and said we must follow our leader and be quiet. Some have even suggested that those of us who support this resolution and want this war to end are doing a disservice to our troops. 
   Mr. Speaker, for 4 long years, Congress has done absolutely nothing in the face of mistake after mistake after mistake in Iraq. None of us in this Chamber have to wake up tomorrow in Baghdad or Fallujah or Tikrit. None of us have to wake up each morning and go on patrol in Anbar Province. None of us in this Chamber are in harm's way. But we are all responsible, all of us, just like the President, for assigning tens of thousands of our bravest young men and women for being referees in a sectarian civil war. 
   If we truly want to protect our troops, if we truly are concerned with their safety and well-being, then bring them home and reunite them with their families. 
   Newsweek columnist Anna Quindlen put it this way: ``There is no better way to support those fighting in Iraq than to guarantee that no more of them die in the service of political miscalculation.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people are way ahead of the politicians in Washington. Citizens of all political persuasions are sick and tired of the political spin and political posturing. Our focus should not be about saving face. Instead, it should be about saving lives. 
   The people of this country have been misled, they have been deceived, and they have been lied to. Increasingly, people do not trust their government to tell the truth on the war. Mr. Speaker, I don't trust my government to tell me the truth about this war. 
   There is no military victory to be had. The only hope is a political solution. 
   The Iraqi Government and the Iraqi people have the power and the ability to move in a different direction, a direction that seeks to calm sectarian violence and heal sectarian divides, respect the rights of all citizens and uphold the rule of law that applies to everyone equally. But they have to choose that path themselves. Regrettably, I have little confidence that the current Iraqi Government will make such a choice. I hope I am wrong. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is essential to change the dynamic inside Iraq, and to do that it is essential that we dramatically change our policy. That means we must end the U.S. occupation and begin an all-out diplomatic effort to promote reconciliation and an end to the violence. That means we should begin the immediate, safe and orderly withdrawal of our troops from Iraq. That means we should provide protection and political asylum to those in Iraq who have assisted us and who may be in danger because of it. That also means that the United States must demonstrate the maturity and the common sense to talk to political leaders and to countries we don't like, including Syria and Iran. 
   None of this will be pleasant, none of this will be easy and there are no guarantees that it will work. But I am sure of one thing: What we are doing now is failing. What we are doing now is not healing the divisions in Iraq and is not serving the best national security interests of the United States. Our own intelligence agencies have reported to us that this war is creating more terrorists. 
   No one in this House enjoys this discussion. Some, I know, wish that somehow this issue would go away. But, Mr. Speaker, it won't. So no matter how uncomfortable this debate is for some of my colleagues, it is long overdue. 
   The message that Congress will hopefully send tomorrow by passing this resolution is one that the American people want us to send and one that the President needs to hear. 
   President Lyndon Johnson once remarked, ``It is easy to get into a war, but hard as hell to get out of one.'' The choices before us in the next weeks and months will not be easy. Indeed, it will be difficult, even painful, to extricate ourselves from this war. But it is the right thing to do. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution which strongly supports our troops and opposes this escalation

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (RECOGNIZING AND COMMENDING EFFORTS TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT AND HELP END THE WORSENING HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AND GENOCIDE IN DARFUR, SUDAN -- (House of Representatives - October 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding me the time and for his leadership on so many issues advocating human rights, but especially the humanitarian crisis in Darfur. 
   I also want to thank Congressman JIM MORAN for introducing this resolution that recognizes and commends the outstanding work carried out by dozens of national organizations and literally thousands of local groups across the country to educate Americans and motivate them to take action on ending the genocide in Darfur, Sudan. 
   Mr. Speaker, on April 28, 2006, my House colleagues, Representatives MORAN of Virginia, TOM LANTOS, JOHN OLVER and SHEILA JACKSON-LEE, joined me for a protest in front of the Sudanese embassy here in Washington as part of a larger effort organized by religious, student, and human rights groups to focus the country's attention on the genocide in Darfur. All of us were arrested and many of us joined thousands of our fellow citizens 2 days later for the national rally on the Mall to stop the genocide in Darfur. 
   I brought my two children, Patrick and Molly, to that rally so that they could listen to the speeches, see the great diversity of people united in effort, and meet so many of the young people and students who have been engaged in the cause of ending genocide. 
   I happen to be especially blessed, Mr. Speaker, in having 13 colleges and universities in the Third Congressional District of Massachusetts, an engaged religious community of many faiths and school districts that believe in debating the serious issues of the day inside the classrooms. I had been hearing and learning about the humanitarian crisis in Darfur for months from elementary school, middle school, high school and college students, from religious leaders and community groups, from the Armenian American community in Worcester, and from local human rights and refugee advocates. 
   When I stood with my colleague in front of the Sudanese embassy, I was there not just to protest the genocide, but to honor the broad coalition of voices that works every day, that works day after day, week after week and year after year to end the violence, the terror, the humanitarian crisis, the genocide in Darfur. Among these are the Save Darfur Coalition, STAND, ENOUGH, and the Genocide Intervention Network. 
   Since the national rally on the Mall a little over a year and a half ago, these groups have continued to raise the awareness of the American people. Over the April recess, I had the privilege of traveling to eastern Chad to meet some of the 300,000 refugees from Darfur living in camps along the Chad-Sudan border. I spent several days with representatives from UNHCR, UNICEF, the World Food Program, Oxfam, ICRC, Catholic Relief Services, Doctors Without Borders and so many others whose lives and work are completely focused on responding to the humanitarian crisis. I cannot possibly express in words the respect and admiration I have for them and all the other NGOs working inside Darfur and in Chad and the Central African Republic with the nearly 3 million people displaced from their homes by the violence in Darfur. 
   Mr. Speaker, today we are considering three bills on Darfur: this one, that recognizes and commends the work of advocacy groups and other NGOs who raise awareness and are working to help end the genocide in Darfur; another resolution introduced by Congresswoman ROSA DELAURO about the need to protect the women and girls of Darfur from acts of rape and sexual violence that have become commonplace in this conflict; and, a third, condemning in the strongest terms the attacks on September 29 on the African Union peacekeepers. 
   Mr. Speaker, the genocide goes on. The humanitarian crisis persists. This morning's Washington Post speaks to the fact that the United States and the international community speak with passion, but accomplish little in ending the violence in Darfur. This week another peace conference on Darfur is under way in Libya, except all the parties to the conflict are not present. We must do more, Mr. Speaker, or we will be here 1 year from now, once again bemoaning the killing, the violence, and the terror. The time for action is now.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (RELATING TO THE CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5724, UNITED STATES-COLOMBIA TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. I thank the gentlelady for her leadership on this important debate, and I rise in strong support of this rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, the policies of the Bush administration have produced an American economy in crisis. People are losing their jobs, fuel prices are at a record high, food prices have dramatically increased, confidence in the economy is at an all-time low. Maybe this is a radical idea, but shouldn't the energy, passion and focus of the administration be on fixing these problems? 
   This administration has turned a cold shoulder to the plight of American workers. They have opposed efforts to extend unemployment benefits. They have no plan to help 45 million Americans get health insurance. They have even opposed expanding health benefits to children. Their absolute indifference towards our fellow citizens is stunning. It takes my breath away. 
   Well, that must change. The Speaker of the House has the right to prioritize legislation. She has stated quite clearly that we want to continue to work with President Uribe to make progress on improving human rights, the rule of law, ending impunity, breaking Colombia's political and military ties to drug lords and paramilitary groups and protecting and promoting basic labor rights. 
   If the Colombian FTA came up today for a vote, I will strongly oppose it. I have repeatedly told the Colombian Government that I am always willing to reassess my position. 
   But when it comes to issues like human rights, I refuse to be a cheap date. The U.N., the Red Cross and U.S. and Colombian human rights groups all describe a worsening humanitarian crisis in Colombia. The number of internally displaced grew by 27 percent over the past year due to increasing violence throughout the country. 
   Over each of the past 3 years, murders of civilians by the Colombian army have been increasing. Violence against trade unions continues at an extremely high level, and the vast majority of cases of murders of labor leaders remain unsolved. 
   It is true that murders of trade unionists in 2007 were about half of what they were in 2006. Even then, Colombia had the highest rate of trade union murders in the world. But death threats, attacks and disappearances skyrocketed. But this 1-year hiatus in the murder rate may be over. In just the first 12 weeks of 2008, 17 trade unionists have already been assassinated. 
   Like many of my House colleagues, I have traveled to Colombia several times in the past 7 years. I have gone to Putumayo, not just to fly over fumigated territory, but to meet with hundreds of human rights victims and campesinos on the ground. I have been to Barrancabermeja, Sincelejo and Popayan.  
   I have traveled to San Jose de Apartado and to Arauca, where violence from all armed actors reigns supreme and community leaders are murdered like flies. I have visited the slums of Bogota where the poor and the internally displaced struggle to survive. 
   I spent hours in meetings with human rights groups, with families whose loved ones are held in brutal captivity by the FARC and with victims of violence by the paramilitaries and the Colombian army. 
   I have met with the constitutional court, religious and labor leaders, with indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombians and dozens of government and military officials. There is so much more to Colombia than the administration's day and a half excursion tours to Medellin and Cartagena. 
   Congress must insist upon improvements in human rights in Colombia and not paint a rosy picture simply to secure a trade agreement. U.S. policy must take responsibility for the behavior of Colombian behavior forces trained with U.S. tax dollars, take into account the continued suffering of the civilian population in the midst of an ongoing conflict and support the rights of victims after a decade of atrocities. 
   I remain dedicated to the Colombian people. I will never advocate walking away from Colombia. I also strongly support the right of the Speaker of the House to take up trade agreements when it makes the most sense to do so. 
   I urge my colleagues to adopt this rule and to remain engaged with Colombia on these important issues.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, technically, this point of order is about whether or not to consider this rule, and ultimately the underlying bill. And in reality, it's about trying to block this bill without any opportunity for debate and without any opportunity for an up-or-down vote on keeping the government running, providing hurricane and other disaster assistance and other critical items. So I think that that is just wrong. And I hope that my colleagues will vote ``yes'' so we can consider this important legislation on its merits and not kill it on a procedural motion. 
   We need to move forward with this legislation. We need to keep this government running. Those who oppose this bill can vote against final passage, but we need to move forward. So I would urge my colleagues to not allow a purely procedural tactic to kill this bill.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I just want to associate myself with the remarks of the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. 
   I should point out that all of the earmarks are made public. They are on the Rules Committee Web site. They are available in the Appropriations Committee. I should also point out that we have instituted reforms so that what happened when the Republicans were in control, for example, when they air-dropped a provision to provide blanket immunity to drug companies and inserted it into a defense bill after everything had been closed cannot happen. 
   I will also say that I think Members of this Congress should have the right to advocate for their districts and make decisions as to how money  should be allocated. It is our responsibility as the legislative branch to have a role in where that money goes versus bureaucrats who work with the White House. 
   I will also say that there are a lot of Republicans who have applied for and received earmarks. They have gone through this process where they had to fill out forms and vet it through the committee. I know a lot of Republicans, including some of my Republican colleagues on the Rules Committee, have earmarks on this bill because it's public. And I actually trust them to be advocates for their district. 
   So, I would point out to my colleagues that things are very different from how they were when the Republicans were in control of this House. There is more sunshine. There is more accountability. I would urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the motion to consider. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

All time yielded during consideration of the rule is for debate only. I yield myself such time as I may consume.

<DOCNO>Mr. McGOVERN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2638, CONSOLIDATED SECURITY, DISASTER ASSISTANCE, AND CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 1488 provides for consideration of the Senate amendment to H.R. 2638, the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009. 
   The rule makes in order a motion by the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations to concur in the Senate amendment with a House amendment. The rule provides 1 hour of debate on the motion, equally divided and controlled by the Committee on Appropriations. 
   The House amendment inserts language for continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2009, making emergency supplemental appropriations and covering three regular fiscal year 2009 appropriations bills, each in a separate division. 
   Division A provides continuing appropriations for all agencies and activities that would be covered by the regular fiscal year 2009 appropriations bills until enactment of the applicable regular appropriations bill or until March 6, 2009, whichever occurs first. Emergency FY09 appropriations for LIHEAP and advanced technology vehicle manufacturing loans are also included.  
   Division B provides $22.9 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for relief and recovery from hurricanes, floods, and other natural disasters. 
   Division C provides $487.7 billion in FY09 funding for the Department of Defense. 
   Division D provides $40 billion in FY09 funding for the Department of Homeland Security. 
   Division E provides $72.9 billion in FY09 funding for Military Construction and Veterans Affairs. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me begin with the good news, a fact that my friends on the other side of the aisle cannot refute. This is the last time that we will have to deal with Bush's budget priorities. After 8 years of President Bush's fiscal mismanagement, we will soon vote on the final Bush appropriations bill. 
   Eight years ago, George Bush became the 43rd President of the United States. Are the American people better off after 8 years of George Bush? The answer is a clear and resounding no. His administration and the then Republican-controlled Congress inherited a $5.6 trillion budget surplus from President Clinton, and they turned that into about a $3.2 trillion deficit and have left us with a national debt that stands at $9.8 trillion. That is the biggest debt we have had in the history of the United States of America. 
   Because of George Bush, we are stuck in a quagmire in Iraq. Because of George Bush, more people are living in poverty and more people are going hungry than they were 8 years ago. And because of this President and his administration, we have the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Just 40 days from the election and 117 days until the next president is inaugurated, President Bush is asking for a $700 billion blank check to fix the mess on Wall Street that he and his allies helped create. 
   Thankfully, this continuing resolution will keep the government up and running until March 6 of 2009 and hopefully, at that time, we will have a President with a very different set of priorities. 
   The process getting here hasn't been perfect. I am disappointed that we weren't able to consider all of the appropriations bills here in the House under regular order. But my Republican colleagues share much of the blame for this inaction. Every time the Republicans had an opportunity to act like statesmen and do the business of the American people, they decided to do the opposite, to play partisan games in attempts to score political points. Instead of acting like honest brokers, they decided to demagog these bills until there was no ability for the House to act on them. 
   We should all remember last year when the Republicans tried to filibuster the Agriculture appropriations bill by offering silly amendment after silly amendment, cutting a program by $50,000, then $75,000 and then $100,000. And we should all remember earlier this year when the Republicans attempted to kill the Labor-HHS appropriations bill by replacing it in committee with the Interior bill. So when my friends on the other side of the aisle complain about the lack of regular order, I would suggest they take a good, long look in the mirror. 
   And this bill isn't perfect. Because of the intransigence by the White House, there are a lot of programs that I care deeply about that are underfunded. But this is the best product we could hope for under these circumstances. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, David Obey, and his incredible staff, there are some bright spots in this bill. 
   First and foremost are the increases in LIHEAP and WIC. This bill fully funds LIHEAP, something the Republicans never did, and increases funding for the WIC program by $1 billion over 2008. At a time when energy and food prices are skyrocketing, we cannot and will not ignore the plight of Americans who are struggling to heat their homes or put food on the table. I am also pleased the bill includes $23.5 million more for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program. This increase will prevent 70,000 low-income women, infants, children and seniors from losing access to food. 
   I am also pleased that there is a $2.5 billion increase in Pell Grants. Unfortunately, this will not restore Pell Grants to the original purchasing power, but it is a good start that will prevent potential cuts in student aid that could come during the school year. 
   Another critical component of this continuing resolution is the disaster aid package. Earlier this year, Iowa and the Midwest were hit with disastrous floods. Wildfires have caused major damage in the West. And this hurricane season has already been deadly and costly with Hurricanes Gustav and Ike causing major damage in the gulf coast States. This continuing resolution includes almost $23 billion to address these natural disasters. Funding will be directed to FEMA, the Community Development Block Grants Program, the Army Corps of Engineers, and several other important disaster recovery efforts that will help these ravaged areas across our Nation. I am also pleased that there is $100 million to help Haiti recover from Ike and other hurricanes, and another $100 million for international food aid to provide emergency food assistance. 
   In addition, the fiscal year 2009 Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Homeland Security appropriations bills are all included in this continuing resolution. There is no higher priority than providing funding for our military and for the men and women who defend our Nation. 
   Finally, let me comment on what is not in this bill. Unfortunately, and at the insistence of the White House, there is no economic stimulus package, no new money for food stamps, unemployment insurance or Medicaid. There is no new money for transportation projects to help jumpstart our ailing economy, and there is no ban on offshore drilling. 
   Mr. Speaker, I simply cannot understand how this President and his Republican partners in the House and Senate can ask for a $700 billion blank check for Wall Street, but oppose $50 billion to help people afford to put food on the table or to make ends meet while they look for a job in this ailing economy or prevent States from cutting health care benefits to people on Medicaid. 
   Republicans like to say that people have to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps. Well, it's hard to do that if you can't afford any boots. During these tough economic times, it is critical that we help all Americans, not just the fat cats on Wall Street. Yet as Katrina and this economic crisis here have shown, the Republican Party has no interest in helping the people who need it most. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker, the good news is that this is the last time that we will have to deal with this President and his budgetary priorities. Help, I believe, is on the way. With a new administration and more Democrats in Congress, we will be able to finally act on these priorities of the American people. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I always love to listen to the gentleman from Washington State, my colleague on the Rules Committee. But I have to say that I don't think there is a single American who hasn't concluded that they have had enough of the Republicans and their misplaced priorities. We are in a financial mess right now because of their fiscal policies, and we need to try to figure out a way to dig ourselves out. 
   But I found it interesting, I think I got the quote right, he talked about stuffing in ``unvetted earmarks.'' Well, a quick look at the earmarks, which are published, by the way, are on the Website of the Rules Committee, I see the gentleman has some earmarks in here. I don't know whether or not the portable launch and recovery system and unmanned aerial vehicle operation was unvetted and stuffed in in some secret room.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Reclaiming my time, I would say to the gentleman that all of the earmarks in here went  through the same process that he went through. So it is just a little bit frustrating to hear some of my friends on the other side of the aisle complain about earmarks when they have earmarks in this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would also remind people that in this bill is $22.9 billion for disaster relief to deal with the disasters in Iowa and Florida. 
   I will point out to my friends in this Chamber that my Republican friends on the Rules Committee all voted last night to block this bill from coming to the floor and block this disaster relief from getting to where it needs to go. 
   At this time I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Braley).

   Mr. McGOVERN. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me just rise to associate myself with the remarks of my colleague from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) on the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. Colombia continues to be the most dangerous place in the world to be a member of a union. It is number 2 in the number of internally displaced people, the largest number of internally displaced people, second in the world. And extrajudicial killings by security forces are on the rise. 
   So if we're going to have a trade agreement, and human rights matters, then I don't think it's too much to ask the Colombian security forces to stop killing and targeting its workers.

   Mr. McGOVERN. I would also disagree that a Colombia Free Trade agreement is going to help create more jobs in Ohio or Massachusetts or anywhere else for that matter. 
   Mr. Speaker, I also, going back to what the gentleman from Washington State had talked about earlier, he mentioned stuffing in unvetted earmarks. I've been going through the bill here, and I found that the ranking Republican member of the Rules Committee has a number of earmarks, too. You may want to check with him whether or not he vetted them and whether they went through the proper process. I assume they did, because I would not expect anything less from him. But I want to point out again that as you go through this bill, you see a number of earmarks that are attributed directly to the Republicans. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey).

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. 
   I would just say that the American people can see what earmarks exist in this bill and who is responsible for those earmarks because it is open. What the gentleman is complaining about is he can't play politics with some of the earmarks on the floor today. 
   The other thing is, I will restate what the chairman of the Appropriations Committee said. The reason why the Defense appropriations bill is in this continuing resolution is because of the request of the Republican administration. 
   Having said that, Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Harman).

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's important that we pass this continuing resolution for a number of reasons. One is it contains money for LIHEAP. With the high cost of energy, we need to make sure that people have the emergency assistance so they can heat their homes, so they don't have to choose between heating their homes and their medication, or heating their homes and food.     
   We need to support this bill because it has money to help combat hunger--which unfortunately, under this administration's watch, has gotten worse in this country. There are people in the United States who are hungry, and that is something that every one of us should be ashamed of. 
   We need to pass this bill because it contains money for disaster relief. We have had hurricanes in Florida and Texas. We have had floods in Iowa. People are in need of assistance from the Federal Government to help rebuild. Why anybody would want to hold that up is beyond me. 
   We need to support this bill because it supports our troops. And we need to support this bill because it supports our veterans. We have a lot of talk around here about how we have to support our troops and veterans, and yet here we have an effort to try to block a bill that will do just that. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is about keeping the government running. And I gotta tell you, I, for one, am glad that this bill will take us into March because hopefully in March we will have a different leadership in the White House; we will be moving in a vastly different direction than the one this President and his Republican allies in this Congress have taken us over the last 8 years. We are in a fiscal mess. Our economy is on the verge of collapse as a result of the incompetence and the inability of this administration to lead us in the right direction. 
   Enough. Enough. 
   It is time for us to move forward. It is time for us to get this work done. I would urge a ``yes'' vote on the previous question and a ``yes'' vote on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment, which seeks to send five times the current level of funding to so-called democracy assistance programs for Cuba. Five times the amount of money to programs that are not transparent; smack of cronyism; are noncompetitive; and, frankly speaking, foolish, corrupt, and just plain embarrassing for the United States. 
   How bad is this program? So bad that Cuba's courageous Catholic Church refuses to work with it. Many dissidents have told me that they think that this program is a bad idea. For Cuban opposition leaders to take money from the U.S. Government subjects them to the charge that they are somehow U.S. agents. That is not the way to p romote democracy. 
   I support the committee bill, which keeps funding level at $9 million. It is the smart thing to do until problems outlined in the November GAO report have been addressed and the program redesigned and better managed so that it might have at least some chance of being effective. 
   Mr. Chairman, everyone in this House supports the work of Cuba's dissident and pro-democracy community. But we do not need to squander five times more money on leather coats, cashmere sweaters, Game Boys, cr abmeat, and Godiva chocolates purchased by groups pretending to support them. 
   What do Godiva chocolates have to do with promoting democracy in Cuba? Come on, give me a break. 
   The American people want accountability, and I hope a majority in this Congress will too. Vote ``no'' on this amendment.

   We have had a policy for 50 years that has failed, it has been a failure. This is a continuation of the same old, same old. But even if you want to go down that road, the reason why you should oppose this amendment is because this program has been plagued with corruption and cronyism. We have used taxpayer moneys to buy Godiva chocolates and cashmere sweaters. I mean, come on. That is not a way to support dissidents. That is not a way to support the struggling democratic movement in Cuba. This program has been mismanaged.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is a very simple amendment. It ensures that no funds in this bill can be used for programs at the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, otherwise known as WHINSEC. It does not affect the funds in the Defense appropriations bill where the majority of WHINSEC's funding is provided. 
   Last year was the first debate on the WHINSEC, the successor to the U.S. Army School of the Americas. Since last year, the WHINSEC has made a number of very disturbing decisions that bring into question its much-vaunted commitment to transparency and democratic values. 
   For example, last year's debate brought to light a number of human rights cases involving WHINSEC students and instructors. Instead of using these cases as an opportunity to review its practices and procedures, instead of strengthening the vetting process and fixing any problems that might exist, the WHINSEC chose to attack the messengers. 
   It asserted that Salvadoran Colonel Francisco del Cid Diaz, responsible for the notorious 1983 Las Hojas massacre, never attended the WHINSEC. I guess they didn't check their own records because here is his name on the list of 2003 graduates. 
   They attacked the reputation of the current Bolivian Human Rights Ombudsman, Waldo Albarracin, saying that he has no recollection of the military captain who had him kidnapped and tortured in 1997, the same Major Urzagaste who was at the WHINSEC in 2002. When Mr. Albarracin heard of this slander, he sent me a letter describing what happened to him and the role of Urzagaste. 
   Mr. Chairman, like similar cases regarding corruption charges against three Colombian officers who attended the school, the WHINSEC dismissed the horror of Mr. Albarracin's torture as without merit because the courts dropped the case. Are WHINSEC officials ignorant about how military officers acted with impunity in Bolivia during the 1990s? Or in El Salvador during the 1980s? Are they ignorant of how the Colombian military benefits from the worst culture of impunity in the hemisphere today? The fact that charges of kidnapping, torture, murder, drug trafficking and corruption are routinely dropped is a major problem with Latin American militaries, not a virtue. Even more disturbing is how the WHINSEC responded to criticism. It chose to build a fortress around itself, to make sure that no one in the public, no human rights organization, no foreign policy analyst, would be able to review the names of WHINSEC's graduates and instructors. 
   For the first time in the history of WHINSEC, including the 40-year history of its infamous predecessor, the  School of the Americas, Freedom of Information Act requests are being denied. I have in my hands the school's response regarding 2005 graduates. Every single name is blacked out. Look at it, 18 pages, completely redacted. Is this anyone's idea of transparency? Of open relations with human rights and other policy organizations? This was a deliberate choice. The practice of secrecy extends to WHINSEC's public relations materials, where not a single solitary name of any of its Latin American students or teachers appears. So blacking out the names of graduates wasn't a mistake. It wasn't an anomaly. It's a deliberate decision to keep information secret, to avoid any kind of independent scrutiny or oversight. 
   Is this the example we want our Latin American counterparts to copy? I hope not, Mr. Chairman. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. The gentleman hasn't been listening to me. The State Department letter that he is quoting is essentially a whitewash. That State Department letter says that Cid Diaz, who I mentioned who is responsible for the Las Hojas massacre, never attended the WHINSEC. I just showed you right here. This is from the WHINSEC. He  did. So the State Department was wrong. The State Department letter says that the Human Rights Ombudsman in Bolivia can't remember who his torturer was. I have a letter here from the Bolivian Ombudsman that says he feels he was slandered. So that letter is wrong. And I have proof that it is wrong. 
   And you talk about accountability. Where's the accountability? This is the first time ever that we can't track the graduates. The school doesn't want to track the graduates. They say they don't have the time. So it has been up to human rights organizations. This is what we get in return. How do we know? How does anybody know? We need to do a better job. 
   So you didn't listen to my statement, I would say respectfully to the gentleman from Georgia. What the State Department sent to you is wrong and I have the proof.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, there seems to be a disconnect here. Let me again try to be crystal clear. 
   The problem is that the WHINSEC takes no responsibility for knowing anything about the human rights records of their students before they come to the U.S. or when they return home. They say the vetting process is done by the State Department, and then they say they will not, will not, do follow-up after their students return to their home countries. 
   How can they then claim that their training is effective? Doesn't that require some kind of follow-up or tracking of graduates? Nobody has addressed the fact that, up until just now, we would have access. There was public access to the people who went to the WHINSEC. 
   That's how we knew about those who violated human rights, because we had the list. This is now the response that we get from this school about the people who attend the school, not just the students, but the instructors that they  bring in. Where is the transparency? Where is the accountability? What's wrong with laying a little sunshine in? 
   Look, our standing around the world has never been lower. I hate to tell you something, but in Latin America this is one of the most unpopular schools that exists in the United States of America. People think that this is a school responsible for training or at least turning a blind eye to human rights violators, not just from years ago but recently. 
   But, then again, we really can't tell you accurately and neither can you tell me accurately what the human rights records are of these people who are attending. Because it's all blacked out. I mean, this is not the way a school in the United States that trains for our military should operate. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, let me again make a point here that is that last year when we were debating this same issue, an Army officer trained at the School of the Americas murdered a DEA-trained anti-narcotics unit in Colombia. This is still happening every day. 
   We were told a little while ago that everything, we are referring to the distant past. Well, again, I mentioned the Bolivian ombudsman, Mr. Albarracin, who was tortured in Bolivia in 1997, and his torturer, Major Urzagaste, went to WHINSEC in 2002. 
   Again, I am going to keep on saying this. I don't have a problem with training foreign militaries. What I have a problem with is this: the secrecy, the lack of accountability, the lack of transparency. 
   I am going to tell you something. We are going to find out, sooner or later, who some of these people are; and we are going to find out that they are responsible for atrocities. I gave them an example of somebody who was admitted to the school after he had been accused of torture. 
   I mean, where is the vetting process? We need to do much better.

   You know, we knew, we found out that 19 of the 26 trigger men who murdered in cold blood six Jesuit priests in El Salvador were graduates of the school because we had access to the names. We don't have access to the names anymore. And no report is going to give us access to the names.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds. 
   I have great regard for the gentleman from Texas. But my question is, how do you know? Do you track all these people individually? Can you tell me that all these people whose names have been crossed out are pure, that they are following a code of human rights; that they're not guilty of atrocities against their people? 
   That's the point here. I'm not arguing against the U.S. being involved in training programs. What I'm saying is that there's something fundamentally wrong with a training program where everything is secret; where we're told everybody is great, but yet we can't have access to track down the people who go to that school. We need to change that.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I'm not interested in going to visit a school and having hors d'oeuvres and a cocktail. 
   I'm interested in who goes to the school. That's what I'm interested in. I want to follow-up who goes to the school, who's admitted to the school. And we used to be able to have access to that information. And even though the school didn't track the graduates, human rights organizations did. We are now being denied access. I mean, where's the transparency? You all talk about all the great graduates of this school. How do you know when you get this in return? This is not an open, transparent process. 
   Furthermore, more and more countries in Latin America are saying we don't want to have anything to do with this school. Uruguay, Bolivia, Argentina, Costa Rica have all pulled out of the school. They don't want to have anything more to do with WHINSEC. 
   Mr. Chairman, we've heard a great deal today that without the WHINSEC the U.S. would not be engaged in Latin America. Well, with all due respect, the U.S. trains 15,000 or more Latin American military officers and troops each and every year, less than 1,000 of them at the WHINSEC. We are very engaged in Latin American militaries, and none of these other programs carry the negative baggage that the WHINSEC does. 
   We have heard that WHINSEC has trained the future leaders of Latin America. But, again, with all due respect, one of Latin America's problems has been that too many of its national leaders were from the military. We should be spending our time and our efforts on strengthening civilian and democratic institutions. 
   We have heard assertions that that the WHINSEC is transparent and promotes democratic values. But WHINSEC's own actions show those claims to be a lie. What else do you need to see? I mean, what else do you need to see? 
   Now, I suggest that instead of WHINSEC, we should support the model of Argentina. After separating from the WHINSEC last year, Argentina just opened a new military school where civilian, legal and human rights experts will teach every single military officer about the role of the military in a modern democratic state. 
   Mr. Chair, America's reputation with the people of Latin America is at the lowest level ever. Cutting the funding for the WHINSEC will send a powerful message to the people of Latin America who, hopefully, will be the real future leaders of their nations, that the U.S. Congress finally gets it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to just close with a few personal remarks. When I was working for our dear friend and former colleague, Congressman Joe Moakley, six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper, and her 16-year old daughter were murdered in cold blood at the University of Central America in San Salvador. 
   It made me sick to my stomach when I learned that 19 of the 26 soldiers who murdered these priests are graduates of the School of the Americas. These priests were my friends, and I knew them. And over the years, we have raised concerns first about the School of the Americas and then its successor, the WHINSEC. 
   We have asked for transparency. We have called for accountability. We have asked for specific follow-up with the graduates. 
   Let me be perfectly clear. There's a reason why WHINSEC does not share information on its graduates and its teachers. They don't want us to do the follow-up. They don't want us to point out what they should be doing. 
   Passage of this amendment will send a strong signal to Latin America that we do care about human rights. But it will also send a signal to our own military that business as usual is not acceptable. 
   Vote ``yes'' on the McGovern-Lewis amendment.

   Mr. McGOVERN. Let me say to the gentleman from Georgia, their record isn't spotless. We presented five cases last year. I mean, maybe you weren't listening to the debate, but we did. And the problem with this year is this is what the WHINSEC gave us, so we can't follow up. 
   And to the gentleman from Pennsylvania, who I have great respect for, you know, I'm not against military training. And yeah, we need to do better. My amendment, by the way, doesn't cut off all funding for the WHINSEC. Most of that money is in the Defense bill. It only cuts off the money that is under the jurisdiction of this bill. 
   And yes, it does need to be improved. I don't know how anybody can vote against this amendment in light of the fact that this is their, WHINSEC's, example of transparency. How do we follow up on the graduates? How can we follow up on whether the people that are going there are human rights abusers when we get this in return? 
   Even under the infamous School of the Americas, we were given the names. That's how I found out that 19 of the 22 trigger men who murdered the Jesuit priests were graduates of the School of Americas. If I got this I never would have known that. This is what they have given us. 
   Now, this is not transparency. This is not accountability. You want that school to do better, we need to send a message on the floor of the House today that we're not satisfied with business as usual, and the way to do that is vote for the McGovern amendment. 
   I urge all my colleagues to vote for the McGovern-Lewis amendment. Let's take a stand for human rights. If this country stands for anything, it needs to stand out loud and four square for human rights, and this is one way to prove it. Vote for this amendment.
