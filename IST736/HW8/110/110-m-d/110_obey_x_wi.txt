<DOCNO>Mr. OBEY. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, what I would like to do is to take some time on the floor today to separate fact from fiction with respect to earmarks. 
   Let me start by saying that I think my record is clear. I have tried as long as I have been in this Congress to restrain both the dollar amount spent on earmarks and the number of earmarks that we have had. But I want to make certain that if we are looking at earmarks we are asking ourselves the right questions. 
   I do not want anyone on this floor, or anyone else, including the White House, to suggest that if you eliminate funding for earmarks you save one dime. You do not. The right question to ask about earmarks is simply whether that money is put in the right place or not. And let me explain what I mean. 
   When the Appropriations Committee, for instance, brings out its appropriation bills, each subcommittee operates under a spending ceiling. And if that bill exceeds that spending ceiling, then a single Member can knock the entire bill off the floor. That means that earmarks, if they are provided, are provided within the predetermined ceiling for that bill. So, for instance, if the committee decides that it is going to earmark 50 after-school projects, those after-school projects are financed within the predetermined ceiling, not above that ceiling. 
   So if people want to pose for holy pictures on the issue of earmarks, be my guest. Just make sure you have your facts when you do so. That is all I ask. 
   A second thing I would point out. If we are going to talk about earmarks, then let us talk about the guy who does the most earmarking. That is the guy in the big White House at the other end of the Pennsylvania Avenue. He is called the President. And I want to give you an example of what happens with the President's budget. 
   The biggest earmarker in the land is the President of the United States of America. Let me give you one example. Last year, the administration provided 18,808 FIRE grants in districts represented by Republican Members of Congress. It provided 11,470 FIRE grants in districts represented by Democrats. Every single one of those FIRE grants is the functional equivalent of an earmark. 
   Now, does anybody believe that that ratio of FIRE grants in Republican versus Democratic districts was not political? If you do, I have got a lot of things I would like to sell you after the session is over.     
   Let me also make one additional point: What is an earmark? If the President sends down an Army Corps of Engineers' list of projects, let's say he suggests 800 projects for the Army Corps of Engineers. Let's say the Congress, after its hearings, determines that 16 of them don't make any sense and so they substitute other projects. Are the 16 which the Congress substituted the only earmarks in that bill? What about the original President's list? He has selected those. Doesn't that represent an earmark on the part of the executive as well? 
   So I would simply ask, if we are going to start talking earmarks, let's  not have the pot calling the kettle black. Let us remember that the Congress has a right to make policy judgments, indeed it has an obligation to make policy judgments, that direct money to one place or another. 
   When I was chairman of the Appropriations Committee 12 years ago, the Labor-Health-Education appropriation bill didn't contain a single earmark. Last year, our Republican friends on the other side of the aisle were planning to have 3,000 earmarks in the Labor-Health bill. I think that is a gross exaggeration of what our staffs have the ability to review. 
   I don't want a single earmark in any bill that the committee staff cannot review to make certain that the reputation of this House and the reputation of the committee is protected. That is why we have the provision in this language that says if any Member asks for an earmark, he also has to certify that that earmark will provide no financial advantage to him or his spouse. To me, that is the way you protect the integrity of the institution and still protect the power of the purse and still protect the prerogative of the Congress. That is the way you protect the prerogatives of the Congress, while also protecting the reputation of this institution. 
   So, please, keep your terms straight. Keep your facts straight. Let's not claim things that are not so about some of these changes. Let's recognize what the definitions are and the fact that this is a very complicated matter.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Speaker, I hope the House will forgive my laryngitis today. 
   Madam Speaker, I have just heard complaints from the minority side of the aisle about the process by which this proposal is being brought to us. This criticism about process comes from the same crowd that brought a $40 billion proposal to the floor 2 days after 9/11 without ever running that proposal through either the appropriations subcommittee or the Appropriations Committee. That criticism comes from the same crowd----

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Madam Speaker, ahead of time, I will not yield to anyone until I have completed my statement. 
   This criticism on process comes from the same crowd that stood by and allowed 30 pages of unread material to be surreptitiously and anonymously slipped into a conference report on the defense bill after the conference report had completed action, language which insulated the drug industry from liability in cases where their products injured the health of customers. 
   This comes from the same crowd that several years ago blocked the ability of this House to vote on a single matter that had anything at all to do with the most significant domestic appropriation bill, the Labor-Health-Education bill. They simply wrapped it into other items and refused to allow the House to work its will on any piece of that proposal which had more than 500 programs which were insulated from House review. 
   This comes from the same crowd that brought three supplemental appropriation bills to the floor without running those bills through the Appropriations Committee or subcommittee. 
   Now they say that they want one vote on the package all put together. Well, let me tell you, what we are trying to do is to avoid Members having to look at everything in one package. What we are trying to do is to give them a straight up-or-down vote, a clean shot on the issue of whether you want to provide funding for the war or not. It is a procedurally neutral approach. If you want funding for the war, you vote ``yes'' and if you don't want it, you vote ``no.'' That way you can't hide on that issue. It stands out there alone, and people see where you stand. 
   We are also having a separate vote on whether or not we should impose conditions on the administration in exchange for the use of that money, straight up-or-down vote, clean shot at it, can't hide behind any other issue. 
   And thirdly, we are taking the administration's other requests and two priorities of our own and putting them together in a third amendment, again separate, not tied into a big package, out there so that Members can choose up or down whether they want to do that or not. I make no apology for that. 
   Now we are being lectured about the fact that this is a bloated bill. Out of all of the appropriated items in this bill, all but $2 billion are requested by the administration. Congress has the temerity to be asking to spend 1 percent of the appropriated amount in this bill. The rest the President takes ownership of. 
   Secondly, we are being told, Oh, it's terrible because we've taken a military bill and ``larded'' it up was the term that the gentleman from Janesville used, that we larded it up with unemployment compensation and with the expanded GI Bill. Well, I suppose additional unemployment compensation benefits may look like lard to a Member who makes $165,000 a year; but to people who have exhausted their unemployment benefits and have been out of work for 6 months, it doesn't look like lard to them; it looks like basic bread, and I think we should be ashamed of the fact that we haven't provided this sooner. 
   It also may look like lard to the gentleman from Janesville for us to say that we want to provide expanded education benefits to the GIs who fought this war. But I would remind every Member of this House, this is the first war in my knowledge where we have never had any sense of shared sacrifice. The only people in this society who are being asked to sacrifice are the veterans and the military families. They have been sent to Iraq and Afghanistan again and again and again, and we have the quaint idea that we ought to be able to take 6 percent of the cost of that war to date, 6 percent, and devote it to expanding education benefits for people who have sacrificed by wearing the uniform of the United States.

   Mr. OBEY. We pay for that by providing what the majority leader refers to as a patriots' premium, a one-half of 1 percent increase in taxes for the most fortunate people in this society who make more than a million bucks a year. 
   If you think that is even a close question, whether we ought to put the GIs before those fortunate folks, then it is no wonder you lost the seat in Mississippi 2 days ago.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1197, I call from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 2642) making appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. 
   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman may be reciting the PAYGO rule as he wishes it were, but that's not the way it is. 
   The legislation before the House fully complies with the PAYGO rule. That rule deals with direct spending and revenues. 
   As to revenues, the revenue effects of this package reduce the deficit, rather than increasing it. As to spending, none of the spending in this package falls into the direct spending category, which is basically defined as spending outside the appropriations process. 
   Even though not technically required to do so, the Medicaid provisions and the expansion of veterans' education benefits fully meet the PAYGO standard. Both sets of provisions contain offsets to ensure that they do not increase the deficit over the 5- and 10-year periods used by the PAYGO rule. 
   The rest of the bill consists mostly of emergency appropriations for defense and other security-related needs, largely for things requested by the President. And the other major spending item, relating to extended unemployment compensation benefits, is temporary in nature and responds to current hardships created by the economic downturn. 
   So I believe that we ought to abide by the House rules as they are, not as some Members wish they were.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have a tough problem before the House today. We have a war which the majority of this House despises. We have a war that we do not have the power to end so long as the President is as obstreperous as he has been on the subject. That means that we have to find a way to try to manage this problem in a way that sends a clear message to the public that they are the only ones who can, in fact, muster the power to change direction on this war by electing a President who will get us out of this war. It also means we have to manage it in such a way that we set the table for the new President to give him at least a few months to think through how he is going to proceed to extricate us from this war and to get his ducks in a row on Iraqi policy. Therefore, we are taking the Senate bill and we are asking the House to consider three amendments and work their will on it. 
   The first amendment is very simple. It's an up-or-down vote on providing the funding to pay for the equipment and to pay for the salaries for the troops as long as they are going to be in the war situation. That money will be estimated to run out by June of 2009. 
   The second amendment would simply be an up-or-down vote on the conditions that the House believes should appropriately be attached to the spending of that money, many of which the House has seen before. Those conditions will, among other things, require that virtually every unit sent to the war be fully combat ready. They will provide that no one who works for the United States may engage in interrogation techniques that are at variance with the Army Field Manual. In plain language, no torture. The conditions will also say that there shall be no long-term security agreements entered into with Iraq without submission of those agreements to the United States Senate for their consideration. It will establish a timetable for extricating ourselves from combat by setting a goal, not a firm date but a goal, of 18 months from the date of enactment. 
   Also, we have added two conditions which would have the effect of requiring Iraq to provide a dollar-for-dollar match for any of the redevelopment and reconstruction activities that are being carried out by the United States Government. The effect of that would be the functional equivalent of turning 50 percent of what we provide to Iraq into loans. We've done it this way because we have faith that the loans would ever be repaid, and this way we guarantee that the Iraqis, who are now about to develop very large surpluses in their own budget--they will have to meet these costs up front on an equal basis before the United States proceeds to expend its own money. And it would also require that the American military be provided gasoline in Iraq at the same subsidized price as the Iraqis are being subsidized. We don't see why the United States troops who are defending that country ought to have to pay a premium. 
   Then we will have a third amendment, again up or down, on the other administration requests. Those include food aid. We've increased the international food aid recommended by the President by $745 million. Anybody who has read the newspapers or watched television for the last 2 weeks understands why that is a moral necessity. We have also included the administration request for the Louisiana levies exactly as they have requested it as fiscal 2009 money. We have responded to a request from the Bureau of Prisons to provide $178 million so that they do not have to lay off prison guards and other personnel in the U.S. prison system. The Secretary of Commerce has requested that we provide additional funding because they run into technology problems at the U.S. Census Bureau; so we have responded to that with a $210 million appropriation. We have also added $2.2 billion in military construction funds above the President's request to fully fund the administration's 2008 BRAC requests. We have also included $210 million for military child care centers, which the President from that rostrum told the country he was for but neglected to ask the money for in his budget this year. 
   There are no Members' projects whatsoever in this bill. In the military construction portion of the bill, for instance, there are 121 facilities that are provided for; 111 of those were specifically asked for by the White House, and the others were identified by the committee as top service priorities after testimony from the military services. 
   There's only one proposal that could be really considered a specific project earmark, and that is one hospital which the Assistant Secretary of Defense asked to be included in the recommendations, and we're providing planning funds for that facility. 
   In addition, the other items in that third amendment to be considered would deal with the following: 
   If we're going to fight the war, we happen to believe that we ought to provide a ``thank you'' to the people who have fought it, especially because there has been no sense of shared sacrifice in this country. The only people who have been asked to sacrifice are military families again and again and again. So what we are doing is including the Webb bill, which would provide for the equivalent of a full-boat 4-year education at a public university for persons who have spent 36 months on active duty, and the benefits are scaled down in accordance with time served. It's long past time that we do that. 
   We have also included emergency funding for unemployment compensation so that for persons who have exhausted their unemployment benefits, they will have an additional 13 weeks available to them. 
   We have also in this amendment recommended delaying the administration's rules changes in Medicaid that have been so controversial, and we include two contractor reforms which the House had already passed. 
   The main difference, Mr. Speaker, between this bill and the administration's bill is that we pay for everything in the bill except the unemployment compensation provision and the President pays for virtually none of his requests.     
   Now I prefer to pay for the entire war if we are going to have it. I don't think we ought to have it. But if we were going to have it, I thought we ought to pay for the whole thing. So did Mr. Murtha and Mr. McGovern. So we introduced legislation to pay for the whole war with the war surtax. We lost that argument. That is not in this bill. 
   I felt that if we weren't going to pay for the war up front, then there should be no requirement to provide an offset to provide the additional GI Bill expanded benefits, which are the equivalent of only about 6 percent of the cost of this war so far. But I lost that argument, too. 
   And so this bill does pay for the expansion of GI benefits. And it pays for that in probably the best way possible, by asking the most fortunate citizens in our society, those who individually make $500,000 or more a year, or as a couple who make $1 million or more a year, we are asking them to help out in the form of a patriot premium by, in essence, asking them to pay a one-half of 1 percent surtax in order to finance the GI Bill expansion. 
   As I look at this bill, what we are doing is we are asking people who, on average, have gotten a $126,000 annual tax cut to take a tiny portion of that  tax cut to help us make life better for the persons who have been doing the most in order to preserve the way of life which has enabled those people to do so well in life. And I make no apology for it. 
   Ninety-nine percent of the appropriated dollars in the bill--99 percent of the appropriated dollars in this bill--are being requested by the administration. 
   This war, Mr. Speaker, has screwed up our economy. This war has injected chaos in the lives of military families all across the country. We make no apology in trying to use this vehicle to respond to the needs of the two groups in society who have been hit the hardest by this war; one being those who have lost their jobs because of the turmoil we have had in the economy because of the war and other factors, and second, the military families whom we believe ought to be treated about as well as the GIs were when they came back from World War II. This war has now lasted longer than World War II. And we think we have an obligation to respond to what is actually out there on the ground in communities all across the country. 
   We can debate our political philosophies. We can debate our economic theories. We can behave like little budgeteers, arguing about this comma and that comma, this offset and that offset. But in the end, we are dealing with the lives of human beings. We are dealing with the lives of families. We are dealing with people who have sacrificed incredibly much with their family members being sent to Iraq and Afghanistan once, twice, three times. Kids are not seeing their parents. 
   I represent a city of 37,000 people. We have had almost 35,000 casualties in this country. It is as if 4,000 people in my hometown were killed, and virtually every other person in that hometown wound up in a VA hospital. That is the human toll that has been paid so far just by Americans on this war. 
   So this is a process which will give Members the opportunity to vote up or down on the major pieces that comprise this legislation. 
   And I urge the House to move forward. 
   I, myself, will be intending to vote against the first amendment. I will be voting for the second and the third amendment. I hope that every Member here today exercises his conscience. That is what they are supposed to do. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from California. Those are some of the nicest words he has ever said about me, and I appreciate them deeply. 
   Let me also say that I think his speech simply bears out that because they can find no real substantive fault with the legislation, they have to fall back on whining about process. 
   I would suggest that the gentleman from California is the last person I will take lectures from when it comes to talking about an open appropriations process. I was not chairman when the Appropriations Committee when, after the conference was closed and the work was done and the names are on the conference report, I was not the chairman of the committee who allowed 30 pages of unrelated new language not seen by anybody to be inserted in that conference report which insulated the pharmaceutical industry from suit if their products damaged their customers. 
   I was not the chairman of the committee when the committee, after the conference was closed, and after it was finished, inserted anonymously, anonymously, in the dead of night, language which changed the definition of organic foods on the agriculture bill and led to nicely enriched profits for certain people in this society. 
   All I can say is that the gentleman may not like the fact that we couldn't finish discussions as fast as we wanted to on this bill. He says he has only been able to see the text for the last day or so. Let me simply suggest that at least the text he reads is the text that will be in the bill after we vote on the bill, which is more than you can say for what happened under his stewardship on several locations.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 additional minute. 
   Let me simply make the point, there is virtually nothing in this bill that hasn't been around here for months. This is not new material. The President's war request has been around here for months, as the gentleman himself has indicated. 
   The unemployment compensation provision that we are providing in this bill already passed the House on one occasion. The Webb bill has been around for months, and it has the support, and, in fact, the sponsorship of the majority of the House and wide bipartisan support in the Senate as well. 
   I would suggest, I think the question is, the Pentagon is saying you've got to get the money to the troops, because they're about to run out of money and won't get paid. Yet our friends on the other side are asking us to follow a process which would have taken a much longer period of time. 
   You can't have it both ways. This is a fair process.

   I am personally opposed to the first amendment which we are presenting to the House. But out of courtesy to the minority, who support it, and out of courtesy to the White House, who supports it, we are allowing that to come to a vote. Our party has not even whipped on that question.

   Mr. OBEY. I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I just cannot allow the impression to continue that somehow we have violated House rules or committee rules by this procedure. The fact is that despite some Members having not been around here long enough to remember, the House used to often proceed in this way, moving amendments back and forth between the Senate and the House as a device by which to reach agreement on legislation. That happened routinely during the old abortion debates back in the seventies when amendments offered by Mr. Magnuson and Mr. Flood were bounced back and forth between the Houses. 
   The fact is also that I offered, and my staff director specifically offered, to have the minority staff participate in every discussion related to appropriation items. We pointed out, we were not drafting, in our committee, the unemployment insurance issues. That was drafted by the authorizing committee. And we were not drafting the language with respect to Medicaid rules. That was done by the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
   But we offered to have the minority staff participate in all of the staff meetings that were going on with respect to anything over which the Appropriations Committee had direct jurisdiction. If they chose not to exercise that right, that's their responsibility, not ours. 
   I would also point out that my understanding is that in the 109th and 110th Congress, fully 12 percent of legislation that was passed was passed using this process of moving amendments back and forth between the Senate and the House. So this may be an unusual procedure, but it is far from unprecedented.

   The gentleman just indicated that somehow we're adding $72 billion to a bill ``that has nothing whatsoever to do with the welfare of soldiers.'' I would point out by far the largest item that we are adding to this bill, $51 billion over 10 years, is devoted to help those very same soldiers so that the people who fought, when they come home, get treated the same way that the GIs did at the end of World War II. That isn't on the backs of the soldiers. That's trying to enhance their lives. It's trying to enable Reservists and Guard members and regular forces who have had their lives disrupted, who have gone to Iraq two and three times. We're trying to say, Okay, you can stay home for a while. Get yourself a college education. 
   The GI Bill paid back this country $7 for every dollar it cost.

   Mr. Speaker, Just Imagine! The mortal sin that we're accused of committing on this side of the aisle is believing that we ought to provide some additional economic assistance to people  who have been hit the hardest by economic dislocation and have been unemployed until their benefits have expired and haven't been able to find a job. 
   It's suggested that we're doing this ``on the backs'' of our fighting men and women who return home. I'd suggest it's just the opposite. When a man or a woman returns home from Iraq, when we find out that in addition to their having their reentry problem, they also, some of them, may have post-trauma stress reaction, they find out in addition to what they have to worry about for themselves, they also have to worry about the fact that their sister or their brother-in-law is now unemployed, adding to the burden on that family.

   I think those GIs recognize this is supposed to be a seamless society.

I don't apologize for getting that money from some of the people in this society who have had the least stress in their lives. 
   It seems to me that that's what the Judeo-Christian ethic is all about, and we plead fully guilty on this side of the aisle.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute to answer the gentleman's question. 
   The gentleman wants to know why do we have money in this bill for the census? Simple. It's because the Secretary of Commerce asked us to put it in because they've had a huge technical screw-up in the Department of the Census. The last time I looked, the Secretary of Commerce was appointed by the President of the United States, Mr. George W. Bush. 
   He wants to know why we have money in this bill for prisons. Simple. We've been told by the Bureau of Prisons--last time I looked, it's run by the Bush Administration--that if we didn't provide this money, because of cost overruns they're going to have to fire guards and lay off people in Federal prisons. Anybody interested in law and order I don't think is going to be happy about that. 
   So it seems to me it is responsible to respond to emergencies on both the domestic side and on the international side. 
   I'm sorry that the gentleman doesn't seem to be aware of the fact that we have, in writing, requests from both of those agencies, but that happens to be the fact. And that's the answer.

   Mr. OBEY. I yield myself 10 seconds. 
   Once again, when they can't argue about the substance, they whine about process. That's not going to impress very many people. It certainly didn't in Mississippi yesterday. 
   With that, I would like to yield 1 minute to the distinguished Speaker of  the House, the gentlewoman from California.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want Members to understand this bill was not written in the Speaker's office or any other leadership office. Virtually every appropriation issue of this bill was  written in the Appropriations Committee. We did not, obviously, write language that has previously passed the House under the control of other committees. The Energy and Commerce Committee produced the language, for instance, on the Medicaid rules. And the authorizing committee produced the language on unemployment compensation. That's normal. 
   In fact, the Speaker herself was joking the other day and teasing me, indicating that there were three items that she had wanted in the bill that the committee had turned down. So I would suggest this is not quite the dictatorship that the myth-makers on the other side of the aisle are trying to portray. 
   Having said that, let me explain what it is we are doing here today, since the minority leader was courteous enough to ask. What we are trying to do is to recognize a sad fact, which is that as long as George Bush is President of the United States, we are not going to be able to shut down the war. So what we are trying to do is proceed in the most responsible possible manner in order to assure that the next President, whoever he or she is, has at least 3 or 4 months to think through how he or she would get us out of this god-awful mess in Iraq, which I regard to be the most misguided foreign policy decision in my lifetime. 
   What we are trying to do is to recognize that we do not have a majority in the United States Senate to shut down this war. And so we are looking at ways to provide Members with an opportunity to speak out on whether they want to see that war funding go ahead or not, a straight up-or-down vote. No coercion, at least on this side of the aisle, no whipping that question on this side of the aisle. Members were told, ``Vote your conscience.'' 
   We are also trying to do two other things. We are trying, once again, to attach conditions to the use of this money. Now I myself will vote against the first amendment because I have no guarantee that the conditions in the second amendment will survive Senate action. If they did, I would be perfectly comfortable with the first amendment because I think the first amendment is a straight effort to do what I just described a minute ago. 
   But the reason we want to pursue the second amendment is because we think it is about time that the Iraqis, now that they are generating oil surpluses and budget surpluses, we believe it is about time that they begin to assume the costs of their own reconstruction, at least 50 percent of it. This is why we have a 50-50, dollar-for-dollar match requirement which we are imposing on the Iraqis if we are to be expected to spend any more money in reconstructing Iraq. We think that's eminently sensible. 
   We also think it is about time that Iraq quit overcharging the U.S. military for the price of gasoline. There is no reason why we should be paying through the nose at a much higher price than Iraqis are paying for gasoline. 
   And then thirdly, we are asking the President of the United States to remember that the United States of America still exists, too, and that there are some problems that we need to address here. In fact, the administration itself has recognized some of them because the administration sent down a reprogramming request to deal with the problem of the Bureau of Prisons. They sent down a reprogramming request to deal with the census. We didn't think we ought to fix those problems by cutting even more deeply into local law enforcement funding, because those budgets have already been cut far too much. So we rejected the way that the administration wanted to pay for those items. And instead we have included them in this bill fully, fully paid for. 
   We also have the temerity to believe that if we are going to fight this war, then we ought to also provide a thank you note, a healthy thank you note, for the people who fought the war on our behalf. That is why we are insistent that we pass the expansion of the GI Bill so that you can take people whose lives have been turned upside-down for years, military families from the east coast to the west coast, their lives have been disrupted for years. We want to say ``we want to at least partially compensate you by giving you the opportunity for a full, 4-year college education at any State university in your State.'' And we have provisions that will even expand beyond that if they go to other schools that also participate in helping finance their education. We make no apology for including that. 
   We have heard from at least three speakers on that side of the aisle that we are providing $51 billion for that on the backs of the soldiers.     
   It isn't on their backs. It's an effort to help them. I would point out in the previous GI Bill in World War II, this country got a return of $7 for every dollar that it invested in the GI Bill. We recognize the value of doing that again. We recognize the moral obligation of doing that again, and we make no apology in going forward with it. 
   We also make no apology for recognizing that when we have millions of Americans unemployed, that there is no harm done by providing to those who have been unemployed the longest and have exhausted their benefits, with 13 weeks of additional assistance as those people look for jobs. This Congress sits here in a comfortable room making $160,000 a year, nickel nursing about our efforts to provide a few additional benefits to people who have been unemployed that long. 
   If we don't vote for that provision, we ought to be ashamed of ourselves. I ask each and every Member to vote your conscience. I am not going to tell you how to vote on any of the amendments. I will be voting against the first, for the second and the third. 
   But I urge us to get on with it. This is the only way that we can get the problem dealt with.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, following is an explanation of the amendments of the House of Representatives (relating to supplemental appropriations for fiscal years 2008 and 2009) to the amendment of the Senate to H.R. 2642, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2008. 
   In this statement, the provisions of the House amendments to the Senate amendment are generally referred to as ``the amended bill''. 
   House Amendment 1 strikes lines 1 through 3 on page 60 of the Senate amendment and inserts language providing supplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2008, and additional supplemental funds for fiscal year 2009 for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   House Amendment 2 inserts after line 3 on page 60 of the Senate amendment language regarding policy for operations in Iraq and reforms relating to war profiteering and contractors. 
   House Amendment 3 strikes line 1 on page 1 of the Senate amendment and all that follows through line 21 on page 59, and inserts language providing supplemental appropriations for military construction, international affairs, and other security-related and domestic needs, as well as language providing for improved veterans education benefits, temporary extended unemployment compensation, and a moratorium on certain Medicaid regulations, and establishing a surtax on high income taxpayers to offset the cost of the veterans benefit provision. 
   The texts of the amendments are printed in the Rules Committee report (H. Rpt. 110-636) to accompany House Resolution 1197. 
   Unless otherwise noted, all appropriations in the amendments are designated as emergency requirements and necessary to meet emergency needs pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of section 204 of S. Con. Res. 21, the congressional budget resolution for fiscal year 2008.

   Mr. OBEY. I thank the gentleman for the time. 
   Let me simply say that I do appreciate very much the initiatives that are being taken by this subcommittee with respect to the climate change problem facing the globe. These are small initiatives; they are nonetheless important. They are not nearly sufficient to deal with the long-term problem, but we will have to mount a much greater effort on this front in the years to come. 
   I would like to comment on what has happened with respect to local law enforcement assistance over the past 3 years. We have had a Kabuki dance going on for years between the White House and the Congress of the United States. Each year, the President proposes very deep cuts in the law enforcement assistance grants to localities, and each year the Congress only partially restores those cuts. It then pats itself on the back, says, ``Oh, what a good boy am I. Look how much we added to law enforcement,'' when, in fact, all they did is restore a small portion of the President's reductions. As a result, these programs, which were funded at the $4.4 billion level in fiscal 2001, are now funded at about $2.8 billion, $1.6 billion below the high watermark. That is ill-advised, in my view. 
   I appreciate the fact that this bill provides a substantial increase in that funding for local law enforcement, $1.7 billion, or 53 percent, above the President's request. I think that is essential. 
   The committee also recognizes that State and local law enforcement benefits from the criminal investigation resources and capabilities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and so this bill provides $148 million over the President's request for that purpose. I think that money is very badly needed. 
   Having said that, I have to confess a significant degree of discomfort with the way the FBI has performed in recent years. As we know, investigations of the use of national security letters by the FBI have told us that the FBI issued approximately 8,500 of those in 2000. The March 2007 Senate investigation of the Justice Department's Inspector General puts that number now at over 143,000 NSLs issued between 2003 and 2005. The same investigation found serious FBI abuses of NSL regulations. And what is even more alarming is the report that the FBI's own lawyers counseled against the illegal use of emergency letters requesting telephone and Internet information, and still the practice continued for 2 years. This practice continued for 2 years, despite counsel's recommendation to cease, and Congress only found out about the situation upon public release of the IG report when the FBI's general counsel had been briefing special agents in charge on reversing the practice for 2 months prior to that. 
   I am disconcerted by that fact, and I have talked to the director of the FBI about this on two occasions. I was pleased when he got the job in the first place, but I am not pleased with the way this has worked out. I would certainly hope that the agency would shape up so that it does not continue to be an embarrassment in terms of its declining to adhere to rule of law. 
   With that said, I also am pleased that the Legal Service Corporation is funded at a level $66 million higher than the President's request. All I can say about that is that it is about time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, let me summarize the basic facts. The Economic Development Administration budget last year was $250 million. The President's request for this year was $170 million. The committee added $100 million to the President's request to take it to $270 million, and the gentleman's amendment would take it back down to $170 million, which is a 32 percent reduction below the amount provided last year.  
   With respect to the FBI, the committee has already added $148 million to the amount that the President requested. We are substantially above last year's budget. The FBI has been treated very, very well. 
   I find no reasonable justification for saying that we ought to provide the $6 million increase for the FBI when it's already received an increase of $148 million. And I certainly don't find any reason to say that we ought to reduce our efforts to support economic development around the country. 
   Economic development funds are used, among other things, to help localities establish industrial parks. I have to tell you there are literally thousands of jobs that have been added in my own district by corporations who were able to move into these industrial parks to get their services and grow. We have developed a very strong electronics industry in my district through the use of funds through EDA. 
   I think the key to this bill is balance. We have provided a significant increase for the FBI. We've provided a modest increase for EDA. And I think that the country is better off if we stick with the committee recommendations. 
   I would urge a ``no'' vote. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the gentleman's amendment. 
   The amendment proposes to increase the level of outlays in the bill. I don't think that's the intention, but that's the effect. 
   The fact is that the outlay rate in the NOAA account is 65 percent. The outlay rate in the FBI account is 80 percent. Therefore, the amendment is not budget neutral, and I ask for a ruling from the Chair.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, it's obvious how reluctant the gentleman is to bring this before the body. He has offered an amendment which does absolutely nothing in order to give him an opportunity to talk about something he says he doesn't want to talk about. Only in Washington would that be believable. 
   Let me simply say that I think I know something about the Code of Ethics in this House. I wrote the Code of Ethics in this House in the 1970s, and I think I know something about what this House regards as a conflict of interest. 
   Let me simply point out that the gentleman from Iowa has objected to a Member of the House chairing a subcommittee which oversees the agencies that he says are involved in an investigation of that Member. The fact is that that gentleman in question has recused himself from all matters relating to the FBI, the Attorney General, the Criminal Division, and U.S. attorneys. That's why I am here on the floor handling those portions of the bill today. 
   The gentleman in question has not reviewed any reprogramming letters. He has not reviewed any Member requests for any of the attendant agencies involved in that investigation. He has not presided over any hearings. He has not participated or made any recommendations with respect to funding either on this bill or in the continuing resolution. 
   So let me simply say that if the gentleman has a strong view about what the House rules ought to be, then the proper place to take that up is not on an appropriation bill. The proper place for him to take that up is with the Standards Committee and with the leadership of both Houses. By taking it up here, it is simply an excuse to bring into question the actions of one Member. And it would be very easy for us to respond in kind with respect to the activities of a number of Members on that side of the aisle. We choose to stay above that and allow the proper committee to deal with the issue. 
   Mr. Chairman, I do, very regretfully, yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I must insist on my point of order. 
   Mr. Chairman, I certainly understand what the gentleman is trying to accomplish, and I probably agree with it. But, nonetheless, this committee is not the proper venue and this legislation is not the proper legislation upon which to raise the issue. 
   During the consideration of the Labor-H bill last week, I had to object to a number of amendments and lodge points of order because they were not appropriately offered to that bill, even though some of them were from my side of the aisle and I agreed with them.  
   This amendment, while I would certainly be happy to work with the gentleman, this amendment cannot be accepted by the committee without violating the rules of the House, and so therefore I make a point of order against the amendment because it provides an appropriation for a non-authorized program and therefore violates clause 2, rule XXI, which states in pertinent part: ``An appropriation may not be in order as an amendment for an expenditure not previously authorized by law.'' 
   The amendment proposes to appropriate funds for a program that is not authorized and therefore violates clause 2, rule XXI. 
   I ask for a ruling of the Chair.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman will yield, I think on this issue there are certainly questions of equity on both sides. I think they need to be resolved. I understand why the FBI wants to follow the policy that they follow. I also understand why agents themselves feel it is unfair leaving them with the reduced retirement possibility. 
   So, again, I would be happy to work with the gentleman to see if we can't persuade the agency to come up with an agreeable solution to the problem.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 minutes. 
   Yesterday, a number of Members on the Republican side of the aisle sought to belittle the legislation before us because, in addition to funding the needs of the troops in Iraq, it contains money to address a number of domestic priorities. To ridicule that legislation, they tried to belittle items such as funding for levees in New Orleans, and agriculture disaster payments. In that they have been joined by editorial writers at papers such as the Washington Post. 
   Like the Post, the Republican speakers of yesterday indicated that their main objection to this legislation is the way it tries to create pressure to end our military involvement in an Iraq civil war. Those speakers and the Washington Post editorial writers make no effort to understand why these additional items are there. They simply ridicule them for their own purposes. This bill has my name on it, and I take full responsibility for each and every item in the bill. 
   Despite the comments of my good friend from California suggesting that if I could have written this bill, it would have been quite different, this is not a bill that was imposed from Nancy Pelosi's Speaker's Office. Oh, yes, she was consulted. But every last provision in this bill was not included until I personally approved of it, and I take full responsibility for it. 
   I want to be very clear about some of the items that the editorial writers and certain Members of this House have been criticizing. 
   Let's start with agriculture. I haven't voted for a farm bill in the last 10 years because I believe that existing farm programs provide way too much funding for large farmers and way too little funding for family farmers. But the fact is that over the past 2 years, over 70 percent of the counties in this country were declared disaster areas, not by me, but by the President of the United States. That entitles farmers who have suffered that weather-related disaster to certain forms of compensation. 
   The previous Congress tried to work its way through that problem for well over a year and failed. We at one time this year were looking at a bill in the Senate costing $6 billion. Thanks to the efforts of Chairman Peterson on this side of the Capitol, the cost of those agriculture disaster programs have been cut by one-third, by tightening up eligibility requirements. 
   I applaud him for making those changes. 
   There is a second criticism being made about the fact that there is some money in here for dairy. You bet there is. Because under the Republican stewardship, during the last Congress, or two Congresses ago, actually, in order to use an accounting gimmick, the then majority on the Agriculture Committee arranged to have the dairy program expire one month before every other farm program. That was done only for budget fiction purposes, to hide the true cost of the farm bill 5 years ago. You bet, in this legislation there is a 1-month fix so that when we go into writing the next farm bill, dairy will have a chance to compete with other farm programs. 
   I find the Washington Post criticism of this especially interesting, since they often squawk about the fact that farm programs give too much to large farmers. The MILC Program happens to focus on small farmers, which is why so many big farmers don't like the program. I make no apology for recognizing that is an inequity that needs to be fixed. 
   Then we have a squawk about spinach. Let me tell you why spinach is in here. You can laugh about it now, but people were dying last year because of an E. coli outbreak. 
   Now, the FDA did not have the authority to require mandatory recalls of spinach. What some of these companies did, despite the fact that their product was clean, they voluntarily withdrew their product from the market. That cost them a bundle and brought a lot of people to near bankruptcy. 
   I have heard a lot of conservatives on this floor talk about how outrageous it is when the government engages in an unconstitutional taking. They usually are talking in terms of land or environment. Doesn't the government that required or that asked these people to participate in the withdrawal in order to protect public health, doesn't that government have an obligation to people who exercise their patriotic duty and did what they were asked? I think they do. That is why this is in here. 
   Then they are squawking about aquaculture. Well, let me explain why that item is in the bill. In eight States in the union, fish farmers woke up one morning and discovered that the Federal Government had issued an edict which prevented them from transferring their product across State lines because lake trout, in the Great Lakes region, had been discovered to have viral hemorrhagic septicemia, a highly virulent fish disease. If it was allowed to get into lakes, in the Great Lakes, it could have ruined the entire fish supply. So, the government said you can't sell your fish across State lines. 
   Again, the problem was that the fish that they were prohibited from shipping across State lines was all healthy. In a catch-22 situation, if their fish had been diseased, they could have collected under disaster programs. But because they were healthy, they couldn't collect. So the government put those people out of business. 
   Does the government have an obligation to correct that problem? You better bet you they do. That is why it is in this bill. 
   There are some other items in the bill as well that people don't like. But the main frustration on the part of the opponents of this bill is because people don't like the way that we are going about trying to end our military participation in an Iraqi civil war. 
   Let me submit to you the problem we have today is not that we didn't listen enough to people like the Washington Post, it is that we listened too much. They endorsed going to war in the first place. They helped drive the drumbeat that drove almost two-thirds of the people in this Chamber to vote for that misbegotten, stupid, ill-advised war that has destroyed our influence over a third of the world. So I make no apology if the moral sensibilities of some people on this floor, or the editorial writers of the Washington Post, are offended because they don't like the specific language contained in our benchmarks or in our timelines. 
   What matters in the end is not what the specific language is. What matters is whether or not we produce a product today that puts pressure on this administration and sends a message to Iraq, to the Iraqi politicians, that we are going to end the permanent, long-term babysitting service. That is what we are trying to do. 
   If the Washington Post is offended about the way we do it, that is just too bad. But we are in the arena, they are not. This is the best we can do, given the tools we have, and I make absolutely no apology for it. 
   I would say one thing, those of us who voted against the war in the first place wouldn't have nearly as hard a time getting us out of the war if people like the Washington Post and those who criticized us on the floor yesterday hadn't supported going into that stupid war in the first place 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me simply say that we could do as the distinguished speaker has indicated and simply rubber-stamp what the administration asks for and do nothing else. But the fact is, what we are doing is exercising our responsibilities to provide checks and balances; Congress has every right to limit the terms and conditions under which appropriations are made, especially in wartime. 
   I would also point out that lest there be any doubt for the support of the troops, in addition to all of the funding that Mr. Murtha has put in his section of the bill to meet the everyday combat and readiness needs of the troops, we have $1.7 billion above the President's request for veterans health care; we have another $1.7 billion above the President's request for defense health care. I think that makes quite clear that if you are concerned about the troops and concerned about the veterans, you will vote for this bill. 
   I will now yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Edwards).

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. 
   The fact is that an earmark is something that is requested by an individual Member. This item was not requested by any individual Member; it was put in the bill by me. And it is there because we are simply doing the same thing with this facility that we are doing throughout the gulf coast, which is to make investments that mitigate against risk because of hurricanes.  
   This is a valuable Federal facility, and it certainly does not pass any definition of earmark that I know. I know the gentleman wants to see earmarks in every closet that he can find, but the fact is it is not an earmark. It was not asked for by any Members of Congress.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Speaker, the characterization just placed on the previous speaker is flat out wrong. 
   Last night we had plenty of time for a lot of Members who didn't show up before the session expired. We called the gentleman from Ohio's office twice to inform him he had time available last night even though he was opposed to our position. He wasn't in a position to take it last night. So I would suggest that we have a different set of speakers today. We called on four Members of the caucus last night who were opposed to our position. And if the gentleman is suggesting that we have not called on Members who are opposed to our position, he is just flat out wrong.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I understand that at the end of the debate the closing speech on the Republican side will be given by our good friend from Texas Mr. Johnson. I think everyone in this place respects him and loves him. 
   I must say that having gone through this for the last 3 weeks trying to talk to each and every person who I could reach about this measure has given me a profound respect for a good many Members of this institution whom I had not known before, especially the newcomers. 
   The caucus that we had this morning was one of the most moving experiences that I have ever felt in my 38 years in the Congress. I heard Member after Member stand up and discuss this issue as a matter of high principle; but they also discussed it in terms of what the impact of their votes would be, not on themselves, but on the people of this country, on the soldiers who are fighting in the field, on the people in Iraq, and on our country's ability to influence the world. 
   This is a very tough issue. There are many considerations that each of us brings to this judgment, but in the end, I think we have a choice. As I said earlier today, we have a choice in determining what kind of Congress this is going to be. We can continue the practices of the past which rubberstamped virtually everything the President wanted on Iraqi policy. We can continue to do what he wants and only what he wants and only when he wants to do it and only in the way he wants to do it; or we can do what our Founding Fathers envisioned when they created the Congress. We can exercise checks and balances in order to try to move policy into a more constructive direction for this country. 
   If you oppose this bill today, and if you take the position that all it should contain is what the President sent down, then you would be saying that you wanted to finance BRAC, the base-closing program, by gutting key education programs as the President recommends. You would be opposed to additional border security, additional port security and additional cargo security. 
   You would be opposed to finally, after all of the horrendous pictures and all of the horrendous human suffering, you would be opposed to finally meeting our total obligations to the victims of Katrina. 
   You would be opposed to asking for the money which the President himself asked that we provide in 2005 on an emergency basis to prepare this country to meet the pandemic flu epidemic which will surely at some time come. 
   You would be opposing the additional $3.5 million that we have provided in this bill for veterans' health care and defense health care, and you would be opposing the timelines and the benchmarks which we place in this legislation, not because they are so perfect, but because they are the instrument by which we communicate to the Iraqi politicians that they must begin to resolve their differences, they must step up, because we are not going to run our baby-sitting service forever. 
   It is imperative that we finally send that signal. The President cannot send  that signal, but we can help General Petraeus. We can help our own government by sending the signal that this Congress is going to play bad cop until the Iraqis get the message. 
   That is what Mr. Murtha's efforts have been about, that is what mine have been about, that's what the Speaker's efforts have been about, and that's what the efforts have been about by virtually every person in this caucus and this House who has had a say in what this bill was going to contain. 
   I strongly urge an ``aye'' vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   Mr. Speaker, I regret that the minority leader has chosen to trivialize one item in this bill, which represents our direct responsibility to people who work in the most outrageous conditions on Capitol Hill. Roll Call itself, in describing the funding that we have in this bill on the Capitol heating plant, which the majority leader just trivialized, wrote that ``what we have on our hands is a `horrific scandal'. The working environment for the 10-member Capitol tunnel shop team resembles that of hell.'' 
   One of our own Republican colleagues in this House is mentioned in the editorial as describing the conditions in that heating plant as, quote, ``inhumane and unprofessional,'' and said of the tunnel workers, that they are ``probably going to end up dying because of their exposure to asbestos.'' 
   The money in this bill is for cleaning up the asbestos problem, which people in that tunnel have to work in every day. I make no apology whatsoever for providing that funds. The minority leader ought to be standing side by side with us to meet our obligations to clean up that mess. I am surprised he doesn't recognize that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Patrick J. Murphy).

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the time. 
   Let me simply say this bill is intended to increase the small business set-aside for these research programs. That does no harm for a large agency whose budget has been rising, such as the Department of Defense, but it can do immeasurable harm to the crown jewel of our research agencies in this country, the National Institutes of Health. 
   If we were to do what this bill does to NIH, it would result in $187 million less being available for traditional medical research grants at medical research centers and universities. I think that that is not a good idea. The President's budget has already reduced the number of grants that NIH will be able to provide by almost 500 grants. This will add about another 500 grant reduction to the President's budget. That would mean that we would be supporting a grant level for the traditional NIH grants at about 1,100 grants fewer than was the case in 2007. I think that is a very bad idea. Therefore, when the bill comes before us, I would urge support of the Ehlers amendment, which will correct the problem with respect to the National Institutes of Health. 
   I know that some people will say, ``Well, we're not reducing the number of grants, we're simply shifting the nature of grants from traditional grants to small business grants.'' But the fact is that the success rate for small business grants under this bill is expected to rise to 52 percent whereas the success rate for applications for traditional NIH grants is expected to decline to 18 percent. That is a disparity that the scientific community and the country at large simply cannot afford. 
   NIH believes that there will not be sufficient high-quality grants under the small business set-aside to pass peer review over time, and that means they would simply have to lapse back precious research money that could be used for heart disease, for Parkinson's, for cancer, things like that. 
   So I would strongly urge, when this bill comes before us, to vote for the Ehlers amendment as a way to address that balance.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for the time, and I want to congratulate the gentleman from Indiana and the gentleman from Ohio for doing a first-rate piece of work on this legislation. They know their business, they work with each other well, and I am proud of both of them. I would like to discuss two matters. The first is the question of congressional earmarks, and the second is the actual substance of this bill. 
   We have seen much attention paid over the past several months to the practice of Congress earmarking certain projects. 
   This bill is a project-oriented bill, and so there will be quite a lot of that going on before the bill is finished. But I would like to put that in context. The fact is that the administration has requested far more dollars for earmark projects for this bill than the Congress traditionally provides. 
   Example: in fiscal year 2006, which is the last year we had a completed bill, the President asked for 987 specific earmark projects in the budget for the Army Corps of Engineers, costing $3.8 billion. The Congress appropriated $1.1 billion for projects that it ranked as high priority. 
   The result: 77 percent of the Army Corps budget went for projects earmarked by the administration; 23 percent went for projects earmarked by the Congress of the United States. 
   In fact, this is a copy of the report for that 2006 bill. The list of administration project earmark requests goes on for 46 pages, and I would submit that if the administration had been Democratic, it would have been the same result. 
   Now, how does the administration decide how to allocate money to specific projects? Here is what the instruction sheet reads for the Corps of Engineers: ``To be included in the recommended program and considered for the ceiling program for fiscal 2008, a construction project or separate element must be consistent with policy.'' 
   Well, guess what? That is the same policy that Congress provides. Projects have to be consistent with policy in order to be included. 
   The document from the Army Corps of Engineers also says it must have a decision document for which executive branch review has been completed. And then it goes on to say, each project or separable element must meet at least one of nine criteria, which are listed. But then it goes on to say, ``however, the agency may propose to relax those criteria, to use additional criteria, or to include special cases.'' 
   Guess what? That is exactly what the Congress does in determining which projects it feels are high priority.  
   Now, let's turn to 2008. This year, the administration has requested some 991 projects. If you string them end to end, that is how long their project list is for this year. I would submit, in the end, this will be a longer list than the project list provided by the Congress in this bill. 
   So let me simply state that whether projects are funded because of directed spending on the part of the administration or directed spending on the part of the Congress, the result is the same: public money is expended on projects that either the executive branch or the legislative branch thinks represent high priority needs. So much for earmarks in this bill. 
   Now, let me simply discuss the substance. There are three major areas of funding critical to our country's future in the bill: climate change, the energy crisis, and nuclear policy. 
   This bill includes more than $1 billion above the President's request for climate change. Funding goes to energy research, for development and demonstration of energy technologies that don't release greenhouse gases. They include conservation, research and development, and demonstration to reduce energy consumption in buildings, vehicles and energy-intensive industries. They include deployment of conservation measures in Federal buildings. They include demonstration of capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide. 
   In the 1970s, the United States responded to the energy crisis in those days with substantially increased funding for energy research, for development and demonstration. But with the collapse of oil prices in the eighties, the interests of the administrations and the interests of Congress, unfortunately, subsided. So the result is that by fiscal 2006, after adjusting for inflation, research budgets for renewable energy were only 20 percent of what they were in real terms in 1980. Research budgets for fossil energy were only 25 percent of 1980 levels. Funding for conservation research was only 49 percent of 1980 levels. 
   In the year-long continuing resolution which we passed just 3 months ago, we raised those percentages considerably. So 2007 funding for renewable energy was boosted up to 38 percent of 1980 levels, and 2007 funding for conservation was boosted to 54 percent of 1980 levels. 
   This bill continues that effort: 2008 funding for renewable energy will now under this bill be upped to 47 percent of 1980 levels, 2008 funding for fossil energy will be upped to 31 percent of 1980 levels, and 2008 funding for conservation will be up to 67 percent of 1980 levels. 
   This bill also provides for a $2 billion operating level for the nuclear nonproliferation activities of the Department of Energy. 
   This bill does not fund new nuclear weapons nor major new weapons facilities, because the administration has not developed a strategy for strategic nuclear weapons in the post-Cold War era. 
   So let me simply say in conclusion that this bill reverses a quarter century of decline in energy research. It increases critical funding to prevent nuclear weapons or material from falling into the hands of terrorists. It represents a responsibly balanced bill. I congratulate both gentlemen for producing this, and I would urge strong support for its passage.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to point something out. Last night the committee, while most Members were able to leave for dinner, the committee had to stay here and work until 10 p.m.. Lots of Members didn't show up then to offer  their amendments, and so now we have a surplus of amendments that we still have to go through today. 
   Now, today, the committee is grinding through these amendments, and we've just hit a patch in the road where no Members were here to offer their amendments. 
   Under the House rules, the committee could have chosen to rise and we could have moved to final passage without considering any of the other amendments that are still pending. The committee chose not to do that, out of fairness. 
   But I want to point out that if Members want to tie up the committee's time ad nauseam on repetitive amendments, the same amendments on the same bills ad nauseam, then the least they can do is to be on the floor when those amendments are supposed to be offered. The next time there is such a gap, I will move to rise and move to final passage.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I had not intended to speak on this issue either, but I feel required to respond to one thing that the gentleman from Arizona said. 
   He indicated that it was too bad that he had only had 2 or 3 days during which time he could review the earmarks in this bill. I simply want to say if he feels badly about that and wants to know why that is the case, all he has to do is look in the mirror along with a number of his other colleagues. 
   Why do I say that? Because I tried about a month ago to make clear to the House that I thought the Appropriations Committee staff had had insufficient time to take a look at and screen a number of these earmarks, especially those that came early in the process. So I offered up another option, and what I proposed is that the committee simply be given more time to screen those earmarks, and that before the Congress adjourned in August, we would then publish all of them, and any persons who had doubts about them would have more than 30 days over the August recess, and our staffs could have reviewed each and every one of them for a much longer period of time. 
   The gentleman and others on that side of the aisle chose to belittle that proposal, suggesting that we were trying to, quote, ``hide earmarks until conference.'' Not so. All we were trying to do was to give the staff and any Members who were interested additional time in which to review those earmarks. Our friends on the other side decided that they would rather criticize than agree to that, and so we acquiesced in their desires to have earmarks in each bill as they came to the floor.     
   We felt that there would be ample protection for Members because we also included a reform that would have required persons in the conference to be present and voting on every single item rather than having to endure what has happened in the past when large amounts of legislation were slipped into conference reports without a vote of the conference after the conference is over. But our judgment was not followed, and so as a result, we have this very limited time for Members to review projects as they come through in regular order. I'm sorry about that. But I would say to the gentleman, no one in this House can have it both ways. We've tried to accommodate the wishes of the House. Either way, we're doing the best we can. And if the gentleman doesn't like it, I think, as I say, all he has to do is look in the mirror because it was comments from people like him that required us to follow this procedure in this manner. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, as the gentleman has indicated, this provides funds for a revolving loan fund for North Central Regional Planning Commission. The purpose is to provide small low-interest loans for small business start-ups or expansions. It is targeted to enterprises which have little access to capital and need to change the technology which they use in production. 
   The planning commission is established by county governments under State statutory authority. It provides zoning and economic development assistance to counties. The planning commission covers a 10-county area and three congressional districts, mine, the gentleman from the eighth, Mr. Kagen, formerly Mr. Green, and also Mr. Petri's district. 
   Why are we providing funds for this area? Very simple: this is an economically challenged area. And I make no apology whatsoever in trying to provide some modest assistance to the area. We have a similar fund in two other parts of my congressional direct. In Chippewa County, for instance, 3 years ago we established a similar fund.     
   That fund has saved 58 jobs in the area. They have provided grants, very small grants, to businesses in question, and they have already received $200,000 in repayments. All of the repayments are current. 
   But I want to ask a series of questions about the gentleman's district. I make no apology for trying to provide small loans to domestic small business entrepreneurs. In the 10 years that I chaired the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I learned very quickly the value of small loans rather than large, megadevelopment projects. I see no reason why we shouldn't provide those same lessons here at home. 
   I find it ironic that someone from Arizona would challenge economic development funds in Wisconsin. Arizona ranks 24th in the Nation in per capita Federal dollars spent in Arizona; Wisconsin ranks 48th. So the gentleman is exactly twice as well off in terms of State ranking than my own State. Arizona receives $41 billion in Federal funds out of the budget; my State receives $31 billion. Arizona receives $7,300 per person; Wisconsin receives $5,675 per person. That is a $1,600 per capita difference. 
   Eighty-five percent of the difference in what our two States get is due to differences in Federal salaries and in procurement. Arizona gets $7 billion more out of the Federal Government because of money spent for procurement than does the State of Wisconsin. In fact, Arizona gets a lot more money than all of the States in the upper Midwest. Arizona, as I said, ranks 24th. Wisconsin ranks 48th in per capita expenditure, Michigan ranks 47th, Minnesota 49th, Illinois 46th, Indiana 45th. 
   On a per capita basis, Arizona gets 28 percent more out of the Federal budget than does Wisconsin. It gets 22 percent more per capita than does Michigan, 29 percent more than does Minnesota, 21 percent more than does Illinois, and 20 percent more than does Indiana. 
   Let me also point out that I doubt very much that the Arizona delegation doesn't work very hard to see to it that giant defense contractors like Raytheon, Boeing, Honeywell and General Dynamics together receive almost $4 billion in funding from the Federal Government. I doubt very much that the delegations from those States don't work to get that money in their States. So I make no apology for this tiny pittance that we are trying to provide for my own State. 
   Mr. Chairman, I also want to say, however, I think it comes with considerable ill grace for someone from Arizona to question the expenditure of $400,000 in Wisconsin, when Arizona has been the principal recipient of the second largest Federal earmark in the history of earmarking in this country, the Central Arizona Project. For Arizona, we have already spent $4.3 billion. The total cost of that project is expected to be $5.6 billion. The President's request is at $27 million this year. 
   Mr. Chairman, that seems to me to be the pot calling the kettle black. I would urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the ayes appeared to have it.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I want to continue my observations about what the gentleman receives from the Federal budget. The Republican Study Committee said that the $1.5 billion that was provided to the D.C. subway was the largest earmark in history. In fact, the Arizona project is almost four times as large as the D.C. subway. Yet the gentleman is complaining about a tiny $400,000 economic assistance grant for my State. 
   I would also simply note that the median household income in the gentleman's district is $48,000. The median household income in my own district is $39,000, a $9,000 difference. A good portion of that higher median income lies in the fact that Arizona has a very large number of Federal installations in the gentleman's State. Fort Huachuca and several other Air Force bases inject enough funds to provide employment for 9,000 additional people, yet the gentleman is objecting to a small revolving loan fund which provides help in keeping about 50 jobs in Wisconsin. 
   I make no apology in trying to get the median family income in my district just a mite closer to the much higher income found in the gentleman's district. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I don't want to get into the debate on this specific project, but I again want to simply note that I find it interesting that the gentleman from Arizona is questioning small economic development programs in other States when, in fact, as I said earlier, the second largest earmark in the history of the Congress is the Central Arizona Project, upon which we have already spent not $4.3 million, but $4.3 billion, total cost estimated to be $5.6 billion. 
   And I also have in my hand, as a certain Senator from my own State used to say, 61 pages of military contracts that are let to firms in Arizona. We don't have in our State something like Fort Huachuca or Luke or Davis Air Force Base, and I'm sure that if we did, we would be experiencing the benefit to our economy that the gentleman's State is experiencing. 
   But I wonder if the gentleman has any idea what the $44,000 was spent on in a contract with Two Pals and a Gal?

   Mr. OBEY. Taking back my time, I was here when we went through all of that with the Central Arizona Project, and I assure you that the project was not approved because of the merits. It was approved because of the persistence of the Arizona delegation, and if anyone thinks that a little politics didn't go into determining that $4.5 billion project, I'd like to sell them a couple of bridges. 
   So, all I can say is it is fine for someone who comes from a district as prosperous as yours to belittle or question these modest economic development efforts that are being provided around the country in districts that have a per family income of $8,000, $9,000, $10,000 less than yours. This is, after all, one country. 
   And just as I believe that the most fortunate human beings in this country ought to be willing to extend a helping hand for those who are least fortunate, I also think that those communities that are well off ought to be able to extend a helping hand to the communities that are less well off, and that certainly is the case with the number of the economic development projects that this committee is trying to fund, recognizing that we are, after all, all one country. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, again, I do not want to comment on the particular project under question, but, again, I just want to make a point to my friend from Arizona. And I love the State of Arizona. It is a beautiful State. I go there every year to visit some friends. I think it is absolutely wonderful. 
   But when I came to this Congress, I believe there were four congressional districts in Arizona, four Representatives of Arizona in this House, and there were 10 Representatives from the State of Wisconsin. Now, almost 40 years later, Wisconsin has eight congressional districts, eight Representatives, and Arizona, I believe, has a similar number. That means that Arizona has grown at an incredibly rapid rate, and an awful lot of money from a lot of other States has helped finance that economic growth. 
   And I return to the Central Arizona Project. I am not expressing a judgment about that project one way or the other, but I do know that it is one of the two or three most expensive earmarks in history. And I would simply suggest that I find it ironic that the gentleman has chosen to go after several projects today in States whose economies are far less prosperous than the gentleman's own State. 
   I also would question whether or not there is any greater purity in a highway, for instance, being built on the basis of a determination by two or three persons from a given State that knows the area, I don't know why that is any less pure than to have some partisan bureaucrat in the agency decide.

   Mr. OBEY. As I was saying, I don't know why one should assume that a decision to build a highway or any other project, if made by partisan bureaucrats or politically appointed bureaucrats in an agency, I don't know why that is any more pure than a decision being made out in the open by Members of Congress, who I think know their districts as well as any bureaucrat. 
   So all I would suggest is that while I am certainly not fond of the earmarking process, I am also not fond of the idea that somehow those of us from States not quite as prosperous as the gentleman's need to be embarrassed by the fact that we are asking for a little better deal in terms of Federal money spent in our districts, especially when the gentleman's State is above the national average in terms of the amount of Federal dollars spent in his own State.

   For all of my 39 years in Congress, I have fought against trickle-down economics and the mindless deregulation that has produced today's economic crisis. I opposed the repeal of Glass-Stiegel, which has made the problem so much worse. 
   The boy geniuses on Wall Street do not deserve to be rescued. But if they fall off their perches at the top of the economic ladder, they will crush innocent people far down that ladder on lower rungs. 
   Sometimes in life, if we are responsible, we have to clean up not just the messes that we have created but the messes that others have created as well. This is one of those times. This package will not prevent a severe recession.

   Mr. OBEY. I thank the gentlewoman for the time. 
   I simply cannot believe that Paul is gone. I first got to know him when we both served on a task force to rewrite the code of ethics in the nineties. That was not an easy job. Paul's performance was solid. It was thoughtful. In all the time that we discussed those issues before we brought our recommendations to the floor, I never saw him for one moment raise a partisan angle on any ethics question, and I never saw him question anyone else's motives. 
   What I did see was a man who understood that ethics is important, and yet because it involves the rules of the House, it can also be exceedingly complicated. 
   I never saw Paul take a single cheap shot in all the time that he served on that committee. That is one of the reasons that he became one of my favorite Republicans in this place, because there are very few people on either side of the aisle who aren't willing to take a cheap shot at the other side, even if it results in damage to the institution. That's where Paul drew the line. 
   He didn't mind seeking partisan advantage. That's what all of us try to do from time to time. But what he always tried to do, in my judgment, was to seek whatever advantage he saw without taking advantage of the institution at the same time. That's an important line to draw in an institution like this. 
   I think we can all be grateful for the job that Paul did for as long as God allowed him to do it. I simply cannot believe he is gone. 
   I extend my sincere regrets and best wishes to his family and all the members of the Ohio delegation.

   Mr. OBEY. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Chairman, as we all know, we have been mired in a god-awful war in Iraq for almost 5 years. What bothers me most about it, except for the deaths that occur on a daily basis, what bothers me most about it is that there is virtually no sense of shared sacrifice in this country in dealing with that war. 
   The only people who are being asked to sacrifice are military families, and they are being asked to sacrifice again and again and again. They are being sent back to Iraq and to Afghanistan again, again, and again. Not much sacrifice is being asked of anybody else. 
   We hear politicians prattle about the need to stand behind the troops. You betcha, we certainly should.  
   But we need to stand behind the troops not just when the bands are playing. We need to stand by those troops when they come home, and they are injured, and they are sick, or they may have lost their job, or they may have lost their spouse; and that's what this bill tries to do. 
   I think we need to put in context how we got here. It has been a struggle to see to it that we have adequate funding in veterans medical care programs. 
   Two years ago, on this side of the aisle, we were given information from people within the Veterans Administration that their veterans health care budget was going to fall $2 billion short. We tried to put that money in the budget. We were then in the minority. We were blocked by the majority then, except for one fellow. The Republican chairman of the Veterans' Committee sided with us, he agreed with us that we needed that $2 billion in additional money. 
   What happened to him? Not only did the then-majority party leadership fire him as chairman, they took him completely off the committee because he told the truth. We finally got that money, but we had to get a double hernia to finally pry that money out of the administration. 
   Then we had, as you know, the budget process collapse last year, and no domestic appropriation bills were passed by the then-majority party. In fact, this very bill, the Military Construction bill, was held up in the Senate by two Members of the Republican Party who put a hold on it because they didn't like certain earmarks that were on the bill. 
   So the bill never passed. When we took the majority, the very first thing we did was to make veterans health care a number one priority, and we added over $4 billion to that account, made it the number one priority. Then we added additional funding of over $3 billion in the Iraqi supplemental, and now we have added this money today to make this the largest increase for veterans health care in the history of the country. 
   When we did that, the White House announced it was going to veto the bill. Now, finally, they have had a St. Paul conversion on the road to Damascus. I welcome the White House on board the bandwagon. 
   But as Golda Meir said to Anwar Sadat when he finally came to Jerusalem a long time ago: ``What took you so long?'' I am glad the President has finally changed his view. 
   But the President continues to say, ``Well, now, I may not veto the bill, but you have got to have offsets. You have to find compensating savings.'' 
   Why do we single veterans out for that requirement? There were no offsets that the President required when he decided that this year we were going to spend $57 billion to provide tax cuts to people who make over $1 million a year and pay for it all with borrowed money. No offsets around then. Do you see them? I don't see any offsets in sight for that. 
   So what do we get? Finally, we get grudging acceptance from the White House that after they stuck us in this miserable war, and after they sit there with no clue about how to get out, at least they are now grudgingly going to recognize that we need the funds in this bill to deal with veterans medical care. 
   This bill ought to pass unanimously. It is far past the time that we put our votes where our mouths are in terms of long-term funding for veterans health care. I am proud of the fact that I provided the allocation to the subcommittee so that they could do that. 
   We are taking funding from $49.7 billion last year to $64 billion this year. Now, green eyeshade people may say, ``Oh, that's too much.'' You know what? In my view, nothing is too much for people who have risked everything on behalf of this country. Finally, over the last 2 years, we have been able to get funding up to begin to meet our obligations in this area. 
   I want to congratulate the gentleman from Texas for helping to lead the way, and I want to express my appreciation to people on both sides of the aisle who stood up for veterans when it was tough, including Mr. Smith of New Jersey, the former Republican chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, who paid a high price for his dedication to the needs of veterans, who paid a high price for putting truth ahead of the partisan wishes of the Bush administration.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman who just spoke has expressed a certain degree of unhappiness with the remarks that I made previously on the floor. I treasure his unhappiness. 
   The fact is that when Harry Truman was President, he was out giving a speech one day, and someone in the crowd hollered, ``Give 'em hell, Harry!'' And Truman responded, ``I don't give them hell. I just tell the truth and they think it's hell.'' 
   The fact is, I am very comfortable with the fact that the previous speaker did not like my comments, because I think maybe that means they hit home. The fact is the previous speaker was the person who was selected by the then Republican Party leadership to replace Mr. Smith after Mr. Smith was, in essence, fired from his job by the majority because he told the truth about the VA health care needs. 
   So I will be happy to endure the unhappiness of the gentleman with my comments anytime if we can use that unhappiness to get more money for people who sacrificed everything for this country.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I had not intended to speak, and I certainly am not directing my comments to the gentleman who just spoke, but I do want to make a few comments about the issue of so-called earmarks. 
   For the last 2 days, Member after Member in this institution have traipsed to the well or stood at the committee table and misdescribed and mischaracterized my proposals and the proposals that several other Democrats have made to reform the earmarking process. 
   I would simply say, I would have been greatly, if I had had any regard at all for those who were making those statements, I would have been upset. Let me simply say there are many Members--well, that is not true. There are some Members who have embarrassed this institution by the carelessness of their earmarks who came to the well and sounded off as so-called champions of reform. 
   There are Members who have come up to me and chastised me because I was insisting on a 50 percent reduction on earmarks; who have sent me letters asking for earmark after earmark after earmark. And there are a great many Members of this body who are not members of the Appropriations Committee who seem to have a memory lapse and forget that the bridge to nowhere, and most of the actions by Mr. Cunningham had nothing to do with the appropriations process; they occurred on legislation out of other committees. 
   I want to make clear, I hate the earmarking process. I absolutely detest it, not because earmarks are wrong, I think 90 percent of the earmarks attached by Members of both parties are perfectly legitimate, and they are a whole lot more on target than the misdirected spending of some of our bureaucrats and the misdirected analysis of OMB, and I know that from personal experience. 
   The reason I hate earmarks is because they suck everybody in. They suck them into the idea that we have to be ATM machines for our districts, and so they focus on the tiny portion of most bills that are earmarks instead of focusing on the policy that is represented by the legislation that we produce.     
   It's a whole lot more important to know whether we have adequately funded education or whether we have funded the right programs in education and refused to add funding to some of the worst programs in education than it is to know whether a Member got a $200,000 earmark for an after-school center. 
   I want the public to know all of that. Every earmark I've ever gotten I believe I've put out a press release and talked as loud as I could and tried to get as much attention to it as I could, because I believed in it. 
   But what I don't believe in is people who walk both sides of the street. I could tell you what they call them in my hometown. The letter begins with W, and I just want to say that I'm going to be very interested in seeing which Members ask for earmarks and which don't, and I'm going to be very interested in seeing which Members vote for the amendment that I intend to attach to every appropriation bill, which would call for a total elimination on earmarks. I want to see how many of you actually vote for it. I want to see how many of you do not give hypocrisy a bad name. 
   I thank the House for its attention.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 8 minutes. 
   Madam Speaker, the gentleman is a good friend of mine. And I don't mind his pulling my leg, but from way over there, it's a little bit of a stretch. 
   Let me simply recite a few facts. If we take a look at the past history to see how these bills have been handled in the past, the gentleman talks about having a separate military construction bill. The fact is, over the last 5 years, when our Republican friends controlled this House, on three occasions they tied the military construction bill to other bills. And on one occasion, they never managed to pass a military construction bill at all. Only once in the past 5 years did they pass a freestanding military construction bill. So, I will stack our record against theirs any time. 
   There is another substantial difference between us on that score. In the 2007 budget and in the bill before the Congress now, we've added $7 billion in additional funding for veterans health care, money which the administration itself opposed. So, I make no apology for what we have done on that score. 
   Let me also point out the gentleman is objecting to the possibility that we will combine the labor, health, education bill, the defense bill and the military construction bill into one piece. If we do that, that would mean that 90 percent of the dollars in the bill would be security related. The President has asked us to send him a defense bill and to send him a military construction bill. That is exactly what we would be doing. In addition to that, we would be sending the largest domestic bill, so that together we would be sending, in essence, 71 percent of the appropriation part of the budget down to the White House. I make no apology for that. 
   I would also point out that, while the gentleman has a newfound objection to omnibus appropriation bills, during the 12 years in which the Republicans controlled this body, 56 times they sent omnibus appropriation bills to the President for his signature.     
   During the Bush administration, they sent omnibus appropriation bills to the President 27 times. The President had no objection whatsoever when they came from a Republican Congress. I find it interesting that he now professes objection because we are doing what his Republican Party did in spades for so long. 
   In fact, last year, the other side, when they controlled this House, they avoided sending an omnibus appropriation bill to the President because on the domestic side of the ledger, they didn't bother to send him any at all. So we had to spend the first 6 weeks when we were in control of this body cleaning up last year's Republican business. 
   I would also point out, lest we take lectures from the administration and OMB, Mr. Nussle, who is the President's new budget director, he was chairman of the Budget Committee for 6 years. Since 1976 when the Budget Act was passed, Congress failed to pass a budget resolution four times. Three of those four times occurred when Mr. Nussle was chairman of the committee. So I don't think I am going to take any lectures about the newfound interest of the new budget director in having timely consideration of any matter related to the budget. 
   I would also point out that during Mr. Nussle's tenure of 6 years, the Republican Congress passed three omnibus appropriations and one omnibus CR. So it seems to me that this is a debate about, if not nothing, at least very little. I would simply say that what we ought to be looking at is not what kind of a ribbon we have on the package, but we ought to be taking a look at the contents of the package. And I make no apology whatsoever about the contents of this package. 
   Now, if we take a look at the President's statement, his veto pronouncement yesterday, he says that the Congress has wasted time voting on efforts to change direction in Iraq. I would suggest that the President has wasted 5 years of the country's influence by the way he has handled Iraq in the first place. The President objects to the fact that in all of the domestic appropriation bills, we are some $20 billion above his budget suggestion, about 2 percent. That 2 percent difference is the difference between having a President and having a King. And I would point out, he wants to spend 10 times that much money in Iraq in just 1 year. 
   The President says that Congress has gone it alone on SCHIP. I would suggest the President has gone it alone in Iraq. He has gone it alone without our allies. He is going it alone now without the support of the American people. So I would be careful, if I were the President, referring to someone ``going alone'' on anything. 
   I would also point out that the President says the Labor-H bill is bloated. Well, as a practical matter, if we were to pass the President's budget, we would be cutting vocational education by 50 percent. We would be accepting the idea that we ought to cut the National Institutes of Health grants by 1,100 grants over the past 2 years. We would be accepting the fact that we ought to allow No Child Left Behind to become a hollow shell in terms of financing. The President is, in fact, objecting to our increase for special education, an item which the Republican Party in this House took the lead on in putting in the bill in the first place. 
   So it seems to me the President, his priorities are not supported by the country. So he is falling back on a process argument. I don't think anybody is going to be especially impressed. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. I yield myself 1 minute. 
   The gentleman says that he finds this a precedent. I repeat, we are doing with Military Construction what the Republicans did in 4 of the last 5 years, considering Military Construction in association with other bills. I do welcome, however, the newfound expression of support for veterans by the now minority party. Over the last 2 years, we had to drag them kicking and screaming into voting for higher funding for budgets for veterans' health care than their own President wanted. In fact, when their committee chairman agreed with us 2 years ago that we needed to add a billion dollars to veterans' health care, they responded by removing that committee chairman from the committee because he wasn't following the party line. 
   I don't think veterans will have much trouble determining who has been on their side the last 5 years and who hasn't. 
   With that, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Israel).

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   Madam Speaker, there was an old comedian who used to say: When somebody says it's not about the money, it's about the money. When the gentleman says it isn't about the Labor, Health and Education bill, it's about the Labor, Health and Education bill. 
   The gentleman objects to the fact that we are doing what has been done in this institution for many years. We are taking the bills that are finished in both Houses at this time and we are trying to get them to the President in the fastest possible way. And the way to do that is to send them down together. 
   Now, the President wants to cherry-pick. He wants to pick and choose. He said you have got to send me 11 separate bills. He didn't send us 11 separate bills. The President sends us one omnibus budget. He put all the departments together in one document and sent them down to us. We are sending him back whatever proposals we can put together in the fastest possible time. 
   Madam Speaker, he says that the Labor-Health bill is bloated. Well, let me compare it to the President's budget. The President says that he is the ``great decider'' and that he is going to decide how much money is going to be in this bill and we have got to live within that limit or else he's going to veto anything else we send him. If we live under the President's budget, we would cut vocational education by 50 percent. Anybody think that is a good idea? If we live under the President's budget, we would eliminate all student aid but Work-Study and Pell Grants. Anybody here really believe that is a good idea? 
   In all my years in Congress, I never heard anybody say: Obey, why don't you guys get together and cut cancer research. Yet, that is what this previous Republican Congress and the President have done the last 2 years; they have cut 1,100 grants out of the National Institutes of Health, medical research grants. If you want to live under the President's budget on law enforcement, we would cut what the committee has in its bill by one-third. The President wants us to cut handicapped kids' education by $300 million. Mr. Walsh, the ranking Republican member of the Labor-Health Subcommittee, led the objection to that, and in fact persuaded the committee to put a higher number in the bill than I had put in in the chairman's mark; yet the President says we ought to follow his budget for Labor-Health. If we do, we will cut rural health by 54 percent. 
   He also wants us down the line to cut the Clean Water Revolving Fund by 37 percent. He wants us to cut disabled housing assistance by 47 percent. He has ordered his Secretary of Veterans Affairs to send us a letter indicating that they don't want the $4 billion that we have added to veterans health care. 
   So you don't think this is about priorities? You bet you, it's about priorities. I submit to you, the teachers of this country, the school kids of this country, the parents of this country, and the veterans aren't going to be fooled. Veterans aren't going to be very thrilled if you take care of their needs so long as they are in Iraq, but the minute they get home you forget the help their kid's need to get an education, you forget the help their wife's needs or husband's needs if they run into medical problems. 
   Veterans are whole people, just like everybody else. This Congress has an obligation to meet all of their needs, not just their needs so long as they are wearing the uniform and then forget them once they take it off. That is not the American way. It shouldn't be the Congress's way. That is why we are proceeding as we are proceeding.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   I yield myself the time simply to respond to something said by the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Wicker). Mr. Wicker implied that the delay that took place in bringing this to the floor today was because of supposedly some turmoil about how this bill was packaged. 
   In fact, as the gentleman from New York (Mr. Walsh) will tell you, the reason for the delay is because I spent all day defending two Republican amendments to this bill that the Senate wanted to reject. And until I got agreement to quit horsing around with those amendments, I refused to bring this bill to the floor. 
   And now I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the remaining time. 
   Let me state once more that I find somewhat disingenuous concerns expressed about the so-called delay that this process will provide for veterans health care. I would like to know where that same concern was when last year the now-minority party never even passed a Military Construction bill. Last year, they completed their session, they walked out of town, shut the doors and said good-bye, and they never passed any bill whatsoever to provide veterans health care. 
   So we took over in January, and the very first action we took was to clean up that mess and add over $3 billion to veterans health care. That was our top priority. And then we followed it up in the regular appropriation bill by adding again more than $3 billion. So I will take a backseat to no one in terms of our expression of concern for veterans. 
   But let me say, we're not just going to take care of veterans as long as they wear the uniform. We're also going to try to take care of their kids' needs for a decent college education. We're going to try to take care of their families' needs in terms of medical research. We're going to try to take care of their housing needs. We're going to try to take care to see that there's decent law enforcement so they can live in communities where kids can actually grow up into adulthood. As the gentleman from Ohio said, we're going to treat veterans as a whole person. That's the purpose of trying to pass all of these bills. 
   Let me simply say I think these bills have been bipartisan. The Labor-Health-Education bill, one of the speakers indicated that it was the most contentious bill on the floor. We got 53 Republican votes for that bill. I hardly think that we would have done that if it had been a partisan product. In fact, if you average all of the appropriation bills that we passed in this House, we got 65 Republican votes on average for every appropriation bill that passed. That means that we passed these bills on average by exactly two-thirds, which is exactly what it takes to override a Presidential veto. 
   Now we're simply trying to get these bills to the President as fast as we can and in a way which does not enable him to have an easy time of cherry-picking. That's what we're trying to do. 
   I sat down with the President's budget director, Mr. Nussle, and I said, Look, why don't we right now, even while the Senate is working, sit down and try to work out a bipartisan compromise for all these bills? He said, Dave, I'm new at the job, but he said, so far I don't find anybody in the White House that has the slightest bit of interest in compromise. I said, Well, that's too bad. I hope that changes. Please call me if it does. But meanwhile, if the President wants to veto something, why don't we at least sit down and try to figure out which bills he wants to veto so maybe we can agree on which ones to send him first. I got no takers on that either. 
   So we're proceeding the way we're proceeding because we're playing off what the President of the United States has said and done, and so far all we've heard is my way or no way. I don't believe that the Republican Members of this Congress came here to walk in lock step, and certainly we didn't on this side of the aisle. We will find out as the process unravels. 
   And so with that, I would simply urge that we support this motion. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. All right. We'll try to do the same. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Let me simply say, Madam Speaker, that what the gentleman is saying is that he wants to prevent us from doing something on this bill which his party did 56 times in the time that they controlled this House over the past 12 years, and I don't find that especially persuasive. 
   He also wants to prevent us from producing more than one bill at a time, and yet the President signed omnibus appropriation bills 27 times since he's been President, when they came from his own party. Now, because one might come from the Democratic Party, he wants to make a Federal case out of it. I don't think people are going to be very impressed with that either. 
   I find it very interesting that out of all of the motions that the minority could have offered, they haven't offered a single motion, and nothing in this motion today would in any way reduce by one dime any of the funds that we appropriated in the Labor-Health-Education bill. They argue that the bill is bloated, and yet when we give them an opportunity to offer motions to reduce spending for any specific item they don't take advantage of it. 
   That is exactly the same experience we had when the subcommittee considered the bill, and in fact, virtually every Republican motion and every Republican speech was on behalf of an effort to increase funding for a number of items, whether it be vocational education, which I agree with, or whether it be Pell Grants or whether it be special education. 
   So I find it interesting that after all of that rhetoric about so-called bloated funding for this bill they choose to argue an arcane process issue. 
   All they're really saying is, when you consider Labor-Health, don't even think of moving forward with Military Construction, don't even think of moving forward with Defense, don't even think of addressing the problem of California wildfires, don't even think of adding additional funding for MRAPs. Well, if they're comfortable with that, fine. I don't think we ought to let procedural theology get in the way of doing what's needed for American families and American veterans and American fighting men and women. 
   So, with that, I would simply urge a ``no'' vote on the motion. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Madam Speaker, I simply want to repeat what the gentleman from Ohio said earlier. We often see politicians try to wrap themselves in the flag, and we often try to see politicians pose for holy pictures every time the issue of veterans comes up. And America's very good at saluting veterans and playing the band when they go off to war. We haven't been as good in dealing with their problems after they come home. 
   And so what we intend to do in the Military Construction bill, in the Defense bill, in the Labor-Health bill, and in a number of other appropriation bills is we intend to deal with all of the problems faced by veterans and their families and other families in this country. 
   When veterans come home, they aren't just worried about whether or not they're going to get veterans health care. They also want to know whether the kids are going to be able to go to decent schools, taught by qualified teachers in decent classrooms. So we are going to be trying to see to it that programs such as title I and handicapped education are much more adequately funded than they would be under the President's budget. 
   Impact Aid, that directly affects many military families. We're trying to make sure that we do a better job funding that program than the President did in his budget. 
   Medical research, believe it or not, veterans need the results of medical research just as much as and probably more so than many other Americans. We're going to see to it, in our bill, that we don't experience a cutback of 1,100 grants in military research around the country. 
   I would suggest that this motion simply says that the new minority does not want us to do something which they did 56 times when they ran this House, namely, combine appropriation bills for the purpose either of efficiency or to strengthen our capacity to meet our obligations around the horn. 
   I also think something else is going on. Under the budget rules of the House, the President does not have the right to veto a budget resolution; he only has the right to veto appropriation bills. But what he is trying to do, by asserting that he, and he alone, will determine what the overall number is for appropriations, he is trying to indirectly position himself so he can veto a budget resolution. He's never had that power. The Congress never gave him that power, and the Constitution certainly doesn't. 
   So I would suggest that one of the probably unintended consequences of the motion of the gentleman from California is that it would, inadvertently, transfer additional power to the executive branch. I don't think that's wise. 
   Having said all of that, I want to make one more point. I know the gentleman from Florida would never want to misstate or misquote any other Member, but I was somewhat stunned to hear him suggest that I have said that we must pass these appropriation bills singly. In fact, I have said many times on this floor just the opposite. 
   I've said that, unlike the previous chairman, who was extremely concerned about passing each of these bills separately, that while I would prefer to do it that way, I would be happy, if that didn't work, to pass them in minibuses or omnibuses or any other kind of bus you can find, so long as we deliver the goods, and so long as the goods are the right goods for the American people. And that's the philosophy I have. 
   So I would simply suggest, we've had more debate than I'd expected today on procedural niceties. I would suggest that we simply recognize that we've got an obligation to get on with completing our appropriations business. This is the most effective way we can do it. 
   All three of these bills passed the House on a bipartisan basis, and I have no reason to expect that they won't do the same when they come back from conference. 
   I do want to say that I agree with not all, but some of the comments made about our esteemed colleagues in the other body, but that's a discussion for another day. 
   And with that, if the gentleman has one remaining speaker, then I'm prepared to yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to follow through on the comments made by the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee. And I think for Members who aren't here, which is approximately 90 percent of the body, for Members who are watching in their offices or perhaps not watching at all, I should make clear what is happening here and what is not happening here. 
   We are not having a real debate on a real bill. What is happening is a debate, it is really ``filibuster by amendment.'' It has been made quite clear by the opposition leadership that the opposition  party intends to bring this institution to a halt today. And the way they intend to do that is by offering amendment after amendment after amendment. There are about 120 amendments pending. And as the gentleman from North Carolina has indicated, we are trying to responsibly deal with a budget from an administration of the other party. 
   The easiest thing in the world for us to do would be for us to gut and slash the administrative accounts in the bill for any department, because, after all, the administration is Republican and we are Democratic. But what we have tried to do instead is to meet our responsibilities. We tried to tie administrative budget levels to the actual needs of the agencies, and we have tried to deal with those agencies in a bipartisan manner. 
   But we have a series of amendments not taking any meaningful reductions out of these agency budgets. We have a series of very tiny nicks being taken out of these budgets. And these amendments, in my judgement, are designed more to take up the time of this body than they are to produce a different financial result. And as the gentleman from North Carolina indicates, we have been, for the last 2 hours, trying to defend an administrative budget for the other party's administration. 
   Now, we may not be the smartest folks in the world, but we haven't exactly fallen off a turnip truck. And I also think that we are not exactly cut out to be suckers. And so, I don't think that we can allow our friends on the other side of the aisle to assume that we will simply serve as punching bags, and that we will simply stand here continuing to defend administration operation accounts. 
   And so, as far as I am concerned, if the administration and if the minority party's leadership can't control their own Members in terms of these budgetary attacks on these agencies, then who are we to stand in the way? So, I think what happens to these administrative levels will be pretty much up to the administration's own party. It will be very interesting to watch.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Let me, once again, not that anyone on the other side of the aisle is interested in listening to facts, but let me, once again, cite what the facts are. We keep hearing this mythical, robotic claim from the other side of the aisle that somehow these earmarks are going to be dropped in in conference. 
   Well, it is not our fault that you couldn't finish the budget last year and we had to finish your work. It is not our fault that you couldn't finish the work on the Iraqi bill for 2007, so we had to spend the last 3 months cleaning up your mess on that one.

   Mr. OBEY. I will not yield until I finish my statement. I would appreciate the same courtesy I've shown you. 
   Now, let me point out, the process that they've invented is not one that we have requested. What we have said is that, because of the urgency of substance, we decided we were going to leave pork projects behind for the moment. And what we've decided instead was to focus on oversight and producing substantive bills. 
   We've now also said that in order to assure that there is review of every project, that we are going to be filing, before the August recess, every single earmark that we expect to place in the appropriation bills. And Members will then have over 30 days to look at the process. They can complain about any earmark they want. 
   We are going to ask that it be open, not hidden, behind-the-scenes telephone calls. We're going to ask that people file in writing if they have an objection. We're going to ask the sponsor of the amendment to then respond in writing so that we can make a decent judgment about those earmarks. 
   Now, let me make another point. For people who are squawking about the fact that these earmarks aren't going to be in the bill originally, the Republicans did the same thing on the Labor-H bill in 1998, in 1999, in 2002, in 2004, in 2005. They did not have any earmarks in the Labor-Health-Education bill until the bill was in conference. The only difference was those earmarks were never reviewed ahead of time. These will be. Those earmarks were never in public view. These will be. 
   They also did the same thing in 2002 and 2003 when they couldn't even get a Labor-H bill through the House, and so they went directly to conference in an omnibus. 
   The difference between our process and the one they've been following is that there will be an opportunity ahead of time to know who has asked for these earmarks, and you'll be able to ask questions about it. 
   And I would assume that the leadership of both parties would take a look at the project list for both parties so that they protect this institution from the outrageous scandals that we had because of their mismanagement when they were running the show. 
   And I will stack my record on congressional reform against anybody on that side of the aisle any time. My entire career here has been defined by reform, and I don't intend to change it now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I am opposed to both the underlying amendment and the substitute amendment, and let me tell you why. I think it's important to put that amendment in context. 
   We had crocodile tears expressed here about the number of earmarks and what will happen to earmarks. Let me cite the record. 
   In 1994, the last year when Democrats controlled the House, earmarks were primarily concentrated in four appropriation bills. They were project-oriented bills like military construction, energy and water, Interior and general government. This Homeland Security bill had not even come to pass yet because it was before 9/11. 
   In the Labor-Health-Education appropriation bill the last year that the Democrats controlled, we had zero earmarks. The last year under Republican control that we had earmarks in the Labor-H bill, we had over 3,000. 
   In the Transportation bill, the authorizing bill, from 1956 through 1995, we had 20 separate highway bills pass this House containing a total of 739 earmarks. Do you know how many we had, Mr. Chairman, in 2005 under Republican control in just one bill? Five thousand.     
   Then we all remember the infamous 3-hour vote on Medicare part D. 
   I would ask my colleagues on this side of the aisle to keep this civil. If the other side wants to turn it into a circus, fine, but I think we ought to behave. 
   Let me say, we remember Medicare part D when the Republican leadership kept the vote open for 3 hours. Meanwhile, the newspaper stories told of how they promised earmarks in the transportation bill in return for votes on Medicare part D. 
   Last year, we had three major scandals. We had the Cunningham affair, then we had the bridge-to-nowhere, which caused a lot of heartburn around the country; and now, just recently, we have another story suggesting that the committee chairman then, the gentleman from Alaska, inserted a project for Florida. 
   Under Republican rules, as they existed then, nobody knew about any of that until about 2 years after the fact. Under the proposal that we are proposing for earmarks, you would know about that 30 days before they went into effect. That is a huge difference. 
   Let me also point out, in 1994, the four biggest appropriation bills that's Commerce-Justice, Labor, Transportation and VA-HUD. The last year the Democrats controlled the House, in 1994, the four major appropriations bills, Commerce-Justice, Labor-Health, Transportation and VA, we had a total of 764 earmarks. Those same bills, just one fiscal year ago, had 8,600 earmarks. 
   With all due respect, I don't want to hear any crocodile tears on the other side of the aisle with respect to the issue of earmarks. They have exploded under their operation of this House, not under ours. 
   In terms of what's going on tonight, I should make quite clear that the gentleman from California (Mr. Lewis) told me in January that the minority party would give us no procedural cooperation because they didn't like the way we had handled a continuing resolution. They wanted us to have a straight CR rather than thinking our way through priorities. Now they have simply moved on to another excuse. 
   So I would simply say, whether you vote for the underlying amendment or for the amendment to the amendment, these are not real amendments. It is clear to me that they have only one purpose, to bring this House to a halt, and they are looking for any excuse they can find. 
   They got a mighty weak one, but we are going to stay here until the job is done. This is the people's business. We are not going to be diverted by their trying to play Trivial Pursuit on this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to say that I think this bill being brought forth today is an excellent bill. It will strengthen America's security, and every Member interested in doing that ought to vote for it. 
   The four security-related appropriation bills which we will bring to the floor, Military Construction, Homeland Security, State/Foreign Operations and Defense, will come in at a level about $2 billion above the President's request. This is a key bill in doing that. 
   I do want to make a few comments about what I understand was said while I was off the floor a few minutes ago with respect to earmarks. Let us trace what the facts are. The last time the Democrats controlled the appropriations process, I was chairman of the Appropriations Committee. In those days, earmarking was focused on about four subcommittees. There were no earmarks whatsoever in the Labor-Health-Education bill the year that I was chairman. Two years ago, there were over 3,000 when the Republicans were running the show. 
   When we took over the Congress last year, the Republicans had not passed a single appropriation bill on the domestic side of the ledger. So we had to complete their work for them. And one of the ways we did that was to put a moratorium on all earmarks for the year. We promised at the time that we would try to resurrect the process, provided that we had a process that was more transparent. 
   Now, I understand someone from the other side claimed that we were going to airdrop these earmarks into the conference with no notice. Not so. What we plan to do is the following. And let me say, we didn't not preclude earmarks by choice. The simple fact is that because we had to deal with last year's Republican budget, because we had to deal with the Iraq controversy which consumed the next 3 months of staff time, because we were under subpoena by the San Diego U.S. Attorney to turn over papers related to Republican shenanigans that occurred last year, we did not have the staff time to focus on the substance of the bills for this year or earmarks. And we finally decided that we need to keep the bills moving, even if that meant that we would have to play catchup later with the earmarks. 
   So what we are going to do is as soon as the staff can prepare them, and we estimate it will take at least 4 to 5 weeks to screen all of those earmarks, we will submit and put in the Congressional Record a description of virtually every earmark that we intend to try to include in conference reports. We will then ask every Member to review those projects. If they have questions, raise questions about them, we will then ask the sponsor of the earmark to respond in writing, so that the person responsible for the request is the person who has to explain to the House what is going on. And then we will use our judgment about what makes sense. If the House thinks that we have got projects in there that shouldn't be in there, they can vote against the bill. 
   But let me point out there is a big difference between what we are doing  and the existing Republican process. It took 2 years after the fact to find out what Duke Cunningham was asking for. The fact is under our process, you will know 30 days ahead of time. It took us more than a year to find out about the Florida road that was evidently inserted in the highway bill by a Republican Member of this House from another State.     
   That can't happen in our process. Under our process, you will have 30 days to review what they request. That is a sweeping reform in comparison to the absolute, behind-the-scenes operation that existed when the Republicans controlled this House.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, the comments of the previous speaker simply indicate how little she understands about the appropriations process. 
   The fact is that the Iraqi bill we had to deal with was last year's supplemental request. Last year's, not this year's, so we had to clean up your mess on the entire domestic budget; and we had to clean up your mess on Iraq before we could move on our business. 
   The first week we have been able to turn to our agenda is this week. We have spent the last 5 months cleaning up your spilled milk.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I would like, if I could, in a calm atmosphere to simply walk Members of the House through some of the facts so that they understand exactly what it takes for the staff to prepare earmarks for consideration by the Congress. 
   Yesterday, we were told in the Appropriations Committee by our Republican friends, at least by some of them, they would ask me, what is the hurry? Why can't you slow down these bills until you can attach the earmarks? Today, our colleague from Georgia, Mr. Price, said on the floor, these bills are already 1 month late, implying that the Republicans last year were able to move the bills to the floor faster. 
   That is right. They did. 
   I want Members to understand why if we started tonight it would take a good 3 to 4 weeks to prepare all of the earmarks that Members are requesting. Let me explain why. 
   Our staff doesn't just have to wade through these requests. Some of these requests that we receive propose to place earmarks on programs such as the National Institutes of Health, for instance, which have never before been earmarked, earmarks which the Members on both side of the aisle strongly oppose. So we have to work with those Members to reshape those earmarks. 
   Some requests come in, but they are duplicative. You may have four or five Members propose the same earmark, but they describe it differently, and the staff has to wade through and reconcile them so they understand it is really the same item. 
   Some earmarks that are requested fail to make clear which programs the requested funds are supposed to come from, so we have to plug in with Members to get answers to that. 
   Some requests ask that funds that are earmarked within a specific program be used for purposes which are not authorized by the underlying authorization, so again we have to go back to those Members and review those projects and rework them so that they are eligible. 
   That is why it is an immense job for the staff to review, especially when we have 32,000 requests. 
   There is another reason why we have lagged on earmarks, and that is because we chose to do substance over worrying about pork. What we did, after almost 5 years of virtually no oversight by this Congress, we chose to intensify oversight and devote our staff time and Member time to that, rather than people's boodle. As a result, we held 224 hearings, as opposed to 117 last year under the Republican regime. 
   That is why we have come to the House with the proposition to make certain that we do have transparency, that we will have names attached to every earmark whenever they appear in the process, and we are following a process which has been engaged in by the majority party on the major domestic appropriation bills of each year, and the majority party engaged in this same process for 7 out of the last 12 years. The only difference is, they didn't provide 30 days' notice before those bills went to conference with those earmarks, and our process would. 
   I know it is late in the evening and I know that Members like to score partisan points, but the fact is, Members, especially those who are not on the Appropriations Committee, are owed the courtesy of at least understanding what it is that the staff has to go through in order to prepare earmarks for everybody. 
   Now, I don't have a Republican list of earmarks.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his courtesy. 
   Mr. Chairman, let me simply say, I don't have any idea what earmarks our Republican friends would want to see included in, for instance, the Labor-Health-Education bill. 
   But the fact is, there is one other protection that we want to have in our process: Unlike the past, when some Appropriation subcommittees simply said Democrats, you look at yours, Republicans look at yours, and then do whatever you want, what we are going to try to do is to make certain that you get to see ours and we get to see yours so that we have that safety valve built into the system. That will protect the taxpayer and that will protect the reputation of this institution, and I think Members know it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would urge Members to remember that our job tonight, after all, is to try to pass a Homeland Security bill, which has traditionally been virtually without earmarks.  
   Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for the time and I thank the gentleman for his courtesy.

   Let me point out there is one critical difference between last year and tonight: Last year, you agreed that we would shut down at 10 o'clock because we agreed to put time limits on all of the amendments so we could finish the bills. 
   I cooperated procedurally so that you could move every single bill through the House, even though I disagreed with some of them. 
   The key was that we each got something. You got to finish the bills, and we agreed that because we were setting time limits on amendments, that, therefore, there would be no need to work in the evening. You haven't been willing to agree to time limits.

   Our job is to try to develop a process. It is not a pro forma process of review but one that is actually effective. 
   The gentleman has offered a lot of motions in the past 2 years to strike earmarks. Could I ask him how many of them have been successful?

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I agree we need accountability. And I want to simply say I don't regard your failure to pass any of your amendments as a personal failure on your part. 
   Mr. Chairman, I think the gentleman has done his dead level best. The problem is that the system is not conducive to producing real results because, as the gentleman himself has said on this House floor, Members look at these motions and they say, I am not going to vote for the Flake amendment because I have got earmarks hanging out there and I don't want to have my endangered. The result has been that nothing has happened. That is why we have had some of the problems we have had. We could have an honest disagreement about what will be the best system, but I would hope that the gentleman would recognize, even though he might disagree with it, it is an honest effort to develop a system which is far more forthcoming than the one we have had in the past. 
   And I would simply point out that while the majority leader indicated that he had adopted transparency proposals last year, they conveniently arranged them so that they didn't apply to any of the appropriation bills that they passed last year. That is not the gentleman's fault. But it is the responsibility of the minority leader. 
   I thank the gentleman for the time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, as the gentleman from California pointed out, we have now probably expended in terms of salaries for the clerks, the cost of air conditioning for the Chamber, the cost of lights for the Chamber, we have probably now expended more money than would be saved by this $50,000 amendment; and so what I think this amendment is about is something very different than in fact we are hearing from our friends. 
   What I think this is about is that, last year, if you take a look at the appropriation bills that have been considered so far this year, last year, approximately 86 hours were spent debating those bills. This year, we have had about 152 hours expended debating the same bills. Why is that? 
   Last year, there were 144 amendments offered by those on this side of the aisle then in the minority. This year, the now minority has offered 339 amendments. So it is obvious to me what is going on. 
   I don't think this debate is at all about either fiscal responsibility or the fact that the amendment purports to save $50,000. This is simply a device which allows the sponsors and the supporters to tie up the time of the House and eventually deny this House the ability to get its work done before it leaves for the August recess. That is what this is about. And all of the rhetoric to the contrary notwithstanding, I think every Member of the House knows that is what it is about. 
   From the beginning, it has been apparent that there are a small number of Members on the other side of the aisle who would prefer to engage in filibuster by amendment, no matter what that means in terms of the quality of the debate, no matter what that means in terms of the inconvenience to Members, and no matter what that means in terms of the ability of this House to finish its business in a timely fashion. 
   So let me simply say we will hear a lot of rhetoric tonight about fiscal responsibility. Keep in mind what the real debate is, and we will give all of that rhetoric the attention that it deserves, which is very little.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I think it is important for Members on both sides of the aisle to understand what is going to transpire here. This is a filibuster masquerading as an amendment. This amendment cuts $50,000, a tiny, tiny symbolic sum, from the administrative account in question. But, as I see it, this is not a real amendment. 
   What it means is that it simply affords those who offer it, under the guise of talking about spending, to really engage in delay and delay and delay. Because their goal, if they can, is to not have the House finish its appropriations business. Their goal, also, if they can, is to delay the SCHIP bill from coming to the floor and finally being passed by the House. 
   So after we have seen this administration and their allies in this House borrow $1.2 trillion to pay for tax cuts and after we have seen them borrow another $600 billion to finance that misbegotten war in Iraq, now they pretend that they are contributing to the public good by offering to cut spending by $50,000; not $50 billion, but $50,000. 
   This is, in plain language, a filibuster. It is the first of many amendments that are being offered by people who are so opposed to the SCHIP proposition, which will be before us tomorrow, that they would prefer to defend $50 billion in tax cuts for people making $1 million a year than they would to see 5 million more kids covered by health insurance in this country. That is really what is afoot here. 
   Mr. Chairman, I find myself only mildly amused, because the subject really is serious. I find myself only mildly amused by the fact that, 3 days ago, we had the President announce another large, massive increase in foreign aid which he wants us to provide yet this year. 
   We also now increasingly are coming to understand that the President will be asking for an extension of the surge in Iraq, which will require him to ask the Congress to spend an extra $25 billion to $30 billion above and beyond $140 billion he is planning to ask for in the supplemental already for this year for Iraq. So, yet, we are here mired today in this let's-pretend Potemkin debate over $50,000. 
   We don't, on this side of the aisle, intend to get bogged down; at least, we don't intend to contribute to the bogging down. So we will let them drone on, drone on and drone on with their Lilliputian amendments. 
   Meanwhile, we recognize what is happening: If the other side wants to delay the people's business for a while, all that means is that, in the end, our colleagues won't be going home on Friday, they won't be going home on Saturday, and we will still be having Sunday dinner together. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I happen to agree with the Supreme Court decision on the gun issue. I've always felt that those who claimed that there was not an individual protection in the second amendment for gun owners were oddly mistaken. But the issue facing us today is not about guns. It's about the Federal relationship with local communities. 
   The first fight I ever had on this floor was when Bob Giaimo and I pried loose the money for the District subway when the Appropriations Committee was trying to dictate local transportation policy. I didn't like bullying then, and I don't like it now. 
   That's why, since that time, I've generally voted ``present'' whenever the Congress tries to play city council and dictate local business. I do that as a protest against Congress acting like we're elected city councilmen. 
   Most Members of this Congress would fight to preserve local authority for their own communities, but they don't hesitate to destroy it when the District of Columbia's around. Well, I, for one, was not elected to be a D.C. city councilman. I'm not paid to be a D.C. city councilman. If I'm expected to vote on their issues, I want to know where is my check from the District government? 
   If Members of this body want to decide D.C. policy instead of running for the Congress, they ought to run for the district council, and they ought to cut their paychecks to the District council level. That's what I believe, and that's why I will vote ``present'' on the underlying bill, and I will vote ``present'' on any amendment thereto as a protest to Congress idiotically playing city council on this or any other issue.

He claims that this is a problem that was created during the Democratic control of this House. In fact, the program under discussion, the authorization expired under control of the Republican Party. Then, at the request of a good many Members, including you, I voluntarily agreed to extend that program on an appropriation bill, even though the authorization had expired. But I said at that time that he needed to understand that this would be a temporary extension, and because this matter was not under the jurisdiction of our committee, he needed to resolve this problem in the authorizing committee, the Agriculture Committee. And that is still where it belongs.

   Mr. OBEY. The fact is that the Appropriations Committee is in a no-win situation. Every time we try to bring a bill out to extend an authorization, we get squawks from the membership because we are exceeding our jurisdiction. Then if we don't bring a bill out, we get squawks for not stepping into an area where we have no business treading.

   Mr. OBEY. After I have completed my statement, I would be happy to.  
   So what I would simply say is this: I gave the gentleman a year. I took money out of the appropriations portion of the pot to give the gentleman a year's grace. Now, if the gentleman voted against a freestanding authorization bill, as I understand, I think from the conversation that the gentleman apparently did, if the gentleman voted against that free-standing suspension bill, it is not the fault of my committee, and I don't have to step in and make up for somebody else's mistakes.

   Mr. OBEY. With all due respect, taking back my time, if the gentleman did, indeed, vote against the free-standing bill that would have corrected the problem, then, as far as I am concerned, he has no complaint with this committee. We are in the middle of serious economic problems. We are trying, as best we can, to find ways to counter the recession. 
   With all due respect, I don't want to get this committee into any more authorization fights than I have to, because I have got a long list of authorization issues that people have objected to when we have included authorization issues on appropriation matters, and you can bet that today there will be some squawks about the fact that we have done that.

   Mr. OBEY. If we had done that, the bill would not have been in compliance with the rules of the House. You could not have offered that amendment, because it would not have been in order. 
   I would suggest if you have got a problem under an authorization bill, take it to the committee that's supposed to handle it. Don't dump every dog and cat in an appropriation bill.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to propound a unanimous consent request in response to the comments that we had during consideration of the rule on this bill. We've had some of our friends on the minority side of the aisle indicate that they are disappointed that the Appropriations Committee did not provide funding for the western schools program, which is expired, and which is not under the jurisdiction of our committee. 
   In the interest of comity, I would like to respond to that concern by simply asking unanimous consent that the amendment that I have placed at the desk be considered as adopted. It would have the effect of resurrecting that western schools program for 1 year in the same manner in which it was being operated before it expired.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would simply like to have the Record show that we have tried to respond to concerns expressed on the minority side of the aisle, that the objection to allowing us to do that came from the minority side of the aisle. I regret that, but I guess there's not as much interest in comity as I had hoped today. Having said that, let me explain the bill before us. 
   I think both political parties are seriously misdescribing the economic crisis that we now find ourselves in. I do not believe that this crisis began on Wall Street. I think this crisis began right here in this Chamber. I think it began right here in this town, in the White House. And I think what is happening today is a logical extension of what has happened since the Reagan administration over 20 years ago. 
   The fact is that this Congress and previous and present Presidents have followed economic policies through the years which have resulted in the middle class--and what's called the underclass by some--being squeezed to the wall. Since 1980, the top 10 percent of American families has absorbed 80 percent of the increase in the national income. And in the last 8 years, the richest 10 percent of American families have absorbed 96 percent of all of the income growth in this country. That means the other 90 percent of American families have been struggling for table scraps, struggling to keep their head above water. And one of the ways that they've been doing that has been by borrowing. 
   There is a lot of talk about the increase in the Federal debt over the past decade, which has been over $1 trillion. But the fact is that mortgage debt alone in the private sector in this country has increased by almost $7 trillion at that same time. And at the same time that that huge increase in borrowing was occurring by families trying to stay above the water line, we also had a simultaneous, ill-advised deregulation of the financial sector of the economy. The umpire was, in fact, taken off the field, and as a result, Wall Street took advantage of that, invented all kinds of interesting and complicated instruments, and at the same time, there was very little regulation to protect little people who didn't know what they were getting into. And so, as a result, we've had trickle down economics being followed for 25 years, and now we are experiencing the trickle down consequences. We have, I think, a serious choice to make in this Chamber and in the other body over the next few days. And I hope we make the right choice. 
   All through this year this Congress has tried to do a number of things that would alleviate the squeeze on the middle class. To cite just some of our efforts, we passed the largest expansion of the GI Bill, education benefits, since that program started in 1945. We provided the largest veterans health care funding increase in modern history. We blocked the President's efforts to eliminate all student aid programs except Pell grant and work study. And we, instead, provided an increase in the Pell Grants of $750. And we passed legislation cutting the loan costs of student loans by 50 percent over the next 5 years, all to help middle class families send their kids to school. 
   We increased the minimum wage for the first time in a decade. We extended unemployment insurance benefits to help people who had run out of unemployment benefits and have still not been able to find a job. We provided additional funding to save the SCHIP program, to help keep needy kids on the health care payrolls of our various States. 
   We've provided funding to help States establish high-risk insurance pools----

   Mr. OBEY. I yield myself another 5 minutes. 
   To increase access for almost 200,000 people who did not have access to health care. We extended dental care programs for the poor by 50 percent. We passed all kinds of efforts to improve the lot of middle-income Americans. And we had a large dispute with the President of the United States over budget levels for programs in the health, education, science and social services area. The President objected to a number of those programs. He wanted to require Congress to impose $14 billion in cuts in those crucial programs, and he said we simply could not afford that money. But now we are being confronted with a Presidential request to deal with the Wall Street bailout, and that cost will be about 50 times as large as the cost of funding the programs that we've been trying to fund for a year. 
   Meanwhile, this economy is sagging. Jobs, income, sales, and industrial production have all gone down. We have lost 600,000 jobs. Twenty-seven percent more people are unemployed today than was the case just 6 months ago. And so we are bringing before the House today an effort to counter some of those problems. 
   We are trying to provide a major increase in investments in highways, bridges and airports to modernize our infrastructure and to provide well-paying construction jobs at the same time. 
   We are providing a significant increase in funding for construction jobs by helping local communities and States construct sewer and water systems. There is a $600 billion national backlog on that. 
   We are providing additional help to create jobs by moving ahead with flood control projects. 
   As far as schools are concerned, the GAO tells us we have a $112 billion backlog in maintenance, building safety, and technology upgrades for our schools. We're trying to provide a small amount of funding to help begin to take care of that. 
   On the energy front, we've had a theological debate about energy between the parties for the last several months. We are trying to provide some funding here for energy research programs which will create jobs in that area, and at the same time, we are trying to invest a significant amount of money in order to assure that our auto industry, as it converts to battery-driven, dual-technology automobiles, we're trying to make certain that those batteries are developed and produced in the United States. If we can accomplish that, it will be a large number of jobs that we keep here in the United States. 
   We also are trying to extend unemployment compensation benefits for an additional 7 weeks. And we are trying to help State budgets to make sure that States don't have to knock low-income children and low-income families off the health care rolls.     
   This is the main thrust of this legislation. We think it is long overdue. 
   And I would urge passage in the House. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hate to keep going over old ground, but in light of the gentleman's comments, I would like to present a slightly different interpretation of where we are. 
   The fact is that we have passed out of this body and we expect to have sent to the President this weekend the three foreign policy appropriation bills for the year, representing well over 60 percent of the discretionary funding in the budget. We have not sent him any of the domestic appropriations bills for one simple reason, because the White House declared them dead on arrival before they had ever been written. 
   The White House simply made quite clear that if we did not submit to their budget wishes and cut $14 billion out of education, out of health care, out of science, out of energy research and the like, if we didn't do that they would veto the bills. When we asked if they would sit down and talk about it and consider compromise, they indicated they had no interest. 
   It is clear to us that the President means what he says. He often does. So under those circumstances, we had a choice. We could either capitulate to the President's requirements that we cut everything from medical research at NIH to vocational education and the like, or we could say no, we are not going to accept those reductions; we will try to appeal to the public and let them choose. 
   So the public will choose by their selection of either Mr. Obama or Mr. McCain. I am sorry, it has been a long day. The fellow from Arizona. Anyway, the public will choose one or the other. And if they choose Mr. McCain, then they will get President Bush's domestic budget, and if they choose Mr. Obama, they will get something quite different. 
   So I think there is a very rational reason for our making this choice. The only other option would have been for us to scream at each other and argue with each other for 6 months, knowing that the bills were going nowhere because of the President's intent to veto the bills. 
   That, in essence, is why we find ourselves where we are on those domestic appropriation bills. 
   But this bill is a different issue. This bill relates not to yesterday's arguments, but to today's problems and tomorrow's solutions. What this bill represents is an effort to respond to the economic chaos that we have seen in this country for the past 8 months or more. It represents an effort. At a time when people are talking about doing a huge bailout for the financial system, we are trying to find discrete ways of making life a little less miserable for people who have been hit hard by the  consequences of the economic chaos that has swept over the country. 
   So we make no apology. In a year when we have lost 600,000 jobs, we make no apology for trying to help resurrect the possibility for some more good-paying jobs by adding to construction, to our infrastructure by way of airport and highway and transit development, by doing additional energy research, by doing additional cleanup of sewer and water, again, construction jobs that will mean a good many families will be seeing decent income again where they were not before. That is what this bill tries to do. 
   It is in fact a very modest proposal in terms of what most economists think will be necessary, but it is a whole lot better than doing nothing. 
   FDR warned a long time ago, he said, ``Better the occasional mistake of a government that cares than the constant omission of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.'' And that I think is the choice that faces us today. 
   As Franklin Roosevelt said a long time ago in his inaugural address, ``This country needs action; it needs action now.'' We are trying in a small way to provide that, along with the two other pieces that are now before this Congress, one being the continuing resolution, and the second being the disposition of the huge economy rescue project that the President has proposed. This is a key element in those efforts.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, this bill, more than any other, determines how willing we are to make the investment necessary to assure the future strength of this country and its working families. We strengthen the country when we strengthen our families. We strengthen our country when we invest in workers to have the most competitive workforce in the world. 
   The decisions we make in any one year are not decisive. But if we do not think in long term, if we do not recognize the kind of country we will be in 10 years, we will not make the investments necessary to prepare for that world and we will be shortchanging the future of every American. 
   Because he has chosen to put his desire to give $50 billion in tax breaks to those make $1 million a year, and his desire to spend $140 billion on Iraq ahead of those investments, the President has chosen to cut those investments by this bill by more than $7.5 billion in real terms. 
   This bill rejects most of those cuts because we cannot disinvest in the country's future without hurting national security and the future of every American family. Instead of cutting $7.5 billion, as the President requested, we eliminate or cut 41 programs, saving $1.1 billion. We then increase investments in critical programs by about $4.5 billion in real terms, or 2.8 percent over last year, after adjusting for inflation and population change. 
   Now, why do we do that? Because in 10 years there will be 27 million more Americans, 12 million more seniors needing health care, 2.7 million more kids in elementary and secondary school, 2.2 million more students in college, 11 million more Americans will be without health insurance, unless we wise up and wake up and change our policies. And within 7 years, half of the Nation's job growth will be in occupations requiring higher education skills. 
   To meet those challenges, with this bill we target modest increases to crucial high priority activities to attack deficits in worker training, deficits in health care, deficits in education access. 
   On a bipartisan basis, without a dissenting vote, we've provided $450 million above the President's inadequate request for Title I to help an additional 155,000 disadvantaged students. Instead of wiping out every student aid program except Pell and Work Study, we rejected the President's cuts and raised the maximum Pell Grant by $650 over the last year to help over 5 million students go to college. 
   We reversed the 3-year decline in Federal support for special education. Mr. Walsh, the ranking member of this subcommittee, has taken a leadership role in that regard. 
   We reversed the President's cuts in teacher training. We provided new after-school opportunities for 163,000 more students. 
   On health care, nobody has ever come up to me at home and said, ``OBEY, why don't you guys get your act together and cut cancer research?'' But that's exactly what Congress did the last 2 years, cutting NIH research grants by over 500 grants. Well, we've stopped that. 
   In January, we reversed the President's cuts and this bill adds another $1 billion above the President's request, which would again cut research grants. 
   We have also included a package of five initiatives to put health care within the reach of more than 2 million additional Americans; $200 million to expand access to health and dental care at community health centers, $75 million to help States expand health coverage for targeted populations, $50 million to help States provide affordable health insurance for 200,000 people who are medical high risks and cannot get insurance from the private market, $20 million to help trade impacted workers benefit from the Health Coverage Tax credit, and added funding to help Medicare beneficiaries to get health insurance counseling. 
   Because of high energy prices, we have added $880 million to the President's request for low income heating assistance, reversing half the cut Congress and the President made last year. 
   To discourage abortions, instead of lecturing, we provide a $1.4 billion package of incentives to provide real world help to women through expanded Head Start, child care, domestic violence programs, maternal and child health care, family planning and abstinence programs. 
   To help workers, we reverse the President's cuts in a range of workforce training programs. We also provide a $100 million increase above the President to help reduce Social Security claims backlogs and to keep more Social Security offices open. 
   Now the President claims that this bill amounts to runaway spending. Fact: From 1980 to today, domestic appropriations, as a percentage of total national income, have declined hugely. The President's budget would cut them to a level 48 percent below the 1980 level, and by 2012, to a level 57 percent below 1980. That's hardly runaway growth. That is a steady bleed of America's quality of life and America's future. 
   For the President to borrow $1.2 trillion to pay for tax cuts, and $600 billion to pay for Iraq, including another $140 billion next year, and then pretend that this modest 2 percent difference with him is the cause of fiscal irresponsibility is sheer nonsense, and many enlightened Republicans know it. 
   These investments are not just fiscally responsible, they are necessary for the future health and strength of the Nation. 
   One other point. We will today hear complaints about earmarks in this bill. Let us be clear, the last time Congress was in Democratic hands there were no earmarks in this bill. Under Republican rule, they exploded from zero to over 3,000. 
   This bill has cut back the dollar level for earmarks to half the level in the 2006 bill. Exactly two-tenths of 1 percent of the total funding in this bill go for congressionally directed earmarks. 
   And let me also point out that the amount of dollars in spending directed by the Congress is a tiny fraction of the amount directed by the Administration. First, for instance, the Administration in this bill requests specific earmarks, $10 million for Reach Out and Read, $10 million for Teach for America, $9 million for the Points of Light Foundation, $4.5 million for America's Promise, $1.7 million for the Mind and Body Institute, $1.4 million for the YMCA. 
   On top of that, in 2006 alone, the Health and Social Services Department directed spending of $1.9 billion through 21,000 contracts that were less than fully competed. That alone is more than seven times the amount of congressionally directed spending in this bill. 
   In the Labor Department, 90 percent of discretionary funding for the High Growth Job Training Program was spent on a noncompetitive basis. 
   The Office of Inspector General found that the Education Department strong-armed State and local school districts to select textbooks from favored publishers. Madison, Wisconsin, in my own State, lost its $2 million Reading First grant because they refused to purchase texts from an inferior program. Yet, the most thoroughly evaluated programs, like Success for All and Reading Recovery, were frozen out by the program administrators. 
   ABC reported that one publisher with good connections at the White House saw its corporate net worth rise from $5 million to $360 million, with a little help from their friends. 
   The Office of Inspector General has made criminal references to the Justice Department, and we have cut Reading First until the Administration changes its ways. 
   So I would simply say, Madam Chairman, spare us the Administration's sanctimony about earmarks or directed spending, and please spare us the pretense that this bill has anything to do  with the fiscal mess this country faces. It is a disciplined set of investments. Virtually every Republican amendment in committee did not seek to cut funding, rather it sought to increase it. 
   I appreciate the bipartisan support for the bill in committee. I appreciate the partnership with Mr. Walsh, the ranking member. 
   People who have reviewed it most closely, Republicans and Democrats alike, know this bill is responsible and disciplined. 
   Just one comparison. The Administration's defense request, even without counting the $140 billion in new money that they're asking for in their supplemental, that defense bill is still $43 billion above last year, which is at least four times as large as the difference between the committee and the Congress on this bill. 
   I would urge every Member who thinks about this country's future to support this bill.

   Frankly, Madam Chairman, I was filibustering in hopes that the majority leader would arrive, but he is in the middle of a meeting and can't make it. So let me simply second the comments of the gentleman from New York. I think this is a good bipartisan product.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, I rise to oppose the amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I have a great deal of respect for the gentleman who just offered the amendment, but I have to say this is exactly the wrong thing for the Congress to do at this time. 
   The gentleman's amendment tries to restore $75 million to probably the most troubled program in this bill. As the gentleman has indicated, we have had six different audits by the Office of Inspector General. He has discovered that the Department of Education  tried to steer billions of dollars in Reading First funds for the purchase of certain reading textbooks and assessments in order to benefit favored publishers and individuals. I don't think the Congress ought to stand for that. 
   I would also point out that the OIG found out that the Department of Education administrators improperly promoted commercial reading programs in potential violation of Federal law. And this did not just occur in my own State, as I mentioned earlier in my remarks, it occurred in Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey. States in districts with programs that were not on the Department's preferential list were either rejected for grants or pressured to change their methods, even though some argued, as did my own State, that their programs met the law's standard. 
   What is most ironic is this is supposed to be a peer reviewed program, and yet the programs that have demonstrably shown the best performance levels were frozen out of the program, including Bob Slaven's program at Johns Hopkins that has generally been reviewed as one of the best in the country. Yet, they were virtually invited out the door by the DOE. 
   In addition to the fact that we certainly should not be rewarding the administration for the way they have handled this program, the gentleman seeks to finance this program by taking $43 million out of job training for ex-offenders. We cannot afford to have criminals reentering society with inadequate job training that provides them with incentives to renew their lives of crime.     
   We need to provide as much training as possible, and the gentleman scales that back dramatically. 
   And, lastly, I must confess I'm a bit confused. In the full committee, I accepted an amendment from Mr. Peterson, a valued member of our subcommittee, who wanted to add $25 million for vocational education above my mark. I accepted it because I thought he made a good case. Now we're being asked to take out $23 million of the money that Mr. Peterson successfully added in the subcommittee. I don't think that's a wise thing to do. 
   There will be plenty of time in conference to restore funding for Reading First, provided that the administration and provided that the agency demonstrates that it's shaped up and it's no longer following the same habits. But at this point, you have the same contractors still in place, you have the same conflicts still at large, and I don't think under these circumstances that this Congress wants to support the kind of shenanigans that we've seen in that Reading First program. And, on behalf of the integrity of the taxpayers' dollar, I would urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment.

   Mr. OBEY. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his question. 
   Yes, it was our intent to fund both the Credit Enhancement for Charter School Facilities program within the larger Charter School Grant program at their fiscal year 2007 levels, not to eliminate the credit enhancement program. We consolidated the programs for administrative efficiency and fully expect the Secretary of Education to continue funding for existing charter school programs from this single line item.

   Mr. OBEY. Let me say simply say, Madam Chairman, that the fund that the gentleman seeks to increase has been increased by 33 percent in terms of resources just over the last 4 years, and staffing for that same agency has been increased by over 25 percent. That is hardly starving an agency. 
   I would also point out that at the same time you've had those large increases, the wage and hour division, which is supposed to enforce protection for workers on minimum wage, overtime and child labor laws, will have seen its staffing drop by over 12 percent since 2001, and the staff level at the Office of Federal Contract Compliance, which protects workers from unfair employment practices by Federal contractors, will have dropped by 23 percent. 
   So it seems to me that what the gentleman's amendment does is to enrich the one portion of the Labor Department which has been doing very well, thank you, and they have been doing very well while other portions of the Labor Department that are supposed to focus on protecting workers have, in fact, been starved. 
   The Department's own budget justifications for the large increase that they've requested states that the acceptability rate for unions in meeting labor management reporting and disclosure reporting requirements is at 96 percent.     
   The goal for fiscal 2008 is to raise this to 97 percent. I'd say if you are getting 96 percent, that's an A. At least it was when I went to school. Things may have changed since then. 
   Let me also say that the place that this funding was taken from, in order to finance this increase is especially pernicious. The administration itself has asked for an 81 percent reduction in the International Labor Account. That is the program that is used in order to protect workers from having to compete against slave labor and child labor. 
   I don't think that you help workers by weakening that program. We are simply trying to restore funding in that program that the President cut, and I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, I don't really enjoy opposing this amendment because I think this is a good program  that the gentleman seeks to expand. But let me put his amendment in context. 
   The President of the United States tried to eliminate this program in his budget. The committee has provided $99 million for it, and for that the administration is criticizing us. 
   I would also point out that in the last year, when the other party controlled the House of Representatives, the committee cut Even Start by $29 million. We've done none of that. We've restored the funding, and I have a great deal of confidence in the program. But I cannot support the idea of adding the additional money the gentleman proposes because he takes it from a very damaging place. 
   Now, I know that there is no political constituency for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. No one is going to get excited if they hear that we are cutting back funding for that agency. But, in fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which produces the Consumer Price Index, puts together the numbers that determine the way hundreds of billions of dollars flow in this budget and flow in this economy. 
   We are operating on the basis of an ancient Consumer Price Index. The housing component of that index, which makes up almost 30 percent of it, is some 17 years out of date, and we know there's been a lot of change in housing stock over the last 17 years. 
   And it just seems to me that while the gentleman is citing a worthy program for adding funds, I would suggest that it would do tremendous long-term damage to this country in terms of equity if we do not update and modernize the data being produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Republicans can have their set of facts, Democrats can have their set of facts, but in the end we need to disregard both sets and we need to have statistics which underlie all of the economic decisions that we make. And it makes no sense to be proceeding on the basis of 17-year old statistics. 
   So, much as I regret having to oppose the gentleman's amendment and much as I regret having to call Bill Goodling, who is the original sponsor of the program, to tell Bill that I couldn't support the increase in this instance, I do think that the responsible thing to do in this instance is to vote ``no.'' 
   I forgot to mention, and far be it for me to defend the administration's Cabinet appointees. But the gentleman, as I understand it, would take a significant amount of this funding from the Department of Labor administration accounts. 
   I would point out the administration is also complaining about the cuts we've made in the Labor Secretary's budget. Their Information and Technology Account has already been cut by 39 percent. The Office of the Secretary has already been cut by 17 percent. And we did not provide the requested funds for a core accounting system, and the administration specifically brings attention to their concerns about this. And I honestly do not think it's advisable to cut the agency even more deeply. 
   And let me assure the gentleman that I would actually prefer that he withdraw the amendment and I'd be happy to try to work, as I'm sure the gentleman from New York would, to try to improve the Even Start position in conference. 
   But if he has to rely on these kinds of offsets, I regret it, but I simply cannot see my way clear to support it. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, let me simply point out that the administration has sent us a statement of administration policy, or SAP as it is known in the trade, and they indicate that the President intends to veto this bill. And one of the reasons they intend to veto the bill is because they say this bill spends too much money. I would simply point out that virtually every Republican amendment that has been offered so far is an amendment to increase funding for a specific program. 
   On this program the President zeroed out this very worthy program. The committee fully restored the funding at the previous year's level of $19.8 million, and now this amendment seeks to add a small amount in addition by taking it out of departmental management. 
   As the Chair of the committee, I think it is my obligation to the administration to try to be somewhat objective about the funding level that they need in order to fund their agency activities. But if we are going to continue to get amendments from the administration's own side of the aisle that further reduce Cabinet Secretaries' operating budgets, who am I to object? So if the administration can't save itself from its friends, far be it from me to intercede, and so I would simply say that on this I will accept the amendment.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, this amendment is very simple. It seeks to reinstate the President's 81-percent cut in the International Labor Organization appropriation in the bill. 
   Madam Chairman, I cannot walk into a union hall in my District, I cannot walk into a restaurant, I cannot walk into a barber shop without having someone say to me, Obey, what are you guys going to do to protect workers from unfair competition? What are you going to do to protect us from slave labor in China? What are you going to do to protect us from countries that pretend that they are free market countries when, in fact, they are centrally directed Marxist countries? When are you going to protect us from goods being produced by child labor around the world? 
   The purpose of this International Labor Organization is to serve as the one agency that serves as a red flag when our workers' wages are being undercut unfairly. 
   So I think the issue is very simple, and I don't intend to take the full 5 minutes. If you really are comfortable with the idea of just letting the wonders of the world market determine what wages are for American workers, if you are really comfortable with the idea of letting substandard wages and substandard working conditions undercut legitimate American workers' interests, then by all means vote for the gentleman's amendment. If you think that the American worker deserves a square deal in the midst of this globalization rampage, then I would suggest you vote against the amendment. And, I do think that workers and the organizations who represent them will be watching. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, I don't like to have to oppose this amendment, but the fact is where some of the previous amendments were merely troublesome, this amendment is irresponsible. 
   Now, let us point out what's happened so far. What we have going on here is a ``let's pretend'' game. We have the administration telling us that this bill is runaway spending, and they threaten to veto the bill when in fact this bill in real terms is only a little over a 2 percent increase over last year. It is a large difference with the President's budget, but that's because he tried to cut $7.5 billion of it. In real terms, this bill goes up by less than $5 billion. 
   By now we have a number of people in this House who are trying to escape from the consequences of the President's budget. So we have pretended in one amendment that we can add money to AmeriCorps by taking money out of administrative management accounts for the Labor Department. 
   Then we are pretending that we can take out, yes, just a small amount, $500,000, out of that same account in order to deal with National Labor Relations Board. Then we are having another effort to escape the squeeze on behalf of another very worthy cause, deaf and blind children. And those have been accepted. 
   But now this amendment comes in, and it proposes to increase funding for a very worthy cause, Center for Disease Control TB Elimination Program. That is funded in the bill at $150.7 million, an increase of $13.7 million over fiscal 2007 and $13.9 million over the President's request. The funding included in this bill is a 10 percent increase over fiscal 2007. 
   Now, everybody knows that we would like to be providing more money for that program and a dozen others in this bill. But we are trying, evidently, to give some credence to the administration's complaints about dollar levels in spending. 
   So what does this amendment do? It savages the ability of the Secretary of Labor to run any programs at all, because what it does is to require a 25 percent cut in the ability of the Secretary of Labor to manage all of the programs within their jurisdiction. So that means that you have to chop the living guts out of the Secretary's own office; you have to chop the guts out of the Solicitor's office. And that is the office that deals with enforcement for mine safety, for OSHA, or even the OLMS union violations that were the subject of a previous amendment just a couple minutes ago. 
   And what this all is is a giant ``let's pretend'' operation. It's a game that pretends that we are doing something real by adding money for these accounts, when you know that if you're going to be responsible, when we go to conference we're going to have to restore most of these management accounts or else we will have a government agency, admittedly one run by a very conservative Republican, but still a government agency which will be crippled in its ability to provide its functions. 
   I have in my office two signs. And whenever anybody comes to me asking for money, I make them read those signs out loud. This is what one of them says: ``What do you want us to do for someone besides yourself that's more important than whatever it is you want us to do for you?'' And I think that's the basic question we always ought to be asking in a Judeo-Christian society. 
   My problem with this amendment is, while it seeks funds for a very worthy cause, in the process it takes away crucial funds for many other worthy causes. And sooner or later, even in the Congress of the United States, we need to think about the needs of the whole. We need to think about all of the needs that the government has to deal with, not just one concern of one Member or one concern of another. 
   So in the interest of responsibility, I would urge a, very regretfully, defeat of the gentleman's amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, this bill contains a provision that freezes public-private competitions at the Department of Labor under OMB circular A-76. That process is used to compete out jobs now performed by Federal employees. Significant resources have been spent by the Department over the last several years on contracting out government jobs, and the committee believes it is time to take a step back and examine how the process is working. 
   Government-wide statistics cast doubt, frankly, on the overall effectiveness of this process. OMB reports in fiscal year 2006 that government employees won the competition in more than 85 percent of the cases where competitive sourcing was used. At DOL, the results have been similar. Since the process has begun, DOL employees have won 22 of the 25 competitions. 
   Now, aside from questions about the lack of compelling evidence of cost savings or increased efficiency, there is concern about the fact that the Department is not taking proper care to assure that functions that ought to be considered inherently governmental or are otherwise unsuitable for contracting performance are excluded from these competitions. 
   We have seen some competitions where regulatory and policy functions are included and believe that an independent look at the Department of Labor's use of this authority is warranted. 
   The gentleman says that it is labor bosses who are concerned about this. The last time I looked, this was having a disproportionate impact on women and on minority workers, and we are asking the GAO to assess the impact on them.     
   The bill language freezes the A-76 process at the Department of Labor until the committee has the benefit of a GAO review of that process. What is wrong with that? 
   The Comptroller General chaired a panel that submitted a report to Congress in 2002 and the request to GAO will be to ask for an assessment of the extent to which the sourcing principle adopted by the panel, including the recognition of inherently governmental functions, are being followed by the Department. This department is frankly not known to be a friend of the worker, certainly not under the present regime. It certainly is not known to be a friend to Federal workers, and it seems to me that we have seen in Iraq what happens when we contract out everything in sight. We have seen what happens in the Labor Department when 90 percent of one of their most important manpower programs, when 90 percent of the money in that program is farmed out on a noncompetitive basis. Frankly, we have sincere doubt about the balance with which the Department is approaching this issue. 
   Therefore, we asked the GAO to review the process. What on earth is wrong with that? I urge opposition to the gentleman's amendment.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, once again we demonstrate the strangeness of the administration's statement of policy on this bill. 
   This amendment would add $40 million to TRIO. We have already added $40 million above the amount that the President asked for for that program. It is a worthy program. 
   The President also eliminated the funding for the other account that the gentleman wants to increase in this amendment. The President zeroed out the geriatrics program. The committee restored $32 million. So in both of these accounts, we are significantly above the President's budget; and yet we get another amendment from the other side of the aisle seeking to raise a worthy program. 
   Now he seeks to pay for it by cutting, among other sources, AmeriCorp. I am a little confused by that because just a few minutes ago the distinguished gentleman from Connecticut had an amendment to try to add money for AmeriCorp. The House turned that down. Frankly, had I realized that the gentleman's amendment was going to be offered, in this instance I probably would have accepted the gentleman's amendment from Connecticut because I don't think it makes sense to reduce AmeriCorp, which has already been cut $9.2 million below last year, although I admit they do have carryover funds of $8 million. 
   I guess what I am saying is I don't intend to stand in the way of this amendment, but it once again illustrates that when the administration claims that this bill is profligate, it is in fact far off the mark. Virtually every single amendment being offered today is being offered for the purpose of increasing funding for what is described as a worthy program. 
   Now, yes, in order to pretend that we are all equally focused on the same things, they say that they have an offset. But it is clear that the offset is a  secondary motivation and the primary motivation is to raise funding for these programs, and I think it indicates that the committee has been far from profligate when it has set the funding levels that we have set in this bill. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chair, this is another one of those ``let's pretend'' devices that I guess we are going to be afflicted with the next 2 days. 
   This amendment doesn't do nothing to nobody, and it doesn't do nothing for somebody. The fact is that it pretends to move $37 million out of this account, and then it puts $37 million back into this account and pretends that something has been accomplished. 
   There is no congressional direction that I know of that's being accomplished by this amendment. There is no consensus about what it does. It makes no changes in either the bill or the report. As a practical matter, it doesn't do anything except let somebody pretend that they have just done something for nurses' education. 
   If it makes you feel good to play a ``let's pretend'' game, go ahead and vote for it. But let's not kid ourselves. This amendment is not a real amendment. It has no real impact. It pretends to have an increase. It has, in fact, no offset. It's simply a shell game.

   Mr. OBEY. The unanimous-consent agreement under which we are now operating means that there will be at least 13 hours of debate on amendments that are contemplated being offered. In addition to the 13 hours that that will take, you almost have to allow for 4 or 5 hours of slippage because of the time it takes for recognition and things like that. So that means that we will have approximately 18 hours, not counting votes, as I calculate it, to dispose of all of the items contained in the unanimous consent request. 
   Members further need to understand that we will not be on this bill tomorrow morning because the Appropriations Committee has to mark up the Agriculture appropriation bill. That means that if we stay here until 1 o'clock tonight, we might, if we get lucky and if some people decide to drop some amendments, be finished by 8 or 9 o'clock tomorrow night. I wish that we could do it sooner, but I'm not the fellow offering the amendments. So I simply want Members to be aware of what it means. 
   What we will try to do, and I don't think this is definitely tied down, but Members should be notified shortly when it is, we will try to go until about 8 o'clock and then have another series of votes. And then those of us who are stuck on the committee or stuck offering amendments, we will have to be here after that. That's the only way that we can see about how to proceed, unless people want to be here Friday or Saturday. 
   So, I just wanted Members to have that happy news before they go to their happy hour.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, if you think that there is too much education in this country, then vote for this amendment. If you think that we could use more help to people trying to get an education, then you vote against it. 
   I think that the only thing wrong with this program in the eyes of the White House is the name of the man that's attached to the program, the distinguished Senator ROBERT BYRD from West Virginia. He sponsored this program, which provides needs-based scholarships all over the country, some 15,000 of them. I happen to think that's a good thing. I think the recipients certainly think it's a good thing. I think the working families of the recipients think it's a good thing. 
   The gentleman says that the White House Budget Office has ranked this program as ``not determined'' in terms of effectiveness. I would remind you, this is the same White House that is claiming that the surge in Iraq has shown great progress. I hardly think that their judgment ought to serve as the standing judgment of the House. 
   I also note, by the way, that the White House also ranks as ``effectiveness not being determined'' IDEA preschool grants, and IDEA Grants for Infants and Families. We've had several efforts on the part of people on that side of the aisle today to increase funding for IDEA. I didn't see them stopping then because the White House didn't think that was such a hot idea. I also see the White House ranks the Federal Work Study program as being ``not determined'' in terms of adequacy. 
   With all due respect, I think this country needs all the education it can get. I think it needs all the student aid it can get. And I would therefore urge rejection of the amendment.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I share the gentleman's concern about the Social Security disability claim backlog and the hardship it has caused. Under the President's request for SSA, the disability backlog has gotten worse. The funding increase we've included in this bill will keep that from happening and will protect SSA from staffing declines that the agency has seen in recent years. 
   I would make the point that despite the fact that we were left in a considerable mess with all of last year's domestic appropriation bills not passed when we took over, we still made SSA a priority and included $148 million over the 2006 funding level. In the bill we are debating today, we have included over $401 million above the 2007 level and $100 million more than the presidential request. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would be happy to work with the gentleman and others, such as Mr. Arcuri, toward increasing the amount for SSA in the conference and in future years.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, this amendment, like so many others offered today, demonstrates that the White House is incredibly off base when they tell us that this bill is over-funded. This bill is about 2.5 percent in real terms above last year. The fact that it is so tight and still falls so short of meeting many needs is evidenced by the fact that we have this kind of amendment before us. The only difference between this amendment and several others is that the others have been coming from the minority side of the aisle and this one happens to come from the majority side of the aisle. 
   But let me simply say that I fully appreciate where the gentleman wants to put the money. It is a good place to put it. There are many other good places to put it. The problem is that it is simply not real to believe that you can decimate the administrative budget of the Department of Education as much as this amendment does. 
   I am not going to ask people to vote one way or another on this, because no matter which way you vote, you will be wrong, because this amendment, because of the squeeze that we are in, because of the tremendous demand for education help in this country, no matter what you do, someone will be shortchanged. It is either the department that is supposed to administer the programs or the programs themselves. 
   So I sympathize with what the gentleman is trying to do. I cannot honestly say I endorse the amendment, because of the problems, but I think the gentleman's amendment lays out clearly how inadequate this bill still is in terms of meeting the country's responsibilities, especially to those folks in our population who are not, shall we say, the top dogs. 
   I yield to the gentlewoman from California.

   Mr. OBEY. I share the gentleman's concern about the Social Security Administration budget. Since January, the committee has provided $550 million in additional resources. It has come in large part because of requests of people like yourself who have constantly reminded us of the problem.  
   In the bill we are debating today, the committee has included over $400 million above the 2007 level and $100 million more than the administration's request. Years of underfunding SSA and the other programs in this bill, such as No Child Left Behind, IDEA, and NIH, cannot be remedied in any one year, but we are certainly doing the best we can to accelerate.

   Mr. OBEY. Earlier today, the gentleman had a previous amendment which tried to put money in a worthy program, and I expressed then my concern about the offset. I must do the same thing on this occasion. 
   The point I'm making is while I certainly understand why the gentleman wants to add the funds that he wants to add, I simply cannot continue to buy into the idea that we can take all of these items out of administrative budgets. It simply is not responsible. Of course, I don't think it is responsible for the White House to claim that this bill is underfunded either. These programs are very good programs. 
   But Members are going through this elaborate dog and pony show, or some would call it cock and bull story, because they are prevented from doing what they know should really happen, which is we should be expanding some of these programs without gouging others. 
   I simply cannot support this amendment and I would not at all urge Members to vote for it not because the funding that the gentleman seeks isn't worthy, but because the solution that the gentleman lays out isn't real, unless you think that we can have agencies run programs with no desks and no lights and no phones and no personnel, nobody to cut the checks and no policy direction.     
   So, with that, I yield back the balance of my time and regretfully indicate my opposition to the amendment.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, this is a very simple amendment that I will only take 2 minutes to discuss. 
   It eliminates all funds for AmeriCorps. It denies opportunities to 73,000 individuals to earn college assistance awards through serving their community. 
   It may not suit the gentleman's fancy that these folks volunteer and are paid, but I would suggest that it's a whole lot better than having people who don't volunteer at all. 
   Secondly, the gentleman cites what he considers to be abuses of the program. You know, when I looked at the Congress, I've seen abuse by Mr. Cunningham, I've seen abuse by Mr. Ney. In the old days, I saw abuse by Mr. Hayes, and a few other Members, but you know what, I didn't see anybody move to shut down the entire Congress because of the abuses of a few idiots. And I would suggest that we ought to apply the same standards to AmeriCorps that we apply to the Congress.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, what this amendment does is eliminate all of the funds for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. I think that would be a very ill-advised thing to do. This Congress has spoken on funding for that organization many times. It has had strong support, often bipartisan support. 
   The gentleman complains about the fact that it is advance funded. It is advance funded for two reasons: number one, so that you can assure some kind of political independence from political pressure, and, secondly, because programmers need advance time in order to plan their programming. 
   The advance funding concept was begun 31 years ago by that notorious big spender Jerry Ford when he was President, my good friend, my good buddy. 
   If this amendment passes, 1,150 public radio and TV stations will be hurt. That will fall especially hard on rural stations. I don't think that's a good idea. I don't think we ought to do anything that would lead us 1 inch more toward a world in which the only kind of news we got was from the commercial stations feeding us the lately breathless news about Britney Spears, Donald Trump and Rosie O'Donnell. I would like to see a little bit better than that, and I think we get it from public broadcasting. 
   As far as the gentleman talking about taxes, we have seen Republican after Republican march down here like good little young Republicans in their college days repeating their mantra about taxes when this bill has nothing to do with taxes. They are all dutifully parroting their words like the Chinese used to do from Mao's Little Red Book. It's no more impressive now than it was then. 
   Let me just simply say that for someone to support spending $600 billion on the war in Iraq and spend $57 billion in tax cuts for millionaires and then somehow to suggest that the 2 percent difference in this bill between the President and us somehow has something to do with fiscal irresponsibility is a joke. The American people know it, and so do the Members of this House.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, this is I guess what I would call a put up or shut up amendment for the House. 
   It is difficult for the press to cover budget stories because they are complicated. It is difficult for the press to cover stories about policy because they are complicated. But it is a whole lot easier for the press and for individual Members of this House to complain about some other Member, or in the case of the press any Member, trying to do something in his district, or in the case of a House Member complaining about somebody trying to do something in a different district. 
   We have a constitutional right to direct spending. In fact, that is the primary power of the Congress, to direct the executive branch in the spending of the taxpayers' money. The executive branch in fact directs far more spending than does the Congress, and yet I  recognize a Member's individual right to object to any direct spending that is engaged in by the Congress or the executive branch. 
   I would like to put that discussion in perspective. The last year that I was chairman of the Appropriations Committee this bill had no earmarks when it left the House. During the 12 years that the Republicans controlled this House, earmarks exploded to over 3,000. 
   In this bill, we have cut earmarks back to 1,300. We have cut the dollar amount in this bill for earmarks back to a very small amount, less than half of the amount that was in the bill 2 years ago. In fact, as the percentage of the total bill, earmarks make up two-tenths of 1 percent. Two-tenths of 1 percent. And yet, the debate on that two-tenths of 1 percent has dominated in the press and dominated the congressional debate. That is ridiculous. 
   But I am tired of having the committee serve as a punching bag for members of the press or Members of this body. I will be happy to play this issue flat, or I will be happy to play it round.     
   I'll be happy to bring a bill to the House floor with these earmarks, or without them. Those who know me well in this House know that I deeply resent the time that we have to take dealing with earmarks, and they know that the reason that I urged that we cut earmarks to 50 percent of the previous level 2 years ago is not because I thought they were impure, but because I thought they were beginning to be so numerous that they were unmanageable. 
   So today I'm going to give the House a choice. We've got lots of amendments pending before us on individual earmarks. I'm going to give the House a choice. I want the House to choose whether it wants to proceed with earmarks or not. If it does, then it will reject the amendment that I sent to the desk. If it doesn't want to proceed with these earmarks, then you can save a whole lot of time by knocking them all out with one vote. I invite you to put up or shut up, and make up your mind. 
   I will be a neutral player in this. I will offer the amendment, and I will vote present so that I'm not pushing people to vote either for or against eliminating these earmarks. 
   But I want, before we move to individual earmark debate, I want to know whether the House itself takes responsibility for the decision to move ahead with earmarks, or whether it doesn't. And if they want to decide no, be my guest. It will make my life a whole lot easier. 
   It will do one thing that will bother me at night.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, I want to make one thing perfectly clear. I indicated, when I offered this amendment, that I would vote ``present.'' And the reason I want to do that is because I want every Member of this House to vote for or against this bill on final passage on the basis of what they think of it on the merits. 
   And I want, both by my ``present'' vote and by my comments here, to make it perfectly clear to Members on both sides of the aisle that no matter how they vote on the issue of earmarks and no matter how they vote on the issue of substance, I don't intend to let one affect the other. 
   I don't care whether Members vote to include earmarks or exclude them. And I will not do what was done to us 3 years ago when, after we voted against the Labor-H bill because we thought it provided inadequate funding for many national responsibilities, that virtually every single one of the earmarks for Democrats were stripped from the bill because of that vote. 
   So as far as I'm concerned, as long as I'm in charge of this subcommittee, there will be no log-rolling with respect to this issue. As far as I'm concerned, this is an individual vote of conscience and of practical judgment on the part of each Member of the House. 
   With respect to the record of Congress, Congress has earmarked funds since the beginning of the Republic. At least four of the appropriation bills are, by their nature, project oriented, so they must contain congressional earmarks. 
   And I want to point out, if we're going to start making comparisons, the HHS Department, just 2 years ago, had $1.9 billion in funds that they shoveled out without being shoveled out on a competitive basis. That is the same, that is the executive branch functional equivalent earmarking. It is directed spending, whether it occurs in the Congress or in the executive branch. And the action of that Department alone represented direct spending in the amount seven times as large as the amount contained in this bill tonight on behalf of the Congress. 
   So I want Members to vote however you want. But as I said, as far as I'm concerned, this is a put-up-or-shut-up amendment. If you want earmarks, vote for them. If you don't, vote against them. Either way I'll be a happy man. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back.

   Mr. OBEY. Let me simply say, Madam Chairman, that there is nothing in the world more deadly than a dull science teacher. I know from long, personal experience, and so does one of my sons. Let me say that this earmark is meant to correct that problem in at least one area of the country. 
   The funds that are attacked by this amendment are for the Bay Area Science Teacher Recruitment, Retention and Improvement Initiative, which supports the professional development of the K-12 science teacher workforce of the Bay Area, with a particular focus on the needs of underserved schools. These funds would be used for professional development programs consisting of summer workshops and academic year follow-up activities for 500 science education teachers, online professional development activities, and curriculum development. 
   This initiative is being conducted by the Exploratorium, a private, nonprofit science museum in San Francisco. It is a longstanding program of professional development for science teachers. It has been awarded more National Science Foundation grants than any other museum. Those funds will significantly increase the number of teachers served. 
   Recruitment and retention of science teachers is a major problem in the Bay Area, with over 50 percent of new science teachers leaving the workforce within 5 years, causing ongoing shortages, particularly in high-poverty urban school districts. 
   It is estimated that in the Bay Area urban school districts, more than 40 percent of high school teachers, 60 percent of middle school teachers, and 90 percent of newly hired science teachers are teaching at least one science course for which they are not technically qualified. High school science students in schools serving large minority populations are twice as likely to be taught by an unqualified teacher, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. 
   This program is consistent with the bipartisan White House and Congressional Priorities for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math, the STEM program, and the U.S. Competitiveness Initiative. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, as you know, I have been less than enthusiastic about virtually every amendment offered here today, but this is one exception. 
   I want to congratulate the dean of the House. He has been a lion for all of the years he has been here in defending Social Security and in pursuing the goal of universal health care for every American.     
   Before that, his father played the same role. I am pleased to see that he is carrying on the tradition. For a moment, when the gentleman from Michigan explained this amendment to me, I had doubts about supporting it. But then I recognized the legitimacy of the gentleman's concern, especially because the gentleman in the Social Security Administration in question had been appointed through a recess appointment. 
   I felt that that process was an indication of disrespect for the congressional prerogatives of this body, or I should say the other body. To express what I mean, I want to simply remind Members that several weeks ago when the amendment was offered by Mr. Emanuel to eliminate funding for the Office of the Vice President, I voted against that amendment because I thought that members of one institution in the government owe a certain degree of respect to the other institution, even if you don't especially care for the policies of the people who run that institution. 
   When the Vice President and I talked about the issue, I told him that the reason I had voted that way was simply because there were at least some people in this body still left who respected other institutions of government. I wish that the administration had demonstrated the same respect for this institution when they allowed this gentleman in question to be appointed through a recess appointment without confirmation. 
   When a program as vital as Social Security is at stake, I think that rather than lecturing each other about how we find a middle road to solve long-term problems of that program, I think the best way to find that middle road is to walk it and to look for ways to cooperate institutionally with the other branch of government. That is certainly what the White House chose not to do in this instance. 
   It is for that reason that I think that the gentleman's amendment is a wise one, because it reminds both bodies of the need to respect each other's prerogatives. Sometimes they need to be forcibly reminded of that which this amendment would do. 
   Madam Chairman, I therefore urge its adoption.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, I held up this sign from the well yesterday, and I will do so again today. I have the sign hanging in my office, and every time somebody comes in looking for money, I ask them to read it out loud. What the sign says is, ``What do you want us to do for someone, besides yourself, that is more important than whatever it is you want us to do for you?'' That request includes even medical researchers at universities. 
   Now, the fact is, this bill contains $750 million over last year, and before that in the continuing resolution we added $620 million to NIH at that time. This bill is $1 billion higher than the President's request for the National Institutes of Health. 
   Now, everybody loves the National Institutes of Health. I do too. But it does no good to any patient if we only concentrate on putting money in the National Institutes of Health and do not see to it that the information produced by the NIH is disseminated adequately to medical practitioners all over the country. 
   It also does no good if in the process of squirreling away this money to NIH we do substantial damage to the public health programs of the United States and if we essentially wipe out the one agency which is doing the research to demonstrate to us how to produce the best treatments and how to produce cost savings that will prevent private medical care and Medicare from going bankrupt.     
   This amendment has all of those problems. This country is consumed about out-of-control health care costs. This amendment would devastate funding for the one agency doing the research necessary to determine the best ways to deliver medical care in order to avoid bankrupting our health care system. 
   The amendment will also devastate the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health by cutting 20 percent of the funding provided for NIOSH, the only agency in government that supports occupational safety and health research and brings that research from the laboratory into the workplace. 
   What we are trying to do in this bill is what has been done for the last 16 years: We take a small percentage of the funds we appropriate to these agencies, and we set that aside for research and for evaluation so that we have a truly holistic approach to health care in this country. It does no good if we do lots of research in the lab and the implications of that research never get out into the doctor's office. It does no  good if patients aren't given enough information so that they can question their own treatment. That is what this does. 
   I would urge strongly, in the strongest possible terms, the rejection of this amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, I have been trying to figure out what to name this operation I have been watching, and I think we ought to name it ``Operation Divert Attention.'' 
   We have heard comments on a number of occasions now, when Members are offering amendments to strike these tiny items, we constantly hear, oh, we are running a deficit, we have to be fiscally responsible. 
   Well, if I am looking at the Record correctly, the gentleman offering this amendment voted to authorize the President to go to war in Iraq. If I take a look at the Record correctly, all three of the gentlemen who have been acting as the point men in going after these projects and in going after other small amendments today, all voted for the 2007 Republican budget resolution. 
   I would point out it is those budget policies, and those foreign policies, which have given us, counting the supplemental this year, $600 billion in borrowed money spent on the Iraqi war in a case of mistaken identity, where the President mistook that stocky fellow with the mustache, Saddam Hussein, for that tall fellow with the beard, Osama bin Laden, and hit the wrong country by mistake. 
   I would also say that the three gentlemen who voted for those Republican budget policies are the fellows who voted for tax policies that are watching $57 billion go out the door this year in tax cuts for millionaires. 
   Then they try to recoup on the deficit front by saying, oh, we ought to  save a little piece here and a little piece there. If they had been as concerned about the fiscal impact of their actions, voting for past budget resolutions, and voting for past war resolutions, we wouldn't be sitting here with this deficit today, and this attack on these investments would be even more chuckle-producing than this episode.

Why don't we say enough is enough in putting the needs of millionaires who are going to get $57 billion in tax cuts this year ahead of the needs of average working people with respect to investments in their education, their job training, and their community development and their health care? I think, indeed, enough is enough, but we ought to be saying that about the right things.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, the amendment offered would not permit the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or the Social Security Administration to pay a bonus or performance-based cash awards to Presidential appointees who are not eligible for bonuses, or to senior executive personnel who are, by definition, eligible for bonuses. Frankly, I don't understand why the gentleman would want to stop CMS or SSA from awarding employees who are eligible for bonuses if they're achieving exemplary performance. The fact is that senior executive service personnel are specifically eligible for bonuses and are paid on the basis of performance. 
   The gentleman's amendment would overturn the entire personnel policy of the agencies. And I really don't think that makes much sense on the basis of a 10-minute debate at 10:30 at night, especially when this matter is not within the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee. This is something which ought to be dealt with by the authorizing committee. 
   I'm sure that many Members have frustrations with the performance of many agencies from time to time, and I'm sure sometimes we're pulling our hair, but that doesn't mean that we ought to have an across-the-board policy that penalizes people across the board because someone didn't perform up to someone else's standards. So, I would respectfully urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment. 
   I would be happy to work with the gentleman. If there is a specific problem which can be ironed out by talking to the agency, I would be happy to help in that respect. But I don't think I will overturn the entire personnel policy of the United States for these people because one Member, on the basis of a 10-minute debate, thinks that that ought to be done.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, I am willing to accept the amendment on this side of the aisle because we think that while it is well-intentioned, it has no impact. I would like to explain what I mean. The CDC is responsible for making recommendations for vaccines along with immunization advisory committees. But decisions on whether any vaccine should be a mandatory requirement for school admittance or matriculation is the responsibility of State and local governments and school districts. 
   The HPV vaccine is recommended for females age 9 to 26. It protects these young women against the cause of the majority of cervical cancers. While it has been made a requirement for schools in some cities and States around the country, these decisions were made locally, not by the CDC or HHS. Because no Federal funds are used to establish such requirements, we do not object to the gentleman's amendment.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, I am of a split mind on this amendment, just as I was on the previous Holt amendment this evening. I think the goal of the amendment is certainly worthwhile; but at the same time I am trying to follow a responsible course with respect to the ability of executive agencies to function administratively. 
   So again I would simply say that I think the fact that this amendment is being offered in a way that would draw further funds out of the Department of Labor management accounts is another demonstration that the White House is dead wrong when they say that this bill contains too much money. Virtually every amendment that has been offered tonight on both sides of the aisle has been an amendment, with four exceptions, that relate to the President's budget, they have all been efforts to increase funds. I think that demonstrates that we are substantially short of where we really need to be. 
   I am not going to mount the barricades to oppose the amendment, but I simply have to observe that while the amendment is certainly worthwhile, the offset that it proposes is really not a real one, and I think we all know when we go to conference we are going to have to repair the administrative budget of the agency. 
   Having said that, I am not going to ask people to vote against it if they want to engage in those kinds of actions on the executive branch's administrative functions. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. I would simply like to read a portion of the letter from Greg Tarpinion from Change to Win. He simply says this: ``Since its inception in 1935, the National Labor Relations Act has permitted workers to unionize and their union representatives to be recognized by obtaining signatures in support from a majority of workers to be represented.'' 
   Many large companies such as Cingular Wireless, Kaiser Permanente, and Harley-Davidson from my own State have voluntarily recognized their employees' desire for union representation using this type of majority signup procedure. By eliminating any funds for the National Labor Relations Board to enforce the laws, in cases in which the majority signup is used, the Souder amendment would gut this long-standing avenue for worker recognition. 
   As a result, any unions already recognized and any contracts already bargained with unions that obtained recognition using this method would be thrown into legal limbo, and any otherwise applicable labor law protections would become unenforceable. That, to me, doesn't seem to make very much sense. 
   I would urge opposition to the gentleman's amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, we have not had enough time to analyze the most recent version of this amendment. Its apparent innocuousness, frankly, raises my suspicions. It would appear to enforce current law for eligibility to enroll in benefits. 
   But for this to be offered just at the time that the authorizers are reauthorizing the SCHIP program and considering pay-fors that might include tightening payments to Medicare Advantage providers, it makes me wonder if this is more than a powerful coincidence. 
   This is certainly not within the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee. It most certainly is within the jurisdiction of the Ways and Means Committee. I don't think, given the sensitivity of it, that it ought to be handled in this manner. 
   So I would certainly intend not to support it. My understanding is also that the Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means Committees are both highly concerned about this amendment. And under these circumstances, I think it would be highly ill-advised for the House to adopt this amendment at this time. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   The motion was agreed to. 
   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms. Jackson-Lee of Texas) having assumed the chair, Mrs. Tauscher, Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3043) making appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, frankly, I am looking for my ranking minority member. But until he gets here let me take a little time and say that I would simply suggest to the gentleman, if he thinks this is a good idea, that he take this idea up with the President of the United States. 
   What this committee has tried to do both on this subcommittee and on the Foreign Operations Subcommittee is to respect and work with the administration in their effort to provide global leadership to deal with the AIDS epidemic around the world. And the fact is that this item in this bill is a critical piece of the President's program. 
   Given our disarray around the world because of Iraq, I think it is a wonderful exception when we can be seen to be providing constructive leadership in the world on something. And certainly, although I have many differences with the President, this is one area where I think he has exercised significant leadership.     
   And I think it would undercut our standing yet again in the world if we were to withdraw this funding. 
   I just think that we've struck a good balance with respect to this program. I think both subcommittees have tried to see to it that we meet our international responsibilities. 
   You and I are very lucky human beings. Our souls were, thanks to God, infused in a body that lives in the United States. If they had been infused in a body that was born in Africa or in Asia or in some of the other hot spots in the world in terms of these diseases, I think we would take a look at this issue in a quite different way. 
   This program provides the only real leadership in the world to attack this program. I think it would be a horrendous mistake if we were to adopt the gentleman's amendment. I would urge defeating the amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Let me simply say that we sort of feel like we're caught in the middle of this one because Mr. Lewis, the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, gave us a lecture yesterday about how we should avoid duplicative programs.     
   Then, today, this amendment would have the effect of creating in one department a program that is virtually identical to a program that already exists in another department. So we can't win, no matter how we deal with the issue. I don't care which agency this is in. I just want it to be wherever it would be run the most efficiently and effectively. 
   I am certainly willing to discuss with anybody involved in the issue how we resolve this issue. We didn't put it in in the first place. It was put in by, as you know, a person from your party from your own State. 
   So we are happy to work with all of you, but I don't want to get cross-wised between two people from the same State. I don't want to be standing here accepting an amendment that creates a duplicative program. 
   So I think the most constructive result would be if the gentleman would withdraw his amendment and we try to work this out down the line, so that if it is not in the right place, we can talk about how to get it in the right place.

   Mr. OBEY. If the gentleman will yield further, if I can simply say again, on this side of the aisle I feel like I am being whipsawed. This was in the other bill because we were trying to accommodate a Republican Member of the House who felt strongly that it ought to be in that bill. Now we are being criticized by another Republican from the same State because we accommodated the other Republican. I can't go in both directions at the same time, which is why I don't seek to have this program in any department. I don't care where it is. 
   I would just as soon that you settle your differences with your colleague from your own State, and when you have, come and see me. I will try to work with whoever is the winner of the rassling match.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, I understand the motivation behind this amendment. The gentleman wants to provide additional funding for a very legitimate purpose. It is something we should have done a long time ago, and I understand that. But having said that, I am simply tired of having to defend administrative accounts from people on both sides of the aisle. 
   So I am not going to object to the amendment, but I do want to point out to the gentleman, as I will point out to many other Members who offer similar amendments today, that this committee is being whipsawed. We are being told by the White House that there is too much money in this bill, yet virtually every amendment that has been offered, save one, has been motivated principally by a desire to increase rather than decrease funds in this bill. This is another similar amendment. While I recognize that it has an offset, it is a ``let's pretend'' offset, just like a number of the offsets were last night. 
   Anybody who understands how government works needs to understand that if an agency is a grant-making agency and if you gut its administrative budget, then there ain't going to be nobody in the agency to issue the grants in the first place. Therefore, I want Members who offer these amendments to understand that even if they are accepted, when we go to conference we are going to have to make very large adjustments, and a lot of what is adopted on the House floor, if it is based on some of these ``let's pretend'' offsets, will in fact wind up on the cutting room floor by the time we get back from conference. That is just a practical fact of life. 
   Madam Chairman, as I say, I will not object to the gentleman's amendment, but I don't want anyone to be under any illusion that we can fund all of these additional wonderful things by simply going to the administrative budgets of the agencies, because occasionally you need somebody in that office to turn on the light.

   Mr. OBEY. Drone on, drone on, O ship of State. That's what I'm tempted to recite when I hear these repetitious dronings on bill after bill after bill. 
   Let me simply say, I think it is legitimate for individual Members of this body to offer amendments in order to illustrate their concern about a larger question. I've done that many times myself in this institution. 
   But I think that after 3 weeks of hearing the same point made again and again, we understand that these gentlemen believe that we are putting too much money into education and health care and science and other areas that we regard as crucial investments, and that's a perfectly legitimate position to have. But please spare me the sanctimony, spare me the nonsense that somehow these amendments will contribute in any meaningful way to significant deficit reduction. 
   Let me simply point out, if people were interested in significant deficit reduction, they would not be supporting an Iraqi war which has already spent over $400 billion and which we'll spend another 140 billion bucks by the time we pass the President's supplemental. They would not be insisting that we provide $57 billion in tax cuts to people making a million bucks a year. No, they don't argue about those two things. 
   What do they do? They come to the floor and squawk about an $8 million program to help the poorest rural communities in this country get basic services like sewer and water. I represent many towns in my District with populations of less than a thousand people. At least half the households in many of those towns are headed either by senior citizens or a woman with a low income, and that means that when they get hit with the DNR order to clean up their water or clean up their sewer, they do not have the tax base to proceed, and they don't have technical expertise even to know how to begin going about it. 
   We've got a $385 billion backlog in this country of sewer and water needs, and yet we're hearing these complaints about this tiny little program and what terrible abuse it is for the taxpayer. 
   Imagine a congressional committee trying to do something to help poor communities deal with their sewer and water problems. Isn't that awful? Isn't that wasteful? Good God, Almighty, we ought to be putting that $8 million into the pockets of millionaires in additional tax cuts, right? At least that's what their record shows they believe. Nonsense. 
   I'm getting up once on this amendment, but I don't intend to continually get up in what is a filibuster by amendment. So I wanted to get that off my chest once, and then I'm just going to sit back and let people drone on, drone on, O ship of State, and occasionally I might even listen. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, again, I feel required to make the same comments that I made on a previous amendment that was offered about one-half hour ago.  
   This amendment seeks to do a very worthy thing: It seeks to increase support for respite care. God knows, having watched my mother-in-law for 7 years, having watched my father-in-law take care of her every day, God knows that anyone who has ever seen something like that understands that we need a lot more respite care. 
   But having said that, I want again to use this amendment to illustrate what is happening on this bill, because here is what the amendment says: 
   Page 63, line 4: After the first dollar amount insert, reduce by $20 million, increase by $20 million. 
   Now, what the amendment really does is simply to serve as a vehicle by which these two worthy Members can raise the issue that there is not enough money in this bill for respite care. And you know what? There isn't. And there isn't enough money in this bill for CDC; there isn't enough money in this bill for NIH; there isn't enough money in this bill for education; there isn't enough money in this bill for Pell Grants; there is not enough money in this bill to sufficiently reduce the Social Security backlog; there is not enough money in this bill to keep all the Social Security offices open that are closing around the country. And, yet, the administration is sending out a letter telling Members of Congress that they ought to vote against this bill because there is too much money. 
   Now, I don't fault the two gentlemen at all for using this device in order to raise their concerns; it is about the only thing they can do. But the fact is, as chairman of this committee, I have an obligation to point out to the House and to the occasional other person who might be listening that Members are being forced to go through these kinds of machinations because instead of meeting our obligations to the most needy people, the most vulnerable people in this society, we are instead squirting away billions of dollars on an Iraq war and billions more dollars in tax cuts for persons who make over $1 million a year. 
   The day that we decide not to do that, the day that we decide that we are not going to spend $150 billion more in Iraq this year, the day that we decide that we are not going to put tax cuts for millionaires ahead of the needs of our disabled and ahead of the needs of our isolated seniors, then that is the day when amendments like this will be real, because then there will be sufficient room in the budget to do what we ought to be doing on these programs. 
   Again, I will not stand in the way of this amendment because it is a worthy cause. But, understand, this is not a real offset; it doesn't add any new money to this account; and when we go to conference, we are going to have to jettison much of what is adopted on the floor because, like this amendment, in reality, because of budget constraints, it ain't real. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, let me simply say again, as I have several times today, I am sympathetic to the goal of the gentlewoman's amendment, and I appreciate the fact that she did not craft her amendment in a way which would go after general departmental administrative costs. I appreciate that concession on the part of the gentlewoman.  
   Having said that, again, I will not personally object to the amendment because I understand what she is trying to do. But I definitely want to make clear what the gentleman from New York said, that there's only so far that you can cut any of these programs. 
   I happen to have insisted on a very deep cut in Reading First because of the abuse that occurred of the taxpayer funds in that account. But having said that, it's our hope that, frankly, and the House needs to know this, it's our hope that by the time we get to conference, we will have worked out enough of an understanding with the administration about the corrections that are needed so that we don't have to take the deep cuts that are in the bill now. But we are not yet at that point, so I think people who are bringing these amendments to the floor need to understand that many of them will not survive, simply for the same reason that I said earlier, that this bill is still short of the funds necessary to fund deserving programs such as that pointed out by the gentlewoman from Texas. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. I want to underscore that I agree with my friend from New York and to emphasize that in parts of my own State, school districts face similar problems. In fact, I would bet this problem exists all over the country. 
   Furthermore, I understand that school districts face a similar issue with respect to the test scores of students receiving special education services. So I'd like to suggest to the gentleman from New York that we sign a joint letter to the authorizing committee requesting that they address this serious issue in the No Child Left Behind reauthorization that they're expected to soon consider.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, I must confess a certain degree of confusion about this amendment. I always had the impression that good Republicans like block grants, and I also had the impression that thoughtful Republicans favor as much local control as possible. And yet this amendment would have us running in the opposite direction. 
   What this amendment would do is it would take the dollars in question out of a program which provides aid to all States in the Union and instead reserve that money for use in just the few States who have bought into the approach that is supported by these two gentlemen. 
   One of my favorite quotations is from Eric Sevareid, who used to be on CBS News a few years ago, and he said, ``It is important to maintain the courage of one's doubts in an age of dangerous certainties.'' 
   And I have to say that I have a lot of doubts about what is the most effective way to teach children. I don't think I have all the answers. I don't think this House has all the answers. So I don't think we ought to be dictating to States what answers they seek in their teacher quality programs. 
   The virtue of the committee approach, as opposed to the approach suggested by the amendment, is that States can use the money in the block grant as it is provided in the committee bill and they can use it for any variety of techniques, including the one that is being promoted by the two gentlemen pushing this amendment. It seems to me that at a time when we are already questioning the rigidity of No Child Left Behind, and I must confess I voted for No Child Left Behind but with serious reservations and I will not vote to renew it unless those reservations are corrected, but it just seems to me that at a time when we are recognizing that No Child Left Behind is needlessly rigid, we should not be piling on to that rigidity with additional pieces of our own. 
   So with that I would simply urge Members to allow States to continue to have the flexibility that they have under the committee approach, and I would urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, let me simply say that I have only been to Alaska once in my life. I have certainly never been in an Alaskan school. But my grandfather taught me a long time ago, and I'm sure you have heard this many times in your own lives, but he used to say that nothing is more expensive in the long run than a badly educated child. And I don't care if that child comes from New Jersey or Wisconsin or Hawaii or Alaska, a badly educated child is a menace to society. Why, just imagine a badly educated child could grow up to be elected as a Member of Congress from New Jersey or Wisconsin. They could come into this Chamber filled full of all sorts of half-baked ideas, and the Congress would be plagued with having to spend hours and hours dealing with those ideas. I'm sure I've presented a few of the bad ideas myself to this House in that time. 
   The point is that Alaska may seem remote and far away, but the fact is that there are special children who do have special needs. Does anyone really believe that we are spending enough on Indian education programs around the whole country, for instance? And yet, we're told by the administration that we ought to eliminate the program for Alaska Native students because they benefit from the Indian education programs. Well, I've got tribes in my own State, and I know how inadequate some of those schools are, though they're trying the best they can. 
   I would simply say that if the authorizing committee wants to deauthorize this program, then fine, but I see no purpose right now in singling out one special group of children for exclusion from this bill and this account. I can think of a lot of things that go on in Alaska that I would just assume see stopped before I would see them stop educating children with special needs. I wish that they would take a different approach, for instance, on their highway aids. I think that their lack of judgment on that score has embarrassed the entire Congress. But I don't think that the Indian children or the Native Alaskan children who are educated under this should wind up being the principal victims of that action by the State of Alaska. 
   I sense in this House that people are touchy about voting for anything for Alaska since that happened. Well, I don't want these kids to be unlucky enough to run into accidents that started out to happen to somebody else. So it seems to me that the wise course is to reject the gentleman's amendment and allow the authorizing committee to determine whether or not this program ought to continue or not. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for raising this important issue. The purpose of the Energy Employee Occupational Illness Compensation Program is to fairly compensate our Nation's former nuclear workers for illnesses they contracted while serving our country. 
   Former Department of Energy employees who are now elderly and ill have been subjected to bureaucratic run-arounds by the agencies responsible for adjudicating their claims. The Department of Labor is responsible for administering compensation for these former nuclear workers, and I concur with the gentleman from Iowa that a report from the Secretary detailing the administration of the compensation program would provide Congress with highly valuable insight into the agency's implementation of the program. 
   Streamlining and expediting the method through which claims are processed and compensation provided is in the best interests of the families and claimants to whom our country owes its deepest gratitude and respect. 
   I'd be happy to work with the gentleman to request this information from the Department and to ensure that the true intent of the program is being carried out with due diligence by the administration.

   Mr. OBEY. There are two problems I have with this amendment. First of all, it seeks to cut $10 million from an item in the bill which is meant to establish full-service community schools. These are supposed to be schools which test the concept of making schools neighborhood centers which include early childhood education, remedial education, academic enrichment activities, programs that promote parental involvement and family literacy, mentoring and other youth development programs. It's meant to be a much more holistic educational experience than is usually found in an individual school. We believe that that deserves an opportunity to be tested. 
   Secondly, I would simply say that, lest this amendment be portrayed as an amendment that does anything significant for special education, I want to point out that this is an especially marginal amendment. The damage it does to the neighborhood school concept that we are trying to explore in the bill is far larger than the negligible impact that it has on the special education program. 
   What I mean by that is this: Special education is an $11 billion program. This amendment adds $10 million to it. It is another one of those symbolic amendments which I think ought to be placed in context. 
   The committee has already increased this account by $500 million. It is $800 million above the President, and it seems to me that, by comparison, the amendment is demonstrably but a blip on the radar screen in comparison to the funds that we have already put in this bill. 
   Now, I know that many of these amendments can be offered, and they can be converted into nice, sweetly packaged 30-second TV spots which tend to leave the impression that a Member has done something significant. Unfortunately, this amendment doesn't fit into that category of being significant, and it may make a very good television spot, but I doubt it's going to be very meaningful in the scheme of things. 
   I would ask for a ``no'' vote.

   Mr. OBEY. Let me take back my time because I only have 5 minutes. But I agree with the gentleman. Many programs are underfunded in this bill. 
   Let me simply say, Mr. Chairman, that I would certainly support the gentleman's amendment if I thought that we had all of the excellent teachers in the country that we need, but the fact is we don't. 
   This is not a program that should be cut back or eliminated. This is a program that works. This is a program which helps teach trainers to go through rigorous certification processes. They are star teachers. They go back to their school districts, they become lead teachers in their schools, and I hardly think that that is damaging the national interest. 
   And I must also confess a certain amount of confusion, because just about an hour ago we were told by a series of Members that we should support the teacher incentive program because we needed to incentivize teachers to increase their skills. And now we have a program that does just that and identifies teachers based on merit, and we're told we ought to cut back the program. 
   Let me simply say that if you take a look at the way this program has been evaluated, the National Boards for Professional Teaching Standards tells us that this program raises student achievement. It inspires deeper learning. It improves teacher practice. It creates transformative professional development, and it helps these schools to retain teachers. 
   Let me say that there is a tiny increase in this program. That increase is aimed at helping teachers from low-income schools get master teacher certification. 
   We've been told for years that the toughest thing to do in education is to get your best teachers to go into your poorest schools or the schools in your poorest neighborhoods. This is a program that's effective in doing that. We ought not to throw the baby out with the bath water. 
   I would urge opposition to the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

Rather, they lost the last election, in my view, because the public so clearly understood that their party preferred to put spending $57 billion in tax cuts for people who make over $1 million to providing decent funding for education.     
   And the public understood that the other party preferred to spend $600 billion in Iraq rather than spending a small portion of that at home for science and health care and the like to meet some of the needs of our own people. That is why the gentleman's party lost the last election, not because they did too much for education but because they were out of touch. 
   Having said that, let me simply say that this amendment eliminates funding for the National Writing Project. I would simply point out that this program supports teacher training programs so that teachers can help students write effectively and school districts match those funds dollar for dollar.  
   I must say all of us have large turnover of our staff here on Capitol Hill. The number one problem that I have in my office and the number one problem I have heard so many other Members comment on is that when young people come in and interview for jobs, they don't know how to write. 
   When both of my sons went away to college, at least my oldest son asked me, ``Dad, what do you think is the most important thing to learn?'' 
   And I said, I think the most important thing to learn is how to write because if you can write clearly, it means you are thinking clearly, and if you are thinking clearly, it means you can communicate. And I would say that I don't think that this country is over blessed with a number of great writers. I also must say if you listen to some of the congressional speeches written by our staffs, you would certainly agree that we need more help in writing in this country. 
   So let me simply say that I understand that we are engaged in a little filibuster by amendment. But nonetheless, I wanted to take this time to simply urge Members to vote against this amendment. If you believe in raising the quality of discourse in this country, you have to start with writing, and that is what this program tries to do. 
   I would urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to bring to the House the following facts: We have been at this bill now for the better part of yesterday. We have been on this bill since 10:30 this morning, and we have been trying to negotiate a unanimous consent agreement so that Members might be able to leave here tomorrow night. I know there is a CODEL of Members going to Iraq but I want to put them on notice now. I doubt very much that you are going to make it unless you want to miss a lot of votes because as things are developing, I am told that right now, because of the insistence that a number of amendments, which we have heard time and time again, will still be subjected to 40 minutes' debate time even though there are five similar amendments, each of which will take about 40 minutes. When you calculate it all, it comes out to about 800 minutes of debate time. That means roughly 13 hours. By the time you account for slippage, the time it takes for Members to be recognized, the time it takes for them to find their amendments, you have to add about another 5 hours plus your voting time. 
   What that means is that if we continue until 1 o'clock this morning, it will still probably be required for Members to be here until about 8 o'clock or later tomorrow night, which means that we will finish just in time for you to all miss your planes. 
   I just wanted you to know that so that if you think that you would like to see another result, you talk to individuals who right now seem to think that 40 minutes' time on a repetitive amendment is more important than ending a filibuster by amendment. 
   Two years ago when this bill was on the floor, it took about 12 hours. At this rate it will take about three times that amount of time. So I want Members who are coming up to me asking me about whether they are going to be able to make their planes or their CODELs, I want them to understand that if they miss them, I want them to know who to blame because it is not going to be me.

   Mr. OBEY. If the gentleman would yield, I would like to thank the gentleman for bringing to our attention the important work that the U.S. Forest Service has done in running its 19 Job Corps centers. 
   I have reviewed the provision in the Senate Interior Appropriations bill. I support retaining the language in conference that directs the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to execute an agreement to transfer the three Job Corps centers currently administered by the National Park Service to the U.S. Forest Service. 
   I hope the Department of Labor will recognize the merits of this approach which I understand was successful in another case involving the Mingo Job Corps Center in Missouri several years ago. 
   I also understand that the Secretaries of Interior and Agriculture support this approach and expect to work cooperatively with the Secretary of Labor on this matter.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, let me simply ask the House one question: Do we really know everything that we need to know about how children learn? Do we really know enough about how children learn to guarantee that every child will perform to their maximum ability and potential? I think the answer to that is obvious: we obviously don't. 
   There is no great political constituency for educational research. But you know it's a funny thing, in any field of endeavor, research is what separates bull gravy from intelligent approaches to issues. That's what research does: it helps lead one to a right understanding of a problem. 
   What this amendment is, frankly, it's another television ad. What this amendment does is to pretend that it does no damage to education by eliminating $50 million out of the educational research budget. It then puts it into special education. 
   We have a lot of posing for holy pictures on this floor by Members who are trying to escape the fact that the White House is asking them to vote against this bill because the White House claims there is too much money in the bill when, in fact, every single one of these amendments demonstrates that our own Republican Members know that there is not enough money in this bill to fund programs like special education unless you make damaging cuts to other portions of the bill. And I would suggest that we not do that. 
   The President cut special education in his budget by $291 million. We have added $800 million in the committee bill to that, and we're $509 million over last year. 
   I would also point out that this is a 10 percent cut, if this amendment passes, in the research account. And I would point out that this amendment would cut the National Center for Education Statistics, which is the premier educational statistical operation in the country. This amendment would even cut Federal research funds for special education. Do we really know so much about the needs of special education kids that we're going to cut that research? I don't think so. 
   I think the responsible vote is ``no,'' and I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I wonder if anybody remembers these words: ``Whatsoever you do for the least of your brethren, you do for Me.'' I wonder if anybody remembers those words? 
   This amendment is truly amazing to me. This amendment is offered by a Member of the House, who, like me, any time he has an ache or a pain or a toothache or is having a bad day, can trot down to the Attending Physician and have the doctors and the nurses check us over to make sure that we are in peachy keen shape. But what does this amendment say? This amendment says to some of the poorest people in the country, our migrant and our farm workers, sorry, you can't have vocational rehabilitation services if you've got a physical problem. 
   I would like to ask every Member of this House, have you ever picked cucumbers during the summer? Have you ever picked beans? Well, I have. I can tell you it is darn hard work. I used to represent a county by the name of Waushara County--wall to wall irrigation and crops like cucumbers and beans. I used to watch those migrant workers come in and work their tails off to get a few bucks. 
   Are we really so stingy? Are we really so utilitarian that we are willing to say to workers like that, sorry, Members of Congress are important, so they can get taken care of whenever they have got a physical problem. But oh no, don't you dare waste the taxpayers' money when it comes to some poor devil in the migrant stream or when it comes to their family or kids. 
   You want to vote for this amendment? You go right ahead. Count me out.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I have been trying to figure out what we ought to be calling these amendments that have been offered for 2 days. I have concluded that we ought to call them the congressional rubber-stamp amendments, because what is happening is we are seeing amendment after amendment offered that would simply return these funding levels to the exact level recommended by the President. 
   Now I see story after story indicating that a good many of my friends on the other side of the aisle are anxious to separate themselves from the President these days, but we have evidently a few members of their caucus who are eager to embrace virtually every action and every thought that comes from the White House. I find that very interesting. 
   The President felt we ought to eliminate this program. What does this program do? This program provides $60 million in grants to States to offer needs-based student scholarships. There are 165,000 students who will benefit from this program, getting scholarships of $1,000. I would simply ask, does anybody really believe that we are providing enough help for working families to send their kids to college? 
   The Pell Grant program is the major program upon which we rely in order to help students from lower and middle-income families find enough money to go on to college. When that program was in its heyday in the seventies, it provided over 70 percent of the cost of attending a 4-year public university. It provided help in the form of a Pell Grant to meet that percentage of the cost. Today, it is down to a little over 30 percent of the cost. So we have shifted a huge percentage of the cost to working families. 
   The President's answer in his budget this year was to move Pell Grants from one side of the budget to the other making it, instead of a discretionary program, a mandatory program and in the process decided he was going to pay for the increase in the Pell Grants by eliminating virtually every other student aid program on the books except Pell and Work Study. 
   I would suggest if you think that is a good idea, go ahead, follow the President over the cliff and vote to deny these 165,000 students the additional help they need. The money that we invest in student aid is returned to this country many times over. We are in a competitive world. Over 50 percent of the jobs that will be offered in this country in the next 7 years are jobs that will require a higher education, and it seems to me instead of running away from that obligation, we ought to be embracing it. This is a very bad idea. I urge defeat of the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, everyone knows that I have a great deal of affection for the gentleman from Florida. I think he makes as good an argument for a bad case as you can possibly find. Let me simply say that this recommittal motion is very easy to understand, which is why it ought to be defeated. It simply gives the President all the money in this bill, unconditionally. It is simply a down payment on business as usual. It simply strips the timeline from this legislation. It renews the authority for torture. It eliminates the requirement that interrogation activities follow the Army Field Manual. Outside of those problems, it's a terrific idea. 
   So I would simply urge a ``no'' vote on the motion to recommit. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murtha).

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, the last person in the world I will take lectures from on the appropriations process is the gentleman from California. The fact is that when he was the chairman of the Appropriations Committee last year, they never bothered to send any veterans health care legislation to the President at all. They simply, after the election, shut down the Congress and went home without sending one dime to veterans.

   Mr. Speaker, I would appreciate not being interrupted. It's a technique which they use on that side of the aisle time after time. I hope it comes out of their time, not mine. 
   The fact is that they never bothered to send a dime to the needy veterans of the country. And so it was only after the Democrats took control of the House that we added $3.4 billion to the veterans health care budget and sent it to the President, and then later in the year in the regular bill, we have added $3.6 billion more. So I will be happy to compare the record of this party with his party any time on the issue of veterans health care.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBEY. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 3074, TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to make a few observations about the White House comments on this bill, because we are told that the White House intends to veto this bill. 
   Let me point out some facts about this bill. This bill spends about $105 billion, all told. Much has been made in the debate this morning or this afternoon about earmarks in this bill. Earmarks are about 1 percent of all of the funds that are provided in this bill, around $1.2 billion. 
   For reference, last year, the appropriation, or rather the transportation authorization bill included about $20 billion in earmarks. I didn't see the President talking about vetoing that bill. I find it quaint that he now purports to be upset because this bill contains \1/20\ the earmark level of bills that he has previously signed. 
   I would also note that the President objects to the elimination of the deep cuts which this bill contains for the Community Development Block Grant and for housing programs. There is no individual in this country who is a greater beneficiary of taxpayer-subsidized housing than the President of the United States. He lives in that big white house on Pennsylvania Avenue. He doesn't have to worry about having a driver's license to drive on the roads in this country because he has nice chauffeurs and nice limousines which are transported everywhere around the country. He has lots of people in the kitchen to prepare any meal that he wants prepared. If he wants to have a relaxing weekend, he can go out to Camp David, and he can take a helicopter so he doesn't have to worry about beating the traffic. And yet, this President objects to the fact that we are trying to do a mite more than his budget does for low-income housing in this country. 
   Section 8 housing, he's very unhappy about the fact that we've increased funding for that. It just seems to me that this is one case of the pot calling the kettle black if the President objects to that kind of funding. 
   When we first started putting together appropriation bills, Mr. Speaker, I asked each of the subcommittee Chairs to disregard the year-to-year arguments that we've usually had in this place, and I asked all of the chairmen and chairwomen to ask themselves: What is this country going to look like in 5 and 10 years? And in the case of this bill, how many more cars are there going to be on the road? How much more pressure are we going to have for our rail traffic, both passenger and transport, or freight? 
   I asked people to look at what the expanded population would mean in terms of added demand for housing for the elderly, as well as low-income housing. And then I asked the Chairs to try to prepare a bill which would get us to where we needed to be over a 5- or 10-year period in order to meet those challenges. And that is essentially what this bill tries to do with very limited available funds. 
   Now, this bill contains about $5 billion increase in funding above the President's level. That's about 2 weeks of what we spend in Iraq. I make no apology for it. I wish it were more. No country can have an efficient economy if it doesn't have an efficient transportation system and if it doesn't have modern infrastructure. This is one of the bills that tries to meet those demands. 
   So the President, if he wants, can invent a disagreement with the Congress and veto the bill if he wants. But I think the American people will recognize, the American taxpayer will recognize, while they may not agree with every choice made in the bill, that this is a far more reasonable response to the future needs of the country than is the President's very pinched view of the investment needs that we have here at home. 
   So I would urge support to this bill on both sides of the aisle. It's been put together on a bipartisan basis. To my knowledge, every single Republican on the subcommittee signed the conference report. I think that there is not really very much in terms of policy which would recommend a ``no'' vote on this bill. And I urge Members to recognize that we've got an obligation to deal with the needs of the least visible people in our society, the least powerful, and the least well connected. This is one of the bills that tries to do that. 
   I urge an ``aye'' vote for the bill.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, we hear so many voices in this country and in this Chamber who are willing to fight to the last drop of someone else's blood. Those of us who are supporting this resolution today are being accused of being for ``precipitous withdrawal.'' I hardly think that seeing this war continue for another 14 months constitutes precipitous withdrawal. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is 56 months since the United States first launched its attack against Iraq. It is 4 1/2 years since the President appeared before his ``Mission Accomplished'' banner on that carrier. It is almost 5 years since the administration ignored the advice of General Shinseki. It is 2 1/2 years since Vice President Cheney said that he thought the insurgency was in its last throes. Since that time, we have had 3,800 Americans killed and 28,000 wounded. We have had 8,000 Iraqi military personal killed and 38,000 civilians killed. We have had 4 million Iraqis displaced. 2.3 million of them have been displaced internally in the country. One and a half million have fled to Syria, 1 million to other countries. Not a pretty picture. 
   This war is the most colossal blunder in modern U.S. history. It is a mistake that has shattered our influence in the region, and it has made the one country in the region that we did not want to see strengthened, Iran, it has made them infinitely stronger in that region. We are in the process of borrowing $600 billion and we are not having the guts to pay the bill ourselves. 
   There is no sense of shared sacrifice in this country. The only families being asked to sacrifice are military families and they're being asked to sacrifice again and again and again and again. We aren't even willing to tax ourselves to pay for the cost of this war, so we're shoving off the cost to our kids. Shame on every one of us for making that decision. 
   In November, the public tried to send two messages to this Congress. The first was that they wanted a change in policy in Iraq. The second is that they wanted a change in domestic policy. And yet after blowing $600 billion in Iraq, after signing a Defense bill which adds $39 billion to spending levels over last year, the President has yesterday blocked our efforts to add $6 billion to pay for investments in education, health and medical research here at home.     
   The President is telling the American people, ``Forget what message you think you sent in November in the election.'' He is stiffing the American people. He is saying, ``Forget what message you thought you were sending to Washington; I am the `Great Decider' and we are going to do things my way.'' That is what we are getting out of the White House. Instead of compromise and instead of searching for common ground, the President is making clear that he prefers to govern through confrontation, he prefers to go it alone, with one-third support in the country and one-third support in the Congress. 
   The same is true in Iraq. This is the same President who decided to go it alone, with almost no allies, who decided to go it alone when it came to evaluating intelligence, ignoring the caution alerts that were sent by the State Department intelligence people and the CIA analysts. He bulldozed through. When Baker-Hamilton was produced to offer an opportunity for change, the President simply used that as an opportunity to say ``full steam ahead, no change in course'', and he has deepened and intensified our involvement in Iraq. 
   At home, he insists that Congress cuts 50 percent out of vocational education; he insists that we cut 1,100 grants out of medical research at the National Institutes of Health; he insists that we cut rural health programs by 54 percent; he insists that we cut low-income heating assistance programs by 18 percent; he insists that we cut financial support for programs under No Child Left Behind that he mandated in the first place. He insists that we cut all of that, and yet he demands $200 billion more for Iraq. I say enough is enough.  
   He gave a speech to the American people which was designed for the purpose of public deception, in my view, because it was designed to leave the impression that the President intended to reduce steadily our troop commitment in Iraq, when in reality it was intended to assure that 6 months from now we have the same number of troops we have there that we had 6 months ago. 
   Mr. Speaker, the President is asking for $200 billion more, and as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I announced that I had no intention of providing that money, but I made it clear I'd be happy to provide it all, provided that the President would recognize that we needed a policy change and would get on board with the determination to have a goal of removing our troops from combat operations by the end of next year. That is hardly precipitous. 
   So what this measure does, instead of giving the President $200 billion to continue the war, it gives him $50 billion to shut the war down. Instead of having troops there for the next 10 years, as the President indicated in his speech, we want to have them out by December of 2008. It requires redeployment to begin in 60 days, and it ends the authority for any agency of the United States Government whatsoever to engage in torture. 
   We are mired, Mr. Speaker, in Iraq because of the self-important illusions of hopeless romantics in the administration. We hear tell these days that the President talks a lot about Teddy Roosevelt and Winston Churchill. If that is the case, he is harboring dangerous illusions. He ought to heed the advice of a statesman 80 years ago who wrote the following. I will read excerpts from this letter. 
   ``I am deeply concerned about Iraq. The task you have given me is becoming really impossible. Incompetent Arab officials are disturbing some of the provinces and failing to collect revenue. We overpaid on last year's account, which it is almost certain Iraq will not be able to pay this year, thus entailing a supplementary estimate. . . I have had to maintain troops in Mosul all through the year in consequence of the Angora quarrel. This has upset the program of relief and will certainly lead to further expenditures. ..... I do not see what political strength there is to face a disaster of any kind, and I certainly cannot believe that in any circumstances any large reinforcements would be sent ..... In my own heart, I do not see what we are getting out of it. I think we should now put definitely to the assembly the position that unless they beg us to stay, and stay on our own terms in regard to efficient control, we shall actually evacuate before the close of the financial year. I would put this issue in the most brutal way, and if they are not prepared to urge us to stay and to cooperate in every manner, I would actually clear out. ..... 
   ``I think I must ask you for definite guidance at this stage as to what you wish and what you are prepared to do. At present, we are paying millions a year for the privilege of living on an ungrateful volcano out of which we are in no circumstances to get anything worth having.'' 
   That was the real Winston Churchill speaking in 1922 in a letter to Lloyd George. It seems to me that the President in the White House today ought to heed the words of Winston Churchill so long ago and at long last reconsider a policy change in Iraq. That is what this legislation is designed to stimulate. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 1/2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have heard significant discussion tonight about al Qaeda. And people seem to think that Iraq, the Iraq war was necessary in order to tackle al Qaeda. Well, that's backwards. 
   I can recall being out at CIA headquarters after 9/11. I can recall sitting out at CIA headquarters watching the Predator aircraft as they flew over Afghanistan, transmitting pictures back here in the search for bin Laden and al Qaeda. And I remember what those CIA people out there said, and the frustration they expressed because half of their resources were being diverted from the search for bin Laden and al Qaeda to prepare for the attack on Iraq. 
   It isn't that the war in Iraq was necessary to get at al Qaeda. The war in Iraq diverted us from concentrating on al Qaeda and bin Laden.     
   And we are still suffering the consequences today. 
   So let's keep the facts straight. Let's keep history straight. And let's keep our heads straight. The fact is that Iraq got in the way of our effort to get at al Qaeda and we have been suffering from that fact ever since.

   Mr. Speaker, this resolution keeps government functioning until Congress and the President can make final decisions on appropriation issues for fiscal year 2008. It is a clean CR. It funds all departments at last year's level. The only exception is a $5.2 billion appropriation for MRAPs, which are essential to protect our troops. It expires November 16.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me recite a slightly different version of recent history with respect to appropriation bills. 
   After 12 years of rule by the Republican Party, the American people gave the Democratic Party the privilege of moving into the majority in the last election. We were sworn in on January 4. At that point, not a single domestic appropriation bill had been passed by the previous Congress. 
   So before we could move to our own business for this year, we had to first clean up the unfinished business left by the previous Republican-controlled Congress. That took us 6 weeks. And in 6 weeks we passed the entire domestic budget; and, at the time we did that, we eliminated all earmarks. 
   Then we also set about to implement the earmark reform process which was spoken for by both political parties in this House. That took us an extra 3 weeks. During that time, we ramped up the number of hearings and the intensity of congressional oversight; and by the end of the hearing process we had doubled the number of hearings held by the previous Congress and restored a much more tenacious set of oversight habits. 
   We also were forced to confront the President on Iraq because of the unraveling situation in that misbegotten war. And we also, as we tried to pass our appropriation bills, had to endure filibuster by amendment on the part of the minority. They took more than 60 hours above the amount taken by the minority in the previous year on appropriation bills. 
   Republicans offered 339 amendments to the appropriation bills that we passed in the House, compared to 172 amendments that were offered by Democrats when we were in the minority. Despite all of that, we still managed to pass every single appropriation bill before the August recess. That is only the second time during the Bush administration that this House has passed all of its appropriation bills before the August recess. 
   Then those bills went to the Senate; and, as the gentleman indicated, they ran into considerable trouble. The Senate has passed four bills. I have asked them to proceed to pass as many additional bills as they can, and I hope that they do. And, incidentally, when they do bring up bills, I was told yesterday that you have between two and three hundred amendments filed to several of the bills, so you face a filibuster by amendment on the part of the minority in the Senate. As you know, under Senate rules, debate cannot be shut down unless you have 60 votes, rather than 50.  
   So that's the record as I see it. The gentleman from California has recited the record as he sees it. But I would suggest that what is important is what we do now. Where do we go from here? 
   Even as the Senate makes an effort to complete action on its bills, I would hope that we could shorten the process by sitting down now with the administration to work out compromises on those bills so that we don't have to spend the next 6 weeks continuing to define our differences.     
   I'm an old-fashioned legislator, and I believe that the way the parties ought to proceed is that we first ought to define our differences and then we ought to resolve them. We've already defined our differences with the passage of the 12 bills in the House. I doubt that the Senate bills are going to get any better from our standpoint, and so it seems to me that time's awasting. It seems to me that we would best serve the needs of the country if the administration would be willing to sit down with us now and begin discussions about how we might reach compromises on these bills so that we can move forward. 
   Now, let me make one additional point. The President is asking us to spend about $200 billion, every dollar of that borrowed, in order to finance the supplemental for the war in Iraq, and yet he is objecting to the fact that in the House-passed bills we tried to take about 1/10th that amount and use it for crucial investments in our country's future. 
   The job of this Congress, the job certainly of this committee, is to make investments that will benefit the country over the long haul, make us a stronger country, and make us a stronger society over the next 10 years. We don't believe on this side of the aisle, and I think in fact we had significant bipartisan agreement if you take a look at the votes, we don't believe that you accomplish that strengthening of the country by cutting vocational education by 50 percent, as the President does in his budget; by eliminating all student aid programs except work study and Pell Grant, as the President does in his budget; by gutting education technology grants, as the President does in his budget; by actually reducing the number of medical research grants at NIH, as the President does in his budget. I've never had anybody come up to me in my life and say, ``OBEY, why don't you guys in Congress get your act together and cut cancer research.'' And yet, that's what the Congress has done the last 2 years. We don't think that ought to happen. So that's why we depart from the President on that score. 
   We also don't think we strengthen the country when we cut special education by $300 million, and there are a good many Republicans who agree with that. In fact, Mr. Walsh, the ranking Republican on the Labor, Health, Education and Social Services Subcommittee, Mr. Walsh, led the effort to increase the funds that our committee provided for special education, and I commend him for it. 
   We also don't think it's good to cut mental health and drug abuse funding by $160 million. We don't think that we strengthen the society or this country when we cut minority health professions training by 66 percent. We don't think that we improve health care for children by cutting the training of medical personnel in children's hospitals by 63 percent, and we don't think we strengthen rural America by cutting rural health programs by 54 percent. 
   We don't think we help make our communities better and cleaner by cutting the clean water revolving fund by 37 percent, as the President does. We don't believe that we meet the needs of our logging industry and the recreational needs of the American people when we cut the forest service budget by 15 percent, as the President's budget does. And we don't believe that we ought to cut housing for disabled Americans by 47 percent or senior housing by 20 percent. In an age of high gas prices and high energy prices, we don't believe that we ought to cut the low-income heating assistance program by 18 percent. 
   And let me say that Democrats are not the only ones who believe that. If you take a look and analyze the votes on the various appropriations bills that went through the House, you will see that on average we had 65 Republicans who voted with us in support of the appropriations bills that we sent over to the Senate. In fact, if you average out each of the rollcalls for each of the bills that passed, you will see that exactly two-thirds of this body voted for those bills. 
   So I think we have established a bipartisan foundation in the House for moving forward, and I hope this continuing resolution gives us the necessary time to do that. 
   I would hope that the Senate can move forward and complete its work on a bill-by-bill basis, but frankly, it is immaterial to me whether the bills are produced one by one or if they are produced in bunches. What counts is not the form. What counts is the substance. What counts is whether we make the right investments to make this country stronger over the long haul. That's our obligation, no matter how we package it. 
   So I would once again simply urge the administration to sit down with us and begin to talk about how, as adults, we can reach a compromise on these issues. 
   The President would have the country believe that we are blowing the lid outrageously on budgets and pouring money into the domestic budget. I would suggest that restoring $16 billion in Presidential cuts is mighty small potatoes in comparison to the $200 billion that he wants us to spend in Iraq and the $50 billion that he still wants us to provide for tax cuts for people making a million bucks a year. 
   Let me remind the House, Mr. Speaker, that in 1980 the appropriations for domestic budgets equaled 4.8 percent of our total national income. Today, they have been reduced to 2.9 percent of our total national income, and the President's budget would take us, by the year 2012, down to 2.4 percent of the Nation's income. That means that we would have cut in half our investments relative to our national wealth. We would have cut in half those domestic investments since 1980. I don't believe, and I think there are many in both parties who don't believe, that that is the way that we build a stronger future for this country. 
   So I would simply point out what we have here is an effort on our part to add about 2 percent to what the President is doing in the area of education, health care, science, law enforcement and all of that, and I'd simply suggest that, instead of continuing to talk about it, we sit down and have some more productive actions; we sit down and try to work out these differences between us so that we can leave town at a reasonable time, having completed our action on these bills and having met our responsibilities to make the investments that will, over the long haul, make this a stronger country. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to urge support for this motion. As those in this House who know me well understand, I come from the State of Joe McCarthy. And one of the reasons that I changed political parties, because I grew up in a Republican family, is because I saw what the local McCarthy supporters did to the best teacher I ever had when they impugned his patriotism by calling him a Bolshevik back during the McCarthy heyday. And to this day there is nothing that gets my dander up more than to have someone's patriotism questioned on this House floor or anywhere else in the political realm. And if I'm going to get upset when that kind of juvenile activity occurs on the part of the political right, then I've got an obligation to be equally upset when that kind of juvenile debate emanates from the left. 
   It seems to me that we all ought to recognize that we can have honest and profound differences with the policy that the general was selling 2 weeks ago without getting personal about it. I think what we ought to do is accept this motion, vote for it, send the continuing resolution to the Senate and get on with the business of negotiating out the content of these appropriation bills so that we can do our duty to the country. 
   I yield back the balance of my time and ask for an ``aye'' vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 12 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, why are we here? We are here because 4 years ago the President plunged us into a preemptive war in Iraq, a country that had not attacked the United States, and we took that action on the basis of bad information, manipulated intelligence, with no visible plans for governing after the war was over.     
   Mr. Speaker, that attack diverted us from the hunt for bin Laden, the person who did attack us. 
   The war has now gone on for 4 years and, as a result, we have seen chaos and carnage. We have seen over 3,000 American service men and women die, many times more wounded and maimed. We have seen our influence decimated throughout the Middle East. We have seen our reputation as the democratic hope of the world tarnished by stories about torture and rendition. 
   I voted against that war. There were 215 Republicans who voted for it and 6 that voted against it. There were 81 Democrats who voted for it and 126 Democrats who voted against it. We had 132 votes, in total, against going to war. And ever since that time, we have been trying to get to 218 votes so we can turn this country and this war around. 
   Over the last 4 years, this war has been fought with virtually no sense of shared sacrifice. Military families have done double and triple duty, while the rest of America has had to accept the sacrifice of a tax cut. That is about all that has been asked of most Americans. 
   We have spent a huge amount of our national treasure, and now the President is asking for another almost $100 billion for this war and asking for an additional $3.5 billion for his own domestic priorities. 
   This bill is our response. It says to the President: ``Okay, you can have that money, but only under certain terms and conditions.'' And we try to do three things: number one, to redirect a greater effort to the right war in Afghanistan, rather than the wrong war in Iraq. Secondly, we try to protect our troops to the maximum extent possible and correct the neglect that they have suffered as they have returned from the battlefield. And, thirdly, we are trying to send a message to Iraq politicians that they need to change direction; that we will no longer tolerate an open-ended, interminable babysitting job; that they must get together and begin to resolve their own differences. 
   This bill sets a timetable for repositioning our troops out of Iraq. The exact timetable will be determined by the performance of the Iraqis and whether or not they meet important political and military benchmarks. 
   And this bill establishes a target for finishing our redeployment in any circumstance. It recognizes that our troops won the war, but it also recognizes that the President's plan calls upon troops to do something that they do not have the power to do, namely, to convince Iraqi factions to reach reasonable compromises on their own turf. 
   It sets reasonable conditions for moving our troops into a different posture. It holds Iraqis accountable to standards that the President himself has laid out. And it puts us on a new direction with respect to the war in Iraq. 
   And it does some other things, too. It completes action on a number of leftover pieces of business that the previous Congress left to this new incoming Congress. 
   The President himself asked for $3.4 billion to deal with the needs of FEMA. We are also finishing action on the BRAC action which requires $3.1 billion in additional funding. We are finishing action on the need to improve family military housing to the tune of $3.4 billion. We are finishing action on rebuilding the lives and providing other assistance to the Katrina victims after the most devastating natural disaster in the history of our country. 
   We are finishing the action on the agriculture disaster problem that Congress wrestled with for well over a year in the previous Congress without coming to resolution. And we are providing the final $1 billion in funds to combat a potential pandemic flu, funds which the President himself requested in an emergency appropriation in the year 2005. 
   And we are also finishing action on the action begun last year by the Congress in trying to deal with the fact that 14 States are going to run out of child health money; and we need, therefore, to provide $750 million to see to it that low-income families and children in low-income families are not pushed off those State health care rolls. This is a request that has come in from Republican and Democratic Governors alike. 
   And we have also provided some additional funding, above what the President asked for, items which are not  last year's business, but which we think are important in terms of this year's business. 
   We are increasing funding for veterans health and defense health by $3.4 billion. We are, on the homeland security front, increasing funding substantially. The President, since days after 9/11, has been resisting virtually every congressional effort to add funding for homeland security, for border security, for cargo security and the like. 
   We are continuing the effort to provide significantly more money than the President has asked for. If anybody wants to argue with that, I would suggest they take it up with the 9/11 Commission. I would suggest they take it up with the Hart-Rudman Commission. I would suggest they take it up with the 9/11 families. Everybody but Anne Coulter, I think, would be responsive to what those families think. 
   And then we are also providing $1.2 billion in additional funding for our war in Afghanistan. Mr. Speaker, I sat at CIA headquarters and watched, right after 9/11, as our predator aircraft were searching Afghanistan for bin Laden. And I know what the people at that agency were saying when they expressed their frustration that the President was diverting a huge share of our resources in the hunt for bin Laden to prepare for the unilateral attack on Iraq. 
   What this bill is trying to do is to correct that by, again, refocusing additional attention on the war against Afghanistan. And I make absolutely no apology for the funds that we have in here. 
   Now, some will say this is not a perfect instrument. They will differ with the time line that we have for the repositioning of troops, and they will differ with the benchmarks. But what I would say to them is that what is important in this document today is not the exact wording. What is important is not the exact timetable. What is important is not the exact enumeration of benchmarks. What is important is that, for the first time, this Congress will be exercising its constitutional responsibilities to provide real oversight on the executive branch of government, and we will be trying to set this country on a new direction. 
   Someone in this House said last week that we are similar in our position to a board of directors for a corporation. He said the President is the CEO. The President's Cabinet represents his management team, and we are the board of directors. And when a board of directors of a corporation sees that the management of the corporation is leading it down a disastrous path, it has a fiduciary responsibility to its stockholders to step in and correct the problem. That is what we are trying to do in this legislation. In this case, we have a fiduciary responsibility and a representational responsibility to the taxpayers and to our constituents, and we are trying to meet that responsibility today. 
   Now, there are some who have criticized us for doing so, some in newspapers and some on this floor. Very frankly, I am getting a bit tired of those who were consistently wrong from the beginning on the issue of Iraq, I am getting tired of them lecturing those of us who were consistently right from the beginning in our opposition to this war. 
   And when people ask me why we don't have a better solution, I tell them of the old story about Eddie Stanky, who used to play second base for the New York Giants many years ago. And one day, Leo Durocher, the manager, was hitting ground balls to the infield, and Stanky dropped two in a row. And so Durocher grabbed a glove and said, ``Here, kid, I'm going to show you how it's done.'' And he went out to second base, and the very first ball Durocher dropped. And he turned to Stanky, and said, ``Kid, you got second base so screwed up, nobody can play it.'' 
   The fact is, if you substitute George Bush for Eddie Stanky and Iraq for second base, you have got the picture of what the problem is today. 
   Now, this Congress cannot run foreign policy, but it has an obligation to try to influence the policy and influence the conduct of that policy when we see it headed down the wrong path. Mr. Murtha has tried to lead the way in seeing to it that we face up to those responsibilities, and this legislation will give us an opportunity to do that. 
   I would hope it would be supported on a bipartisan basis. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   The gentleman talks about how we need to support General Petraeus. Let me quote from Thomas Friedman, who has had years of experience in understanding the Middle East. He said: I hope the Democrats under Speaker  Nancy Pelosi keep pushing to set a deadline for withdrawal from Iraq because they are providing two patriotic services that the Republicans failed to offer in the previous 4 years. The first is policy discipline. The other useful function Speaker Pelosi and her colleagues are performing is to give the President and General David Petraeus, our Commander in Iraq, the leverage of a deadline without a formal deadline. How so? The surge cannot work without political reconciliation among Iraqi factions, which means Sunni-Shiite negotiations, and such negotiations are unlikely to work without America having the leverage of telling the parties that if they do not compromise, we will leave. Deadlines matter. At some point Iraqis have to figure this out themselves. Since Mr. Bush refuses to set a deadline, Speaker Pelosi is the next best thing. Do not underestimate how useful it is for General Petraeus to be.

   Mr. OBEY. I yield myself 1 minute. 
   I would say to the gentleman who just spoke, for the last 4 years we have tried it your way. For the last 4 years we have had a Congress that did whatever George Bush wanted it to do, rubber-stamp, lock-step all the way. 
   Today is different. Today we have a Congress that is responding to what the public asked for in the last election. What you are seeing today is the new world of checks and balances. Get used to it. It is what the public asked for, and it is what they are going to get out of this Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. First of all, Madam Speaker, I will not take the full time, but I simply want to rise to thank the staff that has helped to put these bills together: Cheryl Smith, Sue Quantius, Nicole Kunko, Teri Bergman, Andria Oliver, Beth Chaney, Rob Nabors, David Reich, Kirstin Brost, Lesley Turner, John Daniel, Christina Hamilton, Steve Crane, Anne Marie Goldsmith, Ron Anderson, all the associate staff and the staff on both sides of the aisle. 
   I also want to express my appreciation to Mr. Walsh. He is a good man and I think he understands these issues very thoroughly. 
   Having said that, I would like to spend just a few moments to talk about what this debate is really about, because, so far, it has skirted around the edges. 
   The fact is that last November the public sent two messages to Washington. The first is that they wanted a change in Iraqi policy and the second is that they wanted a change in priorities here at home. 
   The President has decided to stiff the American public and reject both of those messages. First, what he is saying to the American people is forget what message you thought you were sending in the last election. I am the great decider and we are going to do things my way. That is what is happening here. 
   The President isn't just stiffing the Congress when he says that he will veto any appropriation bill that departs from his budget ceiling by one dollar. He is also stiffing the American people, who made it quite clear that they thought very little of his budget and foreign policy priorities. 
   Since that time, since the election, the President had said ``stay the course'' in Iraq, and in addition to the gargantuan defense budget that he has asked for, he is also asking for $200 billion in additional spending just to deal with the war that he started.     
   He is also saying stay the course when it comes to the $60 billion we are providing this year in tax cuts for people who make a million dollars a year. But at the same time, Madam Speaker, he is saying oh, tut, tut, tut, we cannot afford to invest here at home, so he sends the Congress a budget which cuts $16 billion out of education, out of health care, out of science, out of law enforcement and other critical domestic national priorities. And then he threatens to veto any appropriation bill that departs from his great wisdom. 
   Well, let's walk through where this bill would be and what it would look like tonight if we had followed the President's budget advice. If this bill did what the President wanted to do in his budget, it would be cutting vocational education by 50 percent. Is there anybody on either side of the aisle who is shortsighted enough to think that is a good idea? 
   If we had followed his instructions, we would have eliminated every student aid program on the books except Work-Study and Pell Grants. 
   In the area of handicapped education, there are a number of Members on the Republican side of the aisle who have made that their number one priority. They want to raise funds for special education. The President suggested we cut $300 million out of that program. Even the Republican Party objected in the House to that, and they raised the money that I had provided in the chairman's mark above the mark that we had provided, and we restored a significant amount of money to that program. 
   The President wanted us to cut mental health services by $100 million. He wanted us to cut funds that teach medical personnel how to deal with illness in children's hospitals by 63 percent. The President wanted us to cut rural health programs by 54 percent. He wanted us to cut the Low-Income Heating Assistance Program by 18 percent. We have rejected those cuts, and this House on a bipartisan basis provided 53 Republican votes for this bill as it left the House. 
   Now some people say this bill spends too much. This bill is a billion dollars less than it was when it left the House because we cut that in a concession to our minority party Members. 
   We have also in the bill respected a good many Republican priorities and respected a good many Republican initiatives, and in the process we have cut $1 billion. 
   Surely, surely at a time when we are spending $200 billion or close to it in Iraq, surely we can spend the equivalent of what we spend in Iraq in 6 weeks in order to meet high-priority domestic needs in the education, health, and job training areas. 
   Now our Republican friends cry newly found crocodile tears because we are also marrying this bill up with the military construction bill. Well, it seems to me if we can't agree on the advisability of the war, at least we ought to be able to agree how we feel about the warriors. And what we are doing in this bill is adding $3.5 billion for veterans health care. And we paid for it. We paid for it by making an identical reduction in the Defense appropriation bill, but that didn't suit the President. He said you have to pay for it again, and so he has issued this dictate that we pay for this increase in veterans health care twice by now going in and cutting other domestic programs by $3.5 billion. And that is why we are marrying these two bills together, because we want the public to see what the specifics are. We want the public to see what the domestic priorities are that would have to be cut if the President wants us to double pay for the bill we have already paid for in increasing veterans health care by $3.5 billion. 
   Now the President says he is going to veto any bill we send him, and the House Republican leadership says they already have the votes to sustain any veto the President makes. So we have a choice. We can sit here like potted palms and do nothing and supinely roll over to the President's dictation; or we can try to make it as uncomfortable as possible for him to be irresponsible and unnecessarily confrontational. And that's what we are trying to do. 
   We are sending these bills to the Senate because it is the right thing to do. And as the gentleman from Texas points out, when the minority says that this is an unprecedented act, that is absolute nonsense, because they did the same thing four times themselves; nary a peep from anybody on that side of the aisle then. 
   I would simply make one last point. We have heard the slogan ``better late than never.'' Well, last year the Republicans decided rather than being late, they chose never. And they delivered not one dollar, not one dollar in additional expenditures for veterans health care, and it fell to us after they shut this Congress down and went home without appropriating a single dollar in veterans health care. It was left to us to fix that mess and to add over $3.5 billion in new funding for veterans. We did it last year. We are doing it again this year. We have made it our number one priority. 
   But that isn't what the boys and the girls on the other side of the aisle want to talk about. They want to obscure a few facts. And here they are:  
   In health care, the President cut funding for the primary Federal agencies responsible for increasing health care access in this country. This conference report rejects those cuts and provides $1.5 billion above the President's request to provide programs to improve health care access for the millions of Americans that don't have it. We do that at the cost of 5 days of what we spend in Iraq. 
   On education, the President cut funding for the Department of Education by $1.2 billion. This conference report rejects those cuts. We invest $4.5 billion above the President's request to the Department of Education, roughly the cost of 2 weeks in Iraq. And by doing that, we provide strong increases for Pell Grants, Head Start and various other education programs. 
   In job training, the President cut the largest job training in vocational education programs by $1.2 billion. This conference report rejects those cuts and invests $1.3 billion above the President's request, roughly the cost of 4 days of the war in Iraq. 
   In medical research, the President cut funding for medical research at the National Institutes of Health by $480 million. I have never had anybody in my life come to me and say, ``Obey, why don't you guys in Washington get together and cut cancer research.'' But that's what the previous Congress did in each of the last 2 years. They cut 1,100 grants out of the National Institutes of Health with the complicity of this President. We are saying no way. Let's have an end to that nonsense. We reject those cuts. We invest $1.4 billion above the President's request, roughly the cost of 3 days of fighting in Iraq. 
   For economic development, in helping to alleviate poverty, the President slashed those programs by over a billion dollars. We rejected those cuts, costing roughly 4 days of what we spend in Iraq. 
   Lastly, the Low-Income Heating Assistance Program. The President comes from an oil State. He knows energy prices have skyrocketed, but he has cut LIHEAP by $380 million in his budget. We have rejected those cuts and invested $630 million more than the President's request, roughly the cost of 2 days of activity in Iraq. 
   So we are left with this. We are left with two arguments. We hear some of our Republican friends say we are going to vote ``no,'' we are going to vote against the Labor-Health-Education bill because we don't like the fact that the bill also contains the veterans funding. And we hear others say we are going to vote ``no'' on the Military Construction bill because we don't like the fact that it contains too much for education and health. Those are two beauties as reasons for voting against this bill. 
   I want to see whether the minority party Members of this House, I want to see whether they are going to be following the wishes of their constituents or whether they have their votes tied once again lock, stock and barrel to the President's desk. I want to see if they came here to represent their constituents or be another set of lemmings jumping off the cliff once again for this President. We will find out on that vote tonight. I hope we see the right vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Let me simply say the reason these amendments are in the self-executing rule is that we agree with you that under the circumstances they should not be in the bill. 
   As I warned the House when we first started bringing appropriation bills to the floor, our committee did not have enough time to adequately get all of these amendments that were coming at us, and so we asked for a process which would allow us during the month of August to review all of them. 
   In the end the House decided they did not want to do that. One of the major reasons is because Members of your party wanted to make certain that we had an opportunity to deal with them on the floor now. I warned at the time that meant that mistakes would be made. They were. When we caught the mistake, I went to the Rules Committee and Mr. Mollohan agreed that under the circumstances they ought to come out. 
   We ought to be congratulated for it, rather than being questioned about it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I think we again need to remind ourselves why we are here in this situation. And I don't like it, but we are here because people need to experience the consequences of their own actions, at least adults do. 
   Why are we here? We are here because as the distinguished majority leader pointed out, despite the agreement that we felt we had reached for consideration of the appropriation bills, we had seen more than 4 hours of dilatory action the last time this bill was on the floor. As a result, this House was not able to complete action on a single provision in the agriculture appropriation bill even though we were told that the minority was really unhappy about something else totally unrelated to that bill. 
   So they dragged this out for 4 hours during which we were able to accomplish nothing. At the same time, the President is on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. At the same time we have had foot-dragging on the part of the minority on this bill, the President held a press conference this morning in which he is attacking the Congress for not moving these bills at a sufficiently rapid speed. 
   Secondly, I would point out that, as the distinguished majority leader indicated, we have spent some 86 hours more debating appropriation bills this session than we spent debating appropriation bills the previous session when the now-minority party was then in control. Why was that the case? Because last year we considered 144 amendments to those appropriation bills, whereas this year we have considered 339 amendments. That is a 77 percent increase. It illustrates why I keep referring to filibuster by way of amendment. 
   There comes a time when we have to face the fact that if the public's work is to be done, we need to move these bills forward. It was very clear that this bill was going nowhere the last time it was on the floor. The distinguished majority leader informed the minority if that was the case, we would have to go to the Rules Committee in order to move the people's business forward. That is exactly what we have done. 
   With respect to his criticism about this rule containing self-executing provisions, I would simply point out that on eight occasions when the gentleman from California was chairman, his committee reported out, and this House passed, self-executing rules. 
   In 2000, it occurred on the Transportation, Labor-HHS and Agriculture bills. 
   In 2001, it occurred on Agriculture, Treasury-Postal, Foreign Ops and Energy and Water. 
   In 2002, it occurred on the Interior bill. And I have them before me. 
   In each case, they contain the magic words ``provides that the amendment or amendments printed in the Rules Committee report accompanying the rule shall be considered as adopted.'' 
   Let me simply point out that I think it is indeed regrettable that we have had to adopt this approach in order to finish the public's business on time. But in fact, if Members of the minority want to know why it was required, all they have to do is look in the mirror. 
   Now I would yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier).

   Mr. OBEY. Reclaiming my time, with all due respect, this amendment makes in order 14 amendments. The majority of those amendments are Republican amendments. One of them is an amendment by the gentleman from Arizona that in fact goes after a project in the district of the majority leader. That is hardly shutting down the process. 
   Mr. Speaker, they were the ones who shut down the process 2 days ago when they refused to allow us to consider a single new amendment during a 4-hour period.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
   Let me simply say the gentleman says we have ``shut down the appropriations process.'' That is absolute nonsense. We are making in order 12 amendments, all of them Republican amendments. Three of the six self-executing amendments are amendments that are sponsored in all or in part by Republicans. 
   If anyone shut down the process, it was the minority party which filibustered for 4 hours the last time this bill was on the floor and didn't allow us to complete consideration of a single item in the bill. Not one. In addition to which when we tried to pursue a unanimous consent agreement before that bill hit the floor, we were denied that opportunity by the minority party. 
   We had an understanding with the minority party that these bills would be finished in roughly equivalent time to that which was taken last year. The minority party was so angry about a bill that was going to extend health care to 5 million additional kids they walked away from that agreement, and that's why we are here today.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, let me simply say that of all people, the gentleman who just spoke is way off base when he cries about being denied an opportunity to deal with an amendment. 
   It was his amendment for $50,000 that this House debated for 4 hours without coming to a resolution thereon because of the filibuster that was being conducted on that side of the aisle. To suggest that somehow that Member, who single-handedly held us up for 4 hours, to suggest that he was denied, is a joke.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Speaker, my understanding, and if the gentleman will shortly yield to the distinguished minority leader and the distinguished majority leader, but my understanding of this provision is that it seeks to assure that there are two kinds of remedies available to items that are in conference. My understanding is that if  the Senate adopts an amendment and the conferees do not like that amendment, then their remedy is to oppose the Senate amendment in conference and refuse to accept it. The question then becomes, well, what is the remedy of each individual Member if something is airdropped that was not in either the House or the Senate bill? 
   My understanding of the provision is that at that point, any Member has the right to raise a point of order against consideration of the conference report, and if that point of order is upheld by the House, then the conference report is sent back to the conferees for correction or adjustment.

   Mr. OBEY. That is correct, as I understand the agreement. 
   As the majority leader has pointed out, the only exception to that is that the Energy and Water bill needs to proceed, but it takes a longer period of time to prepare the earmarks. So we will complete action on the Energy and Water bill except for the question of which earmarks would be attached to that. We will then have a separate report which is reported to the House, and the House will then have the opportunity to consider those earmarks. And after that consideration is completed, then, only then, will that bill be sent to the Senate. So when it goes to the Senate, it will be one document.

   Mr. OBEY. The House is now proceeding under a unanimous-consent agreement which in addition to the hours already covered will limit total time for consideration of this bill to 24 1/2 hours. This is a limit of an additional 6 1/2 hours which we will have to endure tonight. 
   The UC agreement also allows the filing of supplemental reports to enable earmarks to be added to the Interior and Energy and Water appropriation bills without returning the bills to committee. It is expected that this will slow down consideration of the Interior bill by about a week. 
   We will complete action on the Energy and Water bill on the floor next  week, but will not send it to the Senate until the House has an opportunity to act upon the projects that will be attached to that bill. That bill will probably not be sent to the Senate until July. 
   This agreement is part of a larger agreement that contains the following additional understandings: 
   There will be a unanimous-consent agreement for Military Construction that limits consideration of amendments and time on that bill. 
   With respect to the Homeland and Military Construction bills, both bills will be allowed to proceed without earmarks, which, if they are provided, will be added in conference. The intention is that when those bills come back from conference, a point of order against consideration will be in order against any projects that were not in the House or Senate bill, and if those points of order are upheld by the House, the report will go back to the conference for adjustment. 
   The Financial Services, Foreign Operations and Legislative Branch bills, three bills that have already been reported out of committee, will briefly be sent back to committee so that earmarks can be added. The minority party has agreed to expedited procedures to consider these bills once the earmarks have been attached. That will slow consideration of the bills by up to 2 weeks.     
   CJS will not be considered until the proposed earmarks are ready for attachment, hopefully before the July 4 recess. 
   The Labor-HHS, Transportation, HUD and Agriculture bills will be considered after the July 4 recess, that is a change, in order to give committee staff more time to include earmarks for those bills. 
   The minority has agreed that they will help facilitate reasonably speedy consideration of the remaining bills. The expectation is that the House will adopt UC agreements to place reasonable limitations on the time for consideration for each of the appropriations bills which are expected to be roughly and generally similar to the overall time agreements that were adopted for consideration of appropriation bills in the past. 
   The bill managers will be expected to be reasonably flexible in establishing those time limits if modest flexibility is required. This is the understanding of the Appropriations Committee and the House Democratic and Republican leadership. 
   The House should be pleased with this agreement because it recognizes the reality that there is not enough time to responsibly include earmarks in the earliest appropriations bills to be considered by the House. While providing that recognition, it assures a reasonable process that will provide an opportunity to question earmarks.

   Mr. OBEY. Let me correct the gentleman in one respect. There was no change of heart on the part of the majority leadership on anything to my knowledge. 
   Secondly, if we are talking about trust, the fact is that I have been asked in this agreement to trust the word of the minority leader that when we describe what the conduct will be during future appropriation bills, that that conduct will be reasonably close to what is described on this paper. There is no guarantee in this paper to me that that conduct will be appropriate conduct. 
   In this case, however, I am simply taking the word of the majority leader and the minority leader. If it is good enough for me, I hope it is good enough for you. And when the day comes that we cannot trust the word of the majority leader or the minority leader in this House, then this House is really in sad shape.

   Mr. OBEY. No. If the gentlewoman would yield, it is not going to be attached to another bill. The bill is already out of committee. It needs to proceed. It takes a great deal of time. There are a lot of things in that bill besides earmarks, thank God. We are trying to move the business ahead as fast as we can. 
   What this agreement states is that we will finish all of the nonproject-oriented issues in that bill. We will complete consideration of the bill except we will then rise, and when the report is finished that will be attached to the energy and water bill, it will be reported to the full House. When it is reported to the full House, we will then have before the House for consideration the projects that are included in that report and that will be during consideration of the energy and water bill itself. So it will not be a separate bill, it is the energy and water bill. 
   We are just allowing the projects to catch up to the bill. And then before the bill goes to the Senate, you will have a full opportunity to deal with the report and the energy and water bill simultaneously.

We wanted to simply perfect the statement which I just read to make certain that everyone agreed, and we thought when we had more time to review that and check for any changes, we would come right back to the House.

   Mr. OBEY. If you will take a look at the time that was taken for every bill last year, that time that we have been talking about included the entire time for consideration of the bill. So for example, when we say it took 17 hours and 12 minutes for the Commerce-Justice bill last year, that means it took 17 hours and 12 minutes to do the entire bill from start to finish. Only a part of that time was represented by the time allocated to amendments. 
   All we are saying is that it is our hope that we can keep each of these bills to roughly the same amount of total time. If you need some flexibility between the bills, the statement makes clear and the understanding is that we will try to show that flexibility so long as it is not abused.

   Mr. OBEY. Let me simply say that when we compiled these numbers, since there was no Labor-H bill considered last year, we simply looked at the amount of time that it took the previous year to consider the Labor-H bill, and that was 12 hours and 43 minutes. So I think that in 12 hours and 43 minutes, if Members have an objection to an earmark or any other provision, they are going to manage to find a way to bring it to the attention of the House. And if they can't figure out how, I would just ask that you talk to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee) and she will show you how to do it. She's 
   got a lot of experience.

   Mr. OBEY. Let me say, and then be very blunt about this, this agreement requires a lot of trust between people. I've had to rely on a lot of trust on the minority leader tonight, and I expect to have the right to expect the same consideration from others in this House. 
   We have not had much experience in the last 14 years at either producing or delaying reports. That has been the prerogative of the majority party. We're now the majority; and as you know, we had a lot of catch-up work to do from the last session, and we've been working long hours. It is not our responsibility to run the printing office. Sometimes we don't have control over when documents are printed. Sometimes the process breaks down there; sometimes it doesn't. 
   All I can assure the gentleman is that we are going to try to comply not only with the letter but the spirit of the rules of the House.     
   When I was in the minority, I was pushing very hard to see the 3-day practice maintained, even though the rule had been changed to 2 days. We intend to continue to do that.

   Mr. OBEY. No one is trying to hold back information. What I need is time to know what that information is. 
   With respect to the certifications you are talking about, they will be available in the committee office to the public, to Members of Congress, and they will meet whatever requirements, whatever other requirements of the rules that there are. All I can tell you is that we haven't given any consideration to earmarks at this point because we haven't had time to. 
   I think the agreement that we have here tonight finally recognizes the fact that if we're going to proceed with these bills, that we simply haven't had time to produce the initial earmarks. 
   We are slowing down this process considerably. I want to assure you that we're going to do everything we possibly can to comply with the spirit and the letter of the law. The gentleman knows me. I hope the gentleman regards me as someone who is up to his commitments.

   Mr. OBEY. If the gentleman would yield, one of the reasons I have been trying to explain to the House why it takes so long to carefully screen these earmarks, is 
   because many of the requests that come in are so vague that we don't understand where that money is intended to go to. 
   So then we have to go to the individual Member, and we have to say, hey, we really can't tell from your request where this is supposed to go. You  need to change your request so we know what you are talking about. Then we have to sort them out so we know that you don't have three people asking for the same thing in different language. That takes a lot of time. 
   So if the gentleman thinks that sometimes you're confused, so are we. That's why we were asking for more time. 
   I want to stipulate one thing. I recommended to this House a proposal that I thought would give us the best possibility of avoiding future embarrassment. This agreement indicates the House wants to go in a somewhat different direction. 
   That means that with respect to almost all of these bills, we will have less time for our staff to review them than would have been the case under the proposal that I was suggesting. 
   In my judgment, that means that we will run a higher risk of mistakes than we would have otherwise had, because we will not have the entire month of July for the staff to review these requests. 
   So I am giving up on that expectation for a higher level of staff review so that we can continue to do the people's business and get through these bills in time for program managers to get funding out for these programs in an orderly manner. 
   So a lot of us have a lot of complaints about this. I didn't invent the earmark process. If I had my way, there wouldn't be any, as the gentleman knows. 
   But it's my job as chairman not to pursue what I believe. It's my job to try to find a balanced point in the House that I think will achieve consensus in the House, hopefully between two parties. That's what I would try to do, and I will appreciate the recognition of that fact from the gentleman and every other Member of this body.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to lay out the context for this debate. Here is the record of our Republican friends when they controlled the House on the question of earmarks. In the last year that our party controlled the House before the Republicans took over, if you take the largest four domestic appropriations bills, there was a total of less than 800 earmarks in those bills. In the last year of the Republican regime in those same bills, there were more than 8,000. That's a thousand percent increase. 
   In the Labor-Health appropriation bill, the last year I was chairman there were zero earmarks in that bill. The last year that earmarks were considered in the Labor-Health bill under the Republican leadership, there were over 3,000 earmarks. 
   In addition, earmarks were used for internal blackmail. On one occasion, every Democrat who voted against the Labor-Health-Education bill because it insufficiently funded education and health and job training saw their earmark projects eliminated in retaliation, and I called that at the time internal blackmail. 
   It was then that I had my staff prepare the first analysis of the growth of earmarks during Republican control of this House. 
   In addition, we saw earmarks used in order to change votes on Medicare part D, that famous night where the roll call was held open for 3 hours while promises were made in order to turn enough votes around to turn a defeat into a victory for that program. 
   After the Cunningham affair, our Republican friends announced they were going to attach the names of requesters to the earmarks. But they conveniently declined to make that effective on their watch. So when we came in, the first thing we did was to implement that proposal and require that names be attached to earmarks. 
   The second thing we did was to impose a moratorium on earmarks until we could straighten out the process. 
   The third thing we did was announce that we were going to cut them by 50 percent for the appropriate accounts, the nonproject accounts. 
   The fourth thing we did was to require a certification to make clear that no one had a financial interest in the earmarks that they were seeking. 
   Then we also provided that, unlike 2 years ago, no provision would be able to be put into a conference report without having a vote on the final product of that conference report by the conferees. That's what we did. 
   Now the gentleman is making a Federal case out of the fact that I had wanted more time to screen these earmarks which have grown exponentially in order to protect the House from bad choices. Folks on his side of the aisle objected to that, and so we relented and so we now have earmarks in the bill. And now the gentleman is squawking because we have earmarks in the bill just as loudly as he was squawking when we didn't. He's a very hard fellow to please. 
   Now, what I said a week ago was that I detest the earmark process, and I do. Why? For a number of reasons. Because it requires me as a conscientious chairman of this committee to spend a huge amount of my time simply reading through those things to try to make certain that the House is not embarrassed. 
   But the more fundamental reason I am frustrated by the process is because it makes so many Members focus so exclusively on the issue of earmarks that we never get a debate on policy, and I thought we came here to debate policy. And that's my problem. I don't think earmarks are evil. I think Members of Congress have a perfect constitutional right to request specific funding for a specific project, just as the executive branch does. And I would remind you that the executive branch directs eight times--

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. I have forgotten where I was, Mr. Chairman. It must be a sign of old age. 
   What bothers me is I thought we all came here to talk about policy. And so what I said on the floor is that I would like to see once and for all the House put up or shut up on this issue. I would personally prefer there be no earmarks. But as chairman of the committee, I have an obligation to try to find that balance point in the House that reflects the will of the House. I don't have the luxury of pursuing exclusively my own will on a subject. So I have been willing to support bills carrying earmarks even though I don't like what they do to my time and my disposition, to be frank. 
   So what I said, I want to see an up-or-down on all earmarks. I drafted an amendment to do so and was informed by the Parliamentarian that would be subject to a point of order, and so I chose not to offer an amendment that was an obvious waste of the House's time. 
   I will say that I am pleased that the gentleman has offered his amendment. Because while it does go as far as mine did, it will give the House an opportunity to decide once and for all, I would hope, whether it favors earmarks or whether it doesn't. 
   Rather than spending an inordinate amount of the House's time talking about individual earmarks and seeing vote after vote after vote to eliminate them go down to defeat, I think it is about time we find out what the will of the House is. I want to know whether the House wants to proceed with earmarks in these bills or not. I see no problem with their doing so. 
   But what I will say is if the House does vote for this amendment, then I will see to it that any bill that comes out from now on has no earmarks. So let's be clear about this. If Members don't want their earmarks, then they should vote for the gentleman's amendment. If they do want their earmarks, if they do think that they have as much right as the President of the United States to determine what happens in their district, then I would suggest that they vote against the amendment. But it is time to put up or shut up. It is time to see where the House stands on this issue.     
   The committee is trying to reflect the will of the House but we cannot go in both directions at the same time. It's time we find out which direction the House wants to go. 
   I thank the gentleman for the time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, this issue is much ado about nothing. We have been subjected to filibuster by amendment all week, and now we are going to be subjected to 40 minutes of so-called debate on a nonexistent issue. Now, why is this issue here? 
   There isn't anybody in the Congress that I know of who is trying to legislatively resurrect the Fairness Doctrine, and, certainly, the totally Republican-dominated commission is not going to resurrect that doctrine.  
   What's at stake here is that a certain Senator, who evidently was afflicted by a bad case of being hit by sun spots so he no longer believes that there is anything like global warming, claims that he was in an elevator and overheard a couple of Senators talk about resurrecting the fairness clause. The two Senators involved say that's nonsense. 
   But what you have got going on here is an effort on the part of right-wing radio to gin up the folks by inventing a fight that doesn't exist. As far as I'm concerned, it's immaterial to me how people vote on this. If Members want the debate to go until 8:00 tonight instead of 7:00, fine, spend 40 minutes debating an issue that doesn't exist. 
   But what I do find interesting is that folks who scream every day of the week about that so-called ``liberal press,'' all of a sudden they are now saying, ``Oh, my God, can you imagine, somebody might force a fairness doctrine on us.'' Well, one would think that if they really do believe the press is liberal, that they would then want the protection that would come from the Fairness Doctrine. 
   I think the very fact that they don't want to see the Fairness Doctrine resurrected is, in fact, an open admission that they recognize the radio waves are largely and almost totally dominated by the right and the far right and the off-the-wall right. 
   I don't see any purpose in taking any more time. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, as someone of note said a long time ago, it will be little noted nor long remembered what we say here today. Certainly this has not been one of the most scintillating debates in the history of the Republic. 
   But I do want to thank my friends on the right because if our folks on talk radio and yap yap TV, if they actually believed that there was a fiercely liberal press that dominated the country, then they would be running kicking and screaming, demanding a Fairness Doctrine. And the fact that the folks on talk radio and yap yap TV are doing just the opposite indicates to me that they are publicly admitting that they are not ``fair and balanced.'' 
   A lot of fun has been made of the FCC. It started in 1929, Herbert Hoover. Herbert Hoover was a very unlucky President who happened to be a very fine man and who had, I think, for his long illustrious life, a pretty good understanding of what it takes to be basically fair in this country. You ought to go back and read some of Herbert Hoover's speeches. He takes a lot of guff, but he was a very impressive man, with a misguided economic policy, but he was a very impressive human being. 
   When the FCC was created, it was based on the idea that the airwaves, which were being licensed to private holders, were, in fact, property of the public and that it is sort of like our stewardship of the Earth. My religious beliefs tell me that we never really own property even if we have title to it. We lease it from God for a while and we have stewardship responsibility.     
   Now that, in my view, is the same view that the government had when they started licensing radio stations. What they said to people who stood to make a lot of money with those licenses is, ``Look, if you're going to use the public airwaves, make sure that all sides get a fair shake of the argument. That's what it was all about. It has long since gone by the boards because of court decisions and other administrative actions by various administrations. 
   Right wing radio today looks at those airwaves as being their open private preserve, and they're not going to give them up at all. But don't worry, I would not, for a second, want to see Rush Limbaugh or good old Sean moderated. I want to see the real, raw Rush. I want him and folks like him to be thoroughly and fully exposed to the American listening audience in all of their bloviating glory. I want to let Rush be Rush. And that isn't going to bother me if he goes on for hours and hours with his one-sided diatribes. Everybody knows he's plugged directly into Republican national headquarters. And so in my view, he is virtually discredited, and I would like to keep it that way.  
   So all I guess I would say, Mr. Chairman, is that I think we ought to let right wing radio go on just as they do now. Rush and Sean are just about as important in the scheme of things as Paris Hilton. And I would hate to see them gain an ounce of credibility by being forced by a government agency or anybody else to moderate their views enough so that they just might become modestly influential or respectable. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, could I inquire of how much time is remaining on the other side? 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN (Mr. McDermott). The gentleman from Indiana has 1 minute.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. I won't take the time, let me just simply sum up very briefly. 
   As the Chair knows, we've gone through the last 30 minutes debating a nonissue. The amendment has already been accepted by the committee. And I would expect that there will be an overwhelmingly vote for it because there is no prospect of any serious effort to revive the Fairness Doctrine, either legislatively or legally. And so, this has really been another political exercise. 
   I've almost given up expecting that substance will dominate legislative debate. We had a State senator by the name of Lynn Stalbaum, who served in Wisconsin many years ago. And the legislature was covered by a man by the name Aldric Revell. Aldric was an acerbic reporter who had the temperament of H.L. Menkin and a pen to match. And he wrote this about Stalbaum one day, he said, ``Stalbaum is a superb legislator, but he has the maddening tendency to expect reason to dominate legislative debate.'' 
   I don't really expect, on issues like this, to have much common sense in the House. You get six like-minded people in this institution, they talk to each other in the cloakroom and they think they've conducted a public opinion poll. 
   So all I would say is, I fundamentally disagree with the gentleman who indicated that this is a highly important vote. I think, as another famous author once said, this is a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, these agencies, these regulatory agencies in this bill, are not very well known by the American people, but I think this amendment is consistent with the efforts made by Republican Congresses in the past 25 years to slowly but surely weaken and cripple the ability of regulatory agencies to keep the big boys honest and to protect the little people in this society from abuse and to protect legitimate capitalists from chiseling competitors. 
   If you take a look at what happened to the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, for instance, from 1980 on, the protective capacity of the antitrust division at the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission was being shrunk at the same time that America experienced the greatest wave of corporate mergers and corporate acquisitions in the Nation's history. The staff of the Consumer Product Safety Commission during that time was cut in half, since 1980. 
   And as I said last night, the ability of the SEC to keep up with its workload was crunched because over that same period of time corporate filings reviewed by the Agency declined from 21 percent to about 8 percent in 2000. That means the rest of the filings never even got a look-see. 
   Now, the Federal Trade Commission: its job is simply to protect the consumers, to protect them against antitrust and a variety of noncompetitive practices. The SEC is charged with the responsibility of protecting investors, so we don't have more Enrons. And the Consumer Product Safety Commission does all these ``terrible'' things like protecting kids from flammable pajamas. 
   I would simply suggest that you can cut this bill by 1 percent and it won't be noticed much in any immediate year. But you do that for 4 or 5 years in a row and you allow inflation meanwhile to eat away at those regulatory agencies' budgets, and what you have is runaway, ragged individualism and you have the big boys and the big corporations in this society able to get away with murder. These are the agencies that keep those big boys honest. 
   Now, they say, ``Well, this is just a small cut.'' I would submit we have already cut this bill 3 percent. We cut the President's budget by 3 percent. 
   And I would further make the point that I think it is a ludicrous joke for the people in this Congress who brought us $1.2 trillion in tax cuts, paid for with borrowed money, for the people who are willing to give $57 billion in tax cuts this year to people who make over a million bucks, with borrowed money, and for people who are willing to borrow $600 billion to finance the dumbest war in modern American history, and then they want to divert public attention by saying, ``Oh, guess what, we didn't cause the $2 trillion increase in Federal debt. What caused it was these terrible Democrats who are in the coming year going to add $5 billion over the CBO baseline.'' That's all the budget does for this year, add $5 billion over the CBO baseline. 
   So I plead fully guilty of thinking that added investments in veterans, added investments in school kids, added investments in health care, added investments in science, added investments in budgets that help regulatory agencies keep the big boys honest, I plead fully guilty in supporting all of that. It's a whole lot better than their track record on fiscal responsibility. 
   It is a colossal all-time joke. Never again in my life will I take any lectures from any members of that party on fiscal responsibility after what they've done the last 6 years. You can rewrite history if you want, but ain't nobody gonna read it!

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, for purposes of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Lewis), and pending that I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this issue before us is the kind of issue that the Congress was designed to deal with. This Congress exists today because in 1215, almost 800 years ago, our forefathers many times removed, by adopting the Magna Carta, established for the first time in the English-speaking world the principle that the monarch was not unilaterally sovereign. 
   That expression wound up being turned into a reality for our country in 1789, when the Constitution of the United States was adopted. That Constitution created three coequal branches of government. It gave this body, the legislative body, the Congress, the ability to declare war. It certainly gave us the obligation to oversee the conduct of war. It gave us the obligation to oversee the use of taxpayers' money in dealing not just with war, but with every other issue as well. 
   The President yesterday vetoed the legislation now before us, which, for the first time, had he chosen to use it, would have given him the opportunity to have an exit strategy for a war that has brought incredible frustration and agony not just on the people of Iraq, but the people of our own country. 
   Now, the President has told the public that he is ``the decider.'' Well, he is a very important decider, but he is not the only decider in a democratic form of government. The ultimate deciders are our constituents, and we are elected to speak on their behalf and to participate in that decisionmaking. That is what the Congress did when it passed this legislation through both Houses. 
   I regret very much that the President did not use this legislation to establish a bipartisan approach to the war which has plagued us now for more than 4 years. 
   As we all know, yesterday was the fourth anniversary of the President's landing on that aircraft carrier under the banner ``Mission Accomplished'' and telling us that our troops had fulfilled their mission. Indeed, they had;  our troops won the war in Iraq, but it is the White House, in its pursuit of its Iraqi policy, it is the civilian leadership of the Pentagon which systematically, especially in the early days, ignored the judgment of the military that has brought us to the chaos that we see in Iraq today. 
   Now, the legislation before us attempted to do a number of things. It attempted to meet the financial needs of the budget in supplying our troops with everything that they need. Secondly, it attempted to hold the administration accountable and to hold the Iraqi Government accountable for the actions that they have taken. And thirdly, it was meant to provide the beginnings of an exit strategy from that civil war. The President has decided to veto that legislation, and the question before us now is whether we will override that veto or not. 
   The President said in his veto message yesterday that we had all too many so-called nonrelated items in this bill, along with funding for the troops in Iraq. I don't believe that the American people would agree with the President that $1.8 billion for veterans health care, $3.3 billion for defense health programs, $2.2 billion for additional Homeland Security initiatives, $6.9 billion for Katrina recovery, $663 million to protect the country from the ravages of a potential world flu pandemic, or $650 million to prevent kids from losing health insurance is unnecessary funding. I think the American public recognizes each of those as a legitimate expenditure of public funds. 
   I also think that the President has focused so much attention on those items simply to divert public attention from the fact that this bill is first, last and foremost about the war. It is about how we get our troops out of the war. It is how we send a message to the Iraqi politicians that our troops cannot be expected to accomplish the compromises that only they can reach if that war is to be brought to a conclusion. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would urge every Member of this House, regardless of party, to vote to override the President's veto. 
   And I would point out to the President that we already have provided for two major compromises in this legislation. When we first established the Murtha principles for unit readiness, the White House objected. And so we said, all right, we'll change that, we will give the White House a waiver. When the White House objected to the timetable that we laid out for withdrawal of our troops from that civil war, again we compromised, and we said we will keep as hard deadlines the deadlines by which we must begin that process of redeploying troops, but we made the end date for the actual withdrawal of our troops from combat in a civil war, we made those dates extremely flexible in response to the President's views. So we have already compromised on two very major items in this bill. 
   Now that the President has laid down his veto, it seems to me that he has an obligation to lay on the table what compromises he is willing to make in order to bring us together in pursuit of an exit strategy from a war that we should never have gotten into in the first place. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 1/2 minutes. 
   The gentleman expresses his concern about funding designated as emergency spending. In fact, I would point out that the President himself asked for the antiflu money that we put in this bill. The President himself asked for that money 2 years ago as an emergency request. 
   I would also note, since he has expressed concern about our micromanaging the war, I would simply say we have had the administration providing us with bad intelligence. We have had the administration demonstrating bad judgment in saying we would be welcomed with open arms. We have had them demonstrate bad judgment in ignoring General Shinseki's warnings about the number of troops that would be needed to pacify a postwar Iraq. We have seen bad judgment in the President's refusal to talk to the Syrians and the Iranians. We have seen bad judgment all across the board for the last 4 years. It seems to me that we are badly in need of having some kind of management to that war, and if it is not going to come from the executive branch, then the only alternative is for the Congress to express its views. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Maryland, the majority leader, Mr. Hoyer.

   I would simply point out to the gentleman who just spoke that the bill before us specifically allows our troops to continue to go after al Qaeda in Iraq, even after they are repositioned out of fighting that miserable civil war. 
   I would also simply say, the gentleman asks ``What do you think al Qaeda thinks.'' I think al Qaeda wants us to stay in Iraq. It is clear from the beginning that they were happy that we went there, that we got sucked in there, because we have served as a recruiting poster for al Qaeda. That is what al Qaeda thinks.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman who just spoke said that withdrawing from Iraq will destabilize the Middle East. The President's policy has already destabilized the Middle East. 
   He says that this policy endorses failure. The fact is that the only endorsement of failure comes on the part of those who will vote to continue the President's existing policy, because the President's policy in Iraq has been a 4-year failure. 
   We need a change in direction. The only question about the President's policy is whether it will produce a disaster or whether it will produce a catastrophe, and I am afraid it will produce the latter.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. I thank the gentlewoman for the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me simply make a few observations about the gentleman's comments. With respect to the forest funded school program that he is talking about, it needs to be understood that is not within the jurisdiction of our committee. The problem with that program is that the authorizing committee has allowed that program to expire, and it is a mandatory program. Any time the Appropriations Committee tries to involve itself in mandatory programs we get skinned by people on both sides of the aisle, and we are told to mind our own business. We have. 
   I am very sympathetic about the gentleman's problem, but this is not an appropriated program. The Appropriations Committee deals with discretionary spending, not mandatory spending.

   Mr. OBEY. But the fact is we have not reauthorized expired programs. That is the difference. We do not have the authority to reauthorize a mandatory program. If we did, we would have to find another $320 million, and I would like to know where that offset is going to come from.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. I understand that. We had nine other requests to do the same thing. If we had done so, Members on your side of the aisle would have come and attacked us and scalped us for doing things that we had no business doing. So he can't have it both ways, which is what many Members in the minority are trying to do today. 
   I would be happy to join with the gentleman in urging the authorizing committee to fix the problem, but it is not within our purview to do. 
   With that, I take back the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I don't want to prolong the comments on the rule. Let me simply say that the majority had 8 months to deal with the most basic responsibility of a legislative body, which is to pass the Federal budget. They were in the majority. They now are not. Now they are in the minority. 
   We are trying to clean up their spilt milk, and they can squawk all they want about how we did it. The fact is, there are no new issues here. Virtually every single issue that will be debated today was already debated when we passed the appropriation bills. These are the bills that the House passed last summer in the previous session of the Congress. We had hundreds of amendments to these bills. 
   Now because the Republicans in the House couldn't convince the Republicans in the Senate to vote for these bills, we have before us what is, in essence, a pre-conferenced conference report, and we have boiled down this almost 1,000 pages. This is what it would look like if we had an omnibus appropriation bill. We would have had 1,000 pages of legislative material. We have boiled it down to about 150 pages. 
   We have basically decided to stick with the fiscal year 2006 basic funding level for most programs. We try to then adjust programs for agencies so that they don't have to lay off workers, so that they don't have to have furloughs, such as the Social Security Department and the FBI, who both told us that they desperately needed these adjustments or they would have to shut down their operations or lay off people. 
   We then decided that there are some priorities on both sides of the aisle, and we used almost $10 billion, which we had cut from other portions of the bill, to finance those items. 
   You may not like the choices we have made, but, in contrast to the last Congress which ducked its responsibility to make these choices, at least we have made the choices. At least we have made them, and we are going to vote on this today. We are going to send it to the Senate so that when the President submits his new budget on February 5, he has a clean slate and so do we, and that is the way it ought to be.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, my only response to some of the comments I have heard from the other side of the aisle is, you are really something else. You are really something else. You spent all of the last year trying to pass appropriation bills. You passed all but one through the House. You could not get your Republican friends in the Senate to support any of them. So when you relinquished your duties we had no domestic budget for the coming year. 
   I offered on the floor to make any substantive compromises necessary when you were still in control. I offered to make any procedural concessions necessary to enable you to pass the bills on your watch. You did not do it. 
   Your own chairman at the time admitted that the Republican floor leader in the Senate blocked the bills from passage. So you have forfeited any right to squawk about how we cleaned up your mess. 
   Now I want to comment on a few claims that have been made. You say there has been no participation by the minority side. 
   This bill was negotiated at the staff level for 3 1/2 weeks, 7 days a week, around the clock. Your staff was invited to every meeting. Some of them they did not come because they did not like the choices that were being made. But someone had to make the decisions, because you did not. 
   So the staff negotiated virtually all of those compromises. When they could not reach agreement, then they brought the Members in. You had Senator Domenici on the Republican side and Mr. Visclosky going on and on about the Energy and Water bill, for instance. You had Rosa DeLauro in the ag bill involved, you had Mr. Dicks in the Interior bill involved as the appropriate subcommittee chairs. If you did not bring your subcommittee ranking members into the mix, that is your fault, not mine. 
   All I know is, our people participated. If they did not on your side, it is either because they did not want to or because you did not invite them to. I do not know which is which. Do not blame us for your screw-ups.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 12 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the President will submit to the Congress his new budget. It would be kind of nice if we had disposed of his last year's budget request before the President brings  his new budget forward, because I believe that he is entitled to start the year with a clean slate, and I think we are entitled to start the year with a clean slate as well. 
   Unfortunately, we cannot do that because of the failures of the last Congress. This resolution represents the last remaining legislation that must be passed in order to clean up the mess left to us by the last Congress. 
   Now, we all know the story. Last year, the House debated and passed every single appropriation bill except the Labor, Health, Education bill. That was held up because of the now-well-known division between the two parties on the minimum wage and also because moderate Republicans in this House, led by people like Mr. Castle and others, were demanding that the Republican leadership add at least $3 billion to the Labor, Health, Education appropriation bill in order to get their votes on the Republican budget resolution. 
   The then chairman, Mr. Lewis from California, my good friend, specifically said on the House floor that the reason the Congress was not allowed to finish its work is because the Senate majority leader, Senator Frist, shielded the Senate from any painful votes on appropriations before the election. Then, after the election, the majority party walked away from their responsibility to finish the budget, and they left us to clean up the mess as they walked out the door. 
   When we considered the CR under which we are now operating, I specifically said from this place on the House floor that I would make any substantive compromise that was necessary and I would make any procedural compromise that was necessary in order to enable the then majority Republicans to finish the bills on their watch, on their terms. I said I was willing to recognize that they still controlled the Congress and so they had a right to have Republican priorities reflected in those bills, even if I disagreed with those priorities. 
   But I also warned that if they did not live up to their responsibilities to pass the budget, then they would forfeit their right to complain and whine about how we went about cleaning up their leftover jobs. 
   So when it became apparent that they would not meet their responsibilities, Senator Byrd and I announced that we would proceed by doing two things. We announced, first of all, that we would provide no congressional earmarks. We told anybody who had an earmark in a 2007 bill that if they wanted it considered in the following fiscal year they would need to present it under the reform process, which we were in the process of putting together; and we announced at that time that we intended to cut earmarks by 50 percent in comparison to the 2007 bill. 
   The second thing that we announced is that we would take the 2006 continuing resolution and make whatever adjustments were necessary in order to avoid shutdowns of agencies or layoffs or furloughs and in order to recognize priorities that we thought people had on both sides of the aisle. That is what we did. 
   In this bill, we started with the fiscal 2006 base. We then cut or rescinded $9- to $10 billion, almost $10 billion, in items that we thought could be cut or rescinded. We cut over 60 programs. We generated $10 billion or so in savings, and we added that to the $7 billion that still remained within the Republican budget resolution cap, and then we allocated that money on the basis of what we thought were better priorities. 
   Now, the gentleman from California says we should have just stuck with the existing 2006 continuing resolution. We could have done that. If we had, we would not have been able to add $3.6 billion in veterans' health care, which we have done in this bill, which is our number one priority. We would not have been able to add $1.2 billion in defense health, which we add in this bill. We would not have been able to add $500 million for basic housing allowances for our military, and we would not have been able to add the $1 billion that we added for BRAC, the base closing operations. We would also not have been able to add the $216 million that we added to the FBI budget at the request of the administration. 
   In education, two weeks ago, when the Democratic Party brought to this House floor a proposition to lower interest rates on student loans, we were told, ``oh, that is just tokenism. What you ought to do is add to the Pell Grants.'' 
   That is what we have done. We added enough to the Pell Grant program to allow an increase in the maximum grant of $260. We wouldn't have been able to do that either if we had followed Mr. Lewis' suggestion and simply stuck to the CR under which we are now operating. 
   In addition to that, we added $250 million to Title I and $100 million to Head Start so we could end the decline in enrollment in that program. 
   In the area of science, we were asked by a number of Members on the Republican side of the aisle in this House, and on our side, plus the Senate on both sides, to add money for NIH. Members did not like the fact that, under the alternative, we were going to lose at least 500 medical grants in cancer research, heart disease, Alzheimer's and the rest. 
   I have not met a single constituent who said, ``Hey, OBEY, I think you ought to save money by cutting cancer research grants.'' We added $620 million to reverse the decline in the number of research grants at NIH, and we added some additional funds to the National Science Foundation. 
   We added some additional money to energy conservation and energy research programs, in addition to which we provided a $200 million add-on for the Clean Water Revolving Fund. There isn't a small community in this country that doesn't need some help with clean water. 
   We added $100 million for park maintenance, and we added $90 million for firefighting. 
   We also were requested by the administration to provide at least the amount that they asked for the global AIDS program and to combat malaria and TB. So we added $1.4 billion to do that, and we added $146 million to prevent the Social Security Administration from having a 10-day furlough for their employees. That is what we did. 
   We also provided a suspension of all earmarks. 
   Now, I want to make clear a lot of the earmarks that we suspended are perfectly defensible. They accomplish laudatory public purposes. I think it is sad that we haven't been able to fund them. But the fact is that it became apparent to me that the earmarking process had been so discredited by the Cunningham case and by other cases that we have no choice but to start over. So we wanted to clear the decks, clean up the process, and start over. 
   Ninety-nine percent of the Members of this House on both sides of the aisle have immense integrity. They don't ask the Congress for things that are illegitimate, but it is that 1 percent that has fouled the nest for everybody else. So we are trying to clean up the nest so that we can approach next year with a clean start and so that we will have a process so that both parties will know what earmarks the other party is putting into the bills. 
   I want the minority to be fully cognizant of whatever earmarks the majority puts in the bills, and I want us to be fully cognizant of the other earmarks you put in the bills. That is the only way we can protect the integrity of this institution. 
   So we are being criticized in some quarters because we are being told, ``Well, when you eliminated the earmarks, you should also have eliminated the money in those programs.'' We didn't do that for one very simple reason. We didn't want to reduce the amount of money in the COPS program, for instance. 
   What we are doing, by eliminating earmarks, and let's be clear about it, we are not saving a dime by eliminating earmarks. But what we are doing is transferring the power to decide where that money goes from the congressional branch to the executive branch. I don't like that, but it is a price I am willing to pay to clean up the system. What that means is that the administration will have much more authority than normal to decide where money goes, whether it is in the Army Corps of Engineers program or COPS or you name it. 
   I would simply say, we may have made some wrong choices. Undoubtedly, we did. But the process was this. 
   For 3 1/2 weeks our staffs worked 7 days a week round the clock, and they negotiated with the Senate, Republican  and Democratic staff alike. The Republican staff was invited to every meeting that took place. If they attended or didn't, that was up to them. 
   Whenever the staff could not reach agreement, the Members were brought in order to argue it up. If you don't think that occurred, talk to Mr. Visclosky, talk to Senator Domenici, talk about the arguments they had on the Energy and Water bill, and there are countless other examples. 
   We are now in a situation in which we have to move on. We may have made some wrong choices, but at least, in contrast to last year, we made those choices, we made them. They may not be popular, but they were necessary so that we can turn the page, get on the next year. 
   This bill is the functional equivalent of a conference report. All of the appropriation bills that were not completed action on last year, this is what they look like. This is what they look like. This is a continuing resolution that we are producing today in order to direct where the spending in these bills ought to go. 
   Now, you may say you don't think it fits the traditional definition of a continuing resolution. Either you can have an automatic continuing resolution, or you can have a thinking man's continuing resolution. I don't think that we were obligated to lock ourselves into the 2006 numbers, because that would have prevented us from providing the initiatives that I talked about for veterans, for education and the like. 
   This is a responsible document. Nothing was sneaked in. Everybody knows what is in this package. All the staff knows. 
   I would urge an ``aye'' vote for the bill so that, come Monday, we can deal with the President's new budget, rather than continuing to deal with the spilt milk of yesterday's majority.

   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman talks about how we should have stuck with the bills that they produced last year. There is only one problem. They couldn't convince their Republican brethren in the Senate to buy them. And so we had to try something else. 
   I can't help it that the majority party did not meet its responsibilities to pass these appropriations because you had an internal fight within the Republican Party. But now the responsibility is passed to us, and at least we are producing a proposal which can pass both Houses. That is more than can be said for the work product of the last Congress.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I won't take the full 4 minutes. Let me simply say that it is necessary for the House to move forward with this legislation. It is easy to nitpick. It is interesting to me that the minority today has chosen to chastise us for decisions that we made not to go back 2 years and repeal some of the mistakes that the minority made when they were in the majority. They argue that we should have done that; they argue that we should have lived with a simple continuing resolution at '06 levels. If we do that, that would mean we would not have the added funding for veterans health care, we would not have the added funding for BRAC, we would not have the added funding for the National Institutes of Health; we would not be able to raise the Pell grant by $260 for the maximum grant; we would not have the extra funding for energy research. 
   I would ask Members to recognize that after a full year of the Republican minority not being able to produce and finish their work, it is time for us to finish their work so we can move on. The President is producing his new budget on February 5, which is next Monday. We need to clear the decks so we can deal with that afresh. 
   I ask for an ``aye'' vote.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, the fact is that this is simply a nit-picking motion which, if adopted, would kill our chances of passing this resolution in the United States Senate and result in us living on an '06 continuing resolution, which would deny us the ability to provide additional funds for veterans health care, for education, for veterans housing and the like. 
   I would point out, this resolution already adds $500 million to the basic allowance for housing. This CR already increases family housing construction by $210 million and funds military construction at the level of the President's request that have been authorized. 
   This motion would eliminate the weapons research account that has been of some controversy today. I would point out, we have already cut that account by $94 million. I doubt that the House wants to eliminate that nuclear weapons research. 
   I would also say that in a new found and sudden burst of false piety, we are now being chastised because we did not reach back and eliminate an item that was approved 2 years ago for the State of Iowa by the majority. In fact, the gentleman who was chairman of the committee when that item was approved is none other than the gentleman offering the motion right now. 
   I don't mind clearing up the mistakes for last year, of the gentleman, I do mind being asked to go back 2 years to clear up your mistakes. That is asking too much, even for us. 
   Secondly, I would say that some of us may not like the Denali Commission, but it is a perfectly authorized program. And as much as I might like to see a project like that in my district, I don't have one, neither does the gentleman. I think it is illegitimate for us to single out one legitimate program for elimination that would require us, I think in the interest of fairness, to go back and look at hundreds of other programs that have been approved in the past. So I urge a ``no'' vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBEY. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, 4 years ago this Congress voted to authorize the President to engage in a preemptive attack to Iraq, a country that had not attacked the United States. I supported the military action against Afghanistan because they gave sanctuary to Osama bin Laden and those who attacked us on 9/11. But I opposed the President's unilateral and preemptive attack on Iraq, because I believed that this action would destabilize the Middle East, isolate us in world opinion, and weaken our influence in the world. Our opposition was vilified. Our patriotism was questioned, and that continues today. 
   We are told that if we oppose the President's intensification of the war, we are giving aid and comfort to the enemy. Well, I, for one, am tired of those who have been consistently wrong about this war lecturing those of us who have been right from the start. I am tired of the manipulation of intelligence by this administration. I am tired of the stubbornness of an administration that didn't have a clue about the Middle East realities when they got us into this mess, and don't have a clue now about how to get us out. 
   Sadly, there will be no happy endings to this war. The President's policy has done so much damage that there is no good way for us to get out, whether it happens in 6 months or a year or 5 years. 
   Our troops won the war, God bless them. But the problem with the President's plan is that it calls upon our troops to do something they do not have the power to do, and that is to convince the Iraqi factions to stop killing each other and work together on a political compromise. 
   Instead of the President's surge, in my view, we should set a rough target for repositioning our troops out of the area. We should recognize that Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds, will never join together in a strong central government. We should tell the Iraqis that if they do not amend their Constitution to allow for a loose confederation with an oil sharing agreement between the Sunnis and the Shiites, that we will leave them to each others' tender mercies. We should participate in regional discussions with all parties, including Syria and Iran. We should resume aggressive leadership to resurrect a meaningful Middle East process, peace process, and Congress should pass legislation prohibiting an attack on Iran without authorization by this Congress. 
   Given the chaos that the administration's policy has produced, none of these suggestions may work. But all of them would be better than continuing to be stuck in another 5-year period in an endless war with endless promises to the American people and with endless failures on the ground.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I had not intended to speak in general debate on this bill, but in light of some of the comments made by the previous speaker, I feel obligated to. 
   The gentleman said that it was the nature of the rule under which this bill is being considered that prevented him from offering an amendment. The fact is that the only thing this rule did was to require that people publish their amendments 1 day ahead of time so that we were not legislating by ambush. The rules of the House always provide for germaneness. And, as the gentleman knows, his amendment is not germane to this bill. 
   Secondly, I would point out that we put $2.65 billion in the supplemental for Midwest disaster funding and for other disasters around the country. And I would point out that we did that even though the White House never sent to this Congress an official budget request to deal with the disasters not just in Iowa, but Wisconsin as well, my own State. 
   Thirdly, I would point out that the Speaker met today with a number of Members from the Iowa delegation and we made clear that as soon as we get official numbers from the administration that are at all coherent, we will act, and that this Congress will not adjourn for the year without providing needed disaster relief. 
   I just want to make clear there was nothing done in the rule.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, one month ago when we were trying to add funding to provide the largest expansion of the GI bill in the history of the bill  since it was first approved in 1945, the House Minority Leader issued the following statement. He said, ``House Republicans believe that loading up the troop funding bill with billions upon billions of unrelated Washington spending is reckless and dangerous.'' 
   Now, it was difficult for me at the time to understand how adding education benefits for our troops was unrelated to funding the troops, but today we are now being asked to consider a nongermane amendment which would bring a divisive energy debate into legislation which is trying to provide for the needs of our military families around the country and which is trying to provide the needs in the health care area for our veterans. 
   If I were to debate energy in the middle of this bill, I would point out that one of the reasons that we have $4 gas today is that we have an administration which has pursued fiscal policies that have borrowed almost $2 trillion to finance tax cuts and to finance the war in Iraq, and that has contributed to driving down the value of the dollar, which has in turn raised the cost of purchasing a gallon of gasoline by 30 percent. 
   If I were to debate energy on this bill, I would point out that, since Jimmy Carter left office, we have had a succession of administrations running from Reagan to Bush that systemically presided over the gutting of energy research done by the government on alternative energy sources. 
   I would also point out that over the last 8 years we have had an energy policy run by an administration dominated by two oil men in the President and the Vice President. 
   I would point out that their national security advisor, Secretary Rice, served on Chevron's board of directors for 10 years and even had an oil tanker named after her; that Interior Secretary Gale Norton started her career at a think tank funded by energy companies; commerce Secretary Don Evans was former president and CEO of a Texas oil company; Deputy Interior Secretary Griles was a former lobbyist for the oil, chemical, and mining industry, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, 
   I would also point out that we on this side of the aisle have worked to pass increased fuel economy standards for automobiles; we have voted to eliminate $14 billion in special tax breaks for oil and gas companies; we voted to crack down on speculation which has driven up the cost of oil and gas at the expense of the American people. I would have pointed out that we have voted to get more oil from the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. And, I would be pointing out that we have also asked the President to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.     
   I would also point out that we support drilling on the 68 million acres of public lands that are already leased and not being developed. That is what I would point out if I were in a debate on energy. But, in fact, this is supposed to be a discussion about the needs of our military families for housing, for education, and the needs of our veterans for health care. And I think we would best serve the country in this Chamber tonight if we would focus our remarks on that issue. And that is what I will continue to do.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I simply want to respond to one theme that we have heard here in the last 20 minutes or so. We have heard complaints about the ``outrage'' that is being perpetrated by the passage of this rule because it is alleged that this rule closes up consideration of this bill and in fact prevents Members from offering legitimate amendments. 
   Let me point out this rule does one thing and one thing only. It simply says that if a Member wants to offer an amendment, that that Member should notice the House 1 day ahead of time in the Congressional Record so that we do not legislate by ambush. The only thing that is required for an amendment to be considered on this floor is that it be printed in the Congressional Record the day before it is considered so that no Member of the House is blind-sided by any amendment. 
   We believe that the bill managers on both sides of the aisle have a right to know in an orderly way which amendments are going to be offered to bills. We also believe that any individual Member who happens to have a project in his district which is going to be challenged by another Member, that that Member has the right to notice of that challenge. And we believe that every single Member of this House has a right to know ahead of time what they are going to be called upon to vote on by way of amendments. So this rule simply says any amendment is in order so long as it was printed the day before.  
   Now, the gentleman managing the bill on the other side of the aisle asked the question, ``Will secondary amendments be allowed?'' My understanding is yes. My understanding is that this rule provides--or that this rule does not in any way get in the way of the ability of Members to offer secondary amendments. 
   So, very simply, this bill is attempting to meet the military needs of the country. It's attempting to meet the needs of our veterans in terms of health care. It's meant to meet the needs of our communities in terms of construction on military bases all around the country. 
   This bill builds upon the fact that in the last 2 years we have provided the largest increase in veterans' health benefits in the history of the country. This bill continues in that tradition. It is a terrific bill for veterans. It is a terrific bill for the communities that host military facilities around the country. And instead of having a sham debate about legislation which is not before us today, I think we would do well to confine our comments to the bill at hand, which is the military construction bill. 
   It's a good bill, and I would predict it will be supported on a huge bipartisan basis. It was reported unanimously by the subcommittee. What we ought to do, instead of pretending that there's a procedural problem, when in fact there is none, we ought to get to the subject at hand.

It seems to me that if the authorizing committee or any member thereof has some ideas that they would like to see included in the appropriation bill that the best way to work in the legislative body is to talk to people ahead of time about it so that we don't have to make these horseback, half-baked judgments at 10:30 in the evening.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I have just one observation to make about the remarks of the previous speaker when he indicated that the Speaker did not want to hear the truth. 
   I would simply observe that when the VA several years ago was insisting that the administration's budget for veterans' health care was insufficient to meet the needs, the Speaker heard the truth and acted on it. And as a result, even in the teeth of fierce opposition from the administration, she insisted that we provide another $1 billion to the veterans' health care budget. And eventually, even the VA came to admit that that money was needed. 
   When veterans' organizations after our party took control of the Congress 1.5 years ago, when those veterans' organizations told us that we needed to provide at least $3.5 billion more than the President's budget had provided for veterans' health care, she heard the truth and she acted on it. 
   The Speaker need never take a back seat to the gentleman from Indiana or anyone else in this chamber when it comes to hearing the truth and acting on it when it concerns America's veterans. She made quite clear that the welfare of American veterans was going to be her number one budget priority when she became Speaker, because she was objecting to the fact that the only families in America who ever had to make any sacrifice because of the Iraq war were military families. That was indeed a truth which she not only heard but saw and acted upon, and this House can be proud of that on both sides of the aisle. 
   I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will read.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman said that projects in this bill are allocated on the basis of one's power and influence. Well, I think, when it comes to the appropriations process and since I'm the chairman of the committee--and I'm a fairly powerful or influential person except when I'm at home with my wife--I would, nonetheless, say that I have no projects whatsoever in this bill--none, zip. I would also say that, whether you like the reforms that have been instituted in the last 2 years or not, just about the only reforms that have been instituted on the earmarking process have been sponsored by me, and I think the House knows what they are. We wouldn't even be on the floor tonight, dealing with these in this way, had it not been for those reforms. 
   I want to make a point: Regardless of what individual Members think about earmarking, there are certain appropriations which by their very nature require earmarking. There are other bills that by their very nature do not. This is one of the three that does. You've got the Military Construction bill; you've got the energy and water bill, and you've got the interior bill. Large portions, if not all of those bills, are simply construction accounts. When it comes to construction accounts, those projects are in the main, requested and defined by the administration. The overwhelming majority of projects in this bill are selected by the executive branch. 
   This bill includes 518 total earmarks: 408 earmarks, 79 percent of them, were included at the request of the administration. Of the 110 other earmarks, on its own initiative, the committee added seven earmarks to improve better training barracks and medical facilities for soldiers, marines and their families. They were not added at the request of particular Members, but they are in this bill, nonetheless, and the committee makes no apology for them. 
   I would also point out that 103 of these projects were added at the request of a Member. One hundred two of them are military construction projects, and one is a VA project. All of the military construction earmarks, including the quality of life projects, were also included in the authorization bill, and the VA earmark is included subject to authorization. 
   There is no difference between what the Congress does in earmarking military construction and what the White House does when it requests earmarks for military construction. For example, five different Members, Democrats and Republicans alike, asked the committee to provide the second phase of a facility, $7.5 million, to support a facility for a pararescue unit at the Gabreski Air National Guard base in New York. Now, the sponsors of this amendment, evidently, are going to crow about cutting 103 earmarks. Let's look at what they will actually be cutting. 
   They will be cutting Air Force runways, aircraft refueling stations, training facilities, maintenance facilities, fire stations, chapels, barracks, control towers, firing ranges, and so on. You would be hard-pressed to find a substantive difference between these projects and the other 408 contained in the bill. The only difference is that they have not been blessed by the White House. 
   Now, apparently, the sponsors of this amendment believe that the only spending that is legitimate is that which is blessed by the executive branch. Well, this document, the Constitution, reads as follows: ``No money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law.'' It doesn't say, ``only in consequence of funds requested by the executive.'' It doesn't say, ``Only spending by the executive is sacrosanct.'' It says that Congress has the responsibility of making these decisions. 
   Now, Congress may make some wise choices. It may make some bad choices. So may the executive branch. I would submit that, regardless of your attitude about earmarks in general, it is ludicrous to say that you cannot have the Congress using its judgment on occasion to decide where money ought to go in the development of facilities on military bases, just as it would be ludicrous to say that, for the Army Corps of Engineers in the energy and water bill, the only projects that are worthwhile proceeding with are those which are requested by the executive branch. 
   I invite you to take a look at the way a number of accounts in the executive branch have been turned into political slush funds. Take the Reading First program. Look at the major job training program in the Department of Labor. There are ample examples of abuse of the earmarking process in the executive branch and in the legislative branch. Our obligation, in my view, is not within the process of trying to dig those out to throw the baby out with the bath water. 
   I think this committee has done a responsible job in making its judgments about what those projects ought to be. If the gentleman is concerned about members of the Appropriations Committee who he feels have an inordinate number of earmarks, well, I have none. Yet I stand here tonight, defending this process, because at least, on this bill, I think there is very little to be said for the idea that only the executive branch may make choices about whether barracks or hospitals or daycare centers are built to facilitate the convenience of military families. This bill is an example of Congress' meeting its responsibilities and controlling the power of the purse.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBEY. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4351, AMT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Madam Speaker, I would just like to respond briefly to some of the assertions made a few minutes ago under which the Clinton administration was attacked for supposedly not correcting the alternative minimum tax problem. 
   I want to read from the administration's statement when the President vetoed the budget reconciliation bill, which contained the so-called AMT fix. The President pointed out at the time that in addition to supposedly dealing with the alternative minimum tax, that that bill would have cut Medicare by $270 billion, it would have cut Federal Medicaid payments to States by $163 billion, it would have virtually eliminated the direct student loan program, it would have provided huge tax cuts, over 47 percent of the benefits would have gone to the top 12 percent of earners in the country. I think that's enough said. 
   If you want to understand why the Clinton administration vetoed the bill, it was not because they were against an alternative minimum tax fix. In fact, the President specifically supported it in his comments. What he objected to was using the alternative minimum tax proposal as a Trojan horse to bring in huge gifts for the most well off people in this society paid for by huge funding cuts for those in our society who were the most vulnerable. The President didn't apologize for his action at the time, and we shouldn't, either. It was the right thing to do.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think people know what this bill is all about and, at this point, I don't have any intention of talking more about it, unless provoked. 
   But let me simply take this time to bring to the House's attention the fact that Frank Cushing, who is a 23-year Hill veteran, is leaving the Congress at the end of this term. Frank has served as the staff director for the Republican majority, and now also for the Republican minority. He's also, in the past, served the House as the chief clerk of the VA/HUD Appropriations Subcommittee. 
   And I know I should not say it in this body, but he also served numerous positions in the Senate, including staff director for both the majority and minority of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and clerk of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee. 
   I think that the House owes Frank a debt of gratitude for the work that he's done through the years. I think the country owes Frank a debt of gratitude. He's a fine public servant. I hate to see him go, and I'm sure that that sentiment is shared in spades by the gentleman from California and the other side of the aisle. So I want to extend my best wishes to Frank. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   The last people I will take any lectures from on earmarking are my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. The last time I chaired the Labor-Health-Education appropriation bill, there were no earmarks. In the last year of the Republican regime, there were over 3,000. Earmarks exploded under their rule. 
   Two years ago, there were $16 billion in earmarks. The bill that we bring tonight contains a 43 percent reduction in that amount. In July, I offered this House an opportunity to strip all earmarks from the bill. We got exactly one Republican vote out of five in support of that motion. We got 45 Republican votes for that motion, less than 22 percent. 
   Last week, I suggested again that all earmarks be removed. I was run over by a majority of both caucuses. 
   Let me also point out that if the gentleman is complaining about so-called air-drops in projects, of course there are projects that were air-dropped. There were two appropriation bills that left the House that had no earmarks because they were the first ones out of the box, and we were trying to stay on schedule. Every Member in the House except the most obtuse knew that those earmarks would have to be added in the Senate, and they were, in the Homeland Security bill and in the Military Construction bill. 
   As far as the Labor-Health Subcommittee is concerned, the earmarks that were added there are only the earmarks that were added from Members who were not in the House at the time that the House bill passed. Those districts are entitled to representation, too, and those Members are entitled to be treated with consideration, just as every other Member of the House is. 
   So with all due respect, one last point: the gentleman complains, again, about the fact that we are passing an omnibus appropriation bill containing hundreds of pages and billions of dollars. I will hold that in this hand. I'm holding in my right hand all of the pages from the domestic budget that the Republican Congress passed when they were in power. You know how many pages there were? None, because they never got the job done on a single appropriation bill. 
   So if I have to choose between getting our work done in an omnibus bill like this or doing nothing and turning your job over to the next Congress, pardon me, it may not be elegant, but I'll take the product that chose the work. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   The gentleman complains that we're spending 60 minutes debating the contents of this bill tonight. Mr. Speaker, do you know how many minutes we spent debating the contents of the domestic appropriation bill conference reports in the last session of Congress when the Republicans controlled? Zero, because they produced zero legislation.     
   They left their dirty work to us, so we had to do twice the work this year because they didn't do any of it on the domestic side of the ledger last year. So 60 minutes may not be a lot to debate, but it's a whole lot more than zero.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to express my appreciation for the tremendous work done by the entire staff. It's already been mentioned by the gentleman from California. I want to publicly express my gratitude to the entire staff on both sides of the aisle as well as the associate staff and especially Rob Nabors, our staff director on the committee. 
   I don't think Members sufficiently appreciate how many nights in a row these staff people go without sleep. These people have literally been here virtually around the clock for the last 3 days. It's a miracle that they don't make some major mistakes. 
   I also want to express our special concern tonight for Dixon Butler, a staffer who has served the committee very well who underwent some very serious surgery yesterday. I think it's safe to say that Members on both sides of the aisle are very concerned about him, and we hope he'll take all the time he needs to get well. 
   I also want to make a few remarks to put this bill in context, because it is the major domestic achievement of the Congress for this year. 
   Last year, Mr. Speaker, in November, the public sent two messages. One was that they wanted to end the war in Iraq. The second was that they wanted a change in national priorities. We have struggled mightily to bring about both, and we have failed for two reasons. Number one, because we have not had enough votes in the Senate. The public thinks that my party has control of the United States Senate. Unfortunately, we merely have custody of it. Under their peculiar rules, they require 60 percent of the votes to make a major decision. We only have 51 percent of those votes on our side of the aisle in the Senate. 
   The second reason that we have failed to accomplish a good many things that we wanted to accomplish is because the President, after the election, essentially told the American people, Forget what message you thought you were sending. I'm the great decider. We're going to continue to do things my way. And that is what he has tried to do. 
   The result is that we have passed bills to try to change direction in Iraq twice. The President vetoed one of them, and he has blocked action on the other one in the United States Senate. He has insisted that we spend nearly $200 billion more for Iraq, but he said at the same time that we could not afford one-tenth that amount for crucial investments here at home. 
   We sent appropriation bills containing 70 percent of domestic discretionary spending to the President. On a bipartisan basis we sent those bills down. We averaged almost 60 Republican votes. He chose the veto path instead, and so only the Defense appropriation bill has become law. 
   He has insisted that he write the top line in the budget. If we did that, we would have cut 800 grants from the National Institutes of Health. We would have cut access to health care by $600 million. We would have cut rural health by 54 percent, vocational education by 50 percent. We would have eliminated every student aid program except Pell Grant and Work-Study. We would have cut the State and local law enforcement grants by $1.2 billion. We would have cut deeply into renewable energy. 
   We sent to him legislation which had very different priorities. He vetoed it. Next we asked, Why don't we split the difference? Why don't we go halfway to the President and have him come halfway to us? His response was, No way. 
   So now, as the majority leader has said, we're at the end of the road. This is the last chance to produce a set of domestic priorities that are different from those the President proposes. 
   In my view, this bill is totally inadequate to meet the long-term investment needs of the country, but it is a whole lot better than would have been the case if we had not waged the fight. Because of that fight, this bill will contain $600 million more than the President wanted for the National Institutes of Health. It will contain $1 billion more than the President wanted for community health centers and other points of health care access. It will contain $150 million more to help rural communities deal with their health problems. It will contain $150 million more for the Social Security Administration to deal with its disability backlogs. It will contain $800 million more in elementary and secondary education than the President wanted. It will provide $575 million above the President for vocational education. It will provide $1.2 billion more in State and local law enforcement assistance than the President wanted. It will provide $1.8 billion more for homeland and border security. And it will provide $500 million more for renewable energy and energy efficiency. 
   And, most importantly, it will provide $3.7 billion more for veterans' health care. It seems to me if the President can ask us to spend $200 billion more on the war in Iraq, we can spend $3.7 billion more to help those who wage the war at great risk to their own health and their own lives. 
   This bill also contains $7 billion in emergency funding. Eighty-five percent of that money has been asked for by the administration. It didn't originate here. 
   All in all, we have been able to move about $21 billion into a better set of priorities than we were presented with when we were presented with the President's budget. 
   We have heard a lot about all of the shortcomings in process tonight, but let me make clear there is one vital difference between what we are doing this year and what we did a year ago. Last year under a Republican majority, our friends on the other side of the aisle were not able to complete action on a single domestic appropriation bill, so we were left to deal with that when we took control of this institution in January. The difference is that this year we are recognizing that in an adult world, win, lose, or draw, we have an obligation to reach some final decisions. We have an obligation to compromise and move on. And that's what we are trying to do with this legislation. It is a responsible thing to do. 
   I want to thank every Democrat who supported it. I want to thank every Republican who will support it. And I would hope that this can finally wrap up the session, reflecting somewhat better than the President's budget has what the priority wishes are of the American people. I ask for ``aye'' votes on the two amendments.

Early this afternoon I submitted for printing in the Record a lengthy and complete explanatory statement, the same statement that went on the Rules Committee Web site last night.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, let me simply point out that the last year the Republicans were in control we had $16 billion in earmarks. This bill tonight cuts that by 42 percent.

   With respect to his charge that we have 34 pounds in this budget in order to pass the domestic appropriation bills this year, that's absolutely correct. It's very heavy. You can double the weight by only printing on one side, as the gentleman has done, but the fact is, do you know how high the stack was a year ago? Here. Do you see anything? It's because you didn't pass any domestic appropriation bills whatsoever. I'll take this over nothing any time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 9 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill gives the President the exit strategy from the Iraqi civil war that up until now he has not had. 
   Next Tuesday will be the fourth anniversary of the President's ``Mission Accomplished'' landing on that famous aircraft carrier. On that date, U.S. troops had won the war in Iraq, but since that time the administration's mismanagement, their misjudgments, and their missed opportunities have entangled us in a quagmire that has become a prolonged civil war. That civil war has gutted our influence in the Middle East and much of the world. In the last 4 years, the administration has spent over half a trillion dollars. It has stretched the Army to the limit, brought our Guard and Reserve to the breaking point, and reduced our military to the lowest state of military readiness in modern history. 
   The President has refused to finance this war through the normal appropriations process. He has chosen to mask the true cost of the war by paying for it on the installment plan through a series of supplemental requests. He has  now requested another supplemental of almost another $100 billion in military spending, and almost $4 billion in other additional spending. The bill before us today is our response. 
   We provide $4 billion more than the President asked for for troops in the field. The President is objecting on two grounds. First, he does not like the conditions we have placed on funding for the war. Second, he objects to the money we have added for other crucial activities. He calls it ``pork.'' So do some of the charter members of the ``Invent Your Own Facts Club'' that seems to populate this institution. 
   We have provided $4 billion more than he has asked for for operation and maintenance for personnel costs and for procurement. 
   We have provided $750 million more than he asked for for Afghanistan. 
   We have provided $2.2 billion more for military health to meet the medical needs of our returning soldiers. We have added $1.8 billion for veterans health care above the amount the President asked for. 
   We have provided $2.2 billion more for aviation security, port security, and border security. 
   We have provided $80 million more for nuclear nonproliferation, and we have added $150 million for the FBI. 
   We have provided $650 million more than the President asked for for the pandemic flu emergency, cleaning up an action that last year's Congress never got around to completing. 
   We have provided $3.3 billion more for Katrina, again cleaning up some more business that last year's Congress failed to complete. 
   We have also provided $3.1 billion more for BRAC which the administration itself asked for in its budget last year. 
   We provided $500 million for wild land fires, the same amount put into the same account by the Republican majority 2 years ago for the same purposes. 
   We have added $400 million to low income heating assistance because the previous Congress cut that by $1 billion. We should have added back the whole billion dollars, but in the interest of saving money we confined it to $400 million. 
   We have added $425 million to continue the rural school payments in the West that the last Congress never got around to renewing. Unfortunately, they allowed that program to expire, as they allowed so many other things to expire last year. 
   We have also provided $3.5 billion for agriculture disaster, again an issue which has been hanging around for more than a year. The President has declared more than 70 percent of the counties in this country to be agriculture disaster areas. There ought to be some action that flows from that unless we are taking the President's initial action to be meaningless. 
   We have also provided $396 million in SCHIP to make certain that low income children and low income families don't fall off the State health care rolls. We have been asked to do that by bipartisan Governors from 14 States. 
   If the President wants to object to those items and call them pork, or of members of the flat earth club in this body want to call it pork, that's fine with me; I think the public will look at those issues somewhat differently. 
   The President is attacking these additional items as a smoke screen to obscure the fact that the key issue on this bill is whether or not there will be a change in direction with respect to our policy in Iraq.     
   This bill supports the troops. It begins to hold Iraq and the administration accountable, and it points the way to ending our involvement in a protracted civil war. 
   As a condition of providing the President with the funds he has asked for, we require that our American military units meet certain standards that are known as the Murtha standards. They simply require that any unit sent into battle be fully combat ready. They would require, as the Defense Department already has for the most part, they would require that any unit that has been in Iraq does not have to stay there for more than a year without relief, and they also require that if they are sent back, they get to spend at least a year at home before they go back. And in an era where no one is being asked to sacrifice except military families, it seems to me those are all minimum goals that we all ought to be willing to adhere to. 
   Because the President rejected these requirements, we have given him the right to waive these requirements, but only if he spells out to the country why he has departed from them. That is imminently reasonable. He owes the country that explanation. 
   We require that Iraq meet certain performance benchmarks, benchmarks that were first laid out by the President himself, and we tie those benchmarks to a timeline. If those benchmarks are met, redeployment of U.S. troops must begin by July 1. If they are not met, they must begin by October. Those dates are firm. The goal for completing such redeployment is 6 months after it starts. 
   Now, the President objects to the fact that we are setting timelines, but the Secretary of Defense himself was quoted in the Washington Post as noting that these timelines, in fact, have helped give the Iraqis a message that we are not going to stay in Iraq forever. We stand by them. We believe these benchmarks and these timelines are necessary in order to give General Petraeus the ability to make clear to the Iraqis that we are not going to stay there forever, while they refuse to make the political compromises necessary to end the civil war. 
   Iraqis and the President must understand our troops won the war. They cannot achieve the political and diplomatic compromises that are needed to end the civil war, only the Iraqis can do that. 
   Four years after ``mission accomplished'' is long enough, Mr. Speaker. If the President were here I would simply say to him, ``Mr. President, with this bill we have compromised on two fronts. We have responded to your objection to the Murtha principles by giving you the ability to waive them; all you have to do is explain why to the country.'' We have responded to his concerns about those timelines by adjusting them and making them somewhat more flexible in terms of their completion. 
   So I would say to the President if he were here, ``Mr. President, it is your turn; we need a new direction and we need it now. Please do not say, as you said last week'' I will talk but I will not compromise. ``Mr. President, after 4 years, you need to change the direction. You need to sign this bill.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I include for the RECORD the following tabular material reflecting the funding levels in the conference report.     Insert offset folio 481A/1 here EH25AP07.001     Insert offset folio 481A/2 here EH25AP07.002     Insert offset folio 481A/3 here EH25AP07.003     Insert offset folio 481A/4 here EH25AP07.004     Insert offset folio 481A/5 here EH25AP07.005     Insert offset folio 481A/6 here EH25AP07.006     Insert offset folio 481A/7 here EH25AP07.007     Insert offset folio 481A/8 here EH25AP07.008     Insert offset folio 481A/9 here EH25AP07.009     Insert offset folio 481A/10 here EH25AP07.010     Insert offset folio 481A/11 here EH25AP07.011     Insert offset folio 481A/12 here EH25AP07.012     Insert offset folio 481A/13 here EH25AP07.013

We have seen a failure on the part of the administration to give the Congress accurate information. We have seen a failure to focus on al Qaeda and Afghanistan rather than being diverted to Iraq. We have seen a failure to understand the nature of the civil war in Iraq. And as a result, we have seen a tremendous collapse of American influence in the world. It is tragic.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, we've heard a lot of comments tonight about what there should or should not be in this legislation, and I agree with many of those comments. And honestly, just once, acting as chairman of a committee, I would like to put together a bill which reflects my priorities. But that is not usually what chairmen have to do in this place. 
   What we have to do is try to find a consensus that will gather 218 votes and be sustained over time. And on this bill, there are some peculiar problems because, very frankly, we have a very different constituency in this House for continuing the war in Iraq than we have for most of the other items in the bill and, therefore, we had to find a way to allow each and every Member of the House to express his or her opinion. We had to try to find a way to allow each and every Member to vote their convictions in a way which would not keep the House tied up in knots for another 6 months. 
   Now, the way we did that was to adopt a procedure under which we took a conference report pending between the Senate and the House, and used that as the device by which each House would express their preferences, and we would work our way to a solution. 
   Our committee is often criticized because we wind up producing omnibus appropriations in which everything is thrown into one package, and people are forced to vote up or down on the entire package. What we tried to do this time was to do just the opposite, to disaggregate these issues so that people would have a chance to vote separately on the major propositions in the legislation. 
   And that is why the House sent to the Senate originally three amendments. We sent one amendment that would fund the operations for Iraq and Afghanistan. We sent a second amendment which stipulated the conditions under which the first amendment money could be expended. And then we had a third amendment which laid out, basically, other domestic priorities or associated military priorities that we thought were important. And we sent it to the Senate, and it included a number of items about which questions have been raised tonight. 
   In addition to the expanded GI benefits for veterans and unemployment compensation, we tried to protect the Medicaid safety net by having a moratorium on seven Medicaid regulations.     
   We also had a number of restrictions on Iraq policy, one requiring that any money that is expended for reconstruction by the State Department or USAID be matched dollar for dollar by the Iraqi Government so that they  would begin to pick up a fair share of the cost of redeveloping their own country. 
   We also had language with respect to trying to assure that there would be no permanent bases in Iraq. We had funding $2.2 billion above the President's level for military construction and veterans' hospitals, and we fully funded BRAC. 
   Someone asked earlier on the floor today why did we have $178 million in this war supplemental for the Bureau of Prisons. Very simple. Because the executive agency asked for the money because if we don't, there are going to be prison guards laid off because there has been a heavier than expected Federal prison population. And that may not be an emergency to Members of Congress, but if you're one of those prison guards who's working shorthanded under dangerous situations, you don't want to have people laid off in those Federal prisons. 
   And so we sent that package over to the Senate, and the Senate added roughly 37 additional items which cost $10 billion and which the House felt, in many instances, did not accurately reflect emergency expenditure funds. 
   So the Senate sent those amendments back to us, and among other things, they stripped out totally the conditions on the war. That is why I will personally vote against amendment No. 1 because I would vote for that amendment provided that we had a set of reasonable conditions in defining what our national policy is in Iraq. Absent those conditions, I don't intend to vote for that amendment. 
   But I do intend to vote for the second amendment, and I want to take just a moment to explain what was in it. Primarily, we do three important things: We, first of all, create a new program to provide greatly expanded education benefits for American veterans under the GI Bill. We have some Members of this House who are unhappy about the fact that that is not paid for. I am among them. But I would point out that the entire war is not being paid for. Mr. Murtha and I and Mr. McGovern tried to offer the House an opportunity to vote to pay for the entire war. We did not, frankly, find much enthusiasm for that on either side of the political aisle. 
   But we stipulated that we felt that if that war was going to be fought, even though I personally think it's the most misguided war since the War of 1812, nonetheless, we felt if the war was going to be fought, at least we ought to pay for it so we didn't pass the cost down to our grandkids. 
   That has not happened. 
   My point is simply that if we aren't going to pay for the war, then I feel no particular guilt about saying to the GIs who have fought the war that we aren't going to provide you with the equivalent of a 4-year college education because we have had no sense of self-sacrifice in this country except on the part of military families. They've been asked to sacrifice again and again and again while the rest of us have been asked to go shopping or swallow a tax cut. And I think that's illegitimate. 
   We lost the argument on funding the war, and it just seems to me that it is a peculiar view of proportion if people get exercised about not paying for the GI Bill expansion but don't get exercised about not paying for the war. It would take over 50 years of paying benefits under this new expanded GI Bill. It would take more than 50 years to spend as much money on veterans as will be spent in a 2-year period in Iraq. 
   And so I make no apology. While I would prefer that it be paid for, I make no apology for the fact that, in the end, it wasn't. This is the only way that we could get the United States Senate and the administration to accept the expanded GI Bill. And I think we owe it to those veterans to provide it no matter what the budgetary niceties are. 
   Secondly, with respect to unemployment compensation. We wound up essentially--and I want to thank Mr. Rangel especially for the work he did in conference yesterday. The House initially sent over a package which provided 13 weeks of expanded unemployment benefits for every State in the country and then provided an additional 13 weeks on top of that for States with high unemployment rates. 
   The administration, as you know, Mr. Speaker, did not want that. They objected to it. So we looked for various ways to try to salvage as much of that as we could. 
   In the end, we adopted changes which bring the cost of that down from about $10 billion to $8 billion. So we have retained 80 percent of the original unemployment compensation provision. 
   We've made two changes. We have agreed with the administration's request to require 20 weeks of work history if a person is going to be eligible for that, and we also dropped the second step, the targeting of those benefits. We will have to deal with that issue on another bill in another venue. 
   The third issue that was causing great controversy was the fact that we were trying to place a moratorium on seven Medicaid regulations that the administration was trying to impose that would cut services to seniors, families, and those with disabilities. In the end, we got six of those seven in the package. I think that's doing pretty well. 
   Because of the new disasters that we have had around the country, certainly most visible in Iowa recently, the administration agreed to $1.8 billion in disaster funding. This bill comes in considerably higher than that at $2.65 billion. 
   That's basically the outline of what we have done. And there are several other items in the bill. One that Members should be aware of, if we do not get our appropriation bills done by the end of the fiscal year--that has been known to happen from time to time around here--if that doesn't happen, then if we were to proceed for a short time on a continuing resolution, Israel would wind up receiving $170 million less than the President's budget. We did not want that to happen. And so we are including in this bill a provision which guarantees that as of October 1, that even if we were to pass a continuing resolution at last year's level, Israel would not be accidentally shortchanged by that action and they would get that additional $170 million. 
   There are a number of other provisions in the bill, but I think most Members are familiar with them. Most of these items have been around for quite a while. 
   And so with that, Mr. Speaker, I would like to reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   It is now 1:30 in the afternoon, very late into December and we have to decide how soon we want to get out of town so that we don't have to look at each other for the remainder of the year. 
   This vehicle is necessary to simply keep the government open while we're making the final decisions on all remaining appropriations for the fiscal year. 
   There have been numerous meetings going on this week all over Capitol Hill, and there have obviously been many communications going on between the Hill and other locuses of influence and power in the city. And I would hope that those would bear fruition sometime soon. 
   Meanwhile, if we want to keep the government open, we have no choice but to pass this continuing resolution. It simply extends, it keeps the government open for another week, to December 21, 2007. I think it's self-explanatory. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I had thought that perhaps once this session we could simply do our jobs straightaway without having the usual, trite partisan slogans uttered again and again. I'd hoped that we wouldn't continue to chew the same cud over and over again. But evidently we can't. So I will simply take a couple of minutes to respond to the gentleman's comments. 
   For me to take lectures from the minority party on fiscal management or the management of appropriations would be akin to Willie Sutton lecturing the House on bank security. It wouldn't be taken very seriously. 
   But let me, nonetheless, since the gentleman has chosen to engage in yet another round of carping, let me simply point out that the gentleman is now making a fuss, once again, because we have not passed appropriation bills singly and now face the prospect of an omnibus appropriation bill with all domestic appropriations tossed into one budget document. If that, in fact, occurs, what it will mean is that the President sent us one budget document and we sent him one back. That's hardly a Federal offense, the last time that I checked. 
   Secondly, I would simply point out that this Congress has passed and sent to the President appropriation bills totaling about 75 percent of all of the discretionary spending in the budget. The reason that none of the domestic bills have been finalized is because the President chose to veto the Labor, Health, Education appropriation bill. So we are now engaged in the only action left open to us, which is to reach a negotiated agreement between the Senate and the House and between the Congress and the President. We are trying to achieve the required negotiated result between the two branches of government and between the two branches of the legislative portion of the government. 
   Let me simply say that there will be, at the end of this year, there will be one critical difference between this Congress and the previous Congress controlled by our friends on the other side. In the previous Congress, they were able to pass not a single domestic appropriation bill through the Congress. They had passed them through the House, just as we passed all of our appropriation bills through the House. In fact, they didn't pass all of their appropriations bills through the House. They didn't get the Labor-H bill passed last year, which was the major domestic appropriation because they did not see fit to provide a minimum wage increase for workers, and so they preferred to bury the bill rather than have a bill pass which carried a minimum wage increase for America's workers. 
   But the critical difference between them and us is that when we took over this Congress in January, we had to first clean up their mess. We had to spend the first six weeks passing appropriation bills to make up for the fact that they had not passed a single domestic appropriation bill. And so, as a consequence, we will have one critical difference when our work is done, hopefully at the end of next week. We will have passed all of the appropriation bills necessary to keep the government running for a full fiscal year. We may not have done it in single fashion, as they would prefer, but the fact is that, whether they like the packaging, we will have done our jobs, and I would submit we will have done our jobs on a bipartisan basis. 
   There were, on average, 60 Republicans who helped us every step of the way in trying to pass these appropriation bills. I think that demonstrates that we had bipartisan legislation before us in virtually all instances on those appropriation bills, and that was reflected in the fact that, on average, we had over 60 Republicans supporting each of those bills. 
   We could not get the bills through the Senate, but they will, in the end, be passed, and that, in the end, will be a critical difference between the result of the record produced by our friends on the other side last year and one that will be produced, I would hope, on a bipartisan basis this year under different management. 
   So with that, if the gentleman has any further comments, I'll withhold. If he has any further speakers, I'll withhold. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Let me simply take a moment to indicate where I think we are on the appropriation matters. I think we have a reasonable prospect of finishing our work for the year come the middle of next week. I had originally been predicting that we would be out of here on the 22nd of December and reconvene after the 27th. I'm now slightly more optimistic than I was initially. And I think that, while none of us may be particularly enamored of the final result, I think that we are getting closer to having a result which can be supported by many people on both sides of the aisle, at least in the House itself.     
   I cannot speak for what the Senate will produce, but I would hope that Members would familiarize themselves. As soon as we have the final product available, we will try to make that product available to Members so that they have an opportunity to review it before we actually vote on it next week. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. I very much thank the gentleman for the time. 
   Madam Speaker, I observed that the minority is complaining about the fact that this approach has not been sufficiently bipartisan. As I recall, during the 10 years that the Democrats were in the minority, or more, I asked the Rules Committee almost 100 times to make specific proposals in order. The last time I checked, the record demonstrated that they had made them in order exactly two times.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBEY. (SELECT INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT PANEL -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. I didn't hear what you said, but I don't have the time to yield anyway, I am sorry. 
   The fact is that the 9/11 Commission recognized two problems that in their words rendered congressional oversight of intelligence ``dysfunctional''. The first was that the intelligence authorizing committee was routinely ignored by the administration and the intelligence community because they didn't provide the money. In this town, people follow the money. 
   Secondly, the Appropriations Committee, frankly, was negligent in its responsibilities for oversight. Example: When Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld established an independent intelligence operation outside of the purview of his own agency's intelligence shop, I tried to find out what was going on. I requested that the Appropriations Committee do a thorough Surveys And Investigations study of what was going on. My efforts were blocked by that same committee. 
   The third problem we faced is that there was grossly insufficient staff on the part of the Appropriations Committee to have decent congressional oversight. Example: The Democratic minority had exactly one staffer to deal not only with all intelligence issues but also with the entire defense budget. How much do you think you can get done with one person? 
   The other problem was that there was not sufficient emphasis on intelligence matters by the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee because they had a lot of other things to do dealing with ``little'' problems like the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force. 
   So the 9/11 Commission suggested one way to correct that problem. They suggested that we merge the authorizers with the appropriators, and that the authorizing committee, in fact, do the appropriating. 
   We concluded that there was a better way to accomplish the same goal. We felt that the problem with the initial recommendation was that it doesn't make much sense to consider intelligence funding requests standing alone, because in the real world those requests have to compete with other national security imperatives, again, funding the Army, the Air Force, and the other agencies. 
   Instead, we chose to follow a different model, that of the Joint Committee on Taxation. That committee conducts an annual review of the strategic plans and the budget of the IRS. 
   This bill follows, with some variation, that pattern. It creates a hybrid committee composed of members from the Intelligence Committee and the Appropriations Committee. They are all appointed by the Speaker because, in technical terms, whenever task forces are created around here, it is the Speaker who does the appointing. Speaker Pelosi has already made crystal clear that she intends to appoint whatever Republicans are suggested by the minority leader. 
   But there was another reason that the Speaker is listed as appointing all of these people, because we want to make clear to the intelligence community that if they try to ignore what this task force is trying to do, that they are not just messing around with individual Members of Congress; they are messing around with the leader of an independent branch of government who has the authority to inflict consequences if they don't provide information the Congress is entitled to have. 
   This task force will be given the obligation to prepare an annual assessment of all intelligence activities and to make budget recommendations, which will serve as the basis for the preparation of the intelligence budget, the classified annex to the defense appropriation bill. 
   The reason the subcommittee needs to have at least the ability in theory to change some of those recommendations is because it has a job which that panel doesn't have. It has the job of measuring the needs of intelligence against other national security needs, and it needs to have that flexibility. 
   But this bill would also lead to a beefed-up staff for this task force, and that task force will be buttressed by the subpoena power of the Appropriations Committee. 
   That means that at long last we will have at least one panel which the intelligence community cannot ignore. We will have one panel which even the Republican members of the commission, like John Lehman, have indicated is a great step forward. I would just suggest that if the gentleman had preferred a different approach, it would have been nice if he had produced one in the 2 1/2 years he had the chance. 
   I urge support for this proposal.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Speaker, if the gentleman from Illinois, my good friend, wants to hyperventilate over the fact that I simply verbally referred to this as a ``task force'' rather than a ``panel,'' be my guest. I guess his threshold of excitement has been considerably lowered these days. 
   Let me simply say, the gentleman says this is an insult to Mr. Murtha and to Mr. Young. No, it is not. He asked, does the Defense Appropriations Committee need oversight? It certainly did the last year, and let me tell you why. 
   When Mr. Rumsfeld set up his separate stovepiping operation for intelligence, I went to Mr. Murtha, asked him to sign a letter instituting a surveys and investigations study because, under our rules, under our practices, we needed the support of the full chairman, the full ranking member and the subcommittee chairman and the subcommittee ranking member. I went to Mr. Murtha. He signed on to the letter calling for the investigation. I went to Mr. Young. He signed on to the letter calling for the investigation. But I was blocked by the full committee chairman. 
   So if you are asking me, does the Appropriations Committee, based on its record of the last 2 years, need some additional oversight on this issue? You bet it does, because as a result of that refusal to proceed, we never did learn what Rumsfeld was doing until we read it in the press. That is not the way it is supposed to work. 
   This is the first time that we have created any kind of a panel that will  force the Appropriations Committee and the authorizing committee to work together like adults rather than worrying about dunghill jurisdictional issues. And the security of this country is a whole lot more important than the feelings of any one committee.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBEY. (DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 10 minutes. 
   Madam Speaker, I recognize Members want to get out of here and, as I indicated, we are going to facilitate that. But this is an important issue, and it deserves a few minutes of discussion. 
   As I said on the floor last week, in November I believe the American people sent two messages to this body and to the White House. Number one, they wanted a change in policy in Iraq; and, number two, they wanted a change in domestic priorities here at home. 
   I think that the White House, by its insistence on no compromise on both the Iraqi front and on the domestic appropriations front, has indicated that it would prefer to tell the American people: We don't care what you thought you were telling us in November, we are going to do it our way; and, it is our way or the highway. 
   Madam Speaker, it is simply not credible for a President who is asking us to spend $200 billion in additional money in Iraq, it is not credible for a President who is asking us to spend $50 billion to $60 billion again this year on tax cuts for people who make over $1 million a year, to then say that we cannot afford to make basic investments in education, in health care, in medical research. 
   The President insists that we follow his budget with respect to this bill. If we do, we would cut vocational education 50 percent; we would eliminate every student aid program except Pell Grants and work study; we would cut handicapped education by $300 million; we would cut mental health resources by $100 million; we would cut the training in children's hospitals by 63 percent; we would cut rural health by 54 percent; and, we would cut low-income heating assistance by 18 percent. 
   The gentleman from New York mentioned the need for compromise on this bill. We have already had incredible compromise. We have had compromise on virtually every item in this bill, on every issue ranging from family planning to special education, and the minority has been involved every step of the way. When the bill was reported out of subcommittee, every single member of the subcommittee signed the committee report, and yet today we face a Presidential veto. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to make one thing clear. We have said from the beginning to the White House we would like to compromise. We have asked the White House, I have asked Mr. Nussle, I know our leadership has asked the President personally, to sit down and work out our differences. We have been told as recently as last Saturday by the press secretary speaking for the White House that the White House had no intention of compromising, and that all the Congress had to do to meet the President's standards was to submit a bill which was fully identical with his budget.     
   I'm sorry, this is an independent branch of government, and we have an obligation to do better than that. 
   Now, I was asked by a number of members of the press earlier today why the Senate majority leader had released information indicating that I and Senator Byrd were in the process of trying to put together a split-the-difference appropriation bill for all of the remaining appropriation items that still have yet to be finished. I want to take this opportunity to explain why we've done that. 
   People might like to cast a vote without having to take responsibility for knowing the consequences, but there are severe consequences for voting against overriding the President's veto of the Labor-Health-Education bill. 
   If this veto is not overridden, the best that could happen is that we will wind up splitting the difference with the President's wholly inadequate budgets. If we were to do a 50 percent cut to the difference between the Labor-Health-Education bill and the President's budget, what will that mean for the programs that so many Members of Congress claim that they are for? 
   For medical research into diseases like cancer, Parkinson's and diabetes at the National Institutes of Health, meeting the President halfway would put us $700 million below the bill we are considering today. That means 700 fewer grants for research to treat and cure all of the deadly diseases that all of us like to tell our constituents we're sworn to try to overcome. I don't want to have to go back home and explain that kind of cut in NIH, but that's one of the things that will happen undoubtedly, if this veto is not overridden tonight. 
   For health care access, to provide 1.2 million more Americans with access to community health centers, this bill is  $200 million above the President's request. Under a split-the-difference scenario, access for 600,000 Americans will evaporate. 
   Likewise, this bill provides $95 million so that 200,000 Americans who can't get insurance because they are medically high risk will have access to health insurance at the State level. That insurance also evaporates for 100,000 people if we split the difference. 
   Under the President's budget, vocational education would be cut by 50 percent. This bill eliminates that cut, but meeting him halfway would still mean a 25 percent cut. 
   My Republican colleagues worked hard to push funding up for special education, even beyond what I had proposed in committee, funding the program $800 million above the President's request. Defeat of this bill will slash that increase by $400 million. 
   This bill provides $400 million above the President to serve nearly 120,000 more low-income kids with title I grants. But 60,000 of those kids will be out of luck if we meet the President's budget halfway. 
   For the LIHEAP program, this bill also helps around 1 1/2 million more families to pay their energy bills by providing $630 million more than the President's budget. Anyone who votes against this bill will be making inevitable at least a $315 million cut. That means 750,000 fewer families will have help this winter. 
   Now, please remember, everything that I've described is, at best, a best-case scenario if this bill is defeated and we have to pursue a split-the-difference alternative. In fact, as long as a sufficient number of Republican Members continue to follow the President's budget priorities, the result is likely to be even worse. Those who vote against overriding this veto will take full responsibility for the cuts in these essential investments. 
   I would like to make one other point. I know most of you on that side of the aisle, and I recognize that there are probably 50 or 60 of you who are so indifferent to these programs that you could care less what happens, but I don't believe that that's true about the rest of you. I think you care about America's children as much as I do. I think you care about medical research as much as I do. And many of you have told me that you wish you could vote for this bill, but your party leadership won't give you a permission slip. 
   I ask you to use your own judgment. I ask you to recognize that this issue may not be important to you, but it's important to the American families who are affected by what you do here tonight. It affects the quality of their education; it affects the degree to which we will protect the health and safety of American workers; it protects our ability to dig into the problem of serious disease across the board. 
   You know in your hearts that this is a decent bill. This is a bipartisan product put together in a bipartisan way. It deserves a bipartisan vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Madam Speaker, the measure we are considering today contains the same language pertaining to the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and related agencies that the House approved by a vote of 269-142 on Wednesday evening. The statement of the managers accompanying the conference report on H.R. 3043 contains instructions and guidance to these departments and agencies, including detailed tabular material regarding the allocation of resources among the various programs, projects and activity funded in the measure pending before us today. 
   House Report 110-424 reflects the intent of congressional guidance underlying the legislation now before the House. The departments and agencies funded in H.R. 3043 should implement these programs, projects and activities in a manner consistent with the guidance in that report. 
   Now that I have the boilerplate out of the way, Madam Speaker, let me simply make a very few observations. Madam Speaker, it is now ``put-up or shut up'' time in the House. This is a bipartisan bill. When the bill first passed the House, we had 53 Republicans supporting it, along with every single Democrat, except one. We had every single subcommittee Republican and Democrat vote for the bill as it left committee. When it was marked up, every single amendment offered from the minority side of the aisle was an amendment to increase, not decrease, funds. 
   The President, in the budget that he submitted to the Congress, suggested that we cut vocational education, cut special education, cut NIH funding, cut LIHEAP, and cut training for medical personnel in children's hospitals. We rejected those suggestions. We also kept a good many provisions in the bill that were sought by many minority members on the subcommittee. 
   Also, because it is such a controversial issue, we tried to cut through the issue of abortion, and we provided several hundred million dollars in initiatives to help encourage women to carry babies to full-term, so we would offer young women something besides lectures when it came to the question of whether or not they would carry their babies to full-term or seek an abortion. After the bill left the House, we made further concessions to the White House and the minority party by cutting $1 billion out of the bill that we had voted on in the House. 
   Now, when we voted to go to conference a week ago, at that time, as you know, the intention of the majority was to include the Defense appropriation bill in this conference report. We heard many objections from the minority side of the aisle, so we conceded the point and took Defense out. We left Military Construction in, but the Senate overruled us. So now at this point we have a bill which is exactly what so many people said they wanted, a straight-up, unadorned Labor, Health, Education and Social Services bill. 
   I would point out that with respect to the question of earmarks, when this House started the consideration of this bill, I offered the House a chance to eliminate every single earmark with an amendment that I proposed. It was overwhelmingly defeated on both sides of the aisle, and this bill has proceeded within the spirit and the letter of the rules with respect to earmarks. It moved to the Senate, and it received almost 80 votes. 
   So now it is really up to us. The choice is whether or not we are going to exercise our own judgment as an independent body about what requirements we have in this economy, or whether we are simply going to wire our buttons to the White House door. I would hope that we would not do that. 
   In 2 short minutes remaining, I would like to simply remind Members what is at stake. 
   On health care, one in six Americans is without health insurance. That is 47 million Americans. The President cut funding for the primary Federal agency responsible for increasing health care access by $600 million. This bill rejects those cuts and provides $1.5 billion above the President's request for programs to improve health care access, roughly the cost of 5 days' activities in Iraq. 
   On education, the President cut funding for the Department of Education by $1.2 billion. This bill rejects those cuts, investing $4.5 billion above the President's request to the Department of Education, roughly the cost of operating for 2 weeks in Iraq. 
   On job training, the President cut the largest job training program in the vocational education programs by $1.2 billion. He cut State grants for vocational education in half. We rejected those cuts on a bipartisan basis, investing $1.3 billion above the President's request, roughly the cost of 4 days of operations in Iraq. 
   With respect to medical research, the President attempted to cut funding for medical research at the National Institutes of Health by $450 million. That would have resulted in 800 fewer medical research grants. The committee rejected those cuts, investing about $1.4 billion above the President's request, roughly the cost of 4 days in Iraq. 
   Finally, the Low Income Heating Assistance Program, the President tried to cut that by $400 million. We rejected those cuts and invested $630 million more than he requested, roughly the cost of 2 days in Iraq. 
   This is a balanced bill. It is a moderate bill. It is essential to make these investments, and I would urge Members on both sides of the aisle to support the proposal. 
   I would make one last point: on earmarks, when this House voted on my amendment to determine whether or not earmarks should be retained or excluded from the bill, this House voted 53-369 to keep earmarks in the bill, and we have tried to do that. We have a 40 percent reduction in the amount of money for earmarks. It is a 40 percent reduction from the amount that this House had 2 years ago. 
   But I want to make one practical point.     
   I know there are some people in this Chamber who believe that if this bill goes down, if the President vetoes it, that somehow a way will be found to compromise and still protect these earmarks. 
   I want to make it clear, I have been told many times by the White House that they have no intention whatsoever of compromising on this or any other bill that exceeds the President's wishes. If that is the case and if this bill goes down, then the only alternative left to us will be to bring in a bill at the President's level of funding. 
   I would ask every serious-minded person in this body, if they really think there is a chance of a snowball in Hades that Members' earmarks on either side of the aisle will survive if we wind up at the President's level of funding, I think you understand that is not likely. And so I think the fate of all of the work that has gone into this bill, the fate of every project that Members have been concerned about is in your hands. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Madam Speaker, I know the gentleman from California has to get to another meeting, so I will not take long. Everyone understands what this is. It is a continuing resolution that keeps the government open until the last day of the year so that the President can review other pending legislation. 
   I do want to just take one moment to bring to the House's attention the fact that a good and faithful servant of the House will soon be leaving this institution, John Daniel, who is sitting next to me and who, if he could, would wring my neck because I am even mentioning him. 
   John has served the Rules Committee, he has served the leadership, and he has served the Appropriations Committee for many years with extremely excellent judgment and extreme dedication to this institution. He is a strong institutionalist. There are a lot of people in this institution who demagogue the institution every day. John is not one of them. 
   I simply want to express my profound thanks to him for the service he has given the House in general and most specifically the service he has given to the Appropriations Committee. We hate to see him leave, but sometimes even the best of congressional staffers have a lapse in judgment. That is the only thing that can explain his departure in this case. 
   With that, I am ready to yield back when the gentleman is ready to yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, before I get to the matter at hand, I would like to, as the minority leader did just a moment ago, I would like to take special note of the fact that the Appropriations Committee in the House is losing a highly valuable member of our staff. 
   David Morrison has served the Appropriations Committee and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee with distinction for a number of years. I know I have certainly come to rely on him for many things, and I know the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Murtha, has certainly heavily relied on him as well. I hesitate to point out that before he served the Appropriations Committee in the House, he had an errant career. He spent part of that career at the Office of Management and Budget, and he spent another portion of that career in the other body. Despite that fact, he has recovered very well, and he has served us extremely well in the House. We hate to see him leave, and I think we all owe him a round of applause. 
   Mr. Speaker, I don't want to take much time. I know people want to leave. Let me explain the procedure that is being followed. I have a ministerial duty to call up this Senate amendment, even though I intend to vote against it. 
   As the House I think understands, yesterday the House considered an omnibus appropriation bill, and what we did was to consider two amendments; one amendment related to the domestic funding for the bill, and the other amendment related to funding for Afghanistan and for certain force protection items. We sent those two amendments over to the Senate, and the Senate has amended the product in one respect. They have substituted for the $30 billion that we sent to the Senate for Afghanistan and for force protection items, they have substituted $70 billion, and sent it back to the House. 
   I have an obligation to allow the House to work its will on this matter, even though I suspect I am going to disagree with the result of this action.     
   In my view, when we sent legislation over to the Senate 3 weeks ago, that legislation provided for $50 billion for the purpose of helping to shut down the war by establishing a timeline, by requiring that all agencies of the Federal Government adhere to the U.S. Army Manual with respect to torture, and would also require that every unit be militarily ready to perform its duties. That is still sitting in the Senate. In my view, all that we had to do to deal with the so-called shortfall that the White House has been talking about is for the President to sign that bill with those conditions. The White House has blocked that legislation in the Senate, and so we have come to this. 
   Members will vote however they choose. I intend to vote ``no,'' but this is an individual vote of conscience. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think that probably no bill that the House will consider this year more aptly demonstrates the divided nature of this Congress and this government than does the bill that is before us right now. People often say there is not a dime's worth of difference between the two political parties. My response, at least on this occasion, is you are absolutely right. At least with respect to this legislation, there is a $40 billion difference between the two parties. Because when you take into account what this Congress did in January when it passed the continuing resolution in January, and if you take into account the money that has been moved from the President's priorities into congressional priorities in this bill, you will see that that amounts to almost $40 billion. It is not as much as I would like, but it certainly is worth the fight.     
   So I think there is a very big difference between a Congress run by our friends on the other side of the aisle and a Congress run by the now-majority Democratic Party. 
   But I think there is another significant difference, and that is the way the two parties have approached the war in Iraq. We have tried every way known to man to bring this war to a conclusion. Mr. Murtha has produced out of his subcommittee time and time again language trying to produce a policy change, and on each occasion, that language has either been vetoed by the President or it has been blocked by the President through the use of his friends in the other body. 
   So I think it is clear that if the Nation wants a change in direction with respect to this war, it has only two options: Number one is to elect more progressive voices in the United States Senate; second is to elect a President who has a different set of priorities domestically and a different vision for America's involvement in the Middle East and especially in Iraq. 
   This, in my view, is a conscience vote. As it comes down to us at this point, we have disposed of all of the domestic issues and we have this one remaining issue with respect to Iraq. I would simply say that I think we have provided more than enough money for that war. 
   I would note that earlier today, just a few moments ago, we had some 64 Members of this House vote against the alternative minimum tax fix because it was not paid for, and it added $50 billion to the debt. I would point out that the document before us will add $70 billion to that debt. And so I would hope that persons who felt it necessary to express their concern about the debt a few moments ago would be willing to do so on this occasion as well. 
   I would also point out that Mr. Murtha, Mr. McGovern and I have offered this Congress a way to avoid adding to that debt because we believe that if this war is such a hot idea, then we ought to at least pay for it so we don't shovel yet another bill off on our kids. 
   It is apparent that this House does not have the will to do that. And so not only do I think this is an unnecessary war, it is also an unnecessary add-on to the national debt.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, Members of this House have often heard me refer to my old friend, Archie the Cockroach, who is the philosopher I rely upon. And one of the things Archie said once is that ``an old stomach reforms more whiskey drinkers than does a new resolve.'' And I think we have a perfect example of that in this case. 
   We have seen the minority party, for the past 6 years, zealously and delightedly borrow over $1.2 trillion to pay for tax cuts on the cuff. We've seen them support this year providing $57 billion in tax cuts for people who make a million bucks or more a year. We've seen them blindly and blithely support a misguided war, 600 billion bucks, all borrowed. And now, coming in from a 3-day or 6-year jag, all of a sudden people are sobering up. So they're saying, ``Good gravy, look at the record we've built.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, they have destroyed their credibility with their own conservative base with their profligate borrowing to pay for their pet projects. And then they say, ``Well, how can we cover up that and cover our tracks and pretend that we are taking up the old time religion again of fiscal responsibility? 
   And so what they do is they say, ``Well why don't we attack the appropriations bills and try to create the impression that they are runaway spending.'' 
   Well, let me give you some facts. By the time this House finishes passing each of the appropriation bills that we're bringing to the floor, this House will have cut over 250 programs, saving almost $6 billion. 
   I would also point out that if you take a look at the President's budget, if you take a look at the domestic appropriation bills which he's recommended under his budget, you would see these domestic appropriations shrink from 39 percent of the budget to 36 percent. Under the bills that we're bringing to the floor, they will still shrink from 39 percent to 38 percent. 
   Bob Greenstein, who is probably the most objective budget analyst in this town, respected former OMB official, points out that these domestic appropriations bills, when adjusted for inflation, represent a 1.4 percent increase. I invite you to compare that to the 8, 9, 10 percent increases that we have in the war budgets which the President has asked us to pass. 
   This bill commits the cardinal sin of trying to restore two-thirds of the cuts that have taken place since fiscal year 2001 in crucial programs that defend the cleanliness of our air, that defend the cleanliness of our water, that protect the public health and protect the publicly owned natural resources of this country. 
   And they try to divert attention from their miserable record of fiscal irresponsibility the last 6 years by suggesting that somehow these actions have anything to do with the deficits that they've presented the country, turning a surplus when Bill Clinton left office into the largest deficits in the history of man. 
   Now, you know, I generally prefer to read nonfiction. But I am so used to hearing fiction on this House floor that I guess the next time I want to read a fiction novel I'm not going to go to The Washington Post Book Review or the New York Book Review. I'm simply going to ask my friends on the other side of the aisle, ``What's the best piece of fiction that you've been reading and been peddling this week, because I sure would like to take some lessons from you when it comes to peddling fiction.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. I would like to make a few comments on the remarks of my friend from Missouri. We've just heard an expression of deep concern about the so-called runaway spending in this bill and other appropriation bills. And we've heard deep concern expressed about how this is going to hurt the average taxpayer. 
   Well, I would like to compare priorities. They've talked about our budget. I would like to talk about theirs, although I must admit that in 3 of the last 6 years, they couldn't even pass one. We passed a budget. In 3 out of the last 6 years, they couldn't even pass their own budget because of internal squabbles between themselves. But I want to talk about the budget that they attempted to pass. The budget that we're operating under was signed by the President, passed by a Republican Congress, and this year will give over $50 billion in tax cuts to people who make over a million bucks a year. That seems to be the top priority of folks on the other side of the aisle, to preserve that high-roller tax cut above all else. 
   Well, let me tell you what we think should be higher priorities. They've attacked us because of what we did in the continuing resolution last year and they attack us for what we're trying to do in this bill today. I plead fully guilty of trying to add, in fact we did add almost $4 billion of additional funding for veterans health care. I see no sense of shared sacrifice in this country when it comes to the war. Only military families are being asked to pay a price. We decided that we ought to at least see to it that veterans are taken care of when they come home. So we added $4 billion. 
   Then you bet! We added some more so-called ``runaway spending,'' so that middle-class kids could get more help to go to college by raising the Pell Grants. Now, I've never had anybody in my district say, ``Why don't you guys get your act together and cut cancer research?'' But that's exactly what the Republican-controlled Congress did in the last 2 years. They cut health grants, research grants at the NIH, over 500 grants. So we put $610 million back into that continuing resolution to wipe out those cuts, because we think it's more important to save people's lives from cancer and Parkinson's and heart disease than it is to wear a green eye shade that says ``Mr. Perfect'' on it. 
   Then we added additional funding for community health care. 1.2 million additional Americans are going to be able to access community health centers and get health care without begging.     
   I do not apologize for that. Nobody does on this side of the aisle. When it comes to this bill, we make no apology of the fact that we are trying to restore funds which were cut out of this Interior budget for the last 3 years, cut out of the EPA budget, for the clean water revolving fund. There isn't a bigger need in rural America than clean water and decent sewer systems. 
   I represent all kinds of communities of less than 2,000 people. At least half of the families are headed either by women or people over 65. They do not have the tax-paying capacity on the property tax to meet the standards required of them to clean up their water and their sewer problems. Mr. Dicks has tried to deal with that. We do not apologize for that one iota. 
   We've got some other priorities too. We're going to try to provide additional funding for energy. We have added, in the three bills that have passed this House so far, and including this bill, we will have added more than $1 billion in an effort to increase and strengthen our energy research so that we aren't the prisoners of gas and oil companies and so that we aren't the prisoners of Middle East oil. We make no apologies for that. 
   Admittedly, there are some people in this House who know the cost of everything and the value of nothing. I'm looking at a few of them right now. 
   But the fact is that we recognize that it is important to make long-term investments so that 10 years from now, we can have the kind of country we want it to be, rather than having the kind of country we don't want it to be. 
   I would suggest I will compare our priorities to yours any time. You can defend those $57 billion in tax cuts for millionaires until the cows come home. I would rather defend increased service at our national parks, increased educational opportunity, increased health care, increased clean water and clean air opportunities. I think the public will take those priorities any time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I wonder if somebody could call the Attending Physician's office. I'm getting a bad case of whiplash here just listening to these arguments that run in opposite directions. 
   I just heard the gentleman say a minute ago, and I must say, I'm sympathetic to his problem, but I just heard him say a minute ago that he's frustrated. Well, I'm frustrated too because, what I'd like to point out, as the President of the United States pointed out just a few weeks ago, is that the gentleman's knocking on the wrong door. 
   And with all due respect, when Mr. Lewis was chairman of the Appropriations Committee last year, it wasn't his job to reauthorize this program. And as chairman of the committee this year, it isn't my job to reauthorize this program. You need to go to the authorizing committee. 
   We have gotten dozens of lectures through the last month from Members on your side of the aisle who fuss and fume about individual earmarks that they say are not ``authorized.'' 
   Well, this is a case where we on the committee are saying the following: you came to us last year. You said you couldn't get the authorizing committee off its duff, and so you wanted some help to sustain this program until you could get them to reauthorize it. So even against the strong objection of the President of the United States, and the last time I looked, he was a Republican, even in the light of his objection, we put in over $400 million to create a bridge for you until you could get this problem resolved. 
   Now, I'm sorry that this has not been reauthorized. You need to take that up with another committee. All I can tell you is that we're taking time on this bill, on this amendment because you think somebody else, in some other committee, didn't do their job. 
   Well, you can't have it both ways, and neither can we. So I would simply ask the gentleman to please go to the right committee. And I'd be happy to send them a letter. The fact is you're taking up this committee's time, and we're getting squawks from Members on both sides of the aisle saying, ``Why are you appropriators taking so blessed much time.'' 
   Well, with all due respect, it's not the appropriators trying to take the time. It's people who are not on the Appropriations Committee who are aiming at the wrong committee in their search of solution to a problem.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object, under my reservation I would like to simply bring a few facts of time to the House. 
   If we are not prepared to stay here and work until around 1 o'clock tonight, it is my estimation that if all of these amendments are offered tomorrow, even if a handful of them drop off, I think it will be virtually impossible for the House to finish its business by 6 or 7 o'clock tomorrow evening. 
   We have over 50 amendments. Each of them will take at least 10 minutes, plus the slippage that it takes to yield time and the rest. There are also three amendments which would take 30 minutes apiece, debating the very same issues that we debated for an hour and 20 minutes earlier today. There would then be another amendment that requires 40 minutes of debate time to debate an issue which does not exist. Then we will have the added slippage that comes from yielding time in pieces to various Members of the House. Then finally we have to add to that the amount of time it takes for the votes themselves, the amount of time it takes on the recommittal motion and the amount of time it takes for final passage. 
   I do not intend to object to this request, but I want it understood that if we proceed with a unanimous consent request that is being propounded now, and if we do not stay and consider amendments until around 1 o'clock, then it is a ``let's pretend'' promise to every Member of this House when we are giving them the impression that they will be able to get out of here soon enough in order to catch planes tomorrow. 
   Now, I am not going anywhere. I am going to be here reading Members' earmark requests between now and next Wednesday. So I am not going anywhere. But for 90 percent of the Members, who I think would appreciate it if every Member of this place would sublimate their own egos just a mite for the good of the body, I would urge that both sides of the aisle demand that Members take up their amendments tonight, rather than waiting until tomorrow, at least enough to keep us here until 1 o'clock. 
   Now, it is not convenient to me. It is not convenient to the gentleman from New York. It certainly is not convenient to the ranking minority member from Ohio for us to stay this late. Nobody else has to, except the persons who asked to offer these amendments. 
   But if you ask to offer an amendment, then I think you have an obligation to offer it in a timely fashion and not wait so that everybody can be a TV star in prime time. Because, you know what? I participated in the debate today, and I watched the debate that I didn't participate in. It was, frankly, boring as all get out. With all due respect to everybody here who thinks they are Laurence Olivier or Daniel Webster, I ``ain't'' seen many of either lately. 
   So I would simply suggest, Members need to understand why they aren't going to get their planes tomorrow if we don't stay here until 1 o'clock tonight. 
   Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the intent of this amendment, and in the past I have often considered voting for it. But I have a far different attitude now than I had in the past because of the Iraqi War. 
   The fact is that we have no sustained demonstrations in the streets against Iraq, and, in my view, largely that is not occurring because we have no draft. And we have no draft because the country has settled into a comfortable acceptance of the idea that a precious few people, namely those in the regular Armed Forces of the country and those in the Guard and Reserves, should be the only people in our society who are at risk in this stupid and fruitless war. And I just cannot abide that. 
   I have said many times on this floor that I think it is outrageous that there is no sense of shared sacrifice about this war. We ask our Guard and Reserve personnel to return to Iraq and Afghanistan time and time and time again. And yet of the rest of society we ask nothing except to worry about Paris Hilton and to worry about who wins the Super Bowl, and, oh, yes, if you are a millionaire, we are going to spend $57 billion this year giving you a tax cut. That is really some sense of shared sacrifice. 
   And so I just cannot bring myself to vote for this amendment, though it might make sense on the numbers, because I think it would be a symbolic act which would send to the country yet another signal that the only people we expect to bear any burden for this stupid, outrageous, lied-to-get-into war are those in the military. And I just think that is wrong. I know that is not the gentleman's intent, but I think that is the practical signal that we send. 
   So I cannot vote for this amendment. I did not even want to speak against it, but this war bugs me a lot and the total lack of the willingness of this society to face the inordinate costs which we are laying on military families bugs me a whole lot more.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Well, whoever. I have minimum high regard for it, let me put it that way. 
   Mr. Chairman, I think we need to fully understand what is afoot with respect to contracting. 
   I want to cite some other facts, because there is an inexorable and stealthy effort to put much of the activities of government in the hands of contractors rather than in the hands of public servants. And more and more of that contracting is being provided in a noncompetitive manner. That also applies to many, many grants being provided by the executive branch. 
   For example, the Congressional Research Service documented an unusually large number of sole-source grants issued by the Employment and Training Administration within the Department of Labor, which resulted in 90 percent of discretionary funds for the High Growth Job Training Initiative being awarded on a noncompetitive basis over a 5-year period. It isn't just Halliburton and Blackwater who are getting lots of taxpayers' dollars in a noncompetitive fashion.     
   The administration's use of contracting has increased significantly in the past 5 years. For example, the Department of Health and Social Services' contract obligations have nearly doubled from $5 billion in fiscal year 2001 to $8.7 billion in fiscal year 2006. The number of contract employees at the Department of Health and Social Services exceeds 32,000, about half the number of Civil Service employees. A significant share of those contracts were awarded on a noncompetitive basis. 
   In fiscal year 2006 alone, Health awarded nearly 21,000 contracts worth more than $1.9 billion with less than full and open competition. That is four times the total amount of congressionally directed earmarks that are expected to eventually be included in the Labor, Health, Education appropriation bill. 
   I won't even bother to get into what has been happening at the Education Department where local school districts have virtually been blackmailed into accepting contracts with book publishers preferred by the administration or else they are frozen out of the program entirely. 
   So I would simply say I think the gentleman's amendment is ill-advised, and when the time comes late tomorrow evening, I would hope that we will have a ``no'' vote on the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Let me simply say, Mr. Chairman, I recognize this specific discussion is aimed at Sarbanes-Oxley. But in fact I have been around here for awhile, and I know that this occurs in the context of a much broader and much more insidious pattern. 
   The fact is if you take a look at what Republican controlled Congresses have tried to do since 1995, you will see that they have voted for appropriation after appropriation that cut the SEC budget even below the President's request. What that meant was that while that agency's workload was expanding and exploding, the ability of the SEC staff to keep up with that workload was being undermined by this body. 
   The percentage of all corporate filings reviewed by the agency declined dramatically from 21 percent in 1991 to about 8 percent in 2000. Is it any wonder that the Enrons of this world were convinced that they could get away with anything. After Enron failed and after we had a series of other corporations that failed, and their officers went to jail, people got scared. They decided we better do something or we will be seen as being complicit in the abandonment of government's obligation to see that investors are protected. 
   So what happened is they were scared finally in backing into passing Sarbanes-Oxley. They fought it all the way. And now that it is on the books and the heat is off and the cops ain't watching as much, then what are they doing, they once again want to whittle away at Sarbanes-Oxley. Not with my vote they are not going to. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I want to congratulate the gentleman from Indiana. I was not aware of the fact that he had gotten a medical degree. I don't think he is a doctor, and neither am I, and so I would submit that neither one of us are actually qualified to make final judgments about medical matters. 
   But I am also bothered by something else. You know, I came here to be a Member of the United States Congress. I didn't come here to be a Member of the D.C. City Council. I'm certainly not getting paid for it. I don't know if the gentleman is, but I'm not, and I don't feel like doing double duty as a city councilman at 7 minutes after midnight. I don't even think I would feel like doing that tomorrow. 
   But what I am bothered by is the idea that somehow we think we can come from our own communities, our own States, and then come to this town, because we happen to technically approve the district's budget in a plantation-type style, we, therefore, begin to tell the District of Columbia that we are going to decide what kind of medical advice is relevant. I heard the gentleman say this in debate, I believe it is wrong. 
   Well, the gentleman is perfectly entitled to that opinion, just as I am entitled to my opinion. But the fact is that I don't believe that it makes much sense for either Dr. Souder or Dr. Obey to be telling D.C. how they can use their own money. I think it's the height of arrogance on the part of the Congress. 
   If you want to dictate to communities, would you dare go home and dictate to your own hometown what the city council ought to do? Would you say that because we provide Federal money to your city council, that somehow we should decide what their policy ought to be on medical matters? I don't think so. 
   I am baffled by people, especially by conservatives, who every day will profess to believe in local control, States' rights and the like, but then when it comes to the District of Columbia, they say, well, because we have a special opportunity, we are going to impose our judgment on yours. I don't think this is about the issue of needle exchange or drugs. I detest drugs. My God, look what they have done to Rush Limbaugh. 
   But for God's sake, it seems to me that we ought to have enough restraint to recognize that if we wanted to dictate to the D.C. what their policies ought to be, then we ought to resign from Congress and run for city council for the District of Columbia, or maybe even mayor. 
   But until that time, it seems to me that the District of Columbia government has the right to make their own choices even if they are wrong. 
   Now, Will Rogers said once that when two people agree on everything, one of them is unnecessary. 
   I would submit that I don't have to agree with the gentleman's opinion, and he doesn't have to agree with mine to recognize that we have got a right to state those opinions and follow up on them on Federal matters. But we are interfering in the operation of a local city, and we have no right to do that on education, on drugs or anything else. 
   You learn from your own mistakes, and if the District of Columbia is making the wrong choice, then I suspect in time evidence will show they made the wrong choice. 
   But, until then, we are imposing our own judgment on a life-threatening matter. As one layman to another, that makes no sense whatsoever. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Thank you for yielding. 
   I was in my office and I heard you make the assertion that a ``promise'' had been made to finish all of the appropriations bills by July 4. 
   I am the chairman of the committee. I certainly made no promise. We indicated that it was our plan and our intent. But I would point out we have had several hundred amendments offered by Members of the minority party. We have spent approximately twice as much time debating each of the bills the last 3 weeks than was the case a year ago, despite the agreement between the two leaderships that there would be every effort made to try to handle these bills in a timetable that was consistent with last year's activities. 
   And so I simply want to make quite clear that there was no ``promise.'' And even if there had been, which there was not, the majority cannot be held accountable for the fact that your Members introduced 188 amendments to a single bill. One Member introduces 188 amendments to a single bill which is simply filibustering by amendment.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, let me simply point out, Mr. Speaker, that in addition to the fact that we have effectively endured filibuster by amendment by the minority for the past 3 weeks, in addition to that fact, we have two other practical facts to face. 
   When we took over this Congress, we had to deal with last year's budget because the folks who controlled the Congress last time just didn't happen to get around to passing the appropriations bills last time. So we had to spend the first month of this session doing the work that they left over from the last session. They had passed not a single portion of the domestic part of the budget. They had not passed a single domestic appropriation bill. So first we had to run that cleanup brigade. 
   Then we had to deal with the fact that in order to hide the full cost of the war, the President declined to request funding for the Iraqi war in the regular defense bill which was supposed to be finished last year. So we had to take the next 3 1/2 months to clean up that mess left over from last year. So I would say it is really the pot calling the kettle black to somehow suggest that the majority party has failed in its responsibility because it has not met a so-called mythical promise. 
   We laid out what the plan was, and given the fact that the first 4 months of this session was essentially spent cleaning up their mess, I think we have done pretty well.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, no one can visit the American cemetery at Normandy without gaining a profound appreciation for the courage and the sense of self-sacrifice demonstrated by every one of our soldiers who fought to take that beach and begin the liberation of Europe. 
   For years, families who went to that cemetery to think about their loved ones, think about their loss and, at the same time, think about their pride, had a totally inadequate place in which to sit and think or perhaps retreat from the rest of the people around them for a few precious moments. And I am so pleased that I was able to work with Congressman Murtha, with Congressman Walsh, with Congressman Hobson, in order to provide the funding for the new visitors center which is now at that location. It is a spectacularly beautiful, and yet subtle tribute to each and every American who fought there. 
   For years, that visitors center did not tell an adequate story of the sense of self-sacrifice that was exhibited in those days. Now it finally does, and I think it will serve as an inspiration, not just to every American who visits that site, but also to every person from any part of the world who values freedom and values sacrifice. 
   I know of no monument that is more eloquent in paying tribute to both than that monument, and I think it's fitting that we pass a resolution, again, praising the courage and the dedication of the Americans who fought to make the entire world free.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, let me first address the gentleman's comments about process and time. 
   We have been negotiating with the Senate and with the White House since last Friday. At approximately 12:30 last night, the majority staff on the Appropriations Committee finally wrapped up our work in putting this package together. At about 1:00, we communicated what that package was to the minority staff on the Appropriations Committee. It couldn't have been communicated any earlier because it wasn't done until 12:30. One of the reasons it wasn't done is because as late as 10:00 last night, the White House was still squawking about individual provisions in the bill. And the last time I looked, the White House was in Republican hands. 
   Now, we have negotiated in good faith. I hate this agreement. I am going to vote against the major portion of this agreement even though I negotiated it, because I think that the White House is in a cloud somewhere in terms of understanding the realities in Iraq. But let's not get our nose out of joint about the way this package was put together. 
   We have tried in good faith to find a way to put the administration's request and their opponent's position on the floor on an equal footing to give everybody an opportunity to vote however they wanted on it.

   Mr. OBEY. As I was saying, Mr. Speaker, we don't relish bringing a package to the floor that we don't like and that we are not going to vote for. But what I especially don't relish is the fact that, in the process of doing so, we are criticized by people on the minority side of the aisle who, when they were in charge, couldn't run a two-car funeral in terms of the budget. 
   The gentleman claims that it has taken us too long to get here. The fact is, the gentleman's party was in control last year, and it took them 110 days to produce a supplemental that the administration requested. That is 10 days longer than it took us. And we had to spend the first 30 days of this session passing last year's budget because the gentleman's party couldn't get a single domestic appropriations bill through the House because of an internal Republican Party squabble between Republicans in the Senate and Republicans in the House. So that ate up the first 30 days. And the rest of the time we have spent trying to convince the President to change his mind on the policy in Iraq. 
   And so we haven't exactly been doing nothing these last 110 days. We sent a proposition to the President to try to force change in American policy in Iraq. He vetoed it. So if somebody is going to bellyache about the fact that the money isn't getting to the troops, we passed that. It was the President who vetoed it. It is the President's action that has delayed getting anything to anywhere. 
   We then sent a second package over, and the Senate couldn't pass that. And so that is when we faced the inevitability that we simply did not have the votes to force the President to change policy, and so we are now trying to produce a responsible alternative. 
   Let me also say, with respect to the argument that we are somehow playing into the hands of al Qaeda. Who played into the hands of al Qaeda? A fellow by the name of Bush. He lives in that big White House at the other end of the avenue. He is the guy who walked this country into a war he didn't have a clue about how to end, he didn't have a clue about the political realities in the region, he didn't have a clue about what was necessary militarily to pacify the country. He didn't have a clue about what this was going to do to our influence in the world. If anybody in this country has weakened our influence drastically and tragically in the Middle East third of the world, it is the occupant, the present occupant, of the White House and his Republican allies who continue to support this misguided policy on this misbegotten war. 
   So, I get a little tired of people who produced one mess after another. I get a little tired of people who have been wrong from the start on this war. They went after the wrong country. They didn't go after al Qaeda, they went after Iraq. Iraq didn't have anything to do with 9/11. The gentleman knows that, unless he has a faulty memory. Only Dick Cheney is still trying to invent that connection, and his aim is about as bad as it is when he's got a shotgun in his hand. 
   So with all due respect, Mr. Speaker, we have tried to produce change. We have been blocked in obtaining that change by the President. We are now trying to move ahead, on the only option we have available. And the gentleman's nose is out of joint because the action was completed last night too late to provide good notice. You know what? I didn't know about a third of this stuff in this package until I got it in the morning, because we made a number of changes in response to White House requests as late as 10:00 last night. I don't apologize for that. That is what negotiating is supposed to be. 
   You can't have it both ways. You can't squawk at us for being too late in bringing the bill to the floor, and then squawk at us for not giving you enough notice. 
   So, with all due respect, I will take a look at the record of the minority party last year when they were running the show and couldn't pass anything, and I will compare theirs to our record any day of the week.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, let me simply say, in response to the comments from the gentleman, that given what he prefers to see in this bill on this subject, we are very lucky to have the 1-year fix at all because the White House opposed not only the long-term fix, but the short-term fix as well. 
   I would also point out that it was last year's Congress that allowed the program to expire in the first place and never managed to get around to finding the offsets that would have enabled the committee to provide this package long term. 
   So I recognize the legitimacy of the gentleman's concern, but I want to point out that I think that given the resistance of the White House to anything except money for the Iraqi operation and a tiny portion of our obligation for Katrina, with those two exceptions, the White House resisted every single effort made by us to deal with any problem, whether it was Western schools, whether it was kids getting knocked off health-care rolls, or whether it was the need to provide more veterans' health care. They fought it all.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I am sorry to interfere with the gentlelady's time, but I just wanted to bring something to the attention of the gentleman from California. 
   He mentioned that the time stamp on the proposition he received was 6:31 p.m. last night. That was one of only two packages. That time stamp refers to the time at which the legislative counsel got this copy to the staff. The staff still had to read it, to check it out, to make certain it did what it was supposed to do. And that was on the easiest package, that was on the President's package. And everybody knows what the President's request was and what the Warner amendment is. 
   The time stamp on the other package is 9:30 p.m. last night. What that means is that you have over 200 pages, which we got from legislative counsel, and the staff had to read every page of that to make certain, again, that it did what it was intended to do, and to make sure that, among other things, it reflected the changes that had been demanded by the White House at the same time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are two sets of issues before us, the President's request for almost $100 billion to finance the cost of the war in Iraq for the remainder of this fiscal year, which ends October 1. 
   There is a second set of issues which relate to urgent needs for this year, additional funding for State Children's Health Insurance Program to prevent many thousands of poor children and some of their parents from losing health coverage; gulf coast recovery after Katrina; drought relief for farmers and the 70 percent of the U.S. counties that the President named as disaster areas; and other areas where we believe we must do more than the President wants to do; defense health, such as efforts to provide more help to veterans with traumatic rain injury; veterans' health, to help veterans overcome ridiculous backlogs; homeland security, to strengthen our ports, our borders and our cargo inspection systems; full funding for BRAC, the base realignment requirements; additional funding for military housing needs; and greater resources to wage the effort to root out al Qaeda in Afghanistan. 
   Dealing with these issues is complicated by the fact that this country and this Congress are deeply divided on our involvement in the Iraqi civil war, which has dragged on now for more than 4 years. 
   Several weeks ago, House Democrats tried to use the President's funding request to establish a process to responsibly end our involvement in that Iraqi civil war. To that end, we passed and sent to the President a plan that spent almost $4 billion more than the President wanted on the health and safety of our troops. It established limits on how much sacrifice could be asked of U.S. military units when no one else, except for military families, are appreciably sacrificing anything in this so-called war effort. It also sets standards for judging the success or failure of the administration's policy. 
   Now, why did we do that? Because we agree with virtually every general who has said that this civil war will not be resolved militarily. It will be resolved only politically and diplomatically by Iraqi factions making the compromises necessary to bring that civil war to a conclusion. 
   The President vetoed that proposal. To override the veto, we needed two-thirds of the House and the Senate to concur. We didn't get it for a simple reason, that Democrats did not have two-thirds of the seats in Congress. 
   Next we tried to send another proposition to the President and gave the President a limited amount of money and tried to set another more flexible set of standards for proceeding with this war. That failed in the Senate. 
   At that point, like it or not, we ran out of options for using this fiscal year 2007 supplemental to force a change in administration policy. 
   On Friday we met with the administration and offered to drop all domestic items if the administration would accept meaningful benchmarks and timelines for ending our involvement in that civil war. They flatly refused. That leaves us with the Senate-passed plan, which sets a much weaker set of benchmarks than those passed by the House. 
   It is clear we do not have the 60 votes necessary to end debate in the Senate and force a policy change on the administration by using the fiscal year 2007 supplemental. Because there are only months left in the fiscal year, no serious person can expect that it is possible to redeploy our troops during that time. 
   So the question becomes, how do we continue to press for an end to our involvement in that war on a reasonable time frame? The proposition now before us shifts the debate to the President's budget request for the next fiscal year, which begins on October 1. 
   Weak as it is, the Senate-adopted Warner amendment, with its 18 new benchmarks, at least does end the totally blank check that previous Congresses have provided. Weak as it is, it does at least give Members of Congress whose feet are not firmly planted in the status quo another opportunity to review the futile administration policy by establishing a requirement for two reports to the Congress, one in July and one in September. 
   The proposal before us will mean that, in September, using the required reports, the Congress will have an opportunity to decide what course of action to take on this war. That decision will be just 4 months away. 
   Meanwhile, we also insist that the President accept the fact that there are other pressing needs, to which we have an obligation to respond.  
   This proposal contains a long overdue increase in the minimum wage for America's lowest-paid workers, a wage which may not bother many people in this Chamber but a wage which unconscionably has been frozen for a decade. It will contain $17 billion that the President did not want for added defense and veterans' health care, for BRAC, for military housing, for Homeland Security, for Katrina, drought relief and State Children's Health Insurance Program. Some items it should contain, it does not. 
   For example, low-income heating, home energy assistance and funding for the pandemic flu.     
   This proposition falls far short of containing everything that it should on both the Iraqi war and on our own domestic needs. But I take some comfort in the knowledge that even Babe Ruth struck out more than 1,300 times. But weak as it is, this proposition does provide a structure and a process to continue the fight, and it recognizes reality. 
   I intend to vote against the first proposition that contains the President's military request and the Warner benchmarks because I believe they are far too weak, and I believe it is important to maximize the pressure on Iraqi politicians to compromise by having as many votes as possible for a stronger proposition. I expect to vote for the second proposition, which contains the minimum wage increase, and $17 billion of the $21 billion that we sought to respond to crucial national needs. 
   This proposition will transfer the Iraqi fight to September on the President's fiscal 2008 defense supplemental request, and it will require a vote on a proposition that would require the funds appropriated to be used to redeploy troops on a responsible time schedule. I am sure we will also address the issue on Mr. Murtha's defense appropriation bill, on the regular bill that will come at us as we return from the Memorial Day recess. 
   This proposition is apparently the best that we can achieve given the votes that we have. It is my hope that, when these votes occur in September, a firm majority in both Houses will see through the smokescreens being produced by the administration and send an unequivocal message to both the administration and Iraqi political leaders that our patience is over. 
   Now, some news stories have said that Democrats have ``given up on the time line.'' That is patent nonsense. There has never been a chance of a snowball in Hades that Congress would cut off funding for troops in the field. 
   Now, some people say to us, why don't you do what you did in Vietnam and simply cut off the funds even while the troops are in the field? Well, I've got news for you, that is not what the Congress did in Vietnam. I know; I was here. When Congress passed the Addabbo amendment, there were less than 500 American troops left in Vietnam. What the Addabbo amendment did was to cut off American aid to the South Vietnamese Government. 
   Even if the Congress were to cut off aid to troops in the field, the President undoubtedly would not abide by that. He would simply assert his Commander in Chief authority to manage the troops any way he wanted, and we would be tied up challenging that in the court for months, long past the time period covered by the fiscal year 2007 supplemental which this legislation addresses. 
   The last proposal we sent to the Senate attempted to limit the amount of money available to the President to 2 months' operating expenses, fencing the rest to try to force a policy change. 
   All we are doing by this arrangement is to slip the timetable an additional 2 months from that proposal, shifting the debate from the 2007 supplemental to the 2008 supplemental. That means our Republican friends who continue to support the President on this misbegotten war will have to face votes in July and in September on the same issue. 
   We are not giving up. We are simply recognizing that no one believes that it is possible, given the Senate's inability to produce 60 votes to shut down debate, to change course during the remainder of this fiscal year. That may not be a pleasant fact, but it is a reality. Opponents of the war need to face this fact just as the President and his allies need to face the fact that they are following a dead-end policy which we will continue to make every possible effort to change.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   Let me simply note that it was the administration that refused to provide support for including funds for the pandemic flu challenge facing the country. We have tried on this side of the aisle for more than a month to include that funding. 
   I've even noted that it was the administration itself who originally asked for that money, as an emergency, 2 years ago. And yet they declined to support it and, in fact, insisted that it come out in this negotiation, just as they insisted that funding for low-income heating assistance come out. 
   So I certainly agree with the gentleman's suggestion that that money ought to be in here. I said that in my own remarks. I also want it very clear why it isn't.

   Mr. OBEY. Well, let me make two points. First of all, this is not all that unusual. It was not done during the time that the Republicans ran the House, but it was done often prior to that. All we have to do is to take a look at the history of the Hyde amendment and take a look at several other conference reports that were adopted, one in 1996, for instance. 
   With respect to the two questions, or the question about the two amendments, technically, it's my understanding that they do not apply to amendments, or that the rules do not apply to amendments.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 1/2 minutes. 
   The previous speaker just complained about the fact that this has taken 110 days to finish. If I am not mistaken, he was the majority party whip when his party controlled this Chamber last year, and it took 110 days before the Republican-controlled Congress could get a supplemental to the President. So I think it comes with considerable ill grace for the gentleman to be calling the kettle black. 
   Let me also suggest that if there has been any delay whatsoever associated with this process, it is due to two things: Number one, it is a little thing called democracy. You know what? We don't have a rubber-stamp Congress anymore. If we did have a rubber-stamp Congress, we could have finished this in 1 day. But that is not what our obligation is. 
   And, secondly, and even more fundamentally, any delay in the process was not caused by the Congress. We had this job done 3 weeks ago. The delay was caused by fact that the President blocked the funds going to the troops when he vetoed the bill. So I would suggest that the gentleman recognize where the true responsibility lies. 
   We have a right and an obligation to spell out what we think is in the national interest of this country. Pardon me if it takes a few days.

   I intend to yield the remainder of my time to close debate to the Speaker. 
   Before I do that, and before the gentleman closes with his last speaker, let me simply thank the committee staff.  Let me thank the CBO staff, the legislative counsel staff, even the White House staff, who worked with us to fashion together this package. 
   Regardless of how Members feel about it, it took a tremendous amount of work by people whose names never get in the papers, whose pictures never get in the papers, but who do their darnedest to see to it that the will of this House is carried out with as much clarity as possible. I appreciate their work. I appreciate their dedication to this institution and this country.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I think everybody ought to speak English in this country, and I think we ought to have  policies that encourage it. What I don't believe is I don't believe that the Congress of the United States has any business whatsoever predeciding a court case, and when the Congress ahead of time tells the EEOC that they cannot even bring a suit, that means that Congress is substituting political judgment for legal judgment on an issue that ought to be decided in a court of law. 
   Congress has the right to pass legislation saying whatever it wants about immigration and about who is going to get Federal aid, things like that. But it is dead wrong, it is wrong morally, it is wrong constitutionally, for the Congress to prejudge what the outcome of a court case is going to be. And if they deny funds to the Equal Employment Opportunity Agency in this government, the agency that is supposed to enforce civil rights laws, if they deny funds to that agency on a hit-or-miss basis based on what can get a majority on this House floor, God help us all. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. You know, Mr. Chairman, we've had a game going on in this Capitol for the last 6 years. It's called ``Shift the Shaft,'' and nowhere is it more clear than in what has happened with law enforcement funding. 
   As I said yesterday, we've had a Kabuki dance going on in this Congress for years. What happens is each year the President comes up with a budget. He's looking for things he can squeeze out of the budget to make room for tax cuts for millionaires. And so what does he do? He cuts the guts out of our assistance to local law enforcement, and then we wonder why the crime rate has gone up the last 2 years. He cuts the guts out of law enforcement, and then each year the previously Republican-controlled Congress comes in, they restore about one-third of those cuts, they say, oh, what good boys are we. Look at what we've done to help law enforcement. And at the end of that time, we're $1.5 billion below where we were in 2001 in terms of our assistance to local law enforcement. Now, maybe that makes sense to some folks; it doesn't make sense to me, not with the explosion of meth problems all over the country, not with the explosion of drug problems. 
   The prior Speaker of the House had a big thing about going after drug production in Colombia. We're spending hundreds and millions of dollars in Colombia, but we're not spending nearly enough money here at home to reduce the demand for those same drugs that are being produced in Colombia, and this amendment would cut that further. 
   The same crowd talking is the crowd that didn't mind providing $600 billion in borrowed money in order to finance that misbegotten war in Iraq. It's the same crowd that is willing to provide $57 billion in tax cuts to millionaires this year, paid for with borrowed money. But then they divert the public's attention from the cause of those on-the-cuff expenditures by saying, oh, we're going to focus a 1 or a 2 percent cut on law enforcement, a 1 or 2 percent cut on the National Science Foundation so we can get people to think that that's the problem that's causing the deficit and not our profligacy for the last 2 years. 
   Now our friends on the Republican side of the aisle say, oh, we've got this terrible tax cut coming in the farm bill. Baloney. What we're trying to do in the farm bill is to increase support for domestic nutrition programs so that, in addition to having 44 million people in this country who are walking around without health insurance, we don't also have a lot more kids walking around who are hungry. And we're talking about paying for that not by raising taxes on middle-class Americans, but by closing the loopholes on offshore foreign corporations. 
   Now, I'm not at all surprised that the Republican leadership cannot tell the difference between closing tax loopholes on special interests and raising taxes on the middle class. The difference is that on this side of the aisle we can, and that's why we're voting against your amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, the last comments I think demonstrate that this debate is in danger of descending into something that resembles a high school debate, and we appear to be edging toward having a dictionary debate, arguing about whether something is a ``cut'' or an ``increase''. 
   With all due respect, in an adult world, that's not the issue. In an adult world, the question is what is the size of the problem you're trying to attack, and is our response to it sufficient? 
   And with all due respect to those on the other side of the aisle who are objecting to this bipartisan product, with all due respect, we think we have a serious problem that requires a serious response. 
   In the area of law enforcement, we have seen our support for law enforcement grants drop by $1.6 billion since fiscal 2001. That is almost a 36 percent drop. That isn't a dictionary problem. That's a problem on the street for every community in America. 
   We also see at the same time we have a rise in the crime rate, which requires a response, regardless of our dictionary definition, and we also have an explosion of meth use. Have you ever seen how screwed up a kid can be after meth has gotten done with him? It's a god-awful sight, and I've seen plenty of it. 
   So what we're trying to do is to have an adequate response, and the reason that we are having a significant increase in law enforcement funding this year is because we're trying to dig out from that hole that we've been put in since 2001 by these systematic reductions in law enforcement assistance, at the same time that the crime rate is rising. 
   And then the second thing we are trying to do is to recognize that we're going to have a lot more people in this society in the next 10 years. We're going to have a lot more low-paid workers all around the world from China to you name it competing with American workers for jobs, and we've got two ways to combat that. One is education, and the other is technology. And the only way we're going to stay on the cutting edge of technology is if we make much larger investments in the National Science Foundation. 
   Politicians in both parties fall over themselves talking about what they're going to do for the National Institutes of Health, but I don't hear many discussions about what we're going to do  to provide support for the even more basic science research that is then used by everyone else in this society to determine what kind of a future we have. 
   Without that investment in science, our economy lags. If our economy lags, our jobs lag. If our jobs lag, our wages lag, and that means that we wind up with a huge family income deficit. We wind up with a huge education opportunity deficit. We wind up with a huge scientific knowledge deficit, and that cripples our country's future. 
   And that's why we're not going to engage in this silly little debate about whether something is an ``increase'' or a ``cut''. The question is, does it have a good impact or a bad impact on America? And this amendment is being sponsored by people who know the cost of everything and the value of nothing. That's the difference between us.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, as we begin this debate today, I think I ought to take just a moment to explain to the Members of the House where we stand. We have, I believe, 19 amendments still pending to this bill. Four of those amendments will take at least one-half hour and perhaps significantly longer. When you add the slippage time to those debate minutes, if every Member exercises his or her right to offer the amendments that are filed, we could be here for another 8 hours on this bill. 
   I know Members are trying to catch their planes. I will try to keep my remarks as brief as possible; I would appreciate it if everyone else would do the same. And if there are those Members who could be persuaded to forgo offering an amendment or two, that would be helpful also in terms of any Members who are trying to catch planes. I think that by now we are well aware of what people's philosophical ideas are about this bill, and I would appreciate it if Members could extend enough courtesy to their colleagues so that our colleagues, especially those on the west coast, will be able to make their planes without staying in town overnight.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, I wonder how any of us would like to have our future decided by people we have never met or never even seen on the basis of those people having a 10-minute conversation without our being present. I don't think any of us would like that very much, and yet that is what the gentleman is asking us to do. 
   The gentleman, in effect, is asking us to pass sentence on 150,000 students who applied for student financial assistance last year using the Spanish version of the application form. Those students would automatically be denied financial aid, with no demonstrable proof that they were illegal aliens, only because they felt more comfortable applying in Spanish. 
   Now, I want every American--I want every person who comes to this country to learn English. I hope our values are the cement that holds this country together, but I think that English is a great tool to strengthen that cement. But I really would simply suggest that, first of all, this is the wrong venue. 
   The Appropriations Committee has held no hearings on this matter. So far as I know, the gentleman has held no hearings on this matter. He may have very strong opinions; I do, too. But both of our opinions may be irrelevant when we discover what the facts are. The fact is, if something like this is going to happen, if we are going to make decisions that affect people's career possibilities just for the heck of it, it would be nice if we had thought about it rather than jumped onto the nearest slogan masquerading as an amendment. 
   So I would strongly urge that this House show a sense of fairness and a sense of restraint and decline to support the gentleman's amendment, at least until we have had hearings in the proper committee. That is the way we would do things if we are concerned with due process, if we are concerned with maximizing fairness rather than scoring political points. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I just want to get a few things off my chest with regard to this earmarking issue. 
   I know that policy questions are complicated, and I know that budget questions are complicated. I recognize, therefore, that substantial members of the press and some Members of the Congress as well in both bodies seek to find other more simple issues which are small enough to get their mind around. And so we have spent a good amount of time the last 3 weeks talking about earmarks. I want to put some things in perspective about earmarks. 
   In the Financial Services bill, out of all of the money provided in that bill, 1.5 percent was devoted to earmarks. 
   In Interior, 0.43 percent of all the money appropriated was provided for earmarks. 
   In Transportation, 1.4 percent of the entire bill was allocated through earmarks. 
   And in this bill, it is slightly less than 0.20. That is a very tiny portion of the overall bill. 
   The executive branch allocates or directs spending at least 10 times as great as does the Congress and I don't see or hear much squawking about that. 
   I just want to suggest this: I don't happen to be comfortable with the earmarking system because it is a pain in the neck to me, it takes an incredible amount of time, and I would much rather spend that time on policy. But the fact is that it is a constitutional prerogative of the Congress to do so. And I would submit it creates a much more fair system. An example, when Speaker Hastert ran this place last year, here he is the Speaker of the House, and yet if the Congress earmarked no money, all the dollars would go back to Illinois and they would be directed by a Democratic Governor. So Speaker Hastert would be part of the body that raised the money at the Federal level and sent the money back to States and local governments; and yet without the earmarking process, the most powerful and influential man in Congress would have nothing to say about how that money was allocated in his own State. I submit that is not right. 
   Or take myself. I chair the Appropriations Committee. I think I spend more time and, frankly, I think I know at least as much about the Federal budget as anybody in this institution, not because I am so plugged in but because of my job and the fact that I have been here a long time, and even an idiot ought to be able to pick up a fair amount of information as long as I have been here. 
   So I would simply ask the question why should I serve in this body, try to help my district, and then discover that for 16 straight years we had a Republican Governor, I had absolutely nothing to say about funds that were distributed in my State without the earmarking process. 
   The earmarking process, if it is used correctly, allows individual Members to target things in their own district that they think will contribute the most to improving the living conditions or the educational conditions or the cultural conditions in that district. I don't think there is anything wrong with that. 
   But I find it incredibly amazing and amusing that we are talking about 0.19 percent of all of the funds in this bill. How much time have we spent talking about basic education philosophy? How much time have we spent talking about which of these education programs really work? How much time have we spent in this debate talking about the programs? The answer is zip because some people prefer to deal with small things.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I just would like to make a couple of short observations. We are told by this gentleman, and we have been told, and we have been told, and we have been told and we have been told for 3 days that somehow it is this bill which is responsible for the outrageous fiscal mess facing the country. I just want to say one thing: Yes, this bill spends $10 billion more on our kids, on our workers, on our obligation to provide access to health care to people who don't have it, than the President does. I plead fully double guilty. I would do twice as much if I could. I would do three times as much if I could because the country needs it. 
   This is the bill that makes the investments that will make our country stronger economically, educationally and socially not just today but for the next 10 years. That's what this bill is about. 
   We have got a 2 percent difference between us and the President in terms of what we are trying to spend in this bill versus what he thinks we ought to spend. I have just told you where we have put it in the right places. Where does the President want to put money? The President wants to spend five times as much as the difference that we have with him on this bill, he wants to spend five times as much giving tax cuts to people who make more than a million bucks a year. He is going to give 57 billion bucks to people in this country who make over a million bucks a year. We think that money, a portion of it, is better spent on kids who need it and on sick people who need it. And we make no apology for it. 
   The other thing I would simply say is that the other place that the President wants to spend it, he wants to spend 60 times as much as that $10 billion on that stupid war in Iraq, the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of the Republic. 
   So we plead fully guilty to having a meaningful 2 percent difference between the President and us. We plead fully guilty, and I wish it were more.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, some simple facts. The President's budget would have us spend as a share of our total national income 48 percent less on education, health care, science, job training, et cetera, than this country spent in 1980, and by 2012 he would have us spend 57 percent less than we spent in 1980. 
   That creates a problem because we're going to have 27 million more Americans in the next 10 years. We're going to have 12 million more seniors needing health care. We're going to have 2.7 million more kids in elementary and secondary school. We're going to have 2.2 million more students in college. And, unless we change our ways, we're going to have 11 million more Americans without health insurance. 
   That's why we don't want to go back to last year. We want to move ahead to try to deal with the problems coming at us. We see them; they're there. We ought not to stick our head in the ground like an ostrich. We ought to deal with them, and that's what this bill does.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I would rather not talk about what one party did one year and what one party did another year, because I think there is substantial support in both parties for the bill that we have before us today. I want to walk through what the impact of this cut would be on this bill. 
   If we pass this amendment, we will be cutting $1.2 billion from No Child Left Behind, the President's signature education set of programs. We will be cutting $684 million from Title I grants. We will be cutting $519 million from IDEA. That's a program which both parties have fought for the last 3 days to try to increase. 
   We would be cutting $717 million from Pell Grants, reducing scholarship awards for millions of students, despite the fact that the cost of higher education has gone up by 40 percent the last 5 years. We would be cutting $1.4 billion from the National Institutes of Health, money that we use to combat cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's and the like. We would be cutting $100 million from community health centers, denying needed health care and dental services to almost half a million people. 
   We would be cutting $53 million out of the President's request to prepare the country for a potential pandemic flu. We would be cutting $320 million from Head Start, $98 million from Child Care Development Block Grant. We would be cutting $446 million from the Social Security Administration, denying the resources that agency needs to maintain and keep open its local offices and reduce backlogs of disability and SSI claims. 
   So people have a choice. What's more important, their own accounting sheets or these investments in the country? 
   The fact is, with the exception of the gang of four, virtually every Republican who has offered an amendment  has done the same thing that Democrats have tried to do. They have tried to find ways to increase programs that they think are important to the country's future. 
   I would submit I don't think those Republicans are out of step, and I don't think those Democrats are out of step. I think the folks who are out of step are the gang of four offering the amendments.     
   I believe that most Americans, and I think most Republicans, would rather invest the funds now to prepare our workforce to be better trained, our kids to be better educated, and our health care system to be more efficient and more and more humane. That is what this bill is all about, and I think that there is a bipartisan consensus in this House to stick with this bill. So I would urge respectfully rejection of the amendment, as I make one other point. 
   We have the $1.4 billion initiative of add-ons to try to discourage women from having abortions. Instead of lectures, we provide resources to make their lives better if they decide to have those kids. This bill would cut about 40 percent of that initiative out of the bill. I happen to think that initiative is too important to sandbag, and this amendment sandbags that effort. So I would urge rejection of the amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, I would like to again simply walk us through what this cut means in specific terms. This amendment would cut $257 million from the President's No Child Left Behind education flagship program. It would cut $144 million from title I, denying more than 40,000 students those title I services. It would cut $113 million from Special Education. It would wipe out every single amendment but one that was passed on this floor in the last 2 days to enhance Special Education, most of those amendments coming from the Republican side of the aisle. 
   It would cut $156 million from Pell Grants. It would cut $300 million from the National Institutes of Health for medical research in cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and the like. It would cut $22 million from community health centers. Over 100,000 of the uninsured would not have access to those services. It would cut $70 million from Head Start, $21 million from the Child Care Development Block Grant. It would cut $27 million from LIHEAP. 
   I want to remind you, in LIHEAP, the bill itself only restores half of the cut that was made last year by the President and the Congress. 
   It would cut $97 million from the Social Security Administration. Members are climbing all over me saying, ``What are we going to do to keep my local Social Security offices open? What are we going to do to eliminate the multi-month backlog in people applying for Social Security disability?'' I will tell you what they are going to do. This will add to it. It will add to the problem. 
   So with all due respect to the sanctimony that we hear from those who belatedly cry about the Federal deficit, I didn't hear them crying about the Federal deficit when they voted to spend $600 billion on an ill-advised war in Iraq. I don't hear them crying about the fact that $57 billion in tax cuts for millionaires adds $57 billion to the Federal deficit. 
   So I just think we need to recognize that I believe the vast majority of Americans and I believe substantial portions of both parties in this House believe that this bill is responsible in real dollar terms. All of the domestic appropriation bills that we will produce and have produced this year amount to a 1 percent increase in real terms. 
   One of the gentlemen over there claimed that these were not cuts. Well, let me tell you something. If you appropriate the same amount of money this year that you appropriated last year but inflation eats away at that and so does population growth, if you don't adjust for inflation and population growth, then to each recipient of the services under this legislation there is indeed a cut to them. And that is what counts. It is the impact on their pocketbook. It is the impact on their ability to get help to send their kids to school. 
   It is an impact on the couple in my District who called 31 dentists to try to get some help with their kid who had to have the braces taken off his teeth. They couldn't get any of them to take them because the dentists wouldn't take Medicaid patients. They didn't have a local clinic. So the mother held the kid down while the father took the braces off with a pair of pliers. 
   That wouldn't happen to any child of a Member of Congress. The gentleman is smiling about that. I don't think that is anything to smile about. I met that woman.

   Mr. OBEY. I understand. 
   But let me simply say, Madam Chairman, these cuts, these will be cuts in terms of the services that we are trying to provide to these people. It is immoral. It is unconscionable that we allow 44 million Americans to go without health insurance. 
   This bill will deliver health care coverage to 2 million more Americans than got it last year. It will make up in a tiny way for the indifference, the massive indifference, which has characterized this country the past few years on the issue of health coverage. 
   I would urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment and support for the underlying bill.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, I will make the same observation as I made last night. What we have going on here, in my judgment, is Operation Diversion. You have a bunch of people in this House who are perfectly comfortable with the fact that the tax policies that they have voted for will deliver $57 billion in tax cuts this year to people who make over a million dollars a year. That is five times as much money as the increase that we have in this bill above the President's request. 
   And you have people who have voted for the war in Iraq, which has spent $600 billion in a case of mistaken identity as they mistook the stocky guy with the mustache, Saddam Hussein, for the tall guy with the beard, Osama bin Laden, and that mistake has cost us $600 billion when you take into account the President's newest request. That is 60 times as much as the addition we have above the President's budget for these programs. 
   They voted for all of that, and now they want to scramble away from the deficits and the debt that that has produced. And they try to divert the attention of the public and say, oh, the real cause of our fiscal mess is the fact that these crazy Democrats are trying to put more money into education and more money into health care and more money into job training. 
   Well, I plead fully guilty. We are trying to do that because yes, we do believe that these are investments. We think that kids are better off if you put more money into education than if you take it away. And we think society is better off economically and morally if we do more to help people who need health care than less. 
   Now this amendment would cut the following amounts from the bill: It would cut $128 million from this bill for No Child Left Behind. 
   It would cut $74 million from Title I. 
   It would cut $56 million from IDEA. Republicans and Democrats alike have spent the last 2 days trying to increase funds for IDEA; now they want to cut it back by $56 million. 
   They want to cut from this bill $78 million for Pell Grants, despite the fact that college costs have exploded. 
   They want to cut $148 million from this bill for the National Institutes of Health. 
   They want to cut $48 million from this bill for the Social Security Administration. 
   They want to cut $69 million from this bill out of programs that we have here to try to discourage women from having abortions. Now if they want to vote for that, be my guest. We don't happen to think, and I think there are significant numbers of our friends on the minority side of the aisle who don't happen to think that is a good idea. 
   We do have to make choices, and the basic choices here are do we want to defend the 2 percent increase in these programs above the President's level, because that is what it is, it is a 2 percent difference. And if you don't believe my definition, then take a look at CQ and National Journal because that is the way they define it. 
   Do you want to put 2 percent more into the health and education of the country, into the training of our workforce, or do you instead want to use it for additional money in Iraq and additional money for tax cuts for the most wealthy people in this country, most of whom would gladly see a reduction in their take if we could improve the quality of our workforce and the quality of our education and the quality of our law enforcement? 
   I plead fully guilty to agreeing with them, and I would ask for a ``no'' vote on the amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, it is sometimes amazing to me just how small some congressional debates can be. We have heard a lot of bloviating on this floor today about whether something is a cut and whether it isn't a cut. We have had a boy scout debate about dictionary terms. 
   But the real question to ask about this bill is simply to ask, is it adequate to the needs of the country? Do we really need to simply continue the status quo by going back to last year's level, or do we need to recognize that there is more than one deficit in the country? Do we really think that we can afford to continue to avoid dealing with the deficit in educational quality, the deficit in health care access, the deficit in worker training? 
   Do we really think that we can avoid, or that we can afford to avoid investing to increase the number of quality teachers in this country? Do we think that we need to do more or not to help millions of kids who need a better deal in special education? Do we need to do more than we are doing now to help workers who lose their life's work because of the forces of globalization? 
   Are we comfortable continuing to see the number of research grants for cancer, for heart disease, for Parkinson's disease, continue to decline, or do we think that we ought to make an investment, a collective societal investment, so that we can do more to attack those diseases? 
   Those are values questions. That is what we have to decide here today. This amendment is largely symbolic. It gives people a chance on both sides to talk to some more, as though we haven't, God help us, talked enough already. 
   But we are now roughly at the point where we will have to decide what our priorities are.     
   This bill is about 2 percent above the President's budget for these items. That is what we are talking about; we are talking about devoting 2 percent more of the Federal budget than the President wants to devote to deal with the deficits in education, health care, job training, worker protection, and the like. 
   Each Member is invited, in my view, to make their own choice, but I think the choice is clear. We have had a huge increase in the gap between the richest people in this country and everybody else over the past 20 years. This bill attempts to deal with the results of that gap by providing additional grace notes to help the people who haven't been in that top 1 percent so they get a little better deal in sending their kids to college, so that they get a little better deal in being able to find doctors who will take care of them without begging in the community health clinic, so they can find some job training so they maybe can get a job that pays two-thirds of what their job paid before they were bounced because of bad trade deals or globalization. That is what this bill attempts to do. 
   It has traditionally had bipartisan support through the years in this country. It would be a shame if that bipartisan support didn't continue. I urge rejection of the amendment and support for the underlying bill. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, I really wish that the gentleman had not offered this amendment, and let me be very frank. I spent most of the last 6 months trying to convince Democrats, primarily liberals, who are now in control of the House, not to try to use their new majority to change any language in this bill that had anything to do with abortion or family planning. I have asked them, in an effort to provide bipartisan support for this bill, to recognize other people's values as well as their own. I have asked them, therefore, to leave alone the six abortion-related or family planning provisions which are in the existing law which many on this side of the aisle oppose and some on the other side of the aisle oppose. 
   I have asked them to leave alone the Hyde amendment; I have asked them to leave alone Dr. Weldon's amendment. And I had some real fights on this side of the aisle about that, not just with people in my caucus, but with a lot of outside groups. A lot of like-minded people on the left will get together and talk and, after they talk to each other, they think they have taken a public opinion poll. And I have asked them to lay off this bill so that we can try to find common ground on an issue that has divided us for so long. 
   And we put together an initiative which provided well over half a billion dollars in special funding for programs to help discourage women from having abortions, and we have been able to keep that issue out of here. I have asked Members not to offer amendments on any of these items. 
   But now, in return for that, we get from the other side of the aisle from one gentleman an amendment that in essence upsets the apple cart. I think that is unfortunate. I can't do a whole lot about it, but I think the gentleman knows that an amendment like this would not survive conference anyway, and yet it is being offered. And what it does, at the last minute, is to blow up a consensus which we have tried to build over the last 3 days that we all ought to be willing to live under the same laws that we were living under when the Republicans were controlling this House and when they passed the legislation that I am now defending. So I would simply ask the gentleman, in the interest of our being able to work together on these issues, to withdraw his amendment. 
   He doesn't like Planned Parenthood. I don't care whether Planned Parenthood gets money or not. What I do care about is that the women who are served by Planned Parenthood get the services to which they are entitled under the Constitution. And so I would ask the gentleman, in the interest of the bipartisan neutrality that we have tried to build over the past 2 months, to consider withdrawing the amendment, and I thank the gentleman for the time.

   Mr. OBEY. Madam Chairman, the issue here is not Planned Parenthood. The issue is whether women have a right to have full access to family planning. State health departments run 57 percent of the clinics that receive Title X funds. Planned Parenthood affiliates operate 14 percent of Title X supported clinics. Hospitals and family planning clinics and other non-privates make up the rest of the Title X clinic system. 
   Under the law, none of these funds can be spent for abortion. But Planned Parenthood clinics use their Title X funding to provide family planning and health services to millions of women, and it is those women who would be hurt today by this action, not Planned Parenthood. 
   I would urge a vote against the amendment. It seems to me that we ought to be content to live under the same arrangements that we were content to live under when the Republican Congresses were writing the law. 
   It seems to me that we need to be finding ways to avoid dividing the Congress and dividing the country because of our ideologies. 
   This amendment has nothing to do with abortion. It has everything to do with whether or not we are trying to find common ground on this cluster of issues, and whether or not women are going to be allowed to get the services they need in areas where the only services available to them come from the organization in question. 
   With that, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio.

   Mr. OBEY. In that case we'll accept the amendment on this side of the  aisle. In accepting this amendment, I would make the following two points:  
   One, I believe it is merely a re-statement of current law which already prohibits the employment of unauthorized aliens. I do not read it as imposing any new burdens on those who use funds appropriated under this Act. Rather it is fully consistent with the current legal obligations imposed on all employers, regardless of whether or not they use such funds. 
   Two, I am concerned that the amendment may place an undue enforcement burden on the agencies that receive funding under this bill. I plan to discuss that aspect with the administration.

   Mr. OBEY. Then, what I would simply like to say, Madam Chairman, is that this bill is the product of 5 months work on both sides of the aisle by some very dedicated people. Mr. Walsh is the new ranking member on the subcommittee, but he has performed like an old timer. I am proud of the fact that the subcommittee worked hard on hearings. And, I'm proud of the fact that we've largely come together on substance. 
   I would hope that that would be recognized by the endorsement of many Members on both sides of the aisle when the roll call vote is opened. This bill is not a matter of accounting.     
   This bill is not a matter of political theory or political party platforms. 
   This bill, more than any other, meets the needs of all of those in society who are not among the most well-connected and the most privileged. But even for the most well-connected and privileged, this bill provides a lot because all of us benefit every time a child is educated. All of us benefit every time an American citizen gets the health care he or she needs. All of us benefit every time a worker is educated so that our workforce becomes more competitive. All of us benefit when a single teacher achieves new skills. There is nothing in the world more damaging than a dull or a bad teacher, and there is nothing more wonderful than a well-trained, intelligent one. 
   So I would urge Members to recognize that the issue isn't whether some program is defined as a cut or an increase. The issue isn't whether we like the President of the United States or not. The issue is whether or not we are building the kind of country we want to have over the next 10 years. To do that, it takes investments. And, yes, investments cost money. And, yes, I plead fully guilty to wanting to provide even more than we can in this bill. But it is essential if we want to remain competitive. It is essential if we want to have equal access to opportunity in this country. It is essential that we invest in bills like this. 
   And I thank the gentleman from New York for his assistance in trying to do just that, as well as every other member of the committee and subcommittee. 
   There is a reason why there were no votes expressed in opposition to this bill in full committee, and that is because this is the people's bill. It is the product of input from each and every Member from the most conservative to the most liberal, and I think there is not a member of the subcommittee who would not verify that. 
   With that, Madam Chairman, I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, if this issue were in fact the real problem, it can easily be dealt with in conference by Mr. Walsh and myself and the rest of the committee, but in fact it is not a problem. The fact is that under the bill money in the Safe and Drug Free Schools account can already be used for exactly the same purpose. 
   I would also like to point out, however, that this is a program which was cut by the President to $100 million, and the House has restored $146 million above the President's figure to take care of problems just such as this. 
   But the membership should also understand that this recommit kills the bill. It is dressed up in language on fees, but in fact it calls for the bill to be referred to the committee and reported back promptly, not forthwith. And, as Members know, that is a device that kills the bill. 
   We have endured over the last 3 days filibusters by amendment. We have had 25 hours of amendments, sometimes repetitious amendments. We have spent twice as much time on this bill as was spent the last time that the bill was considered by the Congress. 
   And I would make one other point. The sponsors of this proposal could have used it to do anything they wanted to do with the bill. They could have cut the bill, they could have changed the priorities. They didn't. And the fact that they didn't, in my view, is an admission that, in terms of policy, this is a good bill. It is a backhanded admission that this bill ought to pass as is. 
   So I would ask Members to vote ``no'' on the motion and vote ``yes'' on passage. They can then go home having done good things for America's children, for Americans who need help to get health care, and for American workers. 
   Let me also take just a second to thank the House for its indulgence over the last 3 days. I know that it has often been tiresome, but I appreciate the fact that they understood that the committee was just trying to do its job. 
   I yield to the distinguished majority leader.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, let me simply say in response to the previous speaker on that side of the aisle, he claims that efforts on our part to withdraw our troops or redeploy our troops out of a combat situation represents a slow-bleed policy. I would suggest that the existing policy is a bleed-forever policy, and it needs to be changed. 
   The second question the gentleman asked referred to agriculture. He said, ``Gee, these agriculture disasters occurred last year; why weren't they handled then?'' That is a very good question. We weren't in charge last year. The other side was. 
   In fact, we have had agriculture disaster legislation pending for 2 years. The President declared 70 percent of the counties in this country to be disaster areas, and yet the last Congress couldn't put together a two-car funeral when it came to addressing that problem. So we are simply cleaning up in a separate bill; mind you, we are cleaning up last year's agriculture disaster problem. It is just another one of the leftover items from the previous Congress that we are now charged with the responsibility to finish. 
   Now let me get to what the real issue is in this bill. 
   The Washington Post carries a story this morning describing the efforts of the administration to use Iraqi government officials to try to get the Democratic lawmakers to ease the pressure on the White House to have a timetable for the withdrawal of troops. Mr. al-Rubaie is quoted as saying the following: ``Now, nobody is talking about sliding into a civil war, as we've been able to avoid it.'' 
   He added, ``Portraying the scene there as Shiite killing Sunni and Sunnis killing Shiites is totally untrue.'' 
   What are they smoking? What do we see on television every day, despite the effort of the administration to shut down as much access on the part of the public to the carnage as is possible? 
   I strongly support this rule today for one simple reason: The President has asked the Congress to give him $100 billion in additional funding to fight this war, no strings attached. The Congress passed a proposal and put it on the President's desk suggesting that there ought to be certain limitations on the President's conduct in return for getting the money. He vetoed that. He believes he is ``the decider.'' 
   Well, under the Constitution, we are all supposed to be deciders. So now we have before us, in response to the President's action, a proposal to do three things: First of all, it would provide an opportunity to have an up-or-down vote on the issue of whether or not troops ought to be redeployed over the next year. I think that is what a democratic institution is supposed to do, to make choices like that. 
   Secondly, what we are proposing under this rule today will allow the Congress to require the President to report to the Congress on three things: First of all, since the President has said that, as Iraqi military units stand up, we should stand down, we have a sense of the Congress provision in this legislation which says that, as the President certifies that battalions have achieved full combat capability, that a certain number of corresponding U.S. units ought to stand down. It is not mandatory. It is a sense of the Congress that that ought to happen. 
   Secondly, we ask the President to report to the Congress on the progress that Iraq is making on the benchmarks that the President himself set out last fall as being the criteria by which we should judge Iraqi progress. 
   And then thirdly, so that it isn't a softball report, we are also asking that the President report to the Congress spelling out which of those benchmarks have actually been achieved. Has the Iraqi parliament actually passed an adequate oil revenue-sharing law which shares that oil equitably with Sunni, Shiites and Kurds alike, because if they don't do that, the Sunnis will never stop fighting? 
   And then, lastly, what we do is to set up a separate bill that deals with some of the domestic emergencies that we face that the President described as ``pork.'' Among those is the agriculture disaster bill. And so we are considering that as a separate bill to demonstrate to the White House and to demonstrate to our critics that they are wrong when they say that we are afraid to let these programs stand on their own. So we are going to vote on them alone, and I happen to think they are in a stronger position when we vote on them alone.  
   It is going to be very interesting to see how many of our Republican friends from agricultural districts are actually going to support us in trying to provide that assistance.     
   After all, we did not declare those counties disaster areas. A fellow by the name of Bush did, and he's the guy that lives in that big white house, and when he makes a declaration like that, there ought to be certain consequences that flow from it, and we're simply meeting those obligations. So that's basically what we are trying to do. 
   As the gentleman from Washington said earlier, we simply happen to believe, those of us who are going to be supporting this proposition, we simply happen to believe that it would be nice if we were fighting the right war in the right place rather than the wrong war in the wrong place, and the right place to be taking al Qaeda on is in Afghanistan. 
   Now, we also provide in our proposition, we say that 60 days after or 60 days from now roughly, by July 13, by the time this bill is passed, by July 13, we guarantee the administration that the Congress will have an up-or-down vote on its own request for all the money. I don't know what more we can do. 
   What we are simply doing is we are letting the President report, letting him give his judgments to us. We then give the Congress about 10 days to absorb what the President has said, and then we vote, up or down, on two issues: number one, whether the President should get all the remaining money; and, number two, there's another amendment that would simply have us instead use that money to redeploy our troops out of combat. 
   It's a fair, square deal. The administration gets a straight shot at what it wants and war critics get a straight shot at what they want. That, to me, is eminently fair.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 8 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the bill which the President vetoed last week, in addition to funding for the troops in Iraq, we provided funding for a number of other high-priority purposes. We provided additional funding above the President's request for veterans' health care, something which the President did not want. We added additional funding to defend the country against a potential epidemic from the pandemic flu virus that our scientists are concerned about. The President asked for that money 3 years ago, but this time around said he didn't want it in the bill. The President said he did not want to see the money that we put in the bill for homeland security and a variety of other programs. 
   It seemed to me the administration took special pleasure in also objecting to the fact that we had agricultural disaster funding in the bill and that we had the funding in the bill to respond to the court decision on western salmon and we also had funding in the bill to deal with Western school programs that had been allowed to lapse by the previous Congress and several other provisions like that. The President said that those programs didn't belong in this bill because they weren't emergencies. 
   Well, in fact, I think the President had it backwards because what the President seemed to suggest is that the only legitimate funding for an emergency appropriation would be for the war in Iraq. In fact, the war in Iraq should not be funded at all as an emergency appropriation. After all, it has been around for more than 4 years, despite the President's landing on that aircraft carrier. And the fact is that the President, in order to hide the full cost of the war, asked for that war to be funded in 11 different slices. Those funds should have been provided in regular appropriation bills, not in supplementals. So it is the President who has the usual practice figured out just backwards. We didn't object to dealing with the Iraqi problem, and we would appreciate it if he would not object to dealing with other legitimate emergency problems. 
   The President seemed to suggest, in his veto message, that we didn't have the courage to deal with the agriculture and other related issues alone, that we had to slip them in, so to speak, in the Iraq bill. And, frankly, that got my dander up. And so now that we are back in the second bill, I have insisted that when the House votes on this matter tonight that we vote on it separately to demonstrate to the President that there is support in both parties, I believe, for dealing with some of these issues, especially with the agriculture problem. 
   Now, I didn't declare 70 percent of the counties in this country to be disaster areas. The President did. The Congress has an obligation not to ignore those declarations and act accordingly, and that is what we are trying to do. So very simply, we are going to have these votes tonight, and I am glad that we are. 
   There are two items that are not in the bill that should be in the bill. One is spinach. When the President vetoed the bill, his administration made a lot of fun of the fact that we had funding for spinach in the bill. Well, there is no spinach in my district, but let me tell you why we had that funding. Nobody was laughing a year ago when people were deathly sick because they had consumed spinach that was contaminated with E. coli, and then the Federal Government went to spinach growers and asked that they take their products off the shelf voluntarily, and when they did that, that cost those spinach growers a lot of money. Now, I have heard a lot of conservatives and liberals alike in this House complain and cry and whine all over the floor when the government engages in an uncompensated taking from a private citizen. Well, if you tell an industry that they can't collect for their product after they have been asked by the government to take it off the market even though 99 percent of that spinach was perfectly safe, then what have you done? You have engaged in an uncompensated taking. Now, that may not bother many people in a city like Washington, D.C., where a lot of people look down their noses at anything rural, but the fact is that farmers are entitled and spinach growers are entitled to the same kind of consideration any other economic group would have in this country. 
   The second thing that isn't in here is funding for Great Lakes fishery problems. We had several Members of the minority party make fun of the bill 2 weeks ago because they claimed we had money in the bill for tropical fish. Well, I want to tell you what we had in the bill. The Federal Government discovered last year that fisheries in the Great Lakes, especially in Lake Michigan, that fish were being found with a disease called viral hemorrhagic septicemia. It does to fish what ebola does to human beings. It is a bloody problem. And that problem, if left unchecked, has the potential to destroy the entire Great Lakes fisheries. That is an 8 to $9 billion annual business. So what we tried to do was to simply recognize the plight of a few commercial fish growers who were told by the government they could not ship their product across State lines because it would endanger the entire fisheries, and so they complied. The irony was under the law if the fish produced by those farmers had been diseased, they could have collected from the government, but because those fish were healthy, they couldn't. So they were stuck in a catch-22 situation. 
   We tried to fund that, and we got laughed off the screen because the demogogues in this institution and demogogues on the other end of the avenue made fun of a problem that is a very serious environmental problem. We have taken that item out of the bill, too, simply because there is only so much bowl gravy that you can counter in a political debate. So we are left with the bare bones proposition that deals with legitimate problems faced by farmers and faced by Western States with respect to wildfires and the other problems funded in this bill. 
   So I am happy we finally are going to have an opportunity to vote on these items standing alone. I urge an ``aye'' vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Let me keep it short and sweet, Mr. Speaker. Let me simply point out that the items contained in this bill are not new add-ons. They are essentially items that clean up and finish last year's unfinished business. That is certainly the case with agriculture disaster. It is certainly the case with rural schools, a program which the previous Congress allowed to lapse. It is certainly the case with western wildfire, and it is certainly the case with the western fisheries' issues which the Congress of last year should have dealt with but didn't.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, this motion is really quite interesting. What it says is that the same folks who want to spend $57 billion on tax cuts on millionaires this year, all paid for with borrowed money, the same folks who are comfortable with the idea that we have got over a trillion dollars in unfunded tax cuts, all paid for with borrowed money, the same folks that want us to spend, no questions asked, at least $600 billion in a sad, sad war in Iraq, these folks have suddenly gotten religion, and they now have a motion that says they would like to see this bill be deficit neutral. 
   What that mean is they are going to ask the farmers of America to bear the full weight of deficit reduction in this bill. This is simply a device to kill the bill because instead of asking that the bill be reported forthwith, it asks that the bill be reported promptly. That, as you know, is code language for killing the bill. I don't think I need to say anything further. 
   If you want to provide the funding in this bill, you will vote against this motion to recommit. If you care about the farmers, if you care about the western wildfire problem, if you want to meet our obligation to the parts of the country that generally get stiffed and ignored, then you vote against the motion to recommit. If you care about these folks, you will vote against the motion to recommit.

<DOCNO>Mr. OBEY. (PROVIDING FOR REDEPLOYMENT OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES AND DEFENSE CONTRACTORS FROM IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - May 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, this recommittal motion is something that we have seen for approximately 5 minutes. I think it is a dubious proposition to be voting on something this serious with less than 10 minutes of consideration. 
   But upon a cursory reading of it, it is apparent that the purpose of this proposition is simply to prevent people from voting on the underlying bill. It is designed to gut the bill by adding two additional conditions that would enable our troops to stay in Iraq indefinitely. Those conditions make reference to the regional security of the Middle East and the national security interest of the United States. That language is so broad that virtually any deployment of any armed force could be justified under that language. 
   It is obvious that would in fact essentially gut the proposal, and so I would urge a ``no'' vote on the motion to recommit. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern).

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 6 minutes. Let me start by saying what is not in this bill. There is no money in this bill for agriculture, there is no money for western wildfires, there is no money for western schools. All of that will be in the next bill, which will be considered separately. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is our response to the President's request for $100 billion in additional funding for the civil war in Iraq, after he vetoed the Congress's first attempt to deal with that problem.     
   What the bill does is to provide roughly $40 billion in funds that are needed for the troops. We provide $30.5 billion for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. We provide additional funding for training of Afghan and Iraqi soldiers. 
   We provide $3.5 billion for defense health, a number of these items we are providing the President has not asked for. We are providing, for instance, for the full $3.1 billion for base realignment. That is money which he asked for last year, but not in this bill. 
   We are also asking for $1.8 billion for veterans health care, which he did not ask for. We are asking for $2.2 billion for homeland security to strengthen our ports, our border and our cargo security. 
   We are providing $660 million to defend this country against the flu pandemic, which could kill many more Americans than have died in Iraq if we get hit with that flu. This is money the administration itself asked for 2 years ago. 
   We are also, in addition to that, asking to finish a number of jobs left over from the last Congress. We are asking to finish the construction, the job of cleaning up the mess after Hurricane Katrina. 
   We are also trying to restore 40 percent of the cut that the previous Congress, last year, made in the Low-Income Heating Assistance Program in light of the higher energy prices that are rising every day. And we are providing, roughly $400 million in order to keep some of America's poorest kids from losing their access to health care. 
   In addition to that, we are fencing the remaining funds that the President has asked for, for Iraq, and we are fencing that money, just as we did in 1984 when the MX missile issue was in dispute. And that money is being held until the President issues three reports. 
   By July 13, he needs to issue a report defining the progress Iraq is making in meeting the benchmarks which the President himself laid out several months ago. 
   And we also ask him to submit a second report outlining whether or not any of those benchmarks have actually been achieved. 
   And then, in addition to that, we are requiring a monthly report on the combat-ready status of Iraqi military units. 
   When the Congress receives those reports, it will then have about a week and a half before it has to consider, under expedited procedures provided in this bill, it would have to consider, essentially, two questions. 
   The pending question before the House would be whether or not the remaining funds should be released so that the President, essentially, gets all of his money with no strings. 
   The second proposition to be voted on is whether or not that money should instead be used to simply reposition our troops out of a combat role in Iraq. 
   We make certain exceptions, the same exceptions that we had in the bill the last time it was before the House. And I would simply say, Mr. Speaker, that I think we guarantee that the administration has a fair, clean shot at getting the result it wants; and I think those in this Chamber who want a different result and want to see a new policy in Iraq, will get a clean shot at their preference. 
   What we are, in essence, doing is giving the President about 60 more days to make his case before those votes occur. I think that is eminently fair to him, and I think it is eminently fair to those of us in the Congress who disagree with his position. 
   We are trying to find a way to reach a final decision on these matters, even though many of us in this body very strongly disagree with the President's package. With this package, we will have compromised, now, on three very major items. We will have compromised on the initial Murtha principles with respect to military unit readiness by providing a waiver for the President. 
   We have also compromised with respect to the time line, because we have kept in our national bill that he vetoed, we retained the initial date by which troop repositioning was supposed to begin. But the final close-out date was left very much an open-ended affair. That was a huge concession to the White House. 
   And now, in a third concession, we are offering a way for the President to get the rest of his money. All he has to do is issue these three reports and then go to the Congress and try to persuade the Congress that his case is better than those who have a different view. That is a straight, fair way to deal with the problem. 
   And I would urge a ``yes'' vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Last time I looked, the headlines said that there was a bunch of Republicans going down to the White House yesterday to tell the President that the jig is almost up on his Iraqi policy.     
   The gentleman says we should fully fund the troops. We have provided $4 billion more for the troops than the President asked for. We are fully funding the troops. What we are not fully funding is a bankrupt policy in Iraq.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   What the gentleman is telling the House is that he thinks his accounting principles are more important than providing additional veterans medical care. He is saying his accounting principles are more important than providing the funding for base closure. He is saying his accounting principles are more important than port security, cargo security, and border security. He is saying his accounting principles are more important than defending this country from a pandemic flu epidemic. He is saying his accounting principles are more important than providing a bunch of kids in this country with the health care they need. 
   And then he squawks about the tunnel in the Capitol. The fact is what we are doing is protecting workers who were exposed to life-threatening asbestos. That is what we are doing. 
   So the gentleman may like the ad that we hear for the accounting company. He may have a passion for accounting. I would much prefer if he had a passion for people.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   Let me simply point out to the gentleman that in the last session of Congress, it took the Congress almost 110 days to respond to the President's request. Let me also point out that the first 30 days of this session were occupied because, while he was majority leader, we never managed to pass a single domestic appropriation bill, and we had to finish his unfinished business, which took the first 30 days of this session. 
   Let me also point out that we have had two meetings with the administration. We have laid out a number of compromises. I have laid out, frankly, to the administration that we are pursuing a two-track strategy. We asked them what concessions they would put on the table. They still have not put a single concession on the table in their conversations with us on this side of the Capitol. So absent that, we have no choice to proceed except sit here like a bunch of potted palms waiting for a miracle. Not many miracles on this House floor.

   It simply removes the provision in this bill which fences almost $50 billion pending the three reports from the President that we have talked about for the last hour. The effect of it is to give the President every dollar he wants, no questions asked, no oversight, no review, no nothing. It is a blank check, and it guts the bill, and I would urge a ``no'' vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I have to tell you, some days it is very interesting to watch what happens in a place like this. This is the most serious issue that this Congress will confront this year, and this motion is addressing that issue in the most unserious manner possible. This motion is presented by the distinguished ranking minority member of the committee, and then he says he is going to vote against his own motion. I would like for a moment to remind the body of what this House is supposed to be. 
   The core purpose of this Congress, the main reason for its existence is to deal with issues like this. Today, the United States Congress is supposedly regarded as the greatest deliberative body in the world. We exist today, if we remember our history, we exist today because almost 800 years ago our British forefathers placed the first limitation on the absolute use of executive power in the history of the English speaking world when they forced the English monarch to sign the Magna Carta. 
   Over 500 years later, that evolved into the United States Constitution, which created three branches of government, with checks and balances designed to prevent arbitrary and unilateral exercise of unchecked executive power in order to protect liberty. 
   Because of that Constitution, and under the procedures defined by that Constitution, we are here in the fifth year of a war which this country was led into under false premises. And we are debating how the Congress should respond to the President's escalation and intensification of our involvement in an Iraqi civil war. We are also debating his request for another hundred billion dollars to continue that war. 
   He is also asking for billions of dollars in additional spending for other domestic and international activities, including flood control, nutrition programs, education and cultural exchanges, disease control in Southeast Asia, and salaries for U.S. marshals. The majority of both Houses have voted to try to bring about a change in direction in that war. We believe, at least those of us who supported the bill two weeks ago, we believe that our soldiers won the war that they were asked to wage, but that it is unrealistic to expect them to do something that they have no power to do, which is to force Iraqi politicians to make political compromises necessary to end the carnage in that country. 
   By this bill, we are attempting to put enough pressure on those Iraqi politicians and those Iraqi factions to make the compromises necessary to allow our troops to end their involvement in that civil war. And to do that, we have in the legislation now before us conditioned our continued presence in Iraq on Iraq's meeting certain performance benchmarks, which were first laid out by the President himself. 
   This motion, which has now been offered by the gentleman, is an example, I think, of people falling off both sides of the same horse at the same time because we have people who say they don't want us to put limits on the President's conduct of the war, now insisting that in fact we adhere to the very proposals that we passed just 2 weeks ago. 
   I want to say that this is, I think, despite the fact that it is an unserious motion, I intend to accept it because it is simply, in essence, a re-vote of what the House committed itself to 2 weeks ago. 
   The reason we have timelines in this bill is because we want to give General Petraeus the ability to use Congress as sort of a bad cop/good cop routine in order to convey to the Iraqi politicians that they must resolve their differences if they expect us to remain there for any significant length of time at all. There is no way that we can create that kind of pressure on Iraqi politicians unless we maintain the proposals that we made in this House bill. 
   The President wants none of these limitations to pass. I find it interesting that people who say that we should proceed to compromise are now offering a motion which in essence tells us not to compromise. In the end, we know that both sides are going to have to compromise; but in the interest of getting us to conference so that we can begin that long arduous process, which I fear will take many months, I am going to accept the motion of the gentleman, even though I regard it as a very quaint way to move to a position of compromise between the President and the Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, with that, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think that we need to understand what this war has really done. This war has gutted our influence in the Middle East, it's gutted our influence in the world, it's divided our own country, and it's united our enemies. Outside of that, it's been a terrific idea. 
   Our troops won the war clearly, cleanly, and quickly. But now they are stuck in a civil war. And as the gentleman from Pennsylvania points out, the only solution to that civil war is a political and diplomatic compromise, and there are no American soldiers who can get that done. 
   Although it certainly isn't intended to do it, this motion in fact carries out the comments made by Secretary of Defense Gates, who testified before our committee, before Mr. Murtha's subcommittee, that the war was militarily unwinnable, that it could only be won on the political and diplomatic front. In fact, The Washington Post carried this paragraph this morning. It said: ``Secretary Robert Gates told reporters traveling with him in the Middle East that congressional demands for withdrawal had been constructive. `The strong feelings expressed in Congress about the timetable probably had a positive impact, in terms of communicating to the Iraqis that this is not an open ended commitment,' Gates said.'' 
   When the bill was before us the first time, our Republican friends did not bother to offer a recommital motion. Why? Because they were divided about how to proceed. They could reach no agreement. They had no policy. Now they are offering a motion which they say they are going to vote against. Is that the best they can do? We have heard talk about a surrender date. 
   The only surrender that is involved here today is the surrender of the obligation of this Congress to oversee Presidential and executive branch policy. The only surrender is the total surrender of our obligation and our authority to a White House that has demonstrated from day one that it had not a clue of what it was getting into, and it today has not a clue about how to get out. 
   We have to provide better leadership than that, and that is what this bill before us tries to do. I would urge support for the gentleman's motion.

   Mr. OBEY. Then let me yield myself 2 minutes before the gentleman closes. 
   Mr. Speaker, 2 nights ago I was watching the Public Television series on the Iraq War, and I saw one of the gentlemen who is generally regarded as being one of the intellectual architects of that war, Richard Perle, say the following: ``We do not leave the battlefield with the first casualty.'' 
   I would simply note that an awful lot of people who have never seen a battlefield or been anywhere near one seem to be awfully anxious to make that kind of a statement. 
   When I heard that comment, I was reminded of a comment of my old friend, the philosopher, Archie the Cockroach, who said once that there is always a comforting thought in time of trouble when it's somebody else's trouble. 
   But as the gentleman from Pennsylvania has pointed out, there has been no sense of shared sacrifice in this country over this war. The only sacrifice most Americans are being asked to undergo is to take a tax cut. 
   Well, it seems to me that we ought to start asking whether it is right and indeed whether it is moral to allow a tiny band of American citizenry, military families, to bear the entire burden of this war that so many noncombatants seem to be so enthusiastic about. It seems to me we need to bring about a different policy that will indeed have equal sacrifice. 
   There are a lot of people who are apparently willing to fight to the last drop of somebody else's blood. I think it is time for that to stop. 
   We, on this side of the aisle, choose to take seriously the gentleman's motion, even though he himself indicates he does not intend to take his own motion seriously because he intends to vote against it. 
   I would urge that every Member on this side of the aisle, and I hope on the other side, would take this motion with the deadly seriousness that it deserves. Because lives are at stake. They are the lives of innocent Iraqis and they are the lives of innocent American troops who are simply being asked to carry out a policy which is increasingly futile. 
   I urge an ``aye'' vote on the gentleman's motion. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, for the last 4 years Rob Nabors has served as, first, the staff director of the then-Minority Democrats on the Appropriations Committee and, in the last 2 years, as the staff director of the entire committee. His work ethic has been legendary. He has worked all hours of the day like so many in this institution whose names are not publicly known. He has worked overtime. He's worked night and day. He's worked weekdays and weekends. He's demonstrated great judgment and skill. And he has also been a bit of history because he is the first African American to have served as the staff director for the Appropriations Committee. 
   But now, alas, President-elect Obama has asked him to serve as the Deputy Director of OMB, and exercising the ``faulty judgment'' that we have come to expect from Chicago Bears fans, he has accepted that invitation. 
   So I simply wanted to take this moment to publicly in this institution thank him for the great service that he has provided this institution and the country and to wish him well on the road ahead.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, to listen to the last two speakers, one would think that they had Rip Van Winkled their way through the last year in this House. For the Republican Party leadership to belatedly give us lectures on earmarks is, in my view, akin to reformed alcoholics giving lectures on temperance. 
   The higher education bill being debated today is funded through the Labor-H appropriation bill. In fiscal year 1995, the last year I chaired that subcommittee, that bill contained virtually no earmarks. By the year 2000, that same bill contained 491 earmarks; and by 2006, that bill had 3,031 earmarks totaling $1.2 billion. 
   The previous Republican leadership was notorious for using earmarks as enticements in order to get their membership to vote for bills that individuals otherwise would not be inclined to vote for. For example, newspapers at the time reported that the previous Republican leadership used earmarks in the Transportation authorization bill as rewards for several Republican Members to switch their votes and agreed to support the Medicare part D provision that forbade the Federal Government from negotiating with the drug industry to provide lower costs for seniors under Medicare. 
   Under the Republican leadership, the cost of the earmarks quadrupled, and we were treated to stories about Mr. Cunningham, Mr. Ney, Mr. Abramoff abusing the process, as well as several other. 
   When Democrats took over the House, until we could reform the process, we suspended earmarks for a year, over the fierce objections of as many Members of the Republican Party as we saw in my own party. 
   In response to demands from both parties, after we reformed the process, we then resumed the earmarking process with the expressed intention of cutting in half the cost of earmarks in non-project accounts. We made no such commitments for accounts that are by their nature project-based because to do so would gut the very purpose of the bills under consideration. 
   For example, the Army Corps budget is by its nature project-based. In fiscal 2006, the administration sent up a budget request for the Army Corps containing 984 projects. Of the final amount provided by the Corps, 86 percent of the projects were administration-requested earmarks. The Corps is an interesting example. The administration argues that they have a system for selecting projects and that they only select projects that score a 3 or better on their scale. However, in 2006, there were 16 projects requested by the administration that did not even qualify for funding based on the administration's own criteria. 
   After all the shouting was over last year, we essentially met our promise, cutting nonproject earmarks by 43 percent after negotiations with the Senate, cutting it from $16 billion down to $9 billion. So we came pretty doggone close to our goal. I would have preferred a larger reduction than 50 percent, but the 43 percent reduction is a 43 percent larger reduction than any Republican Congress ever produced, and we did it under a reform process. 
   At the beginning of the 110th Congress, the new Democratic majority passed unprecedented new rules that required the listing of the sponsors of every earmark, that required that any Member of Congress requesting an earmark disclose in writing the name and address of the intended recipient, the purpose of the earmark, and required that Members certify that he or she had no financial interest in the project. 
   We also required that all matters before a conference committee including earmarks must be subjected to full and open debate and that no item might be added to the conference report after the conference committee had adjourned, as has happened many times in the past. 
   As we moved forward with earmarks last year, I brought a motion to the floor to see if Members wanted to eliminate all earmarks. That motion failed by a vote of 53-369, with a majority of both parties voting against it. 
   I am assuming they did that because an overwhelming number of honorable Members on both sides of the aisle believe that Members should not lose the ability to fund priority items for their districts because of the scurrilous behavior of a handful of renegade Members. 
   During House consideration of fiscal year 2008 appropriation bills, 71 earmark-related amendments were debated and voted on in the floor, including three amendments to eliminate all earmarks from the bill under consideration and 68 amendments to eliminate particular earmarks. Of the 48 amendments on which record votes were taken, only 13 received the support of more than half the Republicans who voted. On those 13, the percentage of Republicans voting ``yes'' never exceeded 57 percent. 
   Every Member knows that even if the House unilaterally suspends earmarks, the Senate will not follow suit. A firm majority on both sides will see to that. I have learned that lesson the hard way. 
   One last point: the resolution introduced by our friends on the other side calls for the suspension of earmarks for 6 months until yet another group offers their suggestions for change. It is ironic indeed that that delay would force us to do the same thing that the Republican leadership so roundly criticized me for last year when I proposed to delay earmarks 1 month until we had more time to review them. The practical effect of the resolution which our Republican friends want to bring up to date, even though it is nongermane to this bill, would be to require the air-dropping of every single earmark in the entire Federal budget. It would guarantee that no earmarks could be discussed or debated while the bill was on the floor of the House of Representatives. It would then give you in spades what our friends on the Republican side said last year they wanted to avoid. 
   I fail to see how requiring every single earmark in appropriation bills this year, I fail to see how requiring all of those earmarks to be air-dropped rather than debated when we consider the bills is reform. It moves exactly in the opposite direction of that which our Republican friends said we should move last year. So as far as I am concerned, the truth is this is not serious reform at all. It is a grandstanding attempt to escape the reputation of previous Congresses. If I had presided over those previous Congresses, I would be running away from their reputation just as fast as the minority appears to be today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, let me simply respond to one thing the gentleman said. He said that no one has done any reforming of the earmarking process since the Democratic Party took control of this House. 
   I would point out that the facts indicate quite the contrary. The first year that we were in the majority, we eliminated all earmarks for a year until we could get a handle on the process that had been driven wildly out of control by the previous majority from the other side of the aisle. The second year, we indicated that we would try to cut the amount of money spent on earmarks by 50 percent. The Senate dissented from that. And in the end we were only able to cut it by 40 percent. I would say that is a significant change. 
   We also, in the process, provided the public's right to know by guaranteeing that every Member who sought an earmark would have to sign a letter, publicly displayed, which spelled out who asked for the earmark and which spelled out and made quite clear that the Member would have no personal financial interest in the earmark. We also provided that these earmarks would be posted on the committee Web site. As a result, the public will know who has asked for what and they will know who got what. I call that reform even if the gentleman doesn't want to admit it.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I would simply point out to the gentleman who was expressing concern about earmarks in the Defense bill, that if this CR represented the CR that I wanted to bring to the House floor, it would not contain the Defense bill. The original CR that I brought forward did not contain the Defense bill. The Defense bill was added at the express request of the minority and at the express request of the Secretary of Defense who wrote us the following letter: 
   ``I understand that there is a consideration in the House to not include full year funding for the Department of Defense in the fiscal year 2009 continuing resolution. 
   ``While I understand that some have expressed policy concerns with the bill, I believe it is critical for the orderly operation of the Department of Defense that Congress pass a full year fiscal 09 Defense appropriation bill in order to avoid the significant negative effects of having to operate under a continuing resolution. 
   ``Accordingly, I urge you to include such an appropriation bill in the final continuing resolution.'' 
   When you make concessions such as we did to this letter, I'm sorry if the clock doesn't give us enough time to do so in a pristinely orderly fashion, but we simply had to move this forward to keep the government open.

   Let me first second the comments made by the gentleman from California about our departing Members. They have, I believe, all been professionals. They have been an asset to this institution. They've certainly been an asset to the committee, and I appreciate the many courtesies that we have received from all of them throughout the years and wish them all the very best in retirement. 
   Mr. Speaker, today we have three moving pieces with which we have to deal between now and the closing of the session. The first is the President's unprecedented bailout request or rescue request, however you choose to term it, of $700 billion, which has, I believe, truly astounded the Nation. 
   Second is the need to try to pass a second stimulus package which tries to react to the loss of jobs in this economy by providing funding for programs that will help create additional jobs and also provide funding for programs that help mitigate the pain to families of the loss of employment opportunities. 
   And thirdly, and most immediate, we have to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government functioning. It is important that we pass this and let the other body pass it because we can add at least a small sense of stability to the markets that are in turmoil today and I think also in the process give us more time to address the truly radical proposals that have been sent down to us by the White House with respect to that bailout. 
   I want to congratulate Mr. Murtha and Mr. Young because they both know their bill. They both know their brief. And their staff has provided able support to both of them, and I appreciate the hard work that both of them have done, and I appreciate what they've contributed to this institution over their careers. 
   I want to say the same thing about the Military Construction Subcommittee, which has been ably led by Mr. Edwards and Mr. Wamp, and certainly the Homeland Security Subcommittee, led so ably by Mr. Price and the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers). 
   I'm especially proud of what's happened in the Military Construction bill. If you take the last year's budget plus this year's budget, we have had the largest increase in veterans health care in the history of the country, and much of that was adopted over the initial opposition of the President. 
   Let me also say that I-- 
   Mr. Speaker, could I suspend and ask the gentleman a question. Did the gentleman yield back all of his time?

<DOCNO>Mr. OBEY. (CONSOLIDATED SECURITY, DISASTER ASSISTANCE, AND CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, let me resume my comments. 
   What I was trying to say is that the item I'm the most proud of in this package is the fact that this Congress will have provided the largest increase in veterans health care in the history of the Republic, and in addition to that, we have also provided by action taken just a few months ago the largest increase in education benefits for veterans since the beginning of the GI Bill. I think that's truly an historic action, and I am very pleased that this House was willing to do that. 
   So this bill does contain the three bills that represent the security-related appropriation bills for the coming year. 
   Having said that, let me make one observation. As I said earlier, I initially did not plan to have the Defense  bill in this package. Much has been made today by some Members about earmarks in the bill. The fact is if the Defense bill hadn't been in this package, those earmarks would not have been in the bill. We put the Defense bill in, in the end, at the request of the minority and at the request of the Secretary of Defense who asked us to do so, and I suspect in the end it will probably, from the standpoint of the Defense Department, prove to be the right choice. 
   But having said that, I want to talk about why I believe we have not been able to finish the domestic appropriation bills. The President submitted a budget to us at the beginning of the year in which he insisted that we cut some $14 billion in crucial domestic items. Example: He wanted us last year to cut 50 percent out of vocational education funding, and this year he wanted us to eliminate vocational education. He wanted us in the last 2 years to eliminate all student aid programs except Pell Grant and Work-Study. He wanted us to eliminate the program that teaches medical personnel to deal with the specialized needs of children in children's hospitals. 
   I've never had anybody in my life come up to me and say, ``Obey, why don't you guys in Congress get your act together and cut cancer research.'' And yet, that's what the President and the previous Congress did; they cut almost 1,000 research grants out of the National Institutes of Health. 
   At a time when we've had a 70 percent increase in the cost of home heating, the President asked us to cut the Low Income Heating Assistance Program, to help the victims of those price increases, by 22 percent. So if we had rolled over and accepted the President's domestic budget, that's what we would have had to do. 
   And we felt therefore, that since the President had made quite clear that he would veto any domestic appropriation bills that exceeded his budget request, we felt that rather than capitulate and make those cuts, we would simply say, ``All right, Mr. President, for the 4 remaining months that you're in office, we'll be living at your budget level, but we will kick the can down the road so that if we have a President who will negotiate like an adult at the end of the road next year, then we will try to cut some compromises that will preserve some of these high-priority areas.'' 
   Now, the President made a Federal case out of our desire to spend $14 billion on our own people, and then he has presented to the Congress in the last 2 weeks a request that we spend 50 times that much, 50 times that much, on the bailout of Wall Street. And so I say that to put in perspective the President's stubbornness. 
   The fact is, if he had not taken a ``my-way-or-the-highway'' approach to domestic appropriations, we could have sat down....... I told Mr. Nussle many times, I would have been happy to sit down and split the differences right down the middle, compromise like adults are supposed to. But no, the President said, ``My levels or no levels.'' So he gave us no choice unless, of course, we wanted to capitulate. 
   So, by not finishing these bills, we maintained the possibility of providing more support for medical research, more support for energy research, more support for education, and more help to the 50 million people in this country who have no health insurance, and I make no apology whatsoever for doing that. I think it is the right thing to do and the moral thing to do. 
   Now, let me explain just a bit about what's in this bill. We, therefore, straight-lined all of the domestic bills until March 6. In addition, we've included a number of other items. As I've indicated, we have essentially doubled the Low Income Heating Assistance Program. We're taking it up to the full authorization level. 
   We have provided the funds that the gentleman from Michigan just referred to, funds requested to try to enable the auto industry to modernize and retool. We did not give them the $50 billion that they wanted. We have cut it to 25, and we did not change the authorization in the way that the auto industry wanted because we did not want government to be on the hook for 80 percent of the cost of those projects.     
   We also provided the $5 million the White House wanted so that they can conduct their search of e-mails because of subpoenas that have been laid on them. And we have provided $2 billion in this package so that next February, the agency doesn't have to write every family in America and say, ``Sorry, but the Pell Grants for your son or daughter for the next year are going to have to be at a lower level than they were last year.'' 
   We have also provided $23 billion in disaster funding for Iowa, Texas, and all the other States who have been hit by so many bad storms lately. And I will stipulate that I believe that the Community Development Block Grant portion of that disaster funding is inadequate and will have to be revisited next year. 
   These are some of the initiatives we've taken. As the gentleman has indicated, we have also in the process, at the insistence of the White House, acquiesced in the White House's desire to lift the moratorium on offshore drilling. That will mean that what happens in the future will be determined by who is elected President. To me, that is what ought to happen in a democracy. When politicians can't agree on something, instead of continuing to try to gut each other and have needless wrestling matches for 6 months at a time, the right thing to do on many occasions is to simply say, ``Okay, we're going to take it to the referees. We're going to take it to the final judges, the American people.'' 
   So that's what we're doing with this package. And it is the American people who will decide whether they're comfortable with the President's deep reductions in health, in education, in science, in low-income heating assistance, or whether they believe that our investments represent a better path for America if we want to see this country grow through the coming years. Basically, that is what we are trying to do with this package. 
   I appreciate the work of the literally hundreds of Members who have had input into this product. I know I have certainly been grabbed every time I turn around by Members who have this idea or that. I'm sure a third of the House is unhappy because of items that are not in the bill and another third is unhappy because of items that are. But that's the way it goes when you have got 535 people, plus a President in the White House who has from time to time been known to have fairly strong views. 
   With that, I would simply say that I would urge support for the product. I want to especially thank the staff of the committee on both sides of the aisle. On this side especially led by Rob Nabors, our staff chief. I do not think the average American understands how hard they work. I don't know about last week, but I know this week, many of them have not been to bed in 2 or 3 days. That, I think, is a testimony to their dedication and their willingness to step up and help us do what the country needs. 
   I hope that we will pass this today. But I hope we will keep in mind that we have been asked to do so much with so little in some of these discretionary appropriation bills; and I hope people will keep that in mind in comparison to the huge size of the bailout that the President is asking us to provide for Wall Street. 
   I make no apology for making one last stand to try to preserve our ability to invest $14 billion in our people here at home at the same time that we're being asked to provide 50 times that much to bail out Wall Street for its past mistakes.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I think it is fair to say that no subcommittee chairman presided over the provision of more financial aid to Egypt than I did during the 10 years that I was chairman of the subcommittee. 
   I think it is also fair to say that I have, on many occasions, tried to see to it that when this body looked at questions in the Middle East that it looked at the interests of all of the parties fairly. But I rise to oppose the gentleman's amendment. 
   We have a dilemma. Egypt is an important and welcome ally. I have always considered them to be a friend. They have played a very constructive role in the Middle East. But in recent years, I am sad to say, Egypt has displayed an increasingly brutal repression of freedom that is contrary to everything that America is supposed to stand for. We have seen the beating of  demonstrators in Bull Connor fashion. We have seen the jailing of political opponents. 
   We have to speak out. Unlike some wildly romantic beliefs of some of the neocons in this country, like Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perle and the Vice President, I do not naively believe that we can force democracy down the throats of a region that has had little experience with it. We have seen in the case of Hamas how democratic forms can be abused and subverted by undemocratic means. But, nonetheless, I do believe that we have an obligation to expect that countries with whom we are so closely associated will perform within certain norms of decency when it comes to the question of human rights. 
   To indicate our concern, while still expressing our respect for a treasured friend, we have fenced $200 million in military aid until the administration can honesty certify that Egypt has greatly improved its human rights conduct and has done more to effectively prevent the illicit supply of arms from being smuggled into Gaza. 
   In my view, this is a balanced approach. It does not cut off aid. It leaves options open. It certainly leaves a very large amount of military aid to Egypt unfettered in any way whatsoever, enough to continue all existing ongoing military contracts. 
   It is a balanced approach. It is a nuanced approach. It is aimed at military aid, because only the military in the Egyptian government, in my view, has the influence to make this come to a responsible and friendly conclusion. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would urge rejection of the gentleman's amendment so that America can send a message consistent with our values, while still recognizing our geopolitical relationships. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, frankly, I have mixed feelings about this amendment. I don't think that the appropriations bill is the proper place to consider issues that are clearly authorization issues, and yet I know that there is considerable concern about this program. 
   Let me simply say that in the interests of time and because I think the equities are split, that we would be willing to accept the gentleman's amendment, with the understanding that we would need to give the administration an opportunity in conference to express any concerns about it and consider any adjustments that might be made that would be mutually agreed to. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman would yield, at this point I am simply standing in for the subcommittee chair, but I would simply say that while I am not frankly as totally familiar with the issue as I am with, for instance, the record of the Egyptian Government in jailing Mr. Nour and other political opponents, I certainly have seen that concern expressed many times, and I would think the conferees would be interested in improving human rights records on Egypt's part with respect to all groups, including Coptic Christians.

   Mr. OBEY. With respect to the amendment of the gentlewoman, I have some considerable disquiet about the Appropriations Committee on the basis of 3 minutes discussion pronouncing judgment on complicated matters with respect to immigration, but let me simply say I would be willing to accept the amendment as an expression of concern on the subject and would hope that the administration would deal with the concerns as the committee goes to conference.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I had not wanted to take any more time this evening, but I was in my office and I heard several silly suggestions that somehow bills like this are going to seriously add to the deficit and require a tax increase and all of that other frothy nonsense. 
   I would simply like to quote from a document by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, one of the most respected organizations in this country in terms of keeping everybody honest about budget facts. This is what they said in a report issued today: 
   ``The main dispute between the administration and Congress is over a $21 billion difference in domestic appropriations. The administration proposes to cut these programs $16 billion below the 2000 levels after adjusting for inflation and threatens to veto bills that do not contain these cuts. Congress would reject these cuts and instead provide a modest increase to these programs of $5 billion or 1.4 percent.'' 
   The report then goes on to say the following: ``Some 81 percent of the increases in appropriations under the emerging bills consist of increases for military and homeland security programs that the President himself requested. Less than one-tenth, or $5 billion of the funding increases reflected in the congressional targets for the 2008 appropriation bills, are for increases for eight domestic appropriations bills.'' 
   Then it goes on to say, ``Under the planned appropriations, those bills would increase a modest 1.4 percent above the Congressional Budget Office baseline.'' 
   Then, get this: ``In real per capita terms, that is, after adjustment for both inflation and population growth, funding for these programs would barely increase at all.'' 
   And as for the nonsense that somehow these bills will require a tax increase or add to the deficit, the report goes on to say, ``As a share of the economy, funding for these programs would actually edge down slightly.'' Then it points out also that the increases in these bills rise more slowly than the expected increase in revenues. 
   What that means, for anybody who has been through second-grade math, is that you cannot add to the deficit, if that is the case, unless you decide to pass further tax cuts paid for with borrowed money, as the former majority so blithely did over the past 5 years. 
   I would also say one other thing. It is easy for any citizen and any Member to demagogue foreign aid. I chaired that subcommittee for 10 years. And let me tell you, there is no piece of legislation that this Congress passes each year that saves the lives of more children than this bill. If you take a look at what we do for children's health, if you take a look at what we do through immunizations and these other programs, there is no program that we pass that saves the lives of more children. 
   We spent a lot of time talking about the right to life today. Well, this bill is a whole lot more effective than lectures from politicians about celibacy or any other matter. This bill actually delivers the goods in terms of the practical things we can do to help our fellow creatures on this planet. 
   I want to say one other thing. My religious values teach me that we are not Americans because of any special merit that we have. We were just lucky enough that God decided to infuse our soul in a body born in the USA. He could just as easily have made us a child born in Bangladesh, Sudan, or any of the other most troublesome spots in the world, the most agonized spots in the world.     
   Any idiot can put together an across-the-board cut. All that means is that you don't think. This is supposed to be not the mandatory part of the budget, but the discretionary part of the budget. It means you are supposed to think and apply your values to what you do. That is what this bill does, and I urge you to reject these amendments.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, talk about crocodile tears. This bill is $700 million below the amount requested by the President of the United States. The other side cries about the fact that it is $2.9 billion over last year, and they say this is the baby that is going to break the bank.  
   This is the same crowd that has supported over $600 billion, all borrowed money, to pay for the most misguided, misbegotten, destructive war in the modern history of the United States, all paid for with borrowed money.     
   I didn't hear any cries about fiscal responsibility then. No, no, no. They spent it blindly, and now they are saying that this bill, which is really an attempt to clean up a lot of the world's messes left over from past wars, that somehow this bill is the one that broke the bank. That is so silly, I would laugh if it wasn't so serious.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I won't take the 5 minutes. But let me say that I find it rather humorous that our good friends on the other side of the aisle would utter not one peep when this President decides to spend over $600 billion on a war in Iraq which he misled the country into, which he didn't have a clue of how to get out of, and now he's asking us to make a commitment that will lead over the next 20 years to the expenditure of at least $1 trillion more for that same misguided cause. Not a peep; most of their buttons wired right to the White House, wired right to Karl Rove's desk. 
   And yet, it's the same crowd that will then make a Federal case out of the fact that when we cut the President's budget for foreign aid we didn't cut it quite enough. And so they're making a Federal case out of one-half of 1 percent. 
   My good friend, Archie the Cockroach observed once, ``Remember the importance of proportion. Of what use is it for a queen bee to fall in love with a bull?'' 
   Think about it. If you do, you'll realize just how silly and misguided this debate is, because this is a crowd who spent willingly $600 billion on the most damaging war in recent American history, and yet are now objecting to the President's request to fund a bill which is traditionally meant to repair our relationships around the world and to pay a little bit of the cost of citizenship on a planet where many millions of people are a whole lot less fortunate than we are. 
   I'm also amused by the fact that we hear a constant cry from the other side of the aisle, ``We need bipartisanship. Politics ends at the water's edge.'' And then when we try to demonstrate a little bipartisanship by giving the President most of what he asked, but not all, we then get the White House complaining because we've cut this bill too deeply, and we get their supporters in this House crying that we didn't cut it deeply enough. I get whiplash trying to follow the direction of a party that is that schizophrenic. 
   So with all due respect, we understand that this is a marginal debate. It is a debate ginned up to try to find any excuse whatsoever to bring down this bill. 
   It's not going to do it. Let's get on with the public's business. Let's be responsible. Let's reject this amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Colorado (Mrs. Musgrave). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I won't take the 5 minutes. I simply want to say that I appreciate the fact that the committee has accepted this amendment. But let me simply make one point. 
   Because we have heard on this side of the aisle that the minority party is whipping against the bill, let me simply say that I would hope that there are no Members of this House who would engage in an act which would give hypocrisy a bad name by voting for this amendment, which in essence simply repeats existing law, and then use that as cover as an excuse to then vote against the bill in final passage. I don't think that friends of Israel would be conned by that. And I would hope, and I have full confidence, that no Member of this House would engage in such hypocrisy.
