<TEXT>
   Mr. CLAY. Let me thank Chairwoman Waters for yielding and also for her leadership on this issue in getting this bill out of committee and to the floor. 
   As an original cosponsor of this legislation, I support its speedy passage through the legislative process. This bill is sorely needed to help stabilize neighborhoods in various types of communities that have high incidences of housing foreclosures. 
   This act establishes a loan and grant program administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to help States purchase and rehabilitate owner-vacated, foreclosed homes with the goal of stabilizing and occupying them as soon as possible, either through resale or rental to qualified families. 
   I raised concerns about the distribution of loans and grants to Chairwoman Waters, and the bill's funds were originally designed for distribution to States with priority for the 25 most populated cities in the country. 
   My concern was that many of us had districts that had higher density of foreclosures than many of the top 25 cities in population. Additionally, we needed to ascertain that housing was provided for low- and moderate-income families, inclusive of those who had already suffered foreclosures. 
   My staff and I worked closely with Chairwoman Waters and her committee staff and placed provisions in the bill that address these concerns. My district, the First Congressional District of Missouri, has alarmingly high foreclosure rates and large numbers of low- and moderate-income families. The bill now mandates a priority for addressing this high foreclosure level area and others like it across the country. 
   Again, I want to thank Chairwoman Waters for her leadership on this.

Mr. Speaker, in closing, I'd like to thank my friend from Florida (Mr. Klein) for bringing this resolution and to say that, after hearing the speakers today, it made me think about the impact some of my teachers had on my learning throughout my life. In the words of a famed historian and author, Henry Adams, he said, Teachers affect eternity because they can never tell you where their influence stops. 
   So, today, let us stand in support and recognition of the timeless influence of our country's teachers and educators by passing H. Res. 952, which expresses the sense of the House that there should be established a National Teacher Day to honor and celebrate teachers in the United States, and I urge passage of the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I present for consideration H. Res. 1091, which seeks to recognize the life of Charlton Heston for his accomplishments both and off the big screen. Not only did Heston command an overwhelming presence in theaters, but his actions in support of the civil rights movement during the 1960s and on behalf of other social causes throughout his life deserve recognition. For example, Charlton Heston joined Martin Luther King, Jr., in the march on Washington, D.C. in 1963, and was an early civil rights activist long before Hollywood found it fashionable. 
   H. Res. 1091 was introduced by Representative DON YOUNG of Alaska on April 8, 2008, and was considered by and reported from the Oversight Committee on April 16, 2008, by voice vote after being amended by the panel. 
   The measure has the support of well over 100 Members of Congress and is evidence of a wide, national appreciation for the enduring legacy that this great American citizen left behind. 
   Heston was born on October 4, 1923, in No Man's Land, Illinois. In 1944, Heston enlisted in the U.S. Air Force, spending 2 years of his life as a B-25 radio operator and gunner in the Alaskan Aleutian Islands. 
   In August of 2002, after a long and illustrious acting career, Heston publicly announced that he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. In 2003, Mr. Heston was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in commemoration of the positive impact he has had on our culture and country. 
   In memory of his life of greatness and activism, I urge swift passage of H. Res. 1091.

   As chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee on Information Policy, Census, and National Archives and an original cosponsor of the Presidential Records Act Amendments of 2007, I strongly support H.R. 1255 and urge its passage by the House. It is appropriate that the House should consider H.R. 1255 during Sunshine Week, when we can call attention to the importance of transparency and open government. 
   Introduced by Representative Waxman, this bipartisan bill is intended to promote the timely release of Presidential records under the Presidential Records Act of 1978, by rescinding Executive Order 13233. Issued by President Bush in November 2001, the executive order granted new authority to Presidents, former Presidents, their heirs and designees and Vice Presidents, allowing them to withhold information from public view unilaterally and indefinitely.

   Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, during subcommittee hearings last week, the Archivist of the United States, Allen Weinstein, testified that Executive Order 13233 has ``added to the endemic problem of delay that NARA faces from the PRA in the processing of Presidential records.'' 
   Tom Blanton of the National Security Archive testified that the order already has added 5 years to the response time for records from the Reagan library and violates the letter and spirit of the PRA. 
   Presidential historian Robert Dallek urged Congress to rescind the order, stating, ``President Bush's order carries the potential for an incomplete and distorted understanding of past Presidential decisions, especially about controversial actions with significant consequences.'' 
   ``It is understandable,'' said Dr. Dallek, ``that every President and his heirs wants to put the best possible face on his administration, but an uncritical or limited reconstruction of our Nation's history does nothing to serve its long-term national interest.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, the long-term national interest demands that the American people know how and why important decisions are made at the highest level of our government. This straightforward and bipartisan legislation would ensure that this will be the case by requiring that Presidential records will be treated as the property of the American people. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill as reported by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee on Information Policy, Census and National Archives, and lead sponsor of the Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 2007, I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1309. 
   H.R. 1309 champions the values of transparency and open government that we celebrate during Sunshine Week and that are embodied in the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, as it is referred to. 
   Introduced with my colleagues Representative Waxman, chairman of the full Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and Representative Platts, this bipartisan legislation is necessary to strengthen FOIA as a tool for enabling public access to government records. 
   During a hearing in February, the subcommittee heard extensive testimony concerning long delays and bureaucratic obstacles experienced by requesters when trying to obtain government records under FOIA. 
   According to testimony from GAO, most agencies throughout the government are failing to keep pace with the volume of requests they are receiving, the number of pending requests carried over from year to year has been steadily increasing, and the rate of increase is growing. 
   A report released on Monday by the nonprofit National Security Archive further highlights the failure of agencies to make information available to the public in a timely way. According to the report, just 22 percent of agencies are complying with the 1996 ``e-FOIA law,'' which requires agencies to post frequently requested information on their Web sites. 
   An insufficient level of resources available for FOIA processing is one reason requesters are being forced to wait long periods of time for responses from agency FOIA offices. Another factor is the current administration's policy of withholding government information that would have been released under previous administrations. Government secrecy has increased as the volume of requests has gone up dramatically. 
   Building on the OPEN Government Act introduced in the last Congress by Senators CORNYN and LEAHY and Representative LAMAR SMITH, H.R. 1309 contains 13 substantive provisions aimed at removing obstacles to complete and timely government responses to FOIA requests. 
   The bill would re-establish the policy of the Clinton administration, under which agencies were directed to disclose requested information unless the disclosure would result in some harm. The current administration has encouraged agencies to be more aggressive in asserting statutory exemptions to deny FOIA requests. 
   In addition, the bill proposes a government-wide ombudsman to mediate disputes between agencies and requesters. This would help to reduce the number of disputes resolved through costly and time consuming litigation. 
   Other key provisions include: A requirement that agencies respond to FOIA requests within 20 business days or face meaningful administrative penalties; the establishment of a publicly accessible tracking system for pending FOIA requests; and new reporting requirements to allow Congress to evaluate agency compliance with FOIA laws and regulation. 
   In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1309 provides a strong, reasonable and bipartisan approach to streamlining the FOIA process and increasing transparency in government. It has the vigorous support of every major organization representing the media industry, journalists, historians, archivists and the public interest in government openness and accountability. 
   We owe it to our constituents to pass this legislation and ensure that the Freedom of Information Act provides actual access to government information to which the American people are entitled. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

And I also want to thank Mr. Smith, who has reservations about the bill, but I want to thank him for his leadership in championing the cause of freedom of information in this country. 
   I want to also thank my friend from Wisconsin for agreeing with us that the bill was modified since it came out of committee, and that modification was in order to eliminate the costs associated with the bill. 
   Let me say that H.R. 1309 champions the values of transparency and open government that we celebrate during Sunshine Week and that are embodied in the Freedom of Information Act. The bill does several things: It would reestablish the policy of previous administrations under which agencies were directed to disclose requested information unless the disclosure could result in harm.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Connecticut for yielding and managing this bill. I want to also thank the gentleman from Tennessee for his leadership on this subject. I rise in strong support of H.R. 1254 and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of it. 
   Mr. Speaker, Federal election laws limit the amount a single source can give to a political campaign. It requires that donations and donor information must be disclosed to the public. These requirements help to preserve the integrity of our democratic system by ensuring that campaign donors do not exercise undue influence over elected policy-makers. 
   Similar requirements do not apply to Presidential library fund-raising campaigns, and this creates the potential for large donors to exert or appear to exert improper influence over a sitting President. 
   The fact that private foundations are required to raise money to build and maintain Presidential libraries lowers the burden on taxpayers, but it also increases the incentive for sitting Presidents to pursue aggressive fund-raising for libraries that have become more and more expensive over the years. 
   Under H.R. 1254, the Presidential Library Foundation would be required to report on a quarterly basis all donations of $200 or more. This requirement would apply to donations made to the foundation during the time that the President is in office and during the period before the Archives agrees to use the land or facility. 
   In addition, the proposal calls on the Archivist to make all reports available to the public online through a searchable and downloadable database. 
   In 2000, during the last days of the Clinton Presidency, the House passed similar legislation by an overwhelming bipartisan vote. A similar provision was included in legislation introduced last year by then-Minority Leader PELOSI but it did not move. 
   Mr. Speaker, the time has passed for the Congress and the President to enact these requirements into law. This is not a partisan issue. It is an issue of concern to all Americans who care about government, integrity and transparency. 
   I commend Mr. Waxman, my fellow original cosponsors, Mr. Duncan, Mr. Platts and Mr. Emanuel, for their leadership on this issue and urge all of my colleagues to support this important bipartisan bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CLAY. Mr. Chairman, today I rise in support of H.R. 3093 as reported by the Appropriations Committee with the understanding that Chairman Obey, Chairman Mollohan and the other House conferees will make every effort to restore $30 million in funding for the Census Bureau that was removed during the committee's markup of this important funding bill. 
   As reported by the Commerce, Justice, Science Subcommittee, the bill included $13 million above the President's request to fund the partnership program which is so critical to our efforts to count traditionally undercounted populations. 
   The bill also included $35 million above the President's request for the SIPP program, which was slated for elimination until the Census Bureau and the Department of Commerce, to their credit, reevaluated and reversed that misguided policy decision. 
   I applaud Chairman Mollohan, Mr. Ruppersberger and others for their leadership in working to include funding for this vital program in the original bill, in spite of the administration's decision not to fund them in fiscal year 2008. 
   Unfortunately, both of these advances would be jeopardized if the $30 million removed in full committee is not restored. This would undermine our efforts to achieve a thorough and accurate enumeration of the U.S. population in 2010. It would also hamper our ability to gather critical data about poverty, program participation and performance in the future. The data collected during the decennial census and annually by the SIPP impact the way billions of dollars are allocated and the way the programs throughout our government are run.     
   Indeed, cutting the money from the Census would undermine the very program our colleagues are trying to fund at the expense of the Census Bureau. 
   And now, Mr. Chairman, I would like to engage the gentleman from West Virginia in a colloquy. 
   Let me begin by congratulating the chairman for his leadership in working to provide and protect funding for the Census Bureau. As we continue the fight to protect the Bureau's funding from being raided to support other programs, I would like to ask the gentleman about his commitment to ensuring that the Bureau is inclusive in its contracting activity, particularly with regard to the 2010 census. And as the gentleman knows, the Census Bureau, according to GAO, will ``make the most extensive use of contractors in history,'' which includes information technology systems, advertising, and the leasing of local census officers. 
   I believe the gentleman shares my view that in order to carry out its mission effectively, the Bureau must have  a workforce that reflects the diversity of this Nation and that that idea extends to the private entities with which the Bureau contracts to perform mission critical activities. 
   I yield to the gentleman from West Virginia.

   Once again I stand as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 5395, which would rename the post office facility at 11001 Dunklin Drive in  St. Louis, Missouri, after a true hero of mine: my beloved father, the Honorable William ``Bill'' Clay, Sr. 
   The measure before us was first introduced by my friend and colleague Representative RUSS CARNAHAN from my home State of Missouri on February 12, 2008. I am proud to say that the bill now enjoys the support and cosponsorship of nearly 60 Members of Congress, including the entire congressional delegation from the ``Show Me State'' of Missouri. H.R. 5395 was taken up by the House Oversight Committee on March 13, 2008, and reported out of the committee by voice vote that same day. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm sure you can imagine that in commemorating the achievements and accomplishments of my father, I could begin anywhere and probably go on endlessly. Throughout my lifetime I have been blessed to experience and witness firsthand my father's commitment to his community and his country. 
   Congressman Clay served Missouri's First Congressional District for 32 years from 1968 to 2000. Born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, Bill Clay served in the U.S. Army from 1953 to 1955. Prior to his service in the U.S. House of Representatives, my father held the position of alderman in St. Louis from 1959 to 1964. And prior to that, he held jobs as a real estate broker, a labor coordinator, and a union affiliate for the St. Louis City Employees Union from 1961 to 1964 and an education coordinator for the Steamfitters Union up until 1967. 
   During his tenure in Congress, Bill Clay became an advocate for environmentalism, labor issues, and social justice. Co-founder of the Congressional Black Caucus, he chaired the House Committee on the Post Office and Civil Service from 1991 to 1995. His leadership in this policy arena serves as greater evidence for passing the measure at hand, which would name the Dunklin Drive post office in his honor. Upon retiring in 2000, I was fortunate and honored to pick up where my father left off representing Missouri's First Congressional District. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we move to recognize the accomplishments of a great statesman, father, and to many of us friend, I ask that we pass the underlying bill without reservation and pay tribute to service and diligence rendered by Congressman Clay to this body over a 32-year period. I urge passage of H.R. 5395.

   Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to be recognized for as much time as I may consume. 
   Representative Carson advocated and represented with distinction Indiana's Seventh Congressional District from 1997 until she passed away in the winter of 2007. 
   The first woman and the first African American to represent Indiana's Seventh Congressional District, Congresswoman Carson worked her way up the ranks to be a prominent Member of this body and a friend and confidant to many of us. 
   H.R. 5472 was first introduced by Carson's close colleague, Representative Peter Visclosky of Indiana, on February 14, 2008 and was considered by and reported from the Oversight Committee on March 13, 2008 by voice vote. 
   The measure has the support of over 45 Members of Congress and affords us a chance to recognize and pay tribute before the American public to a woman whose life serves as a testimony to the American dream. Her story is an inspiration to those who face insurmountable odds and reminds us that we live in a country where anything can be accomplished with diligence in one hand and dedication in the other. 
   Julia Carson was born in Louisville, Kentucky on July 8, 1938 to a single teenage mother. Despite her apparent disadvantages, Congresswoman Carson overcame the odds she was dealt by fate and achieved extraordinary goals and objectives by faith. 
   As a young girl, we learned that Congresswoman Carson shouldered a host of jobs in order to support her family, including waiting tables, delivering newspapers, and serving as a farm hand. In other words, our friend had to work for what she got and had to toil greatly to get where she got. 
   Julia Carson was first introduced to politics in 1972 when Congressman Andy Jacobs encouraged her to run for the Indiana House of Representatives. She served as a member for 4 years, and then moved on to the Indiana Senate, where she held a seat for 14 years. In 1990, she was elected as a Trustee for Center Township of downtown Indianapolis and was responsible for running the welfare office. Over the course of merely 6 years, Carson managed to take a $20 million debt and turn it into a $6 million surplus. 
   On November 25, 2007, it was reported that Julia Carson had been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, which took her life. We are certainly at a loss for a dear colleague, and believe me, Julia Carson will be missed by this body.

   Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 5489, which seeks to honor the life of Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis, and the example she has set for all of us; as an American stateswoman, legislator, and most importantly, as our friend, by naming a U.S. post office in her name. 
   Congresswoman Davis represented Virginia's first Congressional District from 2001 until her untimely death in 2007. She was the second woman ever to be elected to Congress from Virginia. 
   A woman of faith and strong conviction, Congresswoman Davis lived admirably and with down-to-earth humility, which is why her presence here in the House is sure to be missed for quite some time to come. 
   The bill before us, H.R. 5489, was introduced by Representative Robert Wittman of Virginia on February 26, 2008 and was considered by and reported from the Oversight Committee on March 13, 2008 by voice vote. The measure has the support of over 20 Members of Congress, and provides our body a collective opportunity to acknowledge one of our very own for her dedication and congressional action to improve the lives of others, whether in her congressional district, her beloved home State of Virginia, or throughout our great country. 
   Jo Ann Davis was born in Rowan County, North Carolina on June 29, 1950. At the age of 9, her parents moved to the Virginia peninsula. Despite her humble beginnings, Congresswoman Davis set her sights high and the expectations for herself even higher. In 1968 she graduated from Kecoughtan High School in Hampton, Virginia and then went on to attend Hampton Roads Business College. After graduating she became an executive secretary at a real estate company in Newport News until she obtained her real estate license in 1984 and soon thereafter, founded Jo Ann Davis Realty. 
   Her whole life she exceeded expectations, so it should come as no surprise when she ran for Congress in 1999 and won by receiving 58 percent of the vote in her Southern Virginia District. 
   Representative Davis' congressional record is a testimony to her fight for employees' rights and fairness in the workplace. Her first piece of legislation raised the life insurance benefit paid to survivors of military members killed on duty, and she also pushed for improving dental and vision benefits for government employees, and argued in favor of a more evenhanded system for compensating Federal law enforcement officers. 
   Our country owes her our sincere appreciation for her efforts in making public service, which is the lifeblood of our Nation, a more equitable and beneficial system. 
   In September 2005, our dear friend Congresswoman Davis was diagnosed with breast cancer and for years underwent the necessary treatments. Although she was planning to seek re-election in 2008, Congresswoman Davis unfortunately succumbed to the cancer on October 6, 2007 in her home in Gloucester, Virginia.     
   She is survived by her husband, Chuck Davis, a battalion chief of the Hampton Fire Department, two sons, and a granddaughter. 
   Mr. Speaker, let's join together this day to express our thanks and to pay our respects for the sacrifices and battles Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis fought in the name of liberty and justice and pass H.R. 5489 which would designate the Main Street post office in her hometown of Gloucester, Virginia, as the ``Congresswoman Jo Ann S. Davis Post Office.'' I urge the swift passage of the bill.

   Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I'm pleased to join my colleague from California in the consideration of H.R. 4009, which names a postal facility in Lapeer, Michigan, after the Turrill family. 
   H.R. 4009, which was introduced by Representative Candice Miller on October 30, 2007, was reported from the oversight committee on November 11, 2007, by voice vote. This measure, which has been cosponsored by 14 Members, has the support of the entire Michigan congressional delegation. 
   The Turrill family dates back to the earliest settlers in the Lapeer area. They are a strong representation of what Lapeer is founded upon and are remembered as honest, hardworking farmers and leaders within the community. Dr. Miner Turrill arrived in Lapeer in 1832 and was the first postmaster of the county. When Lapeer was incorporated as a city in 1869, James Turrill was the first mayor. The City of Lapeer is historically touched by the efforts made by the Turrill family and their dedication as public servants. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge swift passage of this bill.

   I rise today in support of final passage of S. 2488, the Openness Promotes Effectiveness in Our National Government Act of 2007, or the OPEN Government Act. 
   This bill is a companion measure to legislation that I introduced earlier this session, H.R. 1309, the Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 2007, which was passed by the House in March. After months of negotiations between both Chambers, S. 2488 provides a strong, reasonable and bipartisan approach to streamlining the FOIA process and increasing transparency in government. 
   Two key provisions within the OPEN Government Act include expanding access to attorneys' fees for citizens who successfully challenge an agency's denial of information, along with the creation of a new FOIA tracking system for pending requests. 
   In addition, the bill will require agencies to disclose the type of FOIA exemptions used to redact specific information sought after in many requests. 
   Lastly, the bill will establish a government-wide ombudsman to help reduce the number of requests that are eventually resolved through costly and time-consuming litigation.

   Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, before returning to the subject matter before  the House, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I'm pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 5811, and H.R. 5811 seeks to modernize the requirements of the Federal Records Act and the Presidential Records Act to ensure the preservation of e-mails and other electronic messages. 
   This bill was introduced by Chairman Waxman, Representative Holt and myself on April 15 and reported as amended from the committee on June 11. I want to thank Chairman Waxman and Representative Holt for their dedication to this important issue. 
   Now, my friend from Virginia and others have made some statements that I would like to refute, and one is that this bill strikes a careful balance. It's not going after this administration, but the Act itself recognizes the President's authority to carry out the day-to-day management of his records. This bill preserves that framework. 
   The Federal Records Act gives the Archivist the authority to conduct inspection of agencies' record keeping programs, but the Presidential Records Act does not include such language. This bill does not give the Archivist any new authority to conduct inspections of Presidential records. And also, the Archivist has the expertise and the responsibility to determine how records should be managed and preserved and to certify that it is done properly. 
   The status quo of having those at the White House make the decisions has not worked, and so, therefore, Mr. Speaker, we know that this bill is needed. And that's why we have it under consideration on the floor today.     
   I urge my colleagues to safeguard our Nation's rich history. Therefore, I urge swift passage of the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Additionally, the bill has new requirements for the maintenance and preservation of e-mail records that are sent and received by Presidential advisers. The bill calls on the Archivist of the United States to establish standards for the management and preservation of these records. 
   It's ironic, Mr. Speaker, that the other side has talked about energy during this entire debate when this administration's energy policy was conducted in secret, which may explain why the country is in the position it is in now because there was no openness to the policy, and this certainly wasn't the correct path to take. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I hope we can go on and pass this bill and open up our government for public perusal.

   Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Subcommittee of Information Policy, Census and National Archives, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 4791, the Federal Agency Data Protection Act, a bill to protect personally identifiable information of individuals that is maintained in or transmitted by Federal agency information systems. 
   H.R. 4791, which I introduced along with Chairman Henry Waxman and Representative Ed Towns on December 18, 2007, was reported from the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on May 21, 2008. I want to also thank Ranking Member TOM DAVIS for working with us on this legislation, especially on the notification provision.  
   Despite progress made with the implementation of the Federal Information Security Management Act, or FISMA, GAO found that pervasive weaknesses continue to exist primarily because agencies fail to maintain secure IT networks. As a result, GAO concluded that Federal financial data are at risk of unauthorized modification or destruction, sensitive information at risk of inappropriate disclosure, and critical operations at risk of disruption. 
   H.R. 4791 would secure our agencies' IT access and require an annual audit of agency programs. The bill would also establish a comprehensive definition for ``personally identifiable information'' and mandate that agencies notify individuals when their personal information is accessed in a data breach. 
   Mr. Speaker, in light of today's report that 1,000 patients at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and other military hospitals had their names, Social Security numbers and birth dates exposed in a security breach, this is a timely measure that provides Americans with some assurance that the Federal Government will work diligently to protect their personal information. 
   I urge the swift passage of H.R. 4791.

   We proposed legislation to crack down on price gouging and curb excess speculation, but House Republicans said no. We proposed lowering gas prices immediately by tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which lowered prices by 33 percent when the President's father took similar action in 1991, but Republicans said no. We proposed legislation that would force Big Oil to drill on 68 million acres of land to increase oil production here at home. Again, House Republicans said no.

   Dr. Jones married Ms. Grace M. Allen in 1912. She became a pivotal helpmate to her husband by performing fund-raising activities for the Piney Woods School. Mrs. Jones was an educator and taught courses in domestic science. 
   Laurence and Grace Jones were dedicated educators who left a legacy in keeping with their principles, ``educating the head, hearts and hands'' of young people. The school they built continues to this day on a 60-acre campus among a 2,000-acre wooded site with an enrollment of 275 students.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CLAY. I thank the chairman from West Virginia for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2176, legislation that would ratify a longstanding tribal land claim in the State of Michigan. 
   The Bay Mills Indian community and the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe have worked for over a decade to achieve an agreement with the State of Michigan that would reinstate land rights that these tribes lost shortly after signing a treaty with the Federal Government in the 1850s. 
   In an effort to achieve justice for these tribes, who have sought to reclaim their lands for over 100 years and to protect the homes of over 100 families who currently reside on the disputed land in Charlotte Beach, the State of Michigan negotiated a land-swap settlement. That agreement would give the Bay Mills Indian community 20 acres of land in Port Huron and give the Sault Tribe up to 40 acres in Romulus or Flint. Under Federal law, the new lands provided to the tribes would be eligible for gambling casinos, just as the Charlotte Beach land would be eligible. The purpose of the land claim agreement is to give alternative land that has the same property rights as the land that was stolen from these tribes. 
   Mr. Speaker, two Governors from the State of Michigan and those Members of Congress whose districts are most affected have all endorsed the land-swap agreement that would give these tribes new lands in exchange for the 110 acres of land they lost in the 19th century. 
   There is no authentic argument against this bill. The legislation before us does not expand gaming, as some opponents have erroneously charged. This legislation simply restores justice to Native Americans in the State of Michigan and provides these Indians there an opportunity to raise badly needed revenues. 
   I urge adoption of the bill.

   Mr. CLAY. Mr. Chairman, as chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee on Information Policy, Census, and National Archives, I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by my colleague from Illinois, Mr. EMANUEL. 
   In light of recent events, in which various Executive Branch officials, including the Vice President's former Chief of Staff, I. Lewis ``Scooter'' Libby, have acted with reckless disregard for the protection of classified information, I applaud Mr. EMANUEL's leadership in introducing this amendment. 
   This amendment would eliminate funding for the Office of the Vice President in light of the Vice President's refusal to comply with Executive Order 12958. 
   Executive Order 12958, as amended by President Bush in March 2003, requires the Information Security Oversight Office, ISOO, within the National Archives and Records Administration to establish a uniform system to protect classified national security information throughout the Executive Branch. 
   In 2004, the Office of the Vice President refused to submit to an on-site inspection. In doing so, it made the astonishing claim that it was not an Executive Branch entity and therefore not covered by the Executive Order. 
   The director of the ISOO wrote the Vice President's office to contest the claim and also asked the Department of Justice to evaluate the Vice President's argument. The Vice President and the Justice Department repeatedly ignored these communications. Moreover, we learned this week that the Vice President's staff has proposed amending the Executive Order to eliminate the ISOO. 
   Congress should not tolerate this effort by the Vice President to exempt his office from oversight and retaliate against the agency charged with maintaining our Nation's most sensitive secrets. 
   The Vice President is making a mockery of the law and our system of checks and balances. 
   If the Office of the Vice President insists upon defining itself as not being an Executive Branch entity, then clearly it should not be funded like one. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   I commend the Appropriations Committee for working in a bipartisan manner to construct a resolution that continues to fund the government for the remainder of the fiscal year. As Chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee on Information Policy, Census, and National Archives, I am especially pleased to note that H.J. Res. 20 restores funding that is absolutely vital to conducting an accurate and cost-efficient 2010 census. 
   The funding in this bill will enable the Census Bureau to move forward with plans for the first-ever automated census in 2010. In addition to saving time and money, utilizing hand-held computers will improve accuracy and ensure the most precise enumeration possible of the American people. According to Preston Jay Waite, Associate Director for the Decennial Census, field trials have resulted in a 91 percent accuracy rate. 
   As preparations for the 2010 Census proceed, active oversight will be important to ensure that all Americans are counted fairly. In 2000, the national census missed at least three million people--mostly the poor and minorities. I look forward to working with Ranking Member MICHAEL TURNER of Ohio and my other Subcommittee colleagues to conduct essential oversight needed to see that this never happens again. 
   Mr. Speaker, the action we have taken today will guarantee that we don't retreat from the goal of using technology to improve the way we keep track of changes in our population. I thank my colleagues for passing this continuing resolution and will support efforts in the Senate to pass this legislation with the same commitment to adequately funding the 2010 Census.,

<TEXT>
   Mr. CLAY. I thank the gentleman from American Samoa for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise to declare my absolute and unwavering opposition to the President's plan to escalate this tragic and unnecessary war. 
   Four years ago, I stood on the floor of this House to oppose the original force authorization resolution. At the time, some of my colleagues cautioned me that I was taking a risk by opposing the President and failing to support the war against terrorism. But I took that position because I believed then and still believe today that great nations do not start wars as a matter of policy, they exercise diplomacy and negotiation to avert threats and achieve security.     
   The evidence that the administration presented did not clearly establish any imminent threat to our national security. I was convinced that invading Iraq, without international support and without unequivocal evidence that Iraq was involved in 9/11, would dangerously drain our military strength, distract us from fighting the very real terrorist threat, and ultimately weaken our credibility around the world. Now we can see that the world in Iraq has emboldened our enemies and provoked the scorn of our allies. 
   Madam Speaker, standing here 4 years later, I can only wish that my assumptions were wrong, that invading Iraq was somehow vital to our national security. We were told that there were weapons of mass destruction, and now we know there were no WMDs. We were told that Iraqi oil revenue would pay for this war, and now we know that that was only a pipe dream that has cost American taxpayers over $400 billion. We were told that our troops would be greeted as liberators, and now we know that was only wishful thinking based on neocon fantasies and not the facts. 
   Today, American troops are embroiled in a bloody quagmire that has already resulted in over 26,000 American casualties. And now, just this past week, the Defense Department Inspector General reported that senior administration officials engaged in a deliberate misinformation campaign about al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein. Now we have learned that officials in our government deliberately distributed altered intelligence assessments. Such a misinformation campaign is unconscionable and a greater threat to our national security than any act of terrorism. 
   We are all familiar with the historian's observation that great nations are not conquered by outside forces until the nation has destroyed itself from within. I implore my colleagues to heed the lessons of history. Do not allow the politics of deception to distort reality. 
   This administration is denying the facts. It has repeatedly misled the Congress and the American people and undermined our Nation's integrity throughout the world. Now the President is asking Congress to register more support for a policy failure. Escalating the military violence in Iraq by injecting 21,000 more U.S. troops into a civil war reflects nothing more than this administration's obstinate refusal to face present realities. 
   A vast majority of Americans want a responsible end to this war as soon as possible. They want our troops redeployed, they want us to alleviate the suffering of innocent Iraqis, and they want us to finally tell the Iraqi people that they must be engaged in their country's destiny. The future of Iraq must ultimately be determined by them, not by us. 
   I want to conclude by quoting a good friend of mine and a fellow colleague, the distinguished chairman of the Armed Forces Committee, IKE SKELTON. In a recent statement he said, ``Only the Iraqis can change the situation there and bring lasting security to their nation. I remain convinced that a gradual and responsible redeployment of U.S. forces is the best way to help the Iraqis take responsibility for their security and to restore the full strength of our military.''

<DOCNO>Mr. CLAY. (PRESIDENT'S VETO THREAT OF CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE BILL -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, yesterday this Congress sent the President bipartisan legislation to reauthorize and strengthen the Children's Health Insurance Program. This bill will provide 10 million low-income children with health care coverage, including 4 million uninsured children who are currently eligible for the program but not yet covered. Unfortunately, President Bush just vetoed this bipartisan legislation. 
   The President's opposition to this bill puts him squarely in the minority.  The legislation has received overwhelming support from a wide variety of groups such as the AMA. A new Washington Post/ABC News poll shows that 72 percent of Americans support the reauthorization of the CHIP program. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am heartened that 45 of my Republican colleagues in this body joined Democrats in passing this critical legislation. However, if the President wants to veto it, I hope other House Republicans will stand with America's children instead of with the President and vote to strengthen the CHIP program.

   Mr. CLAY. As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of H.R. 3446, which names a postal facility in Marshall, Michigan, after Michael W. Schragg. 
   H.R. 3446, which was introduced by Representative Timothy Walberg on August 3, 2007, was reported from the Oversight Committee on October 23, 2007, by voice vote. This measure has the support of the entire Michigan congressional delegation. 
   Mr. Speaker, Michael W. Schragg served as postmaster of Marshall, Michigan, for 23 years. In June 1970 he began as a substitute clerk carrier, and in May 1979 he became the postmaster of Marshall. 
   During Marshall's 1987 annual historic home tour, Mr. Schragg began displaying a number of old postal artifacts throughout the post office. Due to the many artifacts displayed, tourists thought the post office was a museum rather than an official working post office. He decided to develop an extensive collection of postal antiques in the basement of the post office and in an annex building. Currently, he is known for his noteworthy accomplishment in the creation of the Marshall Postal Museum. Everyone in Marshall knows Mr. Mike Schragg as the man who knows everyone's zip code by heart. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative Timothy Walberg, for introducing this legislation and urge the swift passage of this bill.

House Resolution 778, which has 53 cosponsors, was  introduced by Representative Zoe Lofgren. 
   Mr. Speaker, wildfires in Southern California have destroyed over 1,000 homes and scorched more than 400,000 acres. From San Diego to Malibu, hundreds of thousands were warned to leave their homes. More than 250,000 were told to flee in San Diego County alone. There were at least 18 different wildfires in Southern California. 
   I commend my colleague, Representative Lofgren, for seeking to honor the first responders and to express full support to the victims of the Southern California wildfires and urge the swift passage of this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. CLAY. (MAKING PERMANENT THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE SPECIAL POSTAGE STAMP TO SUPPORT BREAST CANCER RESEARCH -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, as a sponsor of H.R. 1236, the bill would make permanent the breast cancer research stamp, which first went on sale on July 29, 1998. 
   After several discussions with the Postal Service, I offered an amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 1236 during the Subcommittee on Federal Workforce, Postal Service and the District of Columbia markup on September 18, 2007. 
   The amendment retained the Postal Service's flexibility by reauthorizing the breast cancer stamp for an additional 4 years and strengthens the bill's reporting requirements. The new reporting requirements would assess the breast cancer stamp's effectiveness and appropriateness and the cost to the Postal Service for administering the program to find a cure for breast cancer. 
   The amendment was agreed to by voice vote. H.R. 1236, as amended, was reported from the Oversight Committee on September 20, 2007, by a voice vote. 
   In America, breast cancer is reported as the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women after lung cancer. The American Cancer Society estimated 178,480 women will be diagnosed this year with invasive breast cancer. In the U.S., approximately 40,000 will die. 
   The Postal Service has sold over 785.6 million breast cancer research stamps from which $54.626 million have been transferred to the National Institutes of Health and DOD for breast cancer research and awareness. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 1236 and urge the swift passage of this bill.

   I commend everyone who has championed this issue in Congress, including former Representative Vic Fazio for introducing the first Breast Cancer Research Stamp Act in 1996, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, Representative Joe Baca and the late Juanita Millender McDonald who pioneered the idea of a permanent breast cancer stamp, research stamp in 2001. And I ask my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 1236.

<DOCNO>Mr. CLAY. (RECOGNIZING ANNIVERSARIES OF MASS MOVEMENT FOR SOVIET JEWISH FREEDOM AND FREEDOM SUNDAY RALLY FOR SOVIET JEWRY -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H. Res. 759, a bill that recognizes the 40th Anniversary of the Mass Movement for Soviet Jewish Freedom and the 20th Anniversary of the Freedom Sunday Rally for Soviet Jewry on the Mall in Washington, D.C. H. Res. 759, which has 57 cosponsors, was introduced by Representative Henry Waxman on October 18, 2007. House Resolution 759 was reported from the Oversight Committee on October 23, 2007, by voice vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, the former Soviet Union today has the third-largest Jewish community in the world. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Russian Empire was home to the world's largest Jewish community. In the late 19th century, over 5 million Jews lived as a persecuted minority in Czarist Russia. This indifference towards Jews continued throughout the 20th century under the leadership of Secretary General Joseph Stalin and Prime Minister Nikita Khrushchev of the Soviet Union. 
   In the mid-1960s, Prime Minister Alexei Kosygin was reported to have said ``the road is open and no problem exists'' for Soviet Jews who might want to leave for Israel. This remark sparked an increase in the efforts of Jews to leave the Soviet Union and helped initiate international efforts to facilitate their mass movement from Soviet Russia. 
   In 1967, in response to earlier Soviet Jewry advocacy efforts, Russian authorities allowed some Jewish citizens to leave for family reunification in Israel. Due to the lack of diplomatic relations between Israel and the Soviet Union, most emigres traveled to Vienna where Israeli authorities flew them to Israel. By March 1976, the majority of emigres who left on visas for Israel chose to resettle in the United States and other Western countries.  
   Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague Representative Waxman for seeking to recognize the 40th Anniversary of the Mass Movement for Soviet Jewish Freedom and the 20th Anniversary of the Freedom Sunday Rally for Soviet Jewry on the Mall in Washington, D.C., and urge the swift passage of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I stand to urge the passage of S. 3477. The National Historical Publications and Records Commission is the grant-making arm of the National Archives and Records Administration. The NHPRC makes grants to help identify, preserve, and provide public access to records, photographs, and other materials that document American history. The grants go to State and local archives, colleges and universities, libraries, historical societies, and other nonprofit organizations throughout the country. 
   This legislation provides that the Archivist, with the recommendations of the NHPRC, may grant money to eligible entities to promote the historical preservation of, and public access to, historical records and documents relating to any former President who does not have a Presidential archival depository currently managed and maintained under the Presidential Libraries Act of 1955. 
   This bill also includes provisions that limit the tenure of members of the NHPRC and provides for their recusal from matters that pose, or potentially pose, a conflict of interest. 
   The bill provides for online access to the Founding Fathers documents, establishes an advisory committee for the NHPRC, and requires that the Archivist develop a 10-year capital improvement plan with annual updates to Congress. 
   Additionally, this legislation authorizes the Archivist to establish an electronically searchable national database consisting of historic records of servitude, emancipation, and post-Civil War reconstruction, including the Refugees, Freedman, and Abandoned Land Records, Southern Claims Commission Records, Records of the Freedmen's Bank, Slave Impressments Records, Slave Payroll Records, Slave Manifest, and others contained within the agencies and departments of the Federal Government to assist African Americans and others in conducting genealogical and historical research. 
   None of the programs authorized in this act shall take precedent over existing programs funded by the Commission unless there is an increase in authorization of appropriations and an increase in appropriated funds to fund these programs. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this measure. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CLAY. (OVER-CLASSIFICATION REDUCTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6575, the Over-Classification Reduction Act, addresses the ongoing problem in the Federal  Government of over-classification. This bill was introduced by the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, HENRY WAXMAN and TOM DAVIS. 
   The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, known as the 9/11 Commission, recommended limiting the unnecessary classification of documents and providing incentives for information sharing. Yet as we mark the 7th-year anniversary of the September 11 tragedy, our government still is not sharing important information. Some information must be protected to avoid threatening our national security. But going too far by over-protecting information is also damaging. Over-classification hurts our efforts to fight terrorism because it prevents agencies from sharing information with relevant stakeholders, including State and local law enforcement and other Federal agencies. It also undermines public access to this important information. 
   H.R. 6575 calls on the Archivist to promulgate regulations to prevent the over-classification of information. In addition to reducing over-classification, the Archivist would consider what classified information should be prepared in an unclassified format. Agencies would be required to give employees training and the opportunity to challenge classifications, and agency inspectors general would randomly audit classified information to ensure that it is properly marked. 
   This bill is being considered with an amendment that makes clarifications and addresses concerns raised by the administration and some Members of Congress. For example, the amendment ensures that the bill is consistent with executive order 12958 as well as other existing laws and programs. The amendment also clarifies that the regulations required by the bill be developed in consultation with the heads of affected agencies. It is essential that the Director of National Intelligence play an important role in developing policies related to the declassification of intelligence information. The Archivist also should consult with relevant agencies such as the Department of Defense regarding information about military operations or the Department of Energy regarding safeguarding nuclear facilities. 
   This bill takes a government-wide approach to improving information sharing. By doing so it will help strengthen our national security. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Reyes and Representative Harman for working with the Committee on Oversight on this bill. I urge my colleagues to support this measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CLAY. (FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of H.R. 5687, the Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 2008. 
   H.R. 5687, which I introduced along with Chairman Waxman on April 3, 2008, was reported out of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on May 15 of 2008. The FACA amendments will improve the balance, transparency, and independence of Federal advisory committees. 
   Congress passed FACA in 1972 to address the rising costs and lack of accountability among Federal advisory committees. However, FACA has been undermined by loopholes that have been created over the years. 
   H.R. 5687 strengthens FACA by closing those loopholes. For example, the bill clarifies that FACA applies to subcommittees, ensuring that agencies cannot avoid the requirements of FACA by conducting business through subcommittees. The bill also increases the disclosure requirements for advisory committees and requires agencies to obtain conflict of interest disclosures. 
   As amended, H.R. 5687 takes into account recommendations made by the Office of Government Ethics and other stakeholders. The amendment makes the conflict of interest restrictions on advisory committee members more workable while preserving the bill's requirement of public disclosure. The amendment also clarifies that agencies have the authority to require advisory committee members to recuse themselves when the committee's work will impact their personal interests. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation will improve the advisory committee process. I urge my colleagues to support passage.

   Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am proud to join my colleagues in the consideration of H. Con. Res 195, which expresses the sense of Congress that a National Dysphagia Awareness Month should be established. 
   Dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, is a medical disorder currently afflicting nearly 15 million Americans, with another million Americans diagnosed each and every year. Moreover, among those over 60 years of age there is over a 50 percent probability of experiencing dysphagia at some point. Unlike many other medical disorders, dysphagia has not gathered the national attention that it deserves, despite the fact that more than 60,000 American deaths occur annually from dysphagia-related complications. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge swift passage of H. Con. Res 195, as it will shed national attention on dysphagia, which is afflicting so many of our fellow Americans and costing us over $1 billion to treat annually.

   Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, representing the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.Con.Res 365, which celebrates the life of Robert Mondavi, a notable winemaker and philanthropist who had a great effect in boosting the economic and cultural well-being of California and the Nation. 
   Robert Mondavi was born on June 18, 1913 in Virginia, Minnesota to Italian immigrants. In 1965, Mr. Mondavi started his own winery, the Robert Mondavi Winery, in the fertile soil of the Napa Valley and immediately became a passionate advocate for California wines. Through his vineyard, he worked to raise the status of California wines and was successful. 
   Through his professional and charitable work, Mr. Mondavi's influence on the California wine industry and the Nation at large has been immense and lasting. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge the swift approval of this resolution honoring the life of Mr. Mondavi.

   Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I rise in support of House Resolution 1283 which expresses our heartfelt sympathy for the victims and the families following the tornado that hit Little Sioux on June 11. 
   At 6:35 p.m. on June 11, a tornado touched down at the Little Sioux Boy Scout Ranch near Little Sioux, Iowa. The tornado, which tore through the ranch with the greatest force of nature, caused a rock chimney to collapse into the bunkhouse where the Scouts sought shelter. In the aftermath of the tornado's destruction, 43 individuals were injured, and four, Sam Thomsen, Josh Fennen, Ben Petrzilka, and Aaron Eilerts, were tragically killed. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Boy Scout community and America at large will grieve the loss of the four Scouts whose lives ended so suddenly. With this bill, we have the opportunity to commemorate the lives of these individuals and to convey our gratitude to all those who so swiftly responded to the disaster, and I urge the adoption of this resolution.

   Mr. Speaker, being a car enthusiast, this is one bill that gives me great pleasure. And I stand to join my colleagues in the consideration of H. Res. 970, which supports the designation of June 30 as National Corvette Day, offered by my friend from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus). 
   Mr. Speaker, when we think of American-manufactured sports cars, one of the first vehicles that probably comes to mind is the Chevrolet Corvette. The Corvette debuted fresh off of the assembly lines back in 1953 as part of Chevy's new wave sports cars. Since then, the Corvette has become a hallmark in the automobile industry both here in America as well as around the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Corvette has been America's favorite sports car for the past 55 years. And in honor of its performance, prowess and prestige, I urge my colleagues to join me in expressing support for the designation of June 30 as National Corvette Day by voting in favor of H. Res. 970.

   Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I gladly join my colleagues in the consideration of H. Con. Res. 370 which expresses support for the designation of September 2008 as ``Gospel Music Heritage Month'' and honors gospel music for its valuable and long-standing contributions to America's culture. 
   H. Con. Res. 370 was introduced by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee) on June 10, 2008, and is cosponsored by 53 House Members. The bill before us was reported favorably from the Oversight Committee on June 12, 2008, by voice vote. 
   Gospel music is a unique national art form that truly exemplifies the American ``melting pot'' concept. Its diverse influences include African-American spirituals, traditional African music, ragtime, jazz, and blues, as well as Irish folk songs and hymns. 
   While some originally deemed the fusion of secular music with sacred lyrics, which characterizes gospel music, to be unconventional, gospel music has quickly grown into an integral part of American culture. The influence of gospel music extends throughout practically all forms of secular music performed today, including rock and roll, country, soul, and rhythm and blues. 
   Gospel music has motivated innumerable musicians over the years, including such greats as Tommy Dorsey, who is sometimes credited as the ``Father of Gospel Music,'' James Vaughan, Diana Washington, Smokie Norful, Yolanda Adams, Sam Cooke, Mahaliah Jackson, Elvis Presley, Marvin Gaye, Ray Charles, Buddy Holly, Bob Dylan, and the list goes on. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is important that we as a Congress honor the enormous and beautiful contributions that gospel music has given to not only America, but to the world by designating September 2008 as Gospel Music Heritage Month. I urge the swift passage of this bill.

   Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 390, which authorizes the National Archives to preserve historical documents relating to servitude, emancipation, and post-Civil War reconstruction. Introduced by my friend, Representative Lantos of California, the bill calls on the Archives to place these documents in a searchable electronic database for use in historical and genealogical research. 
   As a cosponsor of H.R. 390 and chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee on Information Policy, Census, and National Archives, I am pleased to see the measure presented for consideration by the House today. Under this legislation, grants will be made available to States, colleges and universities, and genealogical associations to preserve similar records in their possession and make them available electronically. The bill will for the first time make a wide range of historical documents relating to servitude, emancipation, and post-Civil War reconstruction easily accessible and searchable. This will vastly improve the ability of African Americans to research their lineage. It will also facilitate the efforts of historians performing research into this period of American history. 
   An identical version of this bill was approved unanimously by the Committee on Government Reform last year. And as someone with a deep appreciation of African American and American history, I am honored to support its passage today. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.

   Mr. CLAY. Let me say that I stand in support of the bridge loans to the automobile companies. I speak today for workers. An overwhelming majority of my constituents in the First District support the bridge loans also. They, like me, do not want to see the Big 3 go bankrupt. This would not be good for our economy at this time in our history. 
   If these companies are to go into bankruptcy, it would mean that hundreds of smaller companies and suppliers would go into bankruptcy or would be economically crippled. Millions of Americans have stock in these auto companies, and I need not lecture on the further risk to their investments that this would cause. The state of the economy has already done enough damage to their investments, to pension fund investments and to the investments of business and of organizations of all kinds. The auto companies and the unions have agreements that will bring them in line with Toyota's by 2012. Cut labor costs and industry costs. 
   I urge the passage of the bill.  
   Mr. Speaker, I stand today in support of the bridge loans to the automobile companies. I speak today for workers. An overwhelming majority of my constitutents in the 1st Congressional District of the State of Missouri, support the bridge loans also. They, like me, do not see bankruptcy of the ``Big 3'' as a positive for workers or the economy at this time in history. 
   Mr. Speaker, if these companies are to go into bankruptcy, it would mean that hundreds of smaller companies, the suppliers, would go into bankruptcy or be economically crippled. 
   Small businesses employ more workers in the United States than all other employers combined. The failing of the big three auto makers would put approximately 300,000 jobs at risk in the auto industry. The associated industries, that supply and contract with the auto makers, would then have in excess of 3 million workers at risk. 
   If the auto makers are to go into bankruptcy, the warranties on your cars are at risk. This could result in families, already cash strapped, having to pay repairs out of pocket expenses that were not a part of their budgets and perhaps that requires shifting money from another necessity to pay for the repairs. 
   Millions of Americans have stock in these auto companies. I need not lecture on the further risks to their investments this would cause. The state of the economy has already done enough damage to their investments, pension fund investments, and the investments of businesses and organizations of all kinds. 
   The auto companies and the unions have agreements that will bring them in line with Toyotas' by 2012. They continue to work together to cut labor costs and industry costs to insure the economic stability of the auto industry. 
   I also understand that there are other credible arguments to the contrary, but I can't agree that this is the time to consider them. Our economy is too fragile to risk this kind of hit at this time in the country's economic history. 
   We have used the tarp money to bail out banks and investment houses and to insure that select securities are properly backed. I voted against this approach in previous votes. I believe that we need to concentrate more on putting money in the hands of consumers through the creation of jobs and the maintaining of jobs that do exist. This legislation directly targets the workers. We do not need to have an economy with healthy institutions and securities and consumers with no money to purchase goods or invest. 
   I am speaking to both parties on the floor. We won't solve these economic problems confronting us working for separate results. And I do know that no Member of this floor wants to see this economy crash. I do understand that we have some differences of opinion in the methods that Government has to employ to inject life into the economy. We can work on them after the first of the year. Roll up your sleeves and come back in January ready to find the best solutions. 
   Join me in supporting this package today. This is only a stopgap measure, but a necessary one. We cannot afford the risk of the alternatives.

<DOCNO>Mr. CLAY. (AUTHORIZING NATIONAL PARK SERVICE STUDY REGARDING THE SOLDIERS' MEMORIAL MILITARY MUSEUM -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank my friend and colleague from Arizona for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people are unanimous in supporting the courageous men and women serving in our Armed Forces. In recent days, we were appalled to learn that our veterans are not receiving high-quality health care. We have been sickened by some of the stories and images of the patients at Walter Reed Hospital who have been neglected and left untreated. And we are beginning to understand that this is a nationwide crisis. We are all somewhat ashamed that we have failed to provide to those who have given the most to keep our Nation free and secure. 
   With these recent events in mind, I want to address the legislation before us today. H.R. 1047 is a bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study to determine the suitability and feasibility of designating the Soldiers' Memorial Military Museum in the city of St. Louis as a unit of the National Park System. 
   This memorial is a shining landmark to those brave men and women who gave their lives in World War I. Today, as much as any time in our history, the American people feel a very special connection to our military forces, and the citizens of our Nation have a real need to visit shrines that honor our wartime heroes. 
   The St. Louis Soldiers' Memorial is a valuable shrine where citizens can participate in the tradition of honoring our Nation's veterans. Initiated by the residents of St. Louis in the 1920s, after many years of fundraising, the land was acquired and the monument was constructed. On October 14, 1936, St. Louis Soldiers' Memorial Military Museum was officially dedicated by President Roosevelt. And St. Louis Soldiers' Memorial Military Museum also has a unique place in our Nation's history as it is the only structure in St. Louis that is known to have been dedicated by a sitting U.S. President. 
   The Soldiers' Monument is a national treasure, and it is recognized as an architectural masterpiece. Designed by one of the 20th century's foremost art deco sculptors, Mr. Walter Hancock, the entrance to the memorial is flanked by four limestone sculptures which symbolize the most important virtues in a soldier's life: courage, loyalty, sacrifice and vision. The ceiling of the monument is decorated with mosaic tiles in the shape of large gold stars that are dedicated to our Nation's Gold Star Mothers. 
   Today, the St. Louis Soldiers' Memorial is an important cultural resource and gathering place. It attracts about 48,000 visitors a year, and provides the setting for more than 20 ceremonies annually, including change-of-command and retirement ceremonies, and many other patriotic events hosted by veterans groups. It is also the center of an annual Veterans Day parade which is the largest of its kind in the Midwest, drawing participants from several States and hosting more than 100 marching units. 
   In recent years, the city of St. Louis has relied upon the support and contributions of active military personnel and veterans to enable it to maintain this cherished monument. We all want to honor the veterans and citizens of our Nation. We should have Federal monuments to help us all remember those family members and friends who have given their lives for us in combat. 
   It is the right time for the Federal Government to consider acquiring the St. Louis Soldiers' Memorial Military Museum in its inventory of national monuments. I believe that a study of the monument will show it is a historically important structure with a national significance. 
   H.R. 1047 is strongly supported by veterans groups and other civic organizations. I hope the Members of this body will endorse this important effort to create a Federal monument to honor our Nation's veterans. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
