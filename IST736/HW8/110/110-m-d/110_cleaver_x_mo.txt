<TEXT>
   Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Washington for all the work that he has done on this very important issue. 
   I agree with Mr. Inslee that this problem we face is not irreversible. However, time is not on our side. Almost exactly 7 days ago, I was in Greenland, and on the front page of today's Washington Post is a picture of a harbor at Illulissat, Greenland. This is about 170 miles north of the Arctic circle. And for those who might want to go to the Washington Post Web site or if you have a Washington Post, you will see blue waters. 
   Now, on the surface, pardon the pun, it would appear that this is normal. However, the Greenlanders explained to our delegation, which was led by Speaker Pelosi, that under normal circumstances at this time of the year this area is completely frozen. In fact, they say that their ancestors at this time of the year would get on the water, which was, of course, frozen solid, and go to Canada to get lumber to bring back to build houses. And they would travel on the water that is frozen with their dogs pulling their sleighs. 
   Now, I went out in a boat out to an iceberg which was melting. There are 53,000 people who live in Greenland. I did not have the opportunity to speak with 53,000, but I can tell you with no fear of contradiction that every person we spoke with from Greenland spoke to us about their fear of what is happening to their native land. These are not politicians. These are not scientists. These are not college professors. All they know is that never during their lifetime have they seen the kinds of things that they are witnessing now. 
   For example, they speak now of the fact that their animals can actually graze longer. Now, I never saw a tree in the entire country of Greenland, but at a very short period of time during the summer grass does grow. Greenery does appear on the landscape. And what the natives are telling us, the Greenlanders, is that their animals can graze much longer today than their ancestors and the ancestors before them had ever reported. So this means that something dramatic has happened to the climate. 
   I was told that just 15 or 20 years ago at this time of the year people who had automobiles could drive out into the harbor and drive around to other villages along the coast of Greenland. Today, it is blue water. This is blue water. 
   Well, maybe to people who are watching they are saying, well, so the water is blue around Greenland. Well, the danger, of course, is that the fact that we are seeing a melting down of the Greenland ice sheet means that the sea levels would inevitably, unavoidably,  predictably rise; and when that happens, it means that coastal areas, including the United States, are jeopardized. 
   Now, to the Greenlanders, it means a lot of other things, all of them bad. For example, they are noticing fish coming into the waters around Greenland that are not native there. In fact, many of the people who have never left Greenland, they were born there, they fished there, they killed whales. They also, by the way, wanted to make sure that they told us that they never killed whales or caught fish for sport, that when they killed whales they did it in order to eat and survive.     
   But they say that now they are noticing large numbers of cod coming into the waters. What does that mean? It means that they are running away from the area, fish that are native to that area, because of course they are also predators. So we are finding that the entire environment is now being altered because of global warming. 
   As I mentioned earlier, they know nothing about the debate that's going on in the United States. They know nothing about the charges that this is some kind of hoax. All they know is that it's getting warmer. 
   One of the most amazing things I saw in Greenland was a fly. Now, remember that the temperature where we were was in the 20s. This is Greenland. And my wife and I go to the window and look out, and there is a fly trying to get outside. Now, as I reported that to others, they certainly shrugged their shoulders and said, yeah, that's another example of what is happening. Twenty degree weather, which means it's warmer than usual, and flies are coming around. 
   And so, Mr. Inslee, I am very pleased that you brought this matter to the floor because of its significance. And if we experience any kind of jolt to the Gulf Stream, it can alter weather throughout the Northern Hemisphere. 
   I think that all Americans should be concerned. Because it is clear from what I saw that people all over the world are concerned, perhaps much more so than we are here. People in Greenland are concerned. The 27 Nations of the EU are very concerned. 
   I was in Brussels, and they were having a presidential legislation. And as I was asking questions about the election, I was told, Mr. Speaker, that the person who won the election would be the one who convinced the public that he was greener because of the significance of this issue. If you are running for president, you've got to convince the voting public that you are aware of the climate change and that you are willing to do something about it. Unfortunately and tragically and embarrassingly, we can't say that here at home.

   Mr. CLEAVER. There is a great deal of movement toward wind energy in Missouri and in the State of Kansas. In fact, one of our colleagues who is serving here with distinction, Mr. Carnahan, has a brother, Tom Carnahan, who does this full time. He actually has a windmill farm not far outside of Kansas City, Missouri. 
   One of the things I think is extremely worth noting, particularly as the three of us speak about this subject, is that some people are nervous about discussions that we are having with regards to the changes that need to be made in this country. They falsely believe that we are going to reduce the quality of life, that we are going to damage industry. And what I have said is that if we will unleash this incredibly creative American creativity and ingenuity, that we will be able to transform our energy use in a way that we would create new jobs. 
   For example, there is a plant in China that produces most of the highly efficient light bulbs. They don't use them in China. We buy them here. And there is not a single plant in the United States that manufactures this particular light bulb. So I think we have the capacity to make alterations without damaging our economy, by not even causing a dent. 
   Let me just say that, in having had the opportunity to meet with some of the MPs in London, I found out that a bill was introduced March 13, 2007, to the Parliament.     
   Members from three of the parties were in the dialogue. They said, without any reservations, the bill is going to pass. There is no question. It is going to pass. Now, these are people who don't agree about much else. They agree on one thing, that we are in the midst of climate change, and, number two, they have to do something about it. 
   So the bill that was introduced is aimed at moving the United Kingdom to a low carbon economy. It would require a mandatory 60 percent cut in the UK's carbon emissions by 2050 compared to the base level, which was 1990, with an intermediate target of 26 to 32 percent by the year 2020. 
   The EU has also agreed to cut by 20 percent emissions by the year 2020 and by 30 percent if it is a part of an overall agreement that will include the United States. I will just say what we heard over and over again was, what is the United States going to do? The United States is the leader. 
   In Parliament, as we were talking about the need for us to work together, one of the members of Parliament became quite agitated and said to us, well, it is good you guys are coming over here talking to us about this, but we had a meeting with a Member of Congress. I am not going to call the Member's name. It is not that important. But he said, we had a meeting with a Member of the United States Congress who told us that this was a hoax. Of course, we sat there, and Speaker Pelosi, as she did throughout the trip, made sure that they understood that we were a delegation, it was a bipartisan delegation, that we were not there to cast aspersions on any of our colleagues, that we do have a deliberative body, that there are some people who have not quite caught on yet to what the rest of the world seems to have caught on to. But it is my hope, it is my prayer, that this body will realize what the rest of the world already realizes, that there is climate change and that there is no need to debate the science, only what we are going to do as a result of it.

   Mr. CLEAVER. Well, I am wondering whether or not either of you, and I don't know if you are into horror movies, and there is enough horror going on without having to watch it on television, but there is a movie starring Kurt Russell, and I imagine the movie is 15 years old, maybe older. The movie is called ``The Thing.'' It is a movie about a group of scientists and military people out in Greenland at a facility. At the end, of course, they kill this thing that has been frozen under the ice for perhaps a millennium, and the movie ends with all is well. 
   The movie was actually based on the Swiss camp which is a real camp that is out in the middle of Greenland where scientists stay out all year long measuring temperatures, measuring the melting snow. They have concluded that the temperature has risen 11 degrees over the last 10 years. 
   What happens is many of the natives who used to make money by taking tourists out on 12-day excursions on the ice can no longer do that because the ice is melting. You might go somewhere you have routinely gone, and now the ice is cracking and your dogs fall into the water, so that doesn't happen. 
   I always believe there is a solution, and I think there are a number of things, as Mr. Inslee has mentioned, with regard to capping trade, which I think is, as he said, a part of the solution. There are probably going to be a potpourri of things that we change and implement in order to bring the CO  
   2 level down. 
   But it occurred to me, because I am a United Methodist pastor in my real life, that if people believe it is the government prodding them, pushing them, maybe even beating them into changing, there will be some resistance. But if, on the other hand, they understand that one of the responsibilities of the human race is to be good stewards of the world that God made for them, then it is easier for them to look at their activities, their actions, and make modifications. 
   In the book of Genesis, we are told that the Earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof, and then God says to mankind, humankind, go out and subdue it. Now he did not say go out and undo it, but rather subdue it. 
   If you look at the word ``subdue,'' break it down, it actually means taking care of. So we have to take care of it. The good news is on this Thursday evening there is a growing phalanx of legislators in this House who believe that a change is not only necessary but that it is going to come. 
   One final thing on this, although it is not really all that related. 
   I have a mobile Fifth District office that we use in my district in and around Kansas City, Missouri. It runs on grease, and the technology is probably not as good as it will be because sometimes, if you stay in it all day, you do smell like a Big Mac. However, it is demonstrating that we can make changes and that the Congress must show the way. As opposed to having one of those big gas guzzlers, we, with great intentionality, had a van designed to use grease. 
   I have a bill which will require, if approved, that all Members of Congress who lease automobiles with taxpayer money must lease an energy efficient car. I think, as Ghandi said, we must be the changes we preach. I think Congress can show the way; and, in fact, I think Congress is showing the way.

   Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to address the House. I am excited to be a Democrat. I always take pleasure in giving reasons for why I am a member of the Democratic Party. 
   Since taking control of Congress, Democrats have worked to pass legislation that will help families once again live the American Dream. Over the last 6 years, college costs have shot up 40 percent, putting higher education out of reach for most Americans. I have one son in college today, and I can tell you I am excited over the fact that we passed, and the President did, in fact, sign the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007. This law is the single largest increase in college aid since the GI Bill. It strengthens the middle class by cutting interest rates in half and subsidizes student loans over the next 5 years. We are also able, in this bill, to increase the maximum Pell Grant scholarships by $500. 
   Madam Speaker, I am pleased and I am excited to be a Democrat.

   Mr. CLEAVER. Thank you. The problem with that, and I appreciate your interest in this issue, and I am sure you probably are not aware of the fact that in New Orleans there are 36,000 participants in TANF. All but 5,000 are children; all but 5,000 are children. This legislation is saying we want children to volunteer 20 hours a week in order to receive assistance. 
   In addition to that, we are spending about $5 billion a week in Iraq, and we are building housing, but we are not requiring Iraqis to volunteer in order to be the recipients of the largesse of the American taxpayers. 
   The assumption here is that the people don't need to work and so they somehow have to be coerced into working. As a former resident of public housing, there is a new issue arising, and that is that many of the people in public housing are elderly.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CLEAVER. The point I was trying to make earlier was that, actually, the fact that this is not a welfare reform bill, this is about aiding people in a distressed area. 
   If we are talking about TANF recipients, it is important to understand that in the State of Louisiana, 5,000 TANF recipients are adults, and the bulk of them are children. In Mississippi, 8 percent of them are adults, and the rest of the 32,270 are children. And I think that we have gone awry converting a bill aimed at providing relief for people who are hurting down in the deepest parts of who they are and trying to impose a welfare rights bill on them when we have not done it in any other crisis in the history of this Republic. It is not the right thing to do to say to people that, in the midst of your struggle, in the midst of you trying to rebuild your home, rekindle your belief in the Nation, that we are going to now require that you volunteer.

   Mr. CLEAVER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the fact that this Congress is taking some action. And if this cause is just, it will eventually triumph, in spite of all of the deaths, disease, doubts and disappointments. If this cause is just, and I believe that it is, it will eventually triumph, in spite of all of the rapes, all of the apathy, all of the cynicism, and all of the ``look the other way'' by nations in the region and, in fact, around the world. 
   This tragedy in Darfur shows that genocide is better at abolishing people than people are at abolishing genocide. One speaker earlier mentioned the Balkans. And so genocide is not new. This is not new. The main reason history repeats itself is because the world didn't pay attention the first time. And it seems to me that this provides us with an opportunity to stand up any time we begin to see that genocide is occurring anywhere around this planet. 
   In the war of right and wrong, the United States of America, and certainly this Congress, cannot afford to be neutral. Some businesses in the United States and around the world are probably like a catsup bottle. We may need to slap them on the bottoms a few times to get them moving. I think this legislation will, in fact, do that; and I commend the sponsors and the chairman and the ranking member of our committee, as well as Ms. Lee from California, for standing up and making sure that when the United States can make an impact in the world, we, in fact, do.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CLEAVER. I thank the gentleman from Virginia. 
   Mr. Speaker, one of the first individuals I met when I was elected to Congress was JO ANN DAVIS. I actually met her, along with the gentleman from Virginia, at our prayer breakfast and immediately had the opportunity to get to know her and to work with her. I sat beside her on each Thursday; and over the course of a year, we got a chance to know each other and began to tease each other, play with each other, have fun with each other, and then we ended up as the cochairs of the prayer breakfast for this past year. 
   On the night before the prayer breakfast, I was called in my apartment and told that Congresswoman Davis was not feeling well enough for us to jointly lead the prayer breakfast. I knew of her physical problems, and so I knew that things had to have gotten worse, but I had the opportunity to say to her something that I really, really feel strongly about. My goal is not to hate a single individual, and I get up each morning with a goal of not even trying to resemble, in my actions, something that would be related to hate. 
   But I told her, and I will say it here, I hate cancer, I hate it. I have seen it wreak havoc in the lives of men and women almost all of my life. 
   When JO ANN tried to come back to Congress, this body that she loved, I was able to go over and sit down beside her. I wasn't going to have a gloomy conversation. She said, you know, you don't recognize me, do you, because I have lost so much weight. We had a relationship where we could tease each other, and I kept in contact with her office staff and the prayer breakfast. As the gentleman from Virginia and the gentleman from Tennessee will recall, we sent flowers to her about 3  months ago, which she was very thankful for. 
   But I would like to say this, JO ANN DAVIS and I didn't agree on a lot of things politically; but we were able to sit together, talk together, eat breakfast together, eat lunch together and enjoy this world together. If there is anything I think we ought to be able to remember about her, I think it is in spite of political differences, ideological differences, this woman from Virginia, this tiny woman, was able to put all that aside in terms of personal relationships. 
   Thank you for this opportunity to share my thoughts about one of my colleagues, someone I cared a lot about.

   Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Chairman, I want to first express appreciation to the ranking member and the maker of this motion for spending time down in New Orleans with the committee at Dillard University and then going over into Mississippi. I think it was very important for the people of Mississippi to see Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle coming into that devastated region, expressing concern and interested in putting forth legislation to help them out of something that has devastated their lives, yet they are not responsible for. 
   I have got to oppose the gentleman from Texas' amendment. Let me just say that there are good and decent people who are poor. That is about the only thing good I can say about poverty.     
   I know it personally. We are on a first-name basis. I grew up with poverty. I know it well. And so I had a clear picture of what happened after Katrina and Rita. 
   Only one in six New Orleanians owns an automobile. One in six. That means that this city is a city of poverty. And when you think about the individuals at the Dome begging for help, probably 95 to 98 percent of them had no automobiles. 
   My son was in New Orleans when the flood hit, a student at Dillard University. He had an automobile, and even with an automobile, he had difficulty getting out of New Orleans, ended up spending the night on a Wal-Mart parking lot. But he had a car, and he was able to get out. 
   This is a very, very poor city. We are told that the poor shall be with us always, but then there is a transition word: ``unless.'' And the ``unless'' is something that I think this bill addresses. Unless men and women are willing to do what is necessary to enable people who are in poverty to escape. 
   One of the things that this amendment does not take into account, for example, is 202 housing. I know the program well. I served as mayor of Kansas City. We did about 10 section 202 projects during my administration. 
   Section 202 projects are designed to accommodate the elderly. In some instances HUD has allowed for 202 housing to be used by people who suffer from extremely difficult ailments, physical problems. So the people who live in 202 are either elderly, certified already as elderly with low income or no income, or they suffer from some malady, some physical, maybe even mental, malady. If this amendment is approved, it would mean that the people who are elderly and poor who were displaced from their 202 housing and are now living with a relative someplace or in some temporary housing, they end up being punished again because this means that there would be no opportunity for them to even return to the conditions under which they lived. 
   These are not people who are somehow refusing to work or people who somehow don't want to find permanent housing. This was, in fact, permanent housing. Section 202 housing is permanent housing. And if you look at the HUD statistics, you will find that people who leave 202 housing generally leave it for the funeral home. They die in 202 housing. These are the elderly, and this Congress should exercise all the care we can conjure to take care of the poor and the elderly, particularly those living in section 202 housing. 
   Now, my hope is that the gentleman from Texas would consider in his amendment, even though I would still oppose it for other reasons, at least eliminating 202 elderly housing. 
   Additionally, HUD has a program, 811 housing, for the disabled. The same thing would apply for the disabled. These are people who lost housing because of Katrina and Rita, and then they end up being told, if this amendment were to pass, that they still will not be helped even to return to the conditions under which they lived prior to the flood, even if those conditions were not at the highest living standard. The disabled are all just saying, we want to return to where we lived. And, yes, it is permanent housing. It is not temporary. It was designed by HUD and approved by Congress as permanent housing. Sections 811 and 202 are permanent housing projects. We cannot do additional damage to the elderly and the poor. 
   Now, I think one of the things that we need to consider here as well is that this amendment would strike 1,200 vouchers to families who actually need them. And during our committee debate, I think the gentleman and the ranking member will remember that there was a discussion about substitute language, a compromise, if you will, using the word ``sunset.'' And if we had used the word ``sunset,'' and if it had been placed in the language of the bill, perhaps that would have satisfied Members on the other side who have difficulty with the term ``disappearing vouchers.'' But that is exactly what would happen. That would be a sunset on the vouchers when they are no longer needed. 
   Striking 1,200 vouchers from families who need them is very, very wrong. It certainly is unintentional in terms of wreaking havoc on those families, but that is exactly what would happen if this amendment is approved. Its impact would only hurt families who need the housing assistance. 
   Now, the one thing I would like to leave in terms of what I hope can happen from this discussion today is that if we are unwilling or unable to continue assistance for previously, previously federally assisted individuals and families in public housing section 8, 202 or 811 projects for the disabled, we are going to do immense damage and hurt families who don't deserve to be hurt further. 
   If you can imagine living in a 202 housing project and realizing that you are never going to live in your dream home. There is no such thing as sitting down one day with an architect and designing your dream home. It won't happen. If you live in a 202 or an 811 HUD project, you are already in nirvana. That is as far as you are going to go. And we cannot tell those residents that they cannot return to those living conditions. 
   The point I am trying to make, and perhaps poorly, is that we are hurting people who would have no other way of living. And if you are opposed to permanent housing, you are opposed to the 202 program not only in New Orleans, but all around this country. In every major city in the country there is at least one, and perhaps several, 202 project, and in every community there is at least one 811 project. And if it is wrong in New Orleans, it is wrong anywhere and everywhere. 
   My hope, to the gentleman who has proposed the amendment, is that you withdraw the amendment and express appreciation for the debate, acknowledge that you were trying desperately to make sure that we don't overspend any taxpayer money that we don't have to expend. And I will lead a delegation from this side to congratulate the maker of this amendment for a valiant effort to do the right thing that is  not quite as right as, in his heart, he would like for it to be.

   Mr. CLEAVER. First of all, Mr. Speaker, let me thank the committee and the work that has been done by Chairman Davis. All nine members of the Missouri delegation joined together to support this concurrent resolution. 
   As I think all people in this Nation know, Harry Truman was from Independence, Missouri, a part of the district that I currently represent, and we are very, very pleased and proud that Harry Truman not only rose to become President of the United States in 1948, but he contributed to our community in a number of ways. 
   And his daughter, Margaret Truman Daniel, was not a person who had her sights on becoming an individual in Washington who would garner a great deal of attention, but it was bestowed on her. And when her father chose to run for President, she actually traveled around with him on the ``Whistlestop'' campaign.     
   Once he became President, she did all of the things that the offspring of Presidents will in fact do. But she had more to offer than just being the President's daughter. She ended up being a great singer. She performed at the Metropolitan Opera, she was on the old ``Ed Sullivan Show,'' and then eventually had her own television show in Philadelphia, a daily show in Philadelphia. 
   She was such a factor in our community that on February 23, my colleague from Missouri, IKE SKELTON, and I, along with all the members of the Truman family, buried her at the Harry Truman Library, alongside her parents in Independence, Missouri. 
   And so it is my hope that Congress can make its expression of support of Margaret Truman Daniel by passing this concurrent resolution.

Of course, if they are talking about the war, which most Americans want ended, they are right. If they are referring back to the Terri Schiavo incident, they are right.

   Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, it really troubles me that the United States is borrowing money from China to buy oil from Saudi Arabia to put in cars from Japan.  
   We have been working hard to pass legislation that will bring down prices at the pump and help America end its dependence on foreign oil. 
   We signed into law the first vehicle fuel efficiency standards in three decades which will save drivers approximately $1,000 a year. We passed an historic commitment to American biofuels which are keeping gas prices 15 percent lower than they would be otherwise. And House Democrats pressured Mr. Bush to stop sending oil to the government reserve, which put more oil on the market to fight rising gas prices. 
   This Democratic-led Congress has also passed legislation to curb excess speculation to prevent price gouging and to expand tax incentives for renewable energy. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time for us to stop being partisan and try to move toward progress.

<DOCNO>Mr. CLEAVER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5244, CREDIT CARDHOLDERS' BILL OF RIGHTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, this credit card bill is extremely important, and I would like to just express appreciation to my colleague for having the vision to bring it forth. 
   People all over the country, the majority of the people around this country, are concerned about what is happening to them with regard to credit cards. I think that this is a week in which we need to all be concerned about what the consumers are feeling. In particular, I'm interested in the fact that we were not, at least in terms of statute, prohibiting what could happen to underage consumers. 
   In our committee, I produced a letter received by a 15-year-old boy offering him a credit card. The father of that boy works here on the Hill and brought the letter to the committee. 
   This bill, if approved, would provide that no credit card may be knowingly issued to or open-end credit plan established on behalf of a consumer who has not attained the age of 18 unless the consumer is emancipated under applicable State law. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have, in this country, right now over a billion credit cards. We have young people going to  college receiving credit cards. We had testimony before our committee that in colleges, the administration will quite often allow credit card companies to come in on enrollment day. They offer the students a sandwich at one of the local fast food restaurants in exchange for them applying for a credit card. This has got to stop. 
   China has almost a 22 percent savings rate. The United States is negative .6. We are training our kids to go off to college where that is becoming increasingly expensive and then go out and get a credit card without having any source of income. 
   This has to stop, and I would like to commend my colleague for introducing this legislation and for doing things that I think the public expects us to do as elected officials.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Chairman, it is my hope that we won't have to use the entire 5 minutes in the interest of time. 
   This is a simple but commonsense amendment to this bill, because it will require of Members of this body to do the exact same thing that we are requiring of Federal agencies, and that is for any Member who is using his or her Members' Representational Allowance to lease an automobile, that they would be required to lease the exact same kinds of vehicles, those that are alternative fuels when available, that we are requiring of Federal agencies. 
   This amendment is designed for a demonstration to the public that we are serious about energy independence and that we are also going to lead by example. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Chairman, there are about 100 Members of the United States Congress who lease automobiles. And we are requiring, as of 1997, through a mandate from President Clinton, that all vehicles operating under the aegis of the General Services Administration operate with flex-fuel vehicles. 
   So what we are saying here is that we are willing to require that Federal agencies change their fleets, but that we are not willing to change our fleets. If those vehicles create confusion for us with regard to whether or not they are alternative-fuel vehicles, then we have to stop this entire program because we are already using the language of this amendment as we are requiring other vehicles throughout the Federal Government to use. 
   I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Waxman), the chairman of the committee.

   Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Chairman, one of the problems that we have as a body at this time is that the people around the country are constantly observing us and looking at us in ways that are negative because we want to pass laws to impose on everybody except us. 
   If we are going to declare that we are moving toward energy independence, then the Members of the Congress using taxpayer dollars ought to be willing to give up big Cadillacs in order to lease an energy-efficient car. 
   The Speaker of the House, just to make a point, did, in fact, request an energy-efficient vehicle. Security, as they should have, said that they were not going to compromise security. 
   But this late legislation does not even approach those who have security. This says, Members who use their MRA. The Speaker, the majority leader, the minority leaders don't use their MRA. These are vehicles leased by the House of Representatives. 
   We cannot continue to try to lead the Nation in a direction that we won't lead first. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge all the Members to vote to allow Congress to take the lead in moving toward energy independence.

<DOCNO>Mr. CLEAVER. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, let me, first of all, say that, for the most part, this discussion has gone on without name calling, although it has happened once today, and so I want to start out by saying, I am coming to this floor to make a point, and not an accusation. 
   It is important for me to say because there are words used here, morality and moral and ethical, and in the last election, in my State, the word religion was used with this discussion because stem cell research was on the ballot. 
   I want to say very clearly, there is no conflict between religion and science. There was a man by the name of Paul who visited Turkey, and while in a city called Ephesus, he learned the people, went back and wrote a letter to them. And he said, ``Now Glory be to God who, by his mighty power at work within us, is able to do far more than we would ever dare to ask or even dream of, infinitely beyond our highest prayers, desires thoughts or hopes.'' 
   Science is but another word for hope. And hope stands on tippy toes looking for healing, looking for cures, searching for the ideal. 
   I will not be a hopeless pessimist. I realize that whenever we are able to use the scientific advancements, that we are not becoming the enemies of faith, but rather it is another way to praise God and his constantly evolving creation. 
   Now, there was a great Baptist clergyman by the name of Harry Emerson Fosdick, and in his book, ``The Modern Use of the Bible,'' he says, ``If there are fresh things to learn concerning the physical universe, let us have them, that we may find deeper meaning when we say `The heavens declare the glory of God.' '' 
   Now, it is my hope that we will not be as troglodytic as our ancestors who refused to peer through the lens of Galileo's telescope; that we are men and women who will do every single thing we can to bring about whatever we can, within our human powers, to cure the beastly diseases that wreak havoc in the lives of Americans and people all over this country. 
   Should science succeed in fulfilling the much vaunted optimism expressed by advocates of stem cell therapy, much of the credit should go to the community of faith.  
   Because I accept the Holy Bible as the inspired and interminable Word of God, I consider myself to be a Christian fundamentalist. I accept, as an inseparable component of my faith, the omnipotence, omnipresence, and omniscience of God. Therefore, I am baffled by my fellow fundamentalists who seem to be utterly opposed to and terror-stricken by the advancement of science, including stem-cell research. The propagation of knowledge and the dismantling of the boundless awe-inspiring mysteries of God's world are viewed by some in our faith as a foreboding foray toward undermining and diminishing the glory of the Creator. However, the opposite is true. When the human intellect makes strides that sets the world agog, it is God, from whom all knowledge stems, who is honored. Let us keep in mind that scientific advancement is not an enemy of faith, but yet another way to praise God and His constantly evolving creation. 
   Contemporary men and women of faith, as always, stand at the crossroads. In a real sense, religion has always been impelled to wage war in some area or another. The pressing question is shall we march across the battlefields of faith with open arms toward the magnificent revelations of God's great truths, or, do we use our inherent power and influence to signal a retreat from the bright and simmering sunshine of expanding scientific scholarship. The potential life-saving issue of stem cell research is before us. The scepter is in the hands of the enlightened community of believers. Our failure to speak out on the medical need for stem-cell research will allow earnest but erroneous or misguided souls who wish to constrain such study to force us back to a time when the faithful waged its fiery finger of scorn at the irreverence of scientific inquiry. Like the majority of people of faith, I totally reject the notion that today's community of believers are as troglodytic as our ancestors who refused to peer through the lens of Galileo's telescope. Nonetheless, this is a testing time. 
   Doctor Harry Emerson Fosdick, the legendary Baptist clergyman of the first half of the 20th century, profoundly addresses the issue of flowering faith in his wonderfully inspiring book, The Modern Use of the Bible: ``If there are fresh things to learn concerning the physical universe, let us have them, that we may find deeper meaning when we say, `The heavens declare the glory of God.' '' 
   Should science succeed in fulfilling the much vaunted optimism expressed by advocates of stem-cell therapy, much of the credit should go to the community of faith. Every experiment that leads to greater medical breakthroughs is a discernible display of the earthly presence of God and of the presence of particles of His divinity in us.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I am sure that people around the country have been wondering what was going on here for the past couple of days. My concern is that the people in Missouri's 5th District are quite concerned about homeland security and many of the issues that we must resolve. 
   For example, there has been a delay on the construction of a fence on our southern border. If this were in a court, it would be called obstruction of construction. It is a problem that is being caused by this unnecessary delay initiated by the other party. 
   This is a good bill. It had bipartisan support in the Appropriations Committee, but leaders on the other side of the aisle are choosing to delay things with political games. And so my hope is that from this day forward that both sides will work together to get a solid Homeland Security bill approved, as the American public deserves.

<DOCNO>Mr. CLEAVER. (SHAREHOLDER VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Chairman, today I rise in support of H.R. 1257, the Shareholder Vote on Executive Compensation Act. I think that it has been going on far too long where shareholders and, frankly, the American people, have had to pay for services not rendered and jobs not performed well. 
   The chairman of our committee, Chairman Frank, has already spoken about Mr. Nardelli. There are others, Pfizer's Henry McKinnell, and he also received a $200 million, $200 million exit package in spite of the fact that his performance was poor. KB Home, former CEO, Bruce Karatz, could collect $175 million despite his involvement in backdating stock options at the company. Some CEOs were, in fact, undeserving of compensation packages they received. This is not fair. 
   The one that I think troubles most Americans the most is Lee Raymond, former CEO of ExxonMobil. During our committee hearing, I raised this issue with our panel to ask if they had any problems with the compensation package for Mr. Raymond. He received a $400 million pay and retirement deal as the prices of gasoline soared and millions of hardworking Americans going to the pump every single day are paying more and more money for gas. 
   Twelve years ago, when Mr. Raymond became the CEO of Exxon, the average price of gasoline was $1.02 a gallon. In June, 2006, when he retired, the price, the average price of gasoline was $2.96 a gallon. Yet he received $400 million in retirement. The people who are watching this debate, the overwhelming majority, will say to themselves, that is not right. 
   Now, during the same period of time that the CEO of ExxonMobil was building up for this great exit package, real wages for the average American worker actually declined. While I believe deeply in, and that prosperity is as American as apple pie, I don't believe that we should reward CEOs for doing a poor job. 
   So I want to thank committee Chairman Frank and our ranking member, Spencer Bachus, and the members of the Financial Services Committee for bringing this bill forward to the floor today. I cosponsored this legislation, I voted for it in committee, and I will be voting for it when it comes to the floor. 
   Now, the sad thing about this legislation is that many hardworking Americans get up each day and go to work. If they perform poorly, they lose their job, and they certainly will not get an exit package that will take care of them and most of the people in their cities for life, $400 million. 
   I would ask the people watching this program, do you have a problem with that? The answer, I think, is echoing all around this country. Yes, I have a problem with that. 
   This bill enables shareholders to express their views on their company's executive compensation practices without setting up caps on the size and nature of executive pay. This legislation requires only, only, that public companies include on their proxy statements to shareholders, an annual nonbinding, nonbinding, nonbinding advisory shareholder vote on the company's executive compensation disclosures, which are already required by the SEC, and an additional nonbinding advisory vote if the company awards a new, not already disclosed, golden parachute while negotiating the purchase or sale of the company. The nonbinding advisory vote will give shareholders an opportunity, an opportunity to express themselves. 
   They can say ``yes'' or ``no'' to the proposed executive compensation without diminishing, reducing, interfering with the board's legal authority.     
   Ultimately, if a CEO is doing a good job, I am sure that that CEO will receive the support of that company's shareholders and the appropriate compensation package. That is the way America operates. But what is going on now is an abomination that we will allow people to run a company into the ground and then walk away set, not only for life for themselves but five or six generations to come.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, we are all concerned about the troops. I am extremely concerned about the troops when they return home. 
   On this past Saturday, June 23, I visited the 14th annual Kansas City Stand Down. This is a 2-day event, and it opened up in Kansas City on Truman Road, the road that Harry Truman's  house sits on. It was open to homeless veterans. It provided a variety of services. This event is an opportunity for Americans to help Americans, Americans giving respect and dignity to their veterans who are down on their luck and in many cases homeless. 
   It is believed there are approximately 1,800 homeless veterans in Kansas City, Missouri's largest city. This year 800 homeless veterans attended the Stand Down and received assistance from 500 volunteers. It was a wonderful opportunity to meet and visit with veterans who proudly served the United States of America, and I want to also say at this time it was a proud opportunity for me to thank the volunteers who forfeited their time to make a difference. 
   One of the most popular contributors was Big Bubba's Barbecue, who fed a delicious barbecue lunch to over 700 people on Saturday. Grants were provided by Best Buy, At Home America, and the U.S. Department of Labor. These grants, combined with donations and countless volunteer hours, ensured that the Stand Down would be able to provide the necessary assistance to our homeless veterans. 
   When a homeless veteran arrives, they know that they will be greeted with respect and provided with shelter, shoes, showers, haircuts, blankets, clothing and hygiene products. Each veteran is given medical health screenings, eye care, dental care and if the veteran does not have identification, they are provided with a picture ID, assistance with legal problems, VA benefit counseling, general benefits counseling, including Social Security, food stamps, local health and human services, substance abuse counseling, mental health counseling, employment services which include job referrals, employment counseling, as well as housing services. 
   I wish the entire Nation could have seen Kansas City turn out to pay respect to their veterans and to provide them with care. I truly appreciate and congratulate the Vet Center, AmeriCorps Vista volunteers and the Stand Down steering committee for a job well done. If this is done all over America the way it was done in the Fifth District of Missouri, our veterans will know that we really do care.

I have five pastors. All of them are Methodists, and they are paid with Methodist dollars. Each one of them. They are paid out of the stewardship of the church, and I have the right to do that. But I don't have the right to accept Federal dollars and discriminate. 
   Minorities have come to Washington over the years because this was the seat of power and it was believed that if you could get close to the seat of power, freedom would be more available. The same thing holds true with dollars. People go to work for the Federal Government, and if they see dollars going to a Head Start program, they believe automatically that there will be no discrimination. And we should not, we should not, turn it around now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, when Congresswoman Tubbs discovered that I had three sons who had gone to college on basketball scholarships, she asked if I would bring them here for the annual fund-raising basketball game with the Georgetown Law School faculty. None of them could come this year; so I was drafted by Stephanie Tubbs Jones in language that I would normally not use during a sermon. But I did show up and immediately became angry because she pulled me out of the game just because I could not make it down the court in a minute in the transition game. So I cheered for the remainder of the evening for our team that Congresswoman Sheila Jackson-Lee mentioned did win in overtime. 
   But the most significant moment for me came when we all saw the signs that the pages had made for us. They were cheering us on. And the pages sent me a statement that they asked if I would read on their behalf. And I quote: 
   ``Ask any one of the pages from the spring 2008 class to list their favorite memories from the 5 months we spent working on the hill, an anecdote about Ms. Stephanie Tubbs Jones will likely be included. For some of us it is the unwavering charisma shown when she was the Speaker pro tempore. For others it is the simple act of coming to say good-bye to us at our departure ceremony. For most of us, it is the night of the 2008 home court charity basketball game, where our chants cheering on the Hill's Angels team and the Coach Tubbs Jones rang 10 times louder than the formidable Georgetown students cheering section and led our team to a surprising victory. 
   That night and for the rest of the time we knew Ms. Tubbs Jones, we weren't just pages sitting in the back of the House. We experienced that night the true strength, pride, and enthusiasm of Stephanie Tubbs Jones, a strength rooted in her devotion to making things better, a pride in her job as a public servant evident every single day, and an unmatched enthusiasm for our service as pages. She was the type of woman you only dream of meeting at some point in your life and the friend we never expected to find in the halls of Congress last spring. 
   ``Just as we will never forget our time as pages, we will never forget Stephanie Tubbs Jones. 
   ``The spring 2008 page class.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, Stephanie Tubbs Jones was my friend. We had the opportunity to spend time together, and I don't want to reminisce and say things that others have already said. Let me just say that I hate death. I hate it. And if I had an opportunity to erase it or kill it, I would. But death, unfortunately, is a part of life and we will all experience it. The issue is not death so much as it is life, and we are granted an unspecified period of time, and many of us deal with those moments with a kind of carelessness that certainly was not planned when we were given our time on this Earth. 
   Stephanie Tubbs Jones was exuberant. She lived her life. She lived it out to the fullest. And I can say that if you understand that life is not a time to just waste and then look at the time of Stephanie Tubbs Jones, you know she understood that. And I would say that death is not a cul-de-sac for some. It's not an end. Death is a beginning. And for Stephanie Tubbs Jones, it was a comma for a new beginning. She lived her life and she lived it with zest and zeal. 
   She pulled me in Kansas City on the dance floor in front of hundreds of people and made me dance. I have a photograph of that that I had been hiding that I am now going to bring out with pride because I think when she did that, she was also saying live your life and live it to the fullest. Never ever allow cobwebs to cover you. If you rest, you rust. Stephanie Tubbs Jones never rusted.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, normally we come to this floor to debate, and quite often in our Special Orders we have the opportunity to speak in positive tones about positive things that are going on in our district or in our Nation. 
   I am very proud to represent Missouri's Fifth Congressional District. It is the district that encompasses Independence, Missouri, and the home of Harry Truman. In this Fifth District, I am proud that the fastest growing city in the State of Missouri is not the two largest cities, Kansas City being the largest, St. Louis being the second largest, but it is a city that many people have not even heard of. It is called Lee's Summit. 
   Lee's Summit, Missouri is exploding with growth. Its mayor, Karen Messerli, is doing a fantastic job. The downtown area is being redeveloped. But what I want to zero in on this evening is Lee's Summit West High School. 
   Madam Speaker, this high school has achieved something that I don't believe can be matched by any other congressional district. So far this year, from September to December, they have won three State 4A championships. The girls volleyball team won the State championship coached by Mark Rice. The girls cross country won the 4A State championship coached by Dave Denny. And then, just recently the Titans football team coached by Royce Boehm won the 4A Missouri State championship and went through the entire season undefeated. 
   I was listening to Judge Poe earlier talk about some tragedies in Iraq. And I sat here, and it caused me to tremble to think about what that young woman must have gone through; and it also caused me to renew my commitment to focus on the positive attributes of our young people. If you visit Lee's Summit High School, which has been in existence only 4 years, 4 years, and it has already become one of the most prominent schools in the State of Missouri, not just for athletics, but because this school is well organized. Their population, 1,300 students, is constantly growing. The principal of that school, Cindy Bateman, is doing a fabulous job. They are achieving academically. And I am so proud to be able to stand on this floor tonight and speak without qualification about how fabulously this school is performing. 
   Most of the time, girls' athletics are ignored. And so in the Missouri 4A volleyball championship, probably there are people even around in Lee's Summit who are unaware of the fact that that State championship has been won. The cross country club normally would be ignored, but they have achieved something positive. They brought some positive attention to that school. 
   And so, on this night, I would not only like to lift them up and express how proud I am to represent that particular area, but I would also encourage any Member of the United States  Congress who serves a district where a school has won three State championships thus far this year to let me know it, and I will give them a huge box of Gates barbecue. Kansas City, of course, is the barbecue capital of the galaxy, and I will gladly bring that barbecue in from Gates Barbecue in Kansas City. But I am not even worried, because I am absolutely certain that there is no school in the United States that has won three State championships in 4 months. 
   I know that there are other people who are proud of their districts, and I am pleased that they are proud of their district, they are proud of their schools. And some people stand up and brag about their districts, and some people are actually telling the truth. But I want to go on record tonight as saying that the entire country can be proud of what has happened in this community, because the entire community has rallied to build this magnificent physical structure that is the school, and I appreciate very much the opportunity to share this with the Congress.

   Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I was home last week, and although there was a great deal of discussion about gas prices, still the number one issue among the people of my district in Missouri is the military action in Iraq. And one of the things they are confused about is the fact that this is the most unpopular war in the history of our Republic and yet nothing seems to change. Over 70 percent of the American public is against the war, and we continue to travel down the same road over and over again. 
   One of the reasons I believe we have two ears and just one mouth is that we are to listen more than we speak. Therefore, it seems to me that the people of this country are speaking but we are simply not listening. 
   It is my hope that all blank checks and rubber stamps will be put away. And while we are waiting to discuss this, the Democrats are moving forward with our commitment to make serious changes in Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I very proudly stand here today to recommend the Reverend Dr. Wallace S. Hartsfield, a minister in the Fifth Congressional District, which I very proudly serve, be given the honor of having a postal facility named in his honor at 4320 Blue Parkway in Kansas City, Missouri. All nine members of the Missouri delegation have signed on to this bill, and they signed on for one real reason. It is this: 
   Rev. Hartsfield is an American story. He was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on November 12 in 1929. He was raised by his mother. He was the only child and yet she worked and struggled and pushed him. He eventually graduated from high school and then served a 3-year tour of duty with the United States Army. He returned to this country and attended Clark College, which is now called Clark Atlanta University. He received a bachelor's degree, and then he went on to receive a Master's of Divinity at Gammon Theological Seminary, which is known as the Interdenominational Theological Seminary today. He's received a number of honorary doctorate degrees, and he is recognized in our community as a man who is always going to be where something good is happening. 
   He has been a strong worker in the field of diversity. He is a man who has been able to bring the clergy together from across racial and even religious lines. He's known as the dean of preachers in our community, and I dubbed him the ``Godfather of Preachers'' because of the respect he receives from members of the clergy. Anytime anything in our community is going on that is productive and meaningful, you can expect to see Rev. Wallace S. Hartsfield present. 
   This postal designation is the first I've ever introduced, and one of the reasons that I feel strongly about this is the post office delivers mail to everyone, and if you look at the life and work of the Reverend Wallace S. Hartsfield, that is exactly what he's done. He has delivered ministry, friendship and civic concern to everyone in our community, and so a post office, I think, is very, very appropriate to bear his name. 
   And so, Madam Speaker, it would be my hope that this body would allow our community to celebrate fully his retirement at a November 9 banquet, during which time I would like to proudly announce that the United States Congress has named a post office in his honor.

   Mr. Speaker, had I been present for rollcall vote 252, Supporting the mission and goals of National Crime Victims' Rights Week in order to increase public awareness of the rights, needs, and concerns of victims and survivors of crime in the United States during such week and throughout the year, I would have voted ``yea.''

   Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to stand here on this floor. 
   The subject of this special hour will be a debate between myself and the gentlewoman from West Virginia, Mrs. Capito. But before we begin our debate, which is aimed primarily at demonstrating to our colleagues that we can speak passionately about a matter and still avoid name calling or irreverence or incivility, before we get into our debate on tort reform, I would like to yield to the gentlewoman from West Virginia for some special comments unrelated to our debate.

   Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to associate myself with the comments of the gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. Capito). I too would like to express sympathy to Ms. Millender-McDonald's family and to the families of those young people whose lives were senselessly taken at Virginia Tech. 
   The issue surfaces from time to time that there is a desperate need for us to do something major legislatively for tort reform, that these greedy trial lawyers are out damaging if not destroying the Nation, running people out of the medical profession, creating economic problems for oil companies. I take a different view of that. Obviously, there are inappropriate lawsuits, and I think the courts usually deal with those. 
   But trial lawyers work to provide somewhat of a level playing field for most Americans, small Americans, so they can hold even the most powerful corporations accountable for their actions when they cause injury or death. 
   Today drug companies and oil companies, big insurance companies and large corporations too often dominate our political process and they begin to ask legislators to restrict access to the courts. When corporations and CEOs act irresponsibly by refusing or delaying to pay insurance claims, producing unsafe products, polluting our environment or swindling their employees or shareholders, the last resort for Americans, and this is our system, is to hold them accountable in our courts of law. By holding them accountable, trial lawyers and their families are able to feel that this is a safer America. 
   From automobile fuel tanks that explode in rear-end collisions to bulletproof vests that fail to stop bullets aimed at police officers, we have to realize that there must be some corporation, some individual held accountable. And these cases that I mentioned earlier were actual cases and they brought to light deceptive practices and cover-ups by manufacturers that resulted in serious injury and even death. 
   The civil justice system helps provide compensation to those that are injured and helps prevent other needless injury from occurring. 
   I will now yield to the gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. Capito).

   Mr. CLEAVER. I think there are perhaps some legitimate concerns by small business owners, but I don't think that the trouble is with the litigation. I think the problem is with insurance companies. Now, the gentlewoman and I both serve on the Financial Services Committee; and one of the concerns we have been grappling with, particularly in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the gulf coast, is that insurance companies that are not regulated by the United States Federal Government from time to time are the culprits, and I will get back to that in just a minute. But I wanted to say that the tort filings in State courts have declined by 10 percent since 1994. And automobile filings which make up the majority of tort claims have fallen 14 percent.  
   So what you are finding is that more and more cases are not finding their way into the courts. But what troubles me and I think will trouble Americans when they find out more about it is the fact that the insurance companies end up really being the beneficiaries in the debate that occurs from time to time in this country on the subject of tort reform. The reason I say that is that there was a study done that showed that even in States where tort reform occurred, insurance premiums never dropped, and in some instances they actually increased. 
   So we have a problem with the small businesses that I agree exists, but I am suggesting that one of the ways in which we deal with this problem is not trying to restrict the courts from dealing with the claims that people bring before them, but rather for the insurance companies. 
   Let me give one example, Mr. Speaker. A month after passing malpractice caps, South Carolina's two largest insurers increased rates by as much as 22 percent after increasing their rates by 27 percent the year before. 
   And after Texas passed rate caps in 2003, the Joint Underwriters Association requested a 35 percent premium increase for physicians and 68 percent for hospitals. This is after tort reform, after things were supposed to have been reformed so that people are protected. So the winner ends up being the insurance companies.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CLEAVER. I think, to some degree, that helps my position, not with West Virginia because I am not familiar with West Virginia, but you are absolutely right about my home State of Missouri. But it all relates back to my earlier comments about insurance companies. 
   A national study conducted in 2005 by former Missouri Insurance Commissioner Jay Angoff found that insurance companies have been price-gouging doctors by dramatically and drastically raising their insurance premiums, even though claims for payments have been flat or decreasing. According to the annual statements of 15 large insurance companies, the 15th largest in fact, the amount malpractice insurers collected in premiums increased by 120.2 percent between 2000 and 2004, while claim payouts rose by only 5.7 percent. 
   I think if you look at the report from Jay Angoff from the Missouri Insurance Commission, you find that clearly the insurance companies are the ones doing enormous damage to this country. 
   The other issue is that I think the insurance companies have gouged so much that many of the people in the country, probably even in my home State, operate under the assumption that malpractice costs run physicians away from their profession. 
   The truth of the matter is that, according to the American Medical Association, the number of physicians in the United States of America increased by 40 percent since 1990, 40 percent. And so more and more men and women are going into the profession, even as the insurance companies are creating this crisis, and they are the ones that seem to be held harmless. They are rarely the center of the debate. It is usually the lawyers and the physicians. 
   I take the position that neither of them are actually the villains here. It is the insurance companies that continue to increase the rates. They pay out less money in the payments and then they are getting fatter and fatter. 
   One last comment on this. According to the Bush administration's Justice Department, if I can find their study, the Justice Department actually says that we are dropping in the number of cases that are being brought forward in the courts, and so I think what we end up doing, I think, is fighting a ghost, because the insurance companies have become ghostly in that they can become invisible during the debate because they do not have to get in it because they have not been portrayed as either the victim or the villain. So I would suggest that our positions may not be dramatically different except that I see the problem more in the hands of the insurance companies.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CLEAVER. The gentlewoman from West Virginia makes a good point. I do, however, think that this may cause her to join me. That is, according to the Bush administration, this is what I was looking for earlier, this is from the Justice Department of the Bush administration, their researchers found that the median inflated adjusted award in 2001 was just $28,000. And most of the discussion, you hear people talking about, millions, maybe even billions, but the average median inflated adjusted award in 2001 was $28,000. And even in medical malpractice cases in which the injuries tend to be far, far more serious than the average torte case, the median award was only $170,000, which is far from the multibillion dollar lottery torte reformers have often brought before us. 
   The other issue that I would like to bring forth is that, according to the Congressional Budget Office, malpractice costs amount to less than 2 percent of the overall medical cost. And so when we start talking about the cost of medicine and how it is skyrocketing, and it is, but when you think about the fact that the cost for malpractice or the cost for the insurance, which supercedes the cost really paid out, it accounts for only 2 percent of the overall medical costs in the United States, which is Herculean; but 2 percent is almost nonexistent. 
   And I think what has happened is that we have created a mountain out of a mole hill. That is not to say that there are not problems, but judges will quite often tell a lawyer that the case submitted is simply frivolous, and that case will never come to court, and then of course summary judgments can also prevent cases from ever coming to court. So judges have the option of looking at a case and deciding whether or not it is worthy of taking up the time and resources of the court. 
   And then the other part of it is that in an overwhelming majority of these cases, the amount or the award of the judgment is set by a jury, which are everyday people. And this is not to say that there should not be something done. I just think putting artificial caps would be the wrong thing to do. And that is generally one of the proposals that comes up. I'm not sure if the gentlewoman from West Virginia is supporting caps or not, but I think that if that is one of the solutions, I think a one-size-fits-all kind of solution is unfair to people who may suffer a very, very debilitating injury in the same category of someone who has a fender bender. 
   I yield back to the gentlewoman.

   Mr. CLEAVER. The meritless cases, however, rarely ever win in the first place. I was offended when I first heard that somebody sued McDonald's because they ordered a cup of hot coffee and were burned by the hot coffee that they ordered. I was offended by that as well, and I think most Americans are. But in reality, the meritless cases rarely ever win in the first place, and that is contrary to the allegations that generally come forth, particularly from the major corporations. 
   They would have us believe that the frivolous lawsuits are just automatically finding their way to the courtroom and that they are meritless, but they win. And the truth of the matter is that our intricate system, with the law and juries and judges and even independent reviewers, will pretty much weed out the frivolous lawsuits. And they are filed to no one's benefit, except a lawyer, who I think we can find one in any profession who is going to try to take advantage of their system. And it has nothing to do with having gone to law school. It has something to do with human nature. 
   But I think that the way that this whole issue has been played out ends up actually protecting the one entity that I think is the most culpable, and that is the insurance companies that are not regulated.

   Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, there are people all around this country who look at C-SPAN on a daily basis and who look listen to radio talk shows, look at television news programs, and they see Members of Congress, both House and Senate, screaming at each other. They see from time to time the animated debates that take place on these shows, and even here in this great hall. 
   Many, many great patriots have stepped into the well of the House of Representatives to wax eloquent, because this is the place where the great orators stood and presented their cases to each other and to the American public. But in the past decade or so, we have seen a dramatic drop in the civility exercised by Members of this body, and we have seen it from both sides of the aisle. 
   Let me share something with you that I read the other day by William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania. He said this: ``I know of no religion that destroys courtesy, civility or kindness.'' That is the kind of statement that the Members of this great body ought to keep in mind when we step into the well. 
   I came to Washington and to the Congress with this desire in my heart, to do what I could to make this a more civil place. With the intensity and intention of debate, sometimes it is difficult to restrain ourselves. But restraint is something that we can do and feel better about having done it on the morrow. It is delayed satisfaction. We might get some immediate joy from being nasty, but the greater joy is restraint and receiving greater joy later, that you actually had the discipline to control your tongue. 
   I have opinions that are very, very strong. I feel strong about tort reform, not because I am an attorney. I have four children. None of them are attorneys. But I personally feel strongly about it because of some personal things that happened in my own family that could have gone to court, that we did not take to court for a lot of reasons. One of the things that we felt strongly about was our own integrity, so we didn't go to court. 
   But my challenge is to state whatever strong feelings I have in a tone that raises the level of the conversation and honors those who disagree with me. 
   When you look at the roots of the word ``civility,'' to be civil is to be a citizen, a respected part of the community. So to be uncivil is to fracture the community, locally, nationally and internationally, and that is something that none of us can afford to do. 
   Not long ago President Gerald Ford died, and I was reminded of a story of his days here in this House. He held regular debates here in Washington with his Democratic counterpart Congressman Thomas Hale Boggs. They would debate at the National Press Club. At Congressman Gerald Ford's suggestion, they would ride over from the Capitol to the National Press Club and agree on the topic of the debate. Can you imagine that happening in 2007? Then, after the debate, they would go out and have lunch. 
   Mr. Speaker, that is the kind of House I think we need to demand as a part of what takes place in this city called Washington, D.C. I hope, I even pray, that the men and women of this great body will learn to exercise restraint, because what we do and say here in this hallowed place actually reverberates and ends up traveling all across the length and breadth of this Nation, and the words we say will impact the people around this country. 
   I say again, there are few Members of this Congress, if any, who would say to their children, watch C-SPAN and watch the leaders of this Nation debate, so that they can show you how to act around people with whom you have a disagreement. 
   We can do better, and I think we will. I believe that because Mrs. Capito is interested in doing this, the road towards civility is now under construction, and I enjoy serving with the gentlelady from West Virginia.

   Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, yesterday the Democratic Congress once again supported energy independence and security. This legislation, which the President is now expected to sign, includes an historic increase in fuel economy standards for vehicles and significant new support for alternative fuels. 
   This comprehensive Democratic energy bill provides a dramatic shift in our Nation's energy policy, including new standards for buildings, homes, lighting and appliances, and makes great strides in our fight against global warming. It is also something that we can feel good about, because it reduces the price at the pump through increased efficiency standards that reach 35 miles per gallon by 2020. This is the first increase in CAFE standards in 32 years and will save the average driver between $700 and $1,000 a year. 
   Madam Speaker, the protection of our environment is both a spiritual and moral issue, and Congress has failed for too many years to address this issue. I am proud that the Democratic Congress has worked to bring this historic legislation to the floor.

<DOCNO>Mr. CLEAVER. (RECOGNIZING NATIONAL HOMEOWNERSHIP MONTH -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   The month of June is National Homeownership Month, and at a time of growing concern about the foreclosure crisis affecting the lives of too many Americans, Congress has responded with a bipartisan effort to revitalize the housing market. 
   This year, the President, in one of the proclamations that actually I think spoke for most Members of this body, as well as for most Americans, said, ``For many Americans, owning a home represents freedom, independence and the American dream.'' 
   During National Homeownership Month, we highlight the benefits of owning a home and encourage our fellow citizens to be responsible homeowners. It is difficult to be a responsible homeowner at this time because foreclosure filings last month went up nearly 50 percent compared with a year earlier. Nationwide, this is unbelievable. 261,255 homeowners received at least one foreclosure-related filing in May. That is up 48 percent from the same month last year, and up 7 percent from April. Last week, the Mortgage  Bankers Association reported that about 2.5 percent of home mortgages were in foreclosure during the first quarter of this year, almost double the rate of a year earlier. 
   I was reading an article in the June 19 Washington Post which suggests that 6.5 million loans will fall into foreclosure within the next 5 years; 6.5 million loans. That means that 8 percent of all homeowners in the United States will be impacted directly. That does not count the people who live on the block where a home is foreclosed, and in the urban core, anywhere around the country, that spells disaster, because you will have a rundown property in an area that is already undervalued by those who make declarations about the value of property. 
   Nearly 74,000 properties were repossessed by lenders nationwide just in May, while more than 58,000 received default notices. That is according to the New York Times, June 14 of this year. 
   As a person who did not live in a real home until he was 14, I can speak I think very clearly about the value of homeownership. I lived in a house in Waxahachie, Texas, from the time I was born until I was eight that had no running water, no electricity, no indoor plumbing. My mother, father, three sisters and I lived in this shanty, which at one time served as slave quarters. 
   We were able to move out of that when I was eight. We moved into public housing. We lived in public housing until my father, working about three jobs, sometimes four at the same time, could buy his own home. He bought a home in a white neighborhood, and so he had to have it moved to the black neighborhood. 
   That home meant everything to the six Cleavers who lived in it. It meant so much that my father had converted this home into a palace that we considered having been blessed to live in. His lawn can be compared with the lawn of anybody in the country, and some of the neighbors even make fun of him because if you drop a cigarette butt or a piece of paper on the street anywhere near his home, it gets picked up. 
   Homeownership is valuable, and it does grant us a piece of the American dream. But for many Americans, the American dream has become a nightmare. The subprime lending crisis has devastated communities, but let us not forget it has devastated individuals. 705,446 homes will suffer price declines due to foreclosures nearby. 
   Mr. Speaker, tonight we lift up the value of homeownership, but we do so with a commitment to do everything that we can possibly do to impact the climate so that we can turn things around from the destructive way in which this Nation is suffering.  
   The month of June is National Homeownership Month. At a time of growing concern about the foreclosure crisis affecting the lives of too many Americans, Congress has responded with a bipartisan effort to revitalize the housing market. This year the President proclaimed, ``For many Americans, owning a home represents freedom, independence, and the American dream. During National Homeownership Month, we highlight the benefits of owning a home and encourage our fellow citizens to be responsible homeowners.'' 
   ``Foreclosure filings last month were up nearly 50 percent compared with a year earlier, according to one company's count released yesterday.'' [Washington Post, June 19, 2008]. 
   ``Nationwide, 261,255 homeowners received at least one foreclosure-related filing in May, up 48 percent from the same month last year, and up 7 percent from April, foreclosure listing service RealtyTrac said.'' [Washington Post, June 19, 2008]. 
   ``Last week the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that about 2.47 percent of home mortgages were in foreclosure during the first quarter of the year, almost double the 1.28 percent rate of a year earlier, and the highest point since the group began compiling such figures in 1979.'' [Washington Post, June 19, 2008]. 
   ``A Credit Suisse report this spring predicted that 6.5 million loans will fall into foreclosure over the next five years, reaching more than 8 percent of all U.S. homes.'' [Washington Post, June 19, 2008]. 
   ``According to the RealtyTrac report, one in every 483 U.S. households received a foreclosure filing in May, the highest number since RealtyTrac started the report in 2005 and the second straight monthly record.'' [Washington Post, June 19, 2008]. 
   ``Nearly 74,000 properties were repossessed by lenders nationwide in May, while more than 58,000 received default notices, the company said.'' [New York Times, June 14, 2008]. 
   At the end of the first quarter of 2008, there were an estimated 1.27 million properties in foreclosure in the United States. In addition, there were approximately 350,000 subprime mortgages more than 90 days delinquent where foreclosure proceedings had not yet begun. 
   The Center for Responsible Lending offers the following statistics for Missouri: 42,727 foreclosures predicted for 2008-2009; 705,446 homes will suffer price declines due to foreclosures nearby; a $1.8 billion in home values/tax base; and $2,540 average decrease in home value per unit affected. 
   ``The Federal Housing Administration expects to lose $4.6 billion because of unexpectedly high default rates on home loans.'' [New York Times, June 10, 2008]. 
   ``One study estimates that in just 10 states (AZ, CA, FL, GA, IL, MA, MI, MN, NV, NY), lost tax revenue in 2008 will total $6.6 billion due to foreclosures.'' [Global Insight, The Mortgage Crisis: Economic and Fiscal Implications for Metro Areas, November, 2007]. 
   ``Further, an estimated 524,000 fewer jobs are projected to be created this year because of the foreclosure crisis.'' [Global Insight, The Mortgage Crisis: Economic and Fiscal Implications for Metro Areas, November, 2007]. 
   Initiatives to help responsible homeowners keep their homes have been launched. The Federal Housing Administration has created the FHASecure program so that flexibility in refinancing mortgages for homeowners who have good credit histories but cannot afford their current payments is just one solution. Furthermore, the HOPE NOW Alliance connects struggling homeowners with lenders, loan servicers, and mortgage counselors to help families stay in their homes. 
   67.8 percent of Americans own their own homes [Census Bureau]. 
   72.0 percent of Midwesterners own their own homes (the highest percentage in the nation) [Census Bureau]. 
   With an increase in age, comes an increase in homeownership. Americans view homeownership as a mark of success, and as proof that they have at least begun to realize the American dream. The purchase of a first home is a symbol of stability, and often acts as a monument to family life, which is the cornerstone of our culture.

   Mr. CLEAVER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   Let me first of all say that on the positive side, I do have respect for the gentleman from Arizona. He is consistent. He is not mean-spirited with his opposition. There is a lot of mean-spirited conversation that goes on here. 
   I should say to him, however, that this Member of Congress placed all 120 requested earmarks on my Web site in March, not at the request of anyone. I did it. I am proud of my earmarks. I want everybody to see them. I don't think there is enough money going, though, to this particular project. 
   When I was mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, we built the American Jazz Museum. It is the only museum on the planet dedicated to the preservation of America's only art form. Jazz is the only art form created in the United States of America. We have what is called the John Baker Collection. If students at the University of Arizona want to study the industry of jazz, the art form of jazz, and they would like to see the soundies, the only place they can see the John Baker Collection, the largest collection of old black and white soundies, is the American Jazz Museum in Kansas City. 
   People from across this Nation, actually from across the world, come into Kansas City. The city put money into it. Of course, as a former mayor, I know that we send unfunded mandates down to the city. So the city, particularly, since I left office, reduces the funding each year. Since people are using this museum from all over this Nation, I'll bet there are people in Arizona, I hope they are watching, who are using the American Jazz Museum. 
   So, I believe, first of all, that I have been as transparent as anybody could be. The comments we received from people in our district, Republicans and Democrats, is thank you for being transparent. I don't hide any of it. I want everybody to look at it, examine it. It gives me an opportunity to stand here, and hopefully people in my district are watching me now to stand here and not only defend the earmark, but to promote the American Jazz Museum. 
   This is the home of Charlie ``YardBird'' Parker, who was born and raised right there and went to school around the street from the museum. This is the place where Count Basie organized his band. This is the place where Jay McShan organized his band. Every major jazz artist in the world wanted to play 18th and Vine. 
   Now, there is some debate about whether Kansas City or New Orleans is the Mother of Jazz. Of course, New Orleans is wrong, and I try to help them when I can. But the point here is that we need, Mr. Chairman, to have people who are going to put up earmarks to be in a position to feel good about them and to express it. So I don't see this so much as a defense, but as an opportunity to promote what I think is one of the legitimate projects for funding from the United States Congress because it serves the people of this Nation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Chairman, I would like to make two final points. The first is the people in the Fifth Congressional District of Missouri, Harry Truman's district, will have the opportunity to judge whether or not I should have placed these projects before Congress for earmarks next November. I am measured by my representation in that district. I would suggest that they are going to be very pleased with what I have done. 
   The other issue is that we are talking about a $200,000 earmark, and I had hoped for significantly more than that. We are spending $285 million a day, $11 million a hour in Iraq. If you subtract $200,000, that would reduce the number of Coca-Colas in Iraq by about four cases based on the price they have been gouging. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, the National Football League, the American sports community and the business leadership in Western Missouri lost a true treasure on December 13, 2006, when the Kansas City Chiefs founder, Lamar Hunt, peacefully passed away at Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, Texas, at the age of 74. 
   Mr. Speaker, this great American is survived by his wife, Norma, and their four children, some of whom are here with us today. 
   Lamar Hunt is recognized as one of the greatest sportsmen in American history. He served as the guiding force behind the formation of both the American Football League and the Kansas City Chiefs franchise. Hunt served as a positive influence on the game of football for 47 years, dating back to his conception of the American Football League in 1959. 
   He was the first AFL figure to be enshrined into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. This was a remarkable feat, if you consider that he had become involved in the game just 13 years earlier. 
   It was Lamar Hunt who served as the catalyst, who brought together a group of people whimsically known as the ``Foolish Club.'' He was able to convince eight men to put money up to start a football league that no one thought could survive. This was truly an impossible dream. But the fledgling league took foot on the field for the 1960 season; and on June 8, 1966, the AFL-NFL merger was announced by the NFL Commissioner, Pete Rozelle. On January 15, Lamar Hunt's Kansas City Chiefs were participating in the first Super Bowl. 
   It is worth noting that when the owners met after the merger and began to discuss this football game that would be the bowl game of bowl games, far more noteworthy than the Rose Bowl or the Cotton Bowl or the Sugar Bowl, it was Lamar Hunt who said the bowl game of bowl games should be called the Super Bowl, and thus was born what is now one of the most watched events on this planet. 
   Before there was a player, coach or general manager in the league, there was Lamar Hunt. There was the late Patriots' owner William Sullivan who remarked at Hunt's Hall of Fame induction ceremony that ``Hunt was the cornerstone, the integrity, of the league. Without him, there would have been no AFL.''  
   Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity to serve as Mayor of Kansas City for 8 years. But even before that, during my time on the City Council, I had the great pleasure of meeting and working with Lamar Hunt. Over the years, I can tell you that I have met many, many men and women, some heads of state. I have met kings and one queen. I have never met a person on this Earth yet who had the humility of Lamar Hunt. I have never seen a man who did so much, who accomplished great things at the level of Lamar Hunt, who could walk around this Capitol and no one would know him because he would be opening doors for everyone and trying to serve. 
   In the tradition of my religion, humility is held perhaps higher than any other characteristic. In fact, in my tradition, the great prophets all praised people with humility, and the pharisees, who did not have humility, who praised themselves, were denounced. 
   Lamar Hunt was an innovator. For years and years he advocated the two-point conversion in the NFL. Finally, in 1994, the owners bought into the concept, which is why today there is a two-point conversion. This man would create things in his mind, and he had the ability to share those things. 
   I attribute, as well as many other African Americans, Lamar Hunt with the credit for African Americans moving into all realms of pro football. Before the AFL, there were only a few African Americans playing in the NFL. For a lot of the young people who watch TV today, they would probably find that somewhat amusing. But it was quite possible in the 1950s and even the early 1960s to watch an NFL game and see maybe one or two and, in some instances, maybe no African Americans at all. 
   But when Lamar Hunt started the AFL, he went to the Historically Black Colleges and Universities and began to create players. And what a crop of players he brought in. 
   Willie Lanier, middle linebacker. In those days, and young people will probably find this amazing, people in sports would say African Americans can't play middle linebacker. That is the quarterback of defense. They can't play quarterback. Willie Lanier, who is in the building at this time, Mr. Speaker, became a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was the starting middle linebacker for the Kansas City Chiefs for 11 years. 
   Then there was Buck Buchanan at a little school that most people had never even heard of, a black college called Grambling. Buck Buchanan, Pro Football Hall of Fame. Otis Taylor. And the list goes on and on. And when you look at all of the other teams in the AFL, they, too, would go into these schools. So in addition to being an innovator, he was a great humanitarian. 
   Hunt was not able to ever see his long-held dream of hosting a Super Bowl in Kansas City. It was something that he worked on. But, before he died, the NFL owners passed a proposal to bring the NFL's championship game to Kansas City in February of the year 2015. 
   Mr. Hunt was a great man, a great leader. He did a lot for our community. I had the pleasure of traveling with him around the world. I had the chance to see him in many, many situations; and I can tell you, this was a giant, even though he never tried to project himself as a giant in any situation, he tried to just blend in. But there is no way the history of the National Football League can be complete without a major section entitled ``Lamar Hunt.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask all Members to join me in supporting H. Res. 53, which is to honor the life and legacy and accomplishments of Lamar Hunt.  
   The National Football League, the American sports community, and the Business Community of Kansas City lost a true treasure on December 13, 2006 when Chiefs Founder Lamar Hunt peacefully passed away at Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, Texas at the age of 74. 
   He is survived by his wife, Norma and their four children, Lamar, Jr., Sharron Munson, Clark and Daniel. He was also the proud grandfather of 14 grandchildren. Recognized as one of the greatest sportsmen in American history, Hunt served as the guiding force behind the formation of both the American Football League and the Kansas City Chiefs franchise. Hunt served as a positive influence on the game for 47 years dating back to his conception of the American Football League in '59. He was the first AFL figure to be enshrined into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in '72, a remarkable feat considering he became involved in the game just 13 years earlier. Hunt served as the catalyst, who brought together the whimsically-named ``Foolish Club'' comprised of the eight original AFL owners. His ``impossible dream'' became a reality when his fledgling league took foot on the field for the '60 season. On June 8, 1966, the AFL-NFL merger was announced by NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle and on January 15, 1967, Hunt's Kansas City Chiefs were participating in the inaugural Super Bowl. 
   ``Before there was a player, coach or a general manager in the league there was Lamar Hunt,'' late Patriots owner William Sullivan remarked at Hunt's Hall of Fame induction ceremony. ``Hunt was the cornerstone, the integrity of the league. Without him, there would have been no AFL.'' Despite his many accomplishments, Hunt's humility was one of his most unwavering and most endearing traits. While he modestly declined to take credit for his efforts, he truly played an important role in the design, ongoing development and direction of the modern-day National Football League. Whether it was serving as the driving force behind the formation of the AFL, serving as a key player in the AFL-NFL merger talks in the '60s, or overseeing many crucial issues concerning pro football and the Chiefs franchise during the past 4 decades, few individuals helped change the face of America's favorite game for the better than this quiet Texan. In addition to being a principal negotiator in the merger of the AFL and NFL in the late '60s, he was a contributor to the design of the NFL playoff format. He is also credited with accidentally putting the name ``Super Bowl'' on the NFL's championship game--the name coming from his children's toy ``Super Ball.'' 
   For many years, he was a persistent advocate of the 2-point conversion option for pro football--an old college and AFL rule that was finally adopted by the NFL in '94. Hunt had also lobbied for many years that an additional Thanksgiving game be added to the NFL schedule and in 2006, those efforts were rewarded when the Chiefs hosted the first-ever Thanksgiving contest at Arrowhead Stadium. Perhaps Hunt's biggest influence on the league over the years was his quiet, yet persuasive voice of reason. Hunt's name is rightfully mentioned alongside other legendary family surnames in pro football history such as Halas, Mara and Rooney for his commitment to putting the betterment of the league ahead of any potential individual gain. As the founder of the AFL, he helped pave the way for much of the modem growth of pro football. Possibly the greatest tribute to his contributions to the sport was the naming by the league of the Lamar Hunt Trophy, which is presented annually to the champion of the American Football Conference. The early days of the AFL were problem-filled and often tenuous, but Hunt saw his Dallas Texans franchise achieve on-field success. In 1962, the Texans won the AFL Championship with a double-overtime victory over the Houston Oilers, the first of 3 titles won by the Texans/Chiefs during the league's 10-year existence. 
   After three years in Dallas, Hunt moved his team to Kansas City in '63, where the organization was renamed the Chiefs. Hunt truly helped put Kansas City on the ``big-league'' map, thanks to a star-studded football team that was the winningest in the 10-year history of the American Football League. Hunt's team repeated as AFL champions in both 1966 and 1969. By winning the 1966 AFL title, the Chiefs earned the right to play in the first Super Bowl against the NFL Champion Green Bay Packers. Three years later, the Chiefs claimed Kansas City's first major sports championship by defeating the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl IV. In the late 1960s, Hunt 
   was closely involved in the original development plans for Arrowhead Stadium, a facility which provided the Chiefs and their fans with one of the most decided home-field advantages in all of sports. While other venues of a similar vintage have long since been termed obsolete or have been demolished, Arrowhead continues to serve as a point of pride for the Chiefs and the Kansas City community. 
   Thanks in large part to the vision and lobbying efforts of Hunt, Jackson County Missouri voters approved a 3/8 cent sales tax in April of 2006. That measure is expected to raise $425 million for the Truman Sports Complex, of which $325 million has been earmarked to renovate Arrowhead in order to bring the facility up to today's state-of-the-art standards. Those improvements should only further solidify Arrowhead's status as one of America's foremost sporting venues. 
   Hunt's longtime dream of hosting a Super Bowl in Kansas City appeared to become a reality when NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue announced on November 16, 2005 that NFL owners had passed a proposal to bring the NFL's championship game to Kansas City in February of 2015. 
   Unfortunately, a provision in April's election that would have resurrected the ``rolling roof'' concept for Arrowhead Stadium did not pass. The ``rolling roof'' was part of Hunt's initial vision for Arrowhead Stadium in the '60s. In its  21st century incarnation, the ``rolling roof'' would have provided a climate-controlled facility suitable for hosting the Super Bowl, the Final Four and other prestigious events. 
   While Hunt did not realize his goal of seeing an NFL title game played in Kansas City, he worked diligently to bring other prominent sporting contests to Arrowhead over the years. The ``Home of the Chiefs'' served as host of the Dr Pepper Big 12 Conference Championship Game in 2000, 2003, 2004 and 2006. In addition to numerous other collegiate football contests, the Chiefs hosted several international soccer matches at Arrowhead thanks to Hunt's influence. 
   Hunt's decision to hire Chiefs President, General Manager and CEO Carl Peterson in December '88 set the stage for a football renaissance in Kansas City. During the decade of the '90s, Hunt and Peterson, earned the distinction of becoming just the fourth Owner/General Manager combination to preside over a franchise for all 10 years of a 100-win decade as Kansas City compiled a stellar 102-58 (.638) regular season record from '90-99. Under Hunt's stewardship, the Chiefs developed an intensely-loyal fan following, not just in Mid-America, but across the country and around the globe. Hunt took great satisfication in the fact that the Chiefs boasted season-ticket holders from 48 of the 50 states (all but Maine and Vermont), the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada. He was also appreciative of the fact that Kansas City was selected to represent the NFL in 4 American Bowl contests--Berlin, Germany ('90), Tokyo, Japan ('94, '98) and Monterrey, Mexico ('96). 
   While the Chiefs always remained Hunt's most prized sporting entity, his passion for athletics encompassed more than just the game of football. Appropriately nicknamed ``Games'' during his childhood, Hunt's love of sports was his true lifeblood, an enthusiasm which led to his involvement in 6 different professional sports leagues and 7 sports franchises. 
   In addition to his formative role in the creation of the American Football League, Hunt was involved in the development of both the North American Soccer League and a tennis promotion company, World Championship Tennis. Hunt's involvement in those ventures resulted years later in his induction into the respective Halls of Fame of both United States Soccer (located in Oneonta, New York) in '82 and International Tennis (located in Newport, Rhode Island) in '93. He was also inducted into the state Sports Halls of Fame of both Missouri ('95) and Texas ('84). In total, Hunt was selected to 8 ``Halls of Fame,'' including the Texas Business Hall of Fame ('97) and the Kansas City Business Hall of Fame (2004). In '81, Hunt was inducted into the NFL Alumni Association's prestigious Order of the Leather Helmet and in February of '93, he received the Francis J. ``Reds'' Bagnell Award from the Maxwell Football Club of Philadelphia for continuing positive contributions to the game. 
   Truly a sportsman for all seasons, Soccer America Magazine named Hunt one of its ``25 Most Influential People'' in '99 after the 91-year-old U.S. Open Cup was renamed the ``Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup.'' That same year he also received the U.S. Soccer Federation Hall of Fame Medal of Honor, joining former U.S. Soccer President Alan Rothenberg as the only other individual to earn that prestigious distinction. In 2005, the U.S. Soccer Foundation honored Hunt with its Lifetime Achievement Award. The Hunt Family served as the Investor/Operators of the Kansas City Wizards franchise of Major League Soccer from '95-06 and reveled as the Wizards 
   claimed the 2000 MLS Cup. The Hunt Family still oversees the operations of 2 MLS franchises, F.C. Dallas and the Columbus Crew. 
   The Hunt Sports Group has been at the forefront of stadium development in the United States, beginning with America's first soccer-specific stadium, 22,555-seat Crew Stadium which opened in '99. In 2005, Pizza Hut Park was completed in Frisco, Texas, giving the Dallas area one of the world's most unique and futuristic soccer facilities. Hunt was also one of the founding investors in the 6-time World Champion Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association. In total, Hunt was the owner of 13 distinctive championship rings from 5 different professional sports associations (AFL/NFL, MLS, NBA, NASL and the U.S. Soccer ``Open Cup''). His football championship litany included a Super Bowl IV ring from the '69 Chiefs, as well as AFL title rings from the '62 Texans and '66 Chiefs. A highly-successful businessman outside of sports, one of Hunt's most notable innovations was Sub-Tropolis, the world's largest underground business complex, located just north of Arrowhead Stadium. This naturally climate-controlled, subterranean industrial park serves as home to over 50 local, national and international businesses. Hunt also envisioned and developed Worlds of Fun, a 165-acre family entertainment complex which opened in '73, as well as the 60-acre family water recreation park, Oceans of Fun which was completed in '82. While both of those entities were sold in '95, Hunt Midwest Enterprises, Inc. continues to oversee a diverse range of business interests, including limestone mining and real estate development. 
   Hunt was born on August 2, 1932 in El Dorado, Arkansas and graduated from SMU with a B.S. in Geology in '56. While at SMU, he was a 3-year reserve end on the Varsity Football Team. Hunt was an avid supporter of his alma mater and was an annual fixture at the Cotton Bowl. He and his wife Norma were also involved in numerous philanthropic and civic efforts in Dallas, across the state of Texas and in the Kansas City community.

<DOCNO>Mr. CLEAVER. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, as I began to consider the comments I would make during this debate tonight on the occupation, escalation and gravitation of the U.S. military action in Iraq, I concluded that my visit to this well must somehow echo the threat and frustration of the people who sent me to represent them in the people's House. 
   Tomorrow, the United States of America should begin a massive and voter-mandated salvaging operation in Iraq. Yes, as bad as conditions have gotten, there are important and valuable things that could be salvaged. A tarnished international image clings to a nation like a shadow to a human being. It follows a nation to the next  world crisis. It cannot be blamed for faulty intelligence, and it spoils opportunities to influence a world desperate for direction. Henceforth, we must conduct our foreign policy in a manner which salvages our sunken international image. 
   Because of the way we launched a long-range military action in Iraq, our prestige among the community of nations has surely suffered. Nothing deflates as a punctured international image. We can salvage our image not only by de-escalating in Iraq but also by reestablishing desperately needed dialogue with all the sovereign nations in the neighborhood with Iraq. It takes many, many people, and not just one to put a policy together. 
   Now, with regard to peace in the Middle East, it has become crystal clear that the United States cannot whistle a symphony.     
   It will take an orchestra of many international players willing to make music in the same key. The days of the international soloist or a conductor without an orchestra are past. We must salvage our relationship with the family of nations. We must salvage what is left of our Treasury. 
   Mr. Speaker, for most Americans war does not pay, but it must be paid for. And, to date, we have spent billions and billions of dollars that could have been spent for valuable programs to set this Nation on the right course. We must salvage soldiers. Yes, thousands of brave young U.S. soldiers have been killed, and Iraqis are dying weekly by the hundreds. If this conflict continues, there will be only two classes of young people, one half in graves, the other half in hospitals. 
   Some have said this conflict will last for decades. Nevertheless, that kind of policy or lack thereof has caused young Americans to ask: Will we ever see the last of this war, or will it see the last of us? 
   The Kansas City Chiefs is my team. The general manager, Carl Peterson, would never go to the sports editors of the local media and admonish them not to criticize the game plan of Coach Herman Edwards, because to do so would demoralize the players. Such a warning by the general manager would be ludicrous, if not loony. Why? Because the players of the Kansas City Chiefs are professionals who cannot be so easily defamed. And, friends, neither can the men and women who form the fiercest fighting force in the history of this planet. 
   After all the ethnic and sectarian human butchering, after all the billions spent, after all the children of God killed, after all the maimed who have been hospitalized, after all the dissenters who have been heard, after all the purple thumbs that have been raised, the war drum still throbs, the sabers still rattle, and the blood still flows. Yet, we can salvage the soul of the Nation, even though at this hour we seem to have lost our way. 
   Tomorrow, this Congress must adopt House Concurrent Resolution 63 as bold and beckoning to begin salvage operations.  
   Mr. Speaker, as I began to consider the comments I would make during the debate on the occupation, escalation, and gravitation of the U.S. military action in Iraq, I concluded that my visit to this well must somehow echo the fret and frustration of the people who sent me to represent them in The People's House. 
   For more than 132 years, the steamboat Arabia lay beneath the fathoms of the waters of the mighty Missouri River. Not until Bob and Florence Howley committed their life savings to a massive salvaging operation, did the rusting of this once stately riverboat cease. Today, the salvaged cargo of this retrieved vessel is on display in Kansas City's Historic River Market. Since I first walked into the Arabia Steamboat Museum in 1992, I have become a serious supporter of salvage operations. Anything of great value that is lost or damaged is worth salvaging. 
   Tomorrow, the United States of America should begin a massive and voter-mandated salvaging operation in Iraq. Yes, as bad as conditions have gotten, there are important and valuable things that can be salvaged. 
   A tarnished international image clings to a nation like a shadow to a human being. It follows a nation to the next world crisis, it cannot be blamed for faulty intelligence, and it spoils opportunities to influence a world desperate for direction. Henceforth, we must conduct our foreign policy in a manner which salvages our sunken international image. Because of the way we launched a Lone Ranger military action in Iraq, our prestige among the community of nations has surely suffered. Nothing deflates as fast as a punctured international image. We can salvage our image not only by de-escalating in Iraq, but also by re-establishing desperately needed dialogue with all the sovereign nations in the neighborhood of Iraq. With regard to peace in the Middle East, it has become crystal clear that the U.S. cannot whistle a symphony. It will take an orchestra of many international players willing to make music in the same key. The days of the international soloist, or a conductor without an orchestra, are past. We must salvage our relationship with the family of nations. 
   We must salvage what is left of our treasury. Mr. Speaker, for most Americans, war does not pay, but it must be paid for. To date, we have appropriated $380 billion for the armed conflict in Iraq, and the President has requested an additional $142 billion in the FY08 supplemental. With this amount of money, we could have fully funded No Child Left Behind and the COPS program (which places badly needed police on the streets in high crime neighborhoods). We must salvage respect from our noble veterans who, today, are outraged that they are showered with praise when they are in battle but blasted with neglect when they return home. Soon enough, they will discover that the President's recently submitted budget raises fees on veterans for their health costs by $355 million in FY08, $2.3 billion over 5 years, and $4.9 billion over 10 years. Those who serve--deserve! 
   We must salvage soldiers. Yes, thousands of brave young U.S. soldiers have been killed, and Iraqis are dying weekly by the hundreds. If this conflict continues, there will be only two classes of young people: one half in graves and the other half in hospitals. Some have said that this conflict will last for decades. Nevertheless, that kind of policy, or lack thereof, has caused young Americans to ask, ``Will we ever see the last of this war, or will it see the last of us?'' 
   Let me address a part of this debate which has frustrated me because of its defective logic. Over and over again, many of my honorable colleagues have stood behind this distinguished desk and warned that the debate on House Concurrent Resolution 63 will demoralize our troops in Iraq. Nothing could be further from the truth. I will never accept the premise that U.S. troops are demoralized by the debate in a democracy. The President's stated goal in Iraq is to aid in creating a nation where citizens and public officials can debate in a robust democracy. And then to denounce debate in The People's House as demeaning or damaging? My friends, that denigrates the democracy we so proudly extol and that our troops valiantly fight to defend. We cannot lead others to the light while we stand in the dark. 
   The Kansas City Chiefs is my team. The General Manager, Carl Peterson, would never go to the sports editors of the local media and admonish them not to criticize the game plan of Coach Herman Edwards because it will demoralize the players. Such a warning by the General Manager would be ludicrous if not loonie. Why? Because the players of the Kansas City Chiefs are professionals who cannot be so easily defanged. And friends, neither can the men and women who form the fiercest fighting force in the history of Planet Earth. 
   After all the ethnic and sectarian human butchering, after all the billions spent, after all the children of God killed, after all the maimed who have been hospitalized, after all the dissenters who have been heard, after all the purple thumbs have been raised, the war drum is still throbbing, the sabers are still rattling and the blood is still flowing. Yet, we can salvage the soul of the nation even though at this hour we seem to have lost our way.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, our economy has now lost 430,000 jobs this year. The latest employment numbers show 62,000 jobs lost last month alone. This only adds to the growing financial insecurity among America's middle income families. 
   For the past 7 years, this administration has been supporting the same old policies that got us into this recession. The 3.8 million Americans who continue to struggle to find work in this sluggish economy can no longer afford the poisonous policies of the past. They can't afford to drive their kids to school because of over $4 a gallon in gasoline.
