<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for the Recovery Rebates and Economic Stimulus for the American People Act, H.R. 5140. This important measure represents a bipartisan commitment to help hard-working Americans weather these turbulent economic times. 
   Millions of Americans have been faced with the rising costs of energy, housing and health  care, which have taken a toll on the state of our economy. In my home state of Rhode Island, the typical monthly housing payment is over $2,200, making homeownership a dream out of reach for too many. The situation for renters is not much better, as the average two-bedroom apartment in Rhode Island rents for nearly $1,200 a month. Compounding the cost of housing are the skyrocketing costs of energy, which rose 18.4 percent in 2007. Our employment outlook is also discouraging. Earlier this month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that the national unemployment rate has risen to a 2-year high of 5 percent. 
   These harsh realities, combined with the snowballing effects of the recent subprime lending crisis, have made it increasingly clear that our economy will face an even sharper downturn if we do not act soon. With that in mind, today we are taking swift and bipartisan action to jump-start our Nation's economy with a measure that is timely, targeted and temporary. 
   This measure will quickly inject $150 billion into our economy to revitalize our markets, increase consumer confidence, and protect against recession. Our package is targeted at low-income and middle-class Americans who need assistance the most, providing rebates that will put money directly into their pockets, which will, in turn, stimulate our economy. I am particularly pleased that this package will provide relief to 35 million Americans who work and contribute to payroll taxes, but make too little to pay income tax. 
   Our measure will also temporarily increase the size of individual mortgages that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can purchase, offering help to those in need of affordable housing, particularly in high-cost areas like Rhode Island. Also included is a provision to allow the Federal Housing Administration to insure a greater number of subprime loans so thousands of Americans facing foreclosure may refinance their mortgages with fairer terms. 
   Finally, I am pleased this package will help to stimulate our Nation's small businesses by allowing them to write off 50 percent of the cost of equipment the year it is purchased. This important incentive--which expires at the end of the year--will encourage growth and help keep our small businesses strong. 
   This measure solidifies our commitment to revitalize our economy in a way that is timely, targeted, and temporary. I commend Speaker PELOSI for her leadership in negotiating this significant bipartisan agreement, and I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1108, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. This bill is a pioneering step forward in a decades-long struggle to safeguard the health of our citizens by ensuring that tobacco products are properly regulated. I am proud that the House of Representatives is taking this historic action on such an important public health issue. 
   The dangers of tobacco products are no secret. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the adverse health effects from cigarette smoking account for an estimated 438,000 deaths, or nearly 1 out of every 5 deaths, each year in the United States. Additionally, a report released by the National Cancer Institute states that smokeless tobacco contains 28 cancer causing agents. Despite these and a multitude of other troubling revelations, the tobacco industry has remained virtually outside the realm of transparency or oversight. This groundbreaking measure will empower the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with meaningful authority to regulate tobacco product content and marketing for the first time in our nation's history. 
   H.R. 1108 authorizes the FDA to restrict the sale and distribution of tobacco products, including its advertising and promotion, particularly as it affects children. It requires tobacco companies to disclose the nicotine levels and chemical contents of their tobacco products, and mandates reporting on changes to the products and any research regarding their health effects. This legislation does not permit the removal of nicotine from tobacco; however, it will grant the FDA authority to eliminate harmful ingredients and additives, and reduce nicotine levels. It will also prohibit terms such as ``light,'' ``mild'' and ``low-tar'' that mislead consumers into believing that certain cigarettes are safer than others. 
   Tobacco is a drug with well known adverse health effects, and it should be regulated by the Food and Drug Administration like any other. This bill will provide the FDA with the necessary regulatory and oversight authority to address how tobacco products are manufactured, advertised, and marketed. Further, it will fund this authority with user fees to ensure that other efforts at the FDA are not compromised. 
   The CDC estimates that every day, approximately 4,000 youth try a cigarette for the first time, and another 1,000 will become new, regular daily smokers. One-third of these youth will eventually die prematurely as a result. At a time when our nation's health care system is already straining under the increased weight of chronic disease, this Congress must take action to directly address the dangers of tobacco. To that end, I remain ready to work with my colleagues on this important issue and urge that they support the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. I truly do thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for yielding and the minority for granting the unanimous consent request. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007. This critical bill reauthorizes the Federal Terrorism Insurance Program, which backs up private insurers in the event of a terrorist attack and extends the measure for 15 years. As chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, and Science and Technology, I am certainly pleased that this bill would ensure coverage in the event of a nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attack. 
   While no one wants to ever imagine that a nuclear, chemical, biological, radiological event could occur, the possibility is, unfortunately, a reality. Therefore, we must not only protect against this risk, but ensure that our Nation can recover financially if the unthinkable does happen. 
   This measure takes an important step forward by lowering the deductible from 20 percent to 3.5 percent for insurance coverage against NCBR attacks, and I am certainly proud to support this important measure. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Frank for his leadership on this important issue.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (EXPRESSING SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE IMMEDIATE AND UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE OF DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Con. Res. 200, a resolution that condemns the Burmese Junta for their violent suppression of Buddhist Monks and other peaceful demonstrators in Burma and demands the immediate release of opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. As a cosponsor of this resolution, I believe it is important for Congress to show its support for Burma's call for democracy. 
   In 1988, the Burmese military established rule through a military junta, and named themselves the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). This repressive regime arrested those who opposed them, including Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who is the leader of the legitimately elected political party, the National League of Democracy. SPDC, which has changed the country's name to Myanmar, has forcefully led the Burmese citizens ever since. According to the U.S. Department of State's Country Reports on Human Rights, as well as private organizations, Burma's human rights record has worsened in recent years. These reports have cited government and military abuses of civilians that include killings, torture, rape, arbitrary arrests, and forced labor. 
   This past August, the SPDC ended fuel subsidies, which led to excessive costs for gas. The Burmese citizens, unhappy with yet another burden, held pro-democracy rallies and called for the transfer of power to Aung San Suu Kyi. These rallies were ended forcefully by the SPDC, but Buddhist Monks, nuns and students have continued to peacefully protest the regime. The SPDC has recently banned the assembly of citizens in public, as well as attacked, arrested and killed those involved in the protests. 
   Madam Speaker, the ongoing violence and repression of peaceful protests for democracy is a travesty. H. Con. Res. 200 shows our country's support for the Burmese citizens' right to challenge their regime. This resolution also demands the release of other political prisoners who are detained by the regime, and calls on the United Nations Security Council to take the appropriate action against the State Peace and Development Council. The United States has already imposed heavy sanctions on the SPDC for many years, but we must also call on other countries, including China and India, who benefit from Burma's natural gas exports, to keep the pressure on the SPDC to end this atrocity. 
   As a member of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, I will continue to work with my colleagues to keep pressure on the Burmese regime and express support for those citizens who peacefully congregate for a new government. Passing H. Con. Res. 200 is an important and necessary step for Congress to take as we work to achieve this goal.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3087, legislation that will require the administration to develop and share with Congress a comprehensive strategy for the redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq. 
   Our Nation recognizes that we cannot remain in Iraq indefinitely. Just last week, General George Casey, the Army Chief of Staff, testified before the House Armed Services Committee that ongoing operations in Iraq were having a detrimental impact on our military readiness, endangering our ability to deal with other contingencies or problems. Our troops have done a superb job in a difficult mission, but they were not sent to Iraq to referee a civil war, and we need to bring them home. The violence in Iraq does not have a U.S. military solution; the answer lies in the Iraqi political reconciliation, which we must support with different methods. 
   The legislation before us today demonstrates Congress's commitment to ending our military presence in Iraq by mandating that the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, report on the status of planning for redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq and to provide periodic updates about their implementation. This information is vital for congressional oversight so that we ensure our policies are informed by sound judgment and reflect the complex logistical considerations involved with an undertaking of such magnitude. The administration's poor planning for the post-invasion period led to widespread problems in reconstruction and created the environment of instability that reigns to this day. We must avoid making that mistake again so that our withdrawal from Iraq does not exacerbate existing problems or create new ones. 
   I will continue to work with my colleagues to demand a swift and safe withdrawal of our U.S. forces from Iraq, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support this measure.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Employee Free Choice Act (H.R. 800). This bill will help give workers the leverage they need to negotiate for a better life for themselves and for their families. 
   Despite several years of economic growth, many of America's middle class families still struggle to make ends meet. Every day, workers throughout the country face difficult choices about their family's basic needs as wages stagnate and the cost of living continues to rise. By restoring workers' freedom to join together to bargain for better wages, benefits and working conditions, we will help ease the burden that too many working Americans face.  
   Collective bargaining is one of the best tools working men and women have to restore economic fairness and rebuild America's middle class. The benefit of unionizing also helps workers with low-wage jobs such as janitors, cashiers, and childcare workers to raise their earnings above poverty levels. Union workers tend to have more of the freedoms and rights that ultimately lead to greater opportunity. And members of unions traditionally enjoy higher earnings and better access to healthcare and retirement benefits than their non-union counterparts. 
   Under current law, workers often face uphill battles when attempting to unionize. All too often pro-union employees are intimidated, threatened, and in extreme cases, they may even lose their jobs. The Employee Free Choice Act will help restore fairness to the collective bargaining process by imposing stronger penalties for employers that utilize these tactics. This legislation will also increase the amount of back pay employees receive when they unfairly lose their jobs for attempting to unionize. 
   Furthermore, the Employee Free Choice Act will increase the United States' ability to compete in a global economy. The benefits of collective bargaining go far beyond helping individual workers. By giving workers the tools they need to bargain effectively for the benefits that come with unionizing, we strengthen the economic security of each worker and their families, which ultimately leads to a more secure and prosperous America. 
   In passing this legislation today, we will be giving hardworking Americans the tools they need to negotiate for better wages and benefits in an open, honest, and fair way. Strengthening the security of American families strengthens our economy, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Employee Free Choice Act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of this rule to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program. It is critical that we pass this legislation, and with the funding for SCHIP program scheduled to expire in 5 days from now, it is critical that we pass it today. 
   SCHIP began in 1997 and has been a true success story. While the number of uninsured adults has steadily climbed over the past 10 years, currently 47 million Americans without health insurance, the number of uninsured children in our Nation has declined by nearly a third. 
   This program has made health insurance a reality for over 12,000 children in my home State of Rhode Island this year, the majority of them in families where one or more adults is part of the workforce. It is a critical component of health care delivery in Rhode Island, as it is across the country. 
   By reauthorizing the SCHIP program, we renew our national commitment to achieving the goal of insuring all children whose parents cannot afford private health insurance coverage. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this rule which will allow us to preserve and strengthen this tremendously successful program. It is the compassionate thing to do, it's the right thing to do, and I urge my colleagues to support SCHIP reauthorization.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5749, the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2008, which will provide 13 weeks of extended unemployment compensation benefits for all workers who have exhausted their current 26 weeks of benefits. This measure also provides 13 additional weeks for workers in States with unemployment rates of 6 percent or higher. In order to receive these benefits, workers must have lost a job through no fault of their own, be actively searching for a job, be able to work, and must have a minimum number of weeks worked and amount of wages earned over a specific timeframe prior to being unemployed. 
   This bill provides a critical boost to the many Rhode Islanders, and Americans across the Nation, who are struggling to find employment. Our country's unemployment rate jumped from 5 percent in April to 5.5 percent in May, the biggest one-month increase in over 20 years. In my home State of Rhode Island, the unemployment rate reached 6.1 percent in April, and we have lost an estimated 6,300 jobs since the beginning of the year. H.R. 5749 would provide relief through March 2006 and benefit 3.8 million Americans. Most importantly, this measure would immediately help as many as 8,000 Rhode Islanders. 
   When discussing this matter, we must remember to look beyond the statistics and recognize the serious toll that unemployment is taking on American families. I have received numerous calls from my fellow Rhode Islanders asking when Congress would extend their benefits. They tell me how they are looking for a job, but they just have not been able to find one yet. They have not given up--research has shown that workers who exhaust their unemployment benefits, search for a job at similar or higher levels of intensity as those who find employment before their benefits expire--but they need more time. Compounding the problem, the rising cost of gas poses an additional challenge in searching for a job, and rising food prices have made it even harder to put food on the table. Our constituents are turning to us for help. 
   As Members of Congress, we have the power to give hard-working Americans another chance to continue their job search and provide for their families. Our country has faced economic hardships and recessions before, and I have no doubt we will weather this current downturn. I encourage my colleagues to pass this bill and give a hand up to those who are most vulnerable during these trying times.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (STATE OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss one of the most critical issues facing American families today--the state of the national economy. I want the American people to know that this Congress understands the struggles facing millions of people. And we have been taking steps to provide assistance to those in need. Just last week, we heard the troubling news that our unemployment rate jumped from 5 percent in April to 5.5 percent in May. 
   Now in Rhode Island, the problem is even worse with an unemployment rate of 6.1 percent. Now I strongly support an extension of unemployment insurance to those who exhausted their benefit. And I am disappointed that Republicans blocked its passage in the House earlier today. Unfortunately, our economic woes are not limited, though, to high unemployment. As health care costs and food prices rise, families find themselves forced to decide between buying groceries and medicine, a choice no person should ever have to make. And compounding problems of skyrocketing energy costs have made it tougher for people to fill  their gas tanks while affordable housing has become also increasingly rare. 
   We know what the American people are facing, and we are taking steps to help. Of the many challenges that we are dealing with right now, one important priority for me is to address the housing crisis. Now home ownership has become an unreachable dream for many Rhode Islanders who face the typical monthly housing payments upwards of $2,200. The situation for renters is not much better. The average two-bedroom apartment right now rents for nearly $1,200 a month. Meanwhile our State's foreclosure rate has risen 20 percent in the last few months. I have worked to help Rhode Islanders facing foreclosure, but we need to do more at the national level. 
   I have been proud to support Chairman Frank's efforts to pass comprehensive housing legislation which would significantly increase availability of affordable housing nationwide and help those facing foreclosure to keep their homes. I am certainly hopeful that the Senate will act soon and we will bring swift relief to the American people. 
   Our constituents also face skyrocketing energy costs which are eating up an ever larger portion of disposable income. The average U.S. household spends approximately $1,000 more per year on gasoline than it did 5 years ago. Meanwhile oil and gas companies are reaping record profits while doing nothing to lower prices for consumers. I think this is an absolute outrage. 
   I have strongly advocated a comprehensive energy plan to lower costs, create jobs and improve our environment. As a short-term strategy, this Congress has, among other things, suspended shipments to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to provide more oil to the market. We cracked down on price-fixing among energy companies and passed legislation to repeal massive tax breaks for oil and gas companies. 
   In the longer term, though, we must invest in conservation and domestic production of clean and renewable fuels. This will reduce our reliance on foreign energy sources while creating new jobs in the green energy sector. Unfortunately, the President's stubborn opposition to commonsense initiatives has blocked any real progress. I'm going to keep fighting to move our Nation forward, toward a more responsible energy policy, and I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I am concerned about the state of our Nation's health care system. Right now, approximately 47 million Americans lack health insurance while the rest watch their coverage costs continue their steep climb. That is why I've introduced the American Health Benefits Program Act, which will provide every American with access to the same quality, affordable coverage as Members of Congress. My bipartisan proposal offers a practical model to begin reigning in costs, improving quality and delivering the same level of health care that this country deserves. 
   American prosperity, Mr. Speaker, depends on individual economic security. Only when Americans no longer have to choose between groceries, gas and health care will our economy truly flourish. I am committed to improving the economic outlook for the millions who are struggling, and I will continue working with my colleagues in Congress on this vital and urgent goal. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (RESOLUTION RAISING A QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. I want to thank the gentlelady for yielding, and I also want to thank the gentleman from Virginia for bringing this serious issue to light. 
   As chairman of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, and Science and Technology, I have spent much of the 110th Congress focused on issues of information security. In fact, my subcommittee has held eight hearings and conducted investigations into dozens of cyber security issues. And while I believe we have made some real progress in the last year or so, we still have a lot of work ahead of us. 
   I fully agree with Director of National Intelligence, Mike McConnell, when he says that cyber security is the most significant national security issue facing the Nation today, and it's easy to understand why. 
   We rely on computers in every aspect of our lives, from our banking systems  and our electric grid, to our military and the functions of our Government. And whether we realize it or not, each of us is dependent on the effective functioning of computers. For many years, these systems were largely closed to the outside world, but in the Internet age, this is no longer true. 
   In the history of the world, never have so many people had so much access to ideas, knowledge, and skills. Unfortunately, never before have so many people also possessed the capability to cause such catastrophic economic and physical harm to the United States. 
   Now, this is not a hypothetical threat. In 2007, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff James Cartwright told Congress that ``America is under widespread attack in cyberspace.'' And though we have not seen the massive denial of service attacks that the Nation of Estonia experienced last year, the Federal Government and the private sector have been the victims over the last decade of an extensive and deliberate espionage campaign that has had a significant impact upon our Nation. 
   As Major General William Lord stated publicly last year, ``China has downloaded 10 to 20 terabytes''--again 10 to 20 terabytes--``of data from the DOD's unclassified network.'' That's the equivalent of almost half of the Library of Congress. 
   American businesses, too, have been dramatically affected. One estimate suggests that our companies lose an estimated $70 billion each year due to cyber crime, and individual citizens are far from immune either. Electronic identity theft affects, as you know, millions of us every year. 
   There are a variety of motives for these attacks, but the result is clear: the weakening security and economic stability of our country. National security is a nonpartisan issue, and we must all work together to commit the resources and the manpower necessary to respond to this threat. 
   The situation raised by Congressman Wolf today illustrates that while the House of Representatives has strong information protections in place, cyber security threats pose a challenge to computer systems everywhere, and it is an ever-evolving and dynamic threat. And we need to do all we can to stay out in front of it and ahead of it. 
   Now, I'm pleased that the House leadership takes this issue very seriously and is taking action to ensure that House systems are properly secured, and I especially commend House Administration Chairman Bob Brady for directing the Chief Administration Officer to immediately adopt additional protections for House computers. 
   I also want to commend the gentlelady from California (Ms. Zoe Lofgren) for her due diligence and passion about cyber security as well, and I certainly appreciate the working relationship, good working relationship, that she and I have together. 
   I am ready to do anything I can to help ensure that our House information systems are as secure as possible. Recognizing that this issue is much larger than the House of Representatives, I am also committed to addressing the broader issues of cyber security across the Federal domain and the national critical infrastructure. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that our Federal Government is educated and prepared at all levels to thwart cyber attacks and protect the integrity of our networks.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, today the House is addressing two of the most important issues facing our Nation: The Iraq war and the poor state of our economy. We have the opportunity to force a change in our Iraq strategy while providing much-needed assistance to returning troops and Americans struggling to make ends meet. 
   In October 2002, I voted against the resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq, and more than 5 years later, it is abundantly clear that our Nation needs a new approach in Iraq so that we can bring our men and women in uniform home. I am extremely proud of the service and sacrifice of our troops and their families, and the best way to demonstrate our support is by welcoming them home with the services and resources they need. I strongly support the amendment before us today that requires U.S. forces to begin redeployment from Iraq within 30 days, with a goal of withdrawing nearly all troops by the end of 2009. Recognizing the toll that extended deployments are having on our readiness, the amendment also requires the Department of Defense to adhere to its policy of providing sufficient rest and recuperation time for troops returning from combat. Repeated and unpredictable deployments have placed enormous stress on our military and their families, and if we don't make changes soon, we risk losing the men and women who have made our armed forces the best in the world. 
   Another amendment before us would recognize the service of our troops by establishing a new GI Bill of Rights. Under this plan, which is supported by a broad array of veterans groups, servicemembers returning from Iraq or Afghanistan would qualify for educational assistance based on the amount of time served. Those serving three years on active duty would receive benefits to cover the costs of a 4-year education, based on the costs of the most expensive in-state public school. This new program will allow our military returning from combat to advance their careers and develop skills that will help improve our economy. 
   Finally, the measure recognizes the importance of providing assistance to our citizens struggling in the recent economic downturn. Congress has been working swiftly to address the housing crisis and the skyrocketing costs of food and energy, but we need to make sure that we help those who need it now. This legislation provides an additional 13 weeks of unemployment benefits to those who have exhausted their regular 26 weeks of benefits--a provision that could help as many as 24,400 Rhode Islanders. Unemployed Americans want to get back to work, but in many places jobs are scarce. We must not punish them for the failings of our economy, and this emergency spending measure demonstrates Congress's commitment to those in greatest need. 
   We have a chance today to reject the status quo policies of the Bush administration by setting new priorities for our Nation. I urge my colleagues to support efforts to prevent further blank check funding for Iraq, endorse a responsible new strategy for bringing our troops home and provide support to Americans struggling to make ends meet.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise in support of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act and to be a part of a Congress that has made this a top priority. 
   I particularly want to recognize the great work of Congresswoman DeGette, the gentlewoman from Colorado, for her outstanding leadership in this issue, and the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle) for his leadership as well. 
   This legislation, Mr. Speaker, has strong bipartisan support in both Chambers of Congress. It enjoys the support of up to 70 percent of the American people, and this legislation, stem cell research, offers hope and the promise of a cure to millions of people around the world who are struggling with some of life's most challenging chronic conditions and diseases and disabilities. 
   Mr. Speaker, I became paralyzed almost 27 years ago as a young police cadet, standing in a locker room when a police officer's gun accidentally discharged, the bullet going into my neck and severing my spinal cord. 
   It's been an incredible journey and, at times, a difficult one. I was told  back then that I would never walk again, but I have hope and faith, and I've always believed that somehow, through the miracle of science and research, that some day they would find a cure for spinal cord injuries. That day, that hope of a cure, has never been more real than it is today because of stem cell research. 
   Now, I recognize, though, this isn't just about JIM LANGEVIN or people suffering from spinal cord injuries. This is also about the millions of other people across America and throughout the world who are suffering from diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, juvenile diabetes, cancer and so many others, that could potentially be helped by stem cell research. 
   Now, I have to be the first to admit that my understanding of stem cell research has evolved and involved ongoing education, thought and prayer. In fact, unlike many of my colleagues who support the stem cell research bill before us, I'm opposed to abortion. The fact that my life hung by a thread, I'm reminded every day how precious a gift life truly is. 
   But I'm committed to the protection of life at all stages, and I've not taken my decision to support this legislation lightly. 
   Over the years, I had the good fortune to learn about stem cell research from some of America's renowned scientists, pro-life leaders like Senator ORRIN HATCH and also a dear friend who is certainly on my mind today, Christopher Reeve. So many people have helped me to come to the position to support this research, again because of the hope that it offers. 
   Now, in addition to all of these reasons, I believe that this legislation is vitally important because it provides appropriate safeguards for those that are in S. 5 so it can be done ethically and responsibly. 
   This offers great hope, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2560, the Human Cloning Prohibition Act. In recent years, Congress has debated various means of banning human cloning. In an area that can be complex and confusing, I am pleased that this bill, which is exceptionally simple and straightforward, has come to the floor here today. Clearly some of my colleagues on the other side of this issue are among those who find it too complex and are confused. Hopefully we can clarify that before the vote today. 
   H.R. 2560 would make it illegal to use cloning technology to initiate a pregnancy and thereby create a cloned human being. The bill also includes strict penalties to insure that such an Act is prevented from taking place. Unfortunately, there seems to be some misinformation circulating among my colleagues and outside groups surrounding the implications of this bill. 
   I want to be very clear, this legislation in no way encourages or endorses therapeutic cloning, otherwise known as somatic cell nuclear transfer or any other type of research. On the contrary, this legislation will simply ensure that as technology advances, ethical safeguards are in place to keep human cloning, something we all agree would be a frightening development, from occurring. 
   For the record, there are no incentives included in this bill, not even any words of encouragement, for any specific types of research. This bill is a simple ban on human cloning once and for all. 
   Regardless of my colleagues' feelings on stem cell research or any other type of medical research, I cannot imagine why any of them would oppose a ban on human cloning. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope all of my colleagues will take the time to understand what this bill does and what it does not do and why it is important and vote in favor of H.R. 2560.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1591, legislation that would chart a new course for the United States in Iraq. I commend the gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr. Obey, and the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Murtha, for their leadership and for drafting a measure that answers Americans' calls for real change. 
   Four years after our nation initiated military operations in Iraq, America demands a new approach to this open-ended conflict that has resulted in the deaths of more than 3,200 service members, including at least 25 with strong ties to Rhode Island. Our operations in Iraq have endangered the ability of our armed forces to respond to other crises, distracted from efforts to fight al Qaeda and the Taliban, and damaged our international reputation. Our military now finds itself in the middle of a civil war, and it is time to bring our troops home. 
   Despite calls by the Iraq Study Group for a new approach to the ``grave and deteriorating'' situation in Iraq, President Bush has proposed escalating military operations, sending more troops to prosecute a war mismanaged from the start by the civilian leadership. Fortunately, we have another choice. The House of Representatives will vote today on an emergency spending bill that would, for the first time, set a clear deadline to end U.S. combat operations in Iraq. As one who originally voted against giving the President authority to invade Iraq, I will proudly support this Democratic measure as the first real step to end the war. 
   Last November, an American public dissatisfied with President Bush's Iraq policy elected a Democratic Congress that promised a new direction. Having heard frustration from so many Rhode Islanders, I have worked with the Democratic leadership to develop a better strategy. I spoke of my conversations with military families and advocacy groups to underscore the sincerity and passion of Rhode Islanders' call for change. Meanwhile, Democratic leaders consulted with an array of current and former military commanders, foreign policy experts and advocates, with committees holding more than 100 hearings on operations in Iraq. 
   The bill before us is the direct result of those efforts and reflects the will of the American people. Not only does it demand accountability by establishing clear benchmarks for Iraqis to take control of their own security, but it also sets a deadline to bring our troops home--no later than August 2008. This measure sends a clear signal to the President and the world that we do not intend to remain an occupying force in Iraq. 
   The bill also addresses other serious problems facing our military andf their families. President Bush has recommended sending more troops into harm's way, but has not provided the resources they need upon their return home, as demonstrated by reports of substandard care at facilities such as Walter Reed Medical Center. With nearly 25,000 American troops--among them 93 Rhode Islanders--injured in Iraq thus far, the House spending bill provides an additional $2.8 billion for military health care and $1.7 billion for veterans' health care to ensure that those who have sacrificed for our nation get the support and treatment they deserve. 
   Furthermore, the bill adds critical funds to restore our military readiness and re-equip National Guard and Reserve forces, which face major shortages as a result of operations in Iraq. Lt. General H. Steven Blum, Chief of the National Guard Bureau, has stated that 88 percent of Army Guard units and 45 percent of Air Guard units are unprepared for deployment as a result of equipment shortages. We depend on our National Guard to protect us in the event of catastrophes or natural disasters, and we must ensure they are fully prepared to defend the Nation they serve. 
   In Congress, I have constantly strived to protect our national security and to support our military, which has served valiantly in some incredibly challenging missions. At this point, though, the Iraqis' problems no longer require a U.S. military solution. The underlying causes of violence are primarily political and must be addressed as such. Unlike the President's plan, which promises more of the same failed policy, the Democratic approach will support the political process to end sectarian divisions in Iraq, help rebuild the economy and infrastructure, and promote maximum diplomatic efforts to bring an end to the violence. 
   Some have argued that the bill does not go far enough. Like them, I support an even earlier exit for our troops and have co-sponsored legislation to redeploy them out of Iraq by December 31, 2007. However, there is no question that the Democratic measure being offered marks a major turning point and answers Rhode Islanders' pleas by setting a firm deadline for withdrawal. This is a tremendous step--one which serves our troops, our constituents, and our conscience--and I will wholeheartedly support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise in support of H.R. 6, which will help our Nation take a major step toward energy independence. 
   We must recognize that we cannot dig or drill our way out of our energy crisis and must move away from our reliance on oil and gas. Our nation deserves a comprehensive energy policy that guarantees access to affordable power, encourages energy conservation efforts, and pursues increased use of environmentally responsible and renewable sources of energy. H.R. 6 moves us in exactly that direction. It will close expensive loopholes and end giveaways to oil and gas companies and invest those dollars in clean and renewable sources of energy here in the United States. 
   I have strongly supported efforts to develop and adopt new sources of energy, not only for the important environmental benefits they create, but also for their positive impact on our economy and national security. Just as our Nation worked together to put a man on the moon, we must now unite behind an energy policy that enhances national security, creates American jobs, and protects our environment. We must harness Americans' ingenuity and creativity to make the United States a world leader in new energy technology and move our nation toward energy independence. 
   Many of my colleagues have talked for a long time about how we need to end our addiction to foreign sources of energy. Today we finally have an opportunity to follow through on our promises by voting for H.R. 6.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I am proud to join my colleagues in appreciation of our troops' exceptional service and sacrifice, and to voice my opposition to President Bush's plan to send more forces into what amounts to a civil war. 
   As a former member of the House Armed Services Committee and a new member of the Intelligence Committee, I recognize that our next steps in Iraq present one of the greatest security decisions our Nation has faced in decades. 
   The Iraq Study Group called the situation grave and deteriorating and said it requires a new approach. I agree. We can all conclude that an unstable Iraq, torn by sectarian conflict, would lead to continued violence and civilian casualties, provide combat training opportunities to those who would do us harm, and pose increased challenges to the region. 
   Yet I disagree with President Bush's misguided belief that sending more Americans into combat will solve the problem. 
   Our military has served valiantly for nearly 4 years, particularly in some very challenging and nontraditional missions, in some cases for which they were never trained. However, we have done all that we could do militarily to help the Iraqi people, and their problems no longer require a U.S. military solution. The underlying causes of violence are primarily political and must be addressed in that framework. Sending more troops would simply be a continuation of the same failed strategy. 
   In October of 2002, I expressed my concerns that President Bush's approach to Iraq could have dangerous ramifications in the region and America's own efforts in the war on terrorism. For those reasons and many others, I voted against authorizing use of force against Iraq, a war that was mismanaged by civilian leadership from the start. 
   Now, to address our troops' lack of protective gear and up-armored Humvees, I supported legislation to provide additional funding for proper equipment, as well as other efforts to assure our forces would be safe and effective. Now, however, we can best support our troops by changing our mission in Iraq and adopting a new strategy that reflects the realities on the ground. The Iraqis must now take the lead in providing for their own security, and we must reduce our presence to let them do so. 
   The President's claim that by adding 21,500 additional combat troops we can force a greater stability in Iraq is an argument that ignores some basic truths. Not only have past surges of U.S. forces proved unnecessary in reducing sectarian violence among Iraqis, but the addition of more troops would further inflame anti-American sentiment and turn popular opinion even more against us in our efforts. We have no proof that another surge would lead to a different outcome than in the past, but we do know that it would have negative consequences. 
   Now, perhaps of greatest concern is the impact of the surge on our military readiness. The President's estimate of 21,500 more combat troops does not count the additional 15,000 to 28,000 support troops that would be needed, spreading our military even more dangerously thin. 
   Madam Speaker, we have asked much of our forces, included repeated deployments, and a surge will only exacerbate that problem. Operations in Iraq have also taken their toll on our equipment. 
   According to the Government Accountability Office, 40 percent of the Army's and Marine Corps' equipment is now located in the Central Command theater of operations. Our National Guard/Reserve units are underequipped to deal with emergencies, and we have depleted our preposition stocks, which we need to respond quickly to other contingencies. 
   Now, in testimony before the Armed Services Committee in January, General Conway, Commandant of the Marine Corps, noted that an increase in forces in Iraq would increase our strategic risk and possibly lead to slower and less effective response to another potential threat. 
   Madam Speaker, sending more troops to Iraq is a dangerous gamble with our national security, and we need a new approach. A number of experts, including the Iraq Study Group, had made important recommendations, and they must not be ignored. 
   It is clear that the President's plan for escalation would harm our national security and ignores the will of the American people. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution so that we can promote a new strategy for Iraq and bring our troops home.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (NO CHILD LEFT INSIDE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3036, the No Child Left Inside Act, which would amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to promote the expansion and development of environmental education in our classrooms from kindergarten to grade 12. 
   Environmental education is so important for our students, especially with the growing crisis facing our climate. Yet across the country, these types of programs are facing cuts due to school budget woes. H.R. 3036 helps alleviate this problem by extending the National Environmental Education Act through 2009 and strengthening the Environmental Education Training program under current law. This legislation also establishes the National Capacity Environmental Education Grant Program, which would authorize the Secretary of Education to award 1-3 year competitive grants to nonprofit organizations, state educational agencies, local education agencies, or institutions of higher education. 
   The No Child Left Inside Act will help our students see the real world beyond the classroom and better prepare them for the 21st century. I am proud that my home State of Rhode Island already stands out in this area because of its steadfast commitment to protecting its resources--the Narragansett Bay, beaches, parks and forests, lakes and rivers, and other beloved spaces. Rhode Island has been ahead of the curve in promoting renewable energy sources and conducting climate change research. Now we must work to make sure this legacy is passed on to future generations. Just as we have worked in our cities and towns to preserve the environment, we must ensure that our national policies build on these actions. With so many teachers and students already involved, the No Child Left Inside Act will only boost our work in Rhode Island. 
   I would like to thank my colleague, Congressman Sarbanes, for introducing this bill, as well as my colleague and fellow Rhode Islander, Senator Jack Reed, for introducing the companion bill. 
    Mr. Chairman, this bill has bipartisan support and both environmental groups and schools are ready to implement these programs. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise in strong support of H.R. 6, which will help our Nation take a major step towards energy independence. This legislation is truly historic, and I commend all of the sponsors and all who had a hand in bringing this legislation to the floor today. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot dig or drill our way out of our energy crisis. We need a better way. We need new strategies to develop sources of energy that will move our Nation away from our reliance on oil and gas. This legislation will benefit our environment by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, our economy by creating new industries and jobs, and our national security by reducing our dependence on foreign oil. 
   I am particularly pleased that H.R. 6 includes the first significant increase in automobile fuel economy standards in a generation. We have the technology to make our vehicles more efficient, and it is past time that we do so. While I wish that the bill retained the renewable electricity standards and the tax provisions that the House passed, I will keep working with my colleagues to see those efforts someday become law in the very near future. 
   In closing, I commend the many people who put together this historic legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3685, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. This important measure demonstrates Congress's commitment to combating prejudice and ensures that Americans will not be denied access to employment because of their sexual orientation. 
   Current Federal law prevents employment discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion, national origin, or disability. As a person with a disability, I know how important those Federal protections are for people who want to contribute to the workforce. Unfortunately, too many Americans are still able to be fired based on their sexual orientation. I am proud I come from a State where discrimination based on sexual orientation is against the law, but in 30 States, a person may be fired from a job simply for being gay, lesbian, or bisexual. We need a strong Federal law to protect those Americans and end a practice that is contrary to the American promise of equality and opportunity for all. 
   The Employment Non-Discrimination Act would prohibit employers from using an individual's sexual orientation as the sole basis for employment decisions. As previously mentioned, Rhode Island is one of 20 States that have comparable State laws. Similarly, a growing number of companies are incorporating non-discrimination policies because they recognize that they should be recruiting and retaining the best individuals for the job, irrespective of a person's sexual orientation. However, despite these advances, too many Americans still face discrimination in the workplace. Today we have the opportunity to make a stand for civil rights and equality by passing ENDA. 
   I also want to voice my strong support for an amendment to be offered by the gentlewoman from Wisconsin, Ms. Baldwin, which would prevent discrimination based on gender identity. Rhode Island is one of 12 States that protect gender identity in employment, and our experience has been a positive one. Transgender individuals often have their own set of challenges in the workplace, and we must ensure that their rights are protected as well. I am deeply disappointed that the underlying bill does not include gender identity, especially as I am a cosponsor of a fully inclusive ENDA. Today, the House of Representatives is sending a clear message to the Nation that no American should face discrimination at work or in society, and I think we are missing an unprecedented opportunity to make the measure as inclusive as possible. However, if the Baldwin amendment is unsuccessful, I pledge to work with her and other supporters to see this important provision enacted into law. 
   I would like to thank everyone who contributed to developing this legislation and bringing it to the floor for a historic vote. I urge all of my colleagues to make a strong stand for equal rights and support H.R. 3685.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2641, the Energy and Water Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2008. I commend Chairman VISCLOSKY for his efforts on this measure and for investing in the needs of our Nation's future. 
   As a former member of the House Armed Services Committee and as chair of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity and Science and Technology, I am particularly pleased that this bill recognizes the importance of nuclear non-proliferation efforts. I have become convinced that the nuclear terrorist threat is real, requiring the full and urgent attention of our government. We have learned about the relative ease with which a terrorist can build a crude nuclear device, and we need to do all we can to prevent the nightmare scenario in which someone smuggles a device onto U.S. soil and detonates it in a city. 
   We must pursue a three-pronged approach of prevention, detection, and response. I have supported efforts to increase our radiation detection capabilities at our ports of entry, as well as to improve our government response efforts if our nation is ever attacked with a nuclear or radiological device. 
   This bill addresses the third component of that strategy--securing nuclear material at its source. This measure increases funds for the National Nuclear Security Administration to secure nuclear weapons and materials in the former Soviet Republic. The NNSA's efforts are vital to improving the security of nuclear materials at civilian, naval, and nuclear weapons complex facilities, and helping Russia dispose of plutonium removed from nuclear weapons. 
   However, the challenge of fissile material security goes far beyond Russia and the former Soviet Union and will require our government to expand its non-proliferation programs outside of the former Soviet Union. The revelations of A.Q. Khan's black market proliferation network, for example, provided a striking wake-up call that we must focus on other nuclear states if we are going to be successful in deterring nuclear terrorism. Consequently, the bill more than doubles funding--providing $251 million--for the Global Threat Reduction Initiative, which aims to identify, secure, remove, and facilitate the disposition of high-risk, vulnerable nuclear and radiological materials and equipment around the world. 
   Again, I thank Chairman VISCLOSKY for his leadership on nuclear non-proliferation programs and for his fine work in crafting this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, we are meeting today to again consider the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act--a critical piece of legislation, but one that none of us look forward to voting on. During this difficult economic crisis, I am proud of this Congress for coming together at a crucial moment to reach a bipartisan compromise to rescue not only our financial markets but our entire economy. However, no one is celebrating today about the tough decisions that had to be made. 
   Over the last two weeks hundreds of Rhode Islanders have contacted my office expressing serious concerns about the proposal and a firm belief that the taxpayers' needs must be a priority. I share their anger and frustration that for far too long, many on Wall Street were given carte blanche to make increasingly risky investments--investments which, in some cases, the firms themselves didn't even fully understand. There is plenty of blame to go around, from Wall Street and mortgage lenders to government regulators and Congress. Unfortunately, the actions of these firms do not take place in a bubble: they are inextricably linked to the every day transactions of every day American families. Our economy is in dire shape and drastic action is needed. If we do not act now, a domino effect could easily trigger major job losses and a significant period of economic downturn with negative consequences not just on Wall Street, but on every street in our country. 
   This crisis originated with faulty lending practices and the creation of subprime mortgages made to people who often could not afford to pay them back. These subprime mortgages were then pooled together into packages that were transformed into highly-rated securities purchased around the world. The eventual collapse of the subprime mortgage market infected the prime mortgage market, which in turn poisoned the entire financial system. In response, Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson proposed a plan under which the Federal Government would buy--at a deep discount--so-called ``toxic'' assets, which currently no one is willing to buy. These assets include home mortgages which have been bundled into such complex packages that there is great uncertainty about their underlying value. Secretary Paulson considers these purchases to be investments by the federal government, which could return a substantial proportion of their value to American taxpayers once the market has settle down. 
   I recognize the urgency of the situation and understand that Secretary Paulson and all responsible government leaders are trying to ward off even worse outcomes. This year, we have seen the fall of some of the largest investment banks in the world--Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch--and the last two standing--Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs--last week 
   chose to be switched over to commercial banks, seeking greater protection at the price of greater regulation. Meanwhile, the federal government loaned $85 billion to American International Group, Inc., AIG, the 18th largest company in the world, when it was unable to access credit for its daily operations. On September 26, we also saw the biggest bank failure in our country's history when Washington Mutual collapsed. One week later, Wachovia had been bought out by another bank. Even Bank of America recently decided it would no longer extend new lines of credit to McDonald's franchisees, which have been turning a profit for years and run a clean balance sheet. 
   When the credit market seizes up at the highest levels, it is not just a problem for Wall  Street. It quickly impacts all of us, making it harder for average families to secure car loans, home loans or mortgage refinancing. It means that small business owners can't access the quick capital they need to make payroll or invest in their companies. It impacts the student loan market, where more than 50 firms have abandoned or cut back their student loan programs. And it threatens the pensions and savings that our retirees are counting on. While no one wanted to be in this position, I do believe that passing this rescue plan is essential for Rhode Island families. 
   However, I have been vocal about my own concerns with the Administration's original proposal, and early on I outlined priorities that must be included in any bill I would be able to support. I am pleased that the legislation before us today is a vast improvement over the initial plan Secretary Paulson presented, and it contains significant protections for families across the country who had nothing to do with creating this crisis but are feeling its effects in many ways. First, this bill protects taxpayers by requiring strong Congressional oversight over expenditures under the plan; giving taxpayers a share of profits in participating companies; and requiring a President to ensure taxpayers are repaid in full, with Wall Street making up any difference. Furthermore, we have endured that CEOs do not benefit from risky behavior by severely limiting executive compensation and ``golden parachute'' packages for any firms that take advantage of the government assistance. Finally, the bill requires the government to implement a plan to reduce foreclosures as it buys troubled financial assets like mortgage backed securities. 
   At its core, H.R. 1424 authorizes $700 billion for the Treasury Department to buy distressed mortgage-backed securities, expiring on December 31, 2009. Of that total, $250 billion would be for immediate release, with another $100 billion upon a presidential certification of need. The final $350 billion could be made available if the president transmits a written report to Congress requesting the funds, and Congress would have the right to disapprove this last installment. Spending authority would be overseen by a new Financial Stability Oversight Board, which will review the Treasury Department's actions and its effects on the financial markets and the housing market, and by a special inspector general office to conduct and supervise audits and investigations of the actions taken under this bill. Treasury must also report to Congress 60 days after it begins using this authority, and every 30 days thereafter. 
   Furthermore, H.R. 1424 establishes a joint congressional oversight panel to review the current state of the financial markets and the regulatory system. This panel will submit a report on the current regulatory system and its effectiveness at overseeing the participants in the financial system and protecting consumers. This provision is critical, since going forward, we must ensure that our financial sector is no longer allowed to put ordinary Americans in danger by pursuing high-risk behavior with little to no oversight. We must investigate companies that took advantage of lenient regulation or possibly acted outside of federal regulations entirely. And we must learn from our mistakes, establishing new regulations and ensuring the laws already on the books are enforced. 
   Madam Speaker, in just the four days since the House defeated the original economic recovery bill, we have already seen clear signs of what awaits our country if we do not take action today. Within hours after that first vote, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 800 points, its biggest point drop in history. The markets have remained shaky, threatening the financial holdings and retirement savings of millions of American families. Meanwhile, anxiety continues to rise in industries across the country, from agriculture to manufacturing. Countless businesses, small and large, are having trouble securing credit for everyday operations and they are terrified of what the future might hold. Car loans are becoming more expensive, mortgages more difficult to obtain. And on Monday, Wachovia limited the access of nearly 1,000 colleges and universities to their own funds invested with the bank. 
   These are troubling warning signals of the potential for real economic catastrophe if we do not come together as a Congress and show the real leadership on difficult issues that our constituents expect. This is not an easy vote for any of us, but I am convinced that it is the right one. I know it is not a perfect bill, but rarely is there a perfect solution to such a complex and troubling set of problems. I believe the revised measure before us today is somewhat improved over the original version, largely due to the inclusion of an increase in FDIC coverage for bank accounts from $100,000 to $250,000. Unfortunately, I am disappointed that the tax extenders legislation--which I was happy to support when its costs were fully paid for--has been added to this bill without sufficient offsets. Nonetheless, I will again cast a vote in favor of this package because it is too important to fail again. 
   Madam Speaker, let me close by assuring my colleagues and my constituents that if I thought the bill before us today was nothing more than a hand-out to high-flying Wall Street investors who suddenly found themselves in trouble and decided they didn't like losing money, I would be the first in line to cast a no vote. Unfortunately, this problem is much bigger and much less selective about whom it might hurt. We need to take action, and we need to do it now. This legislation represents a good, bipartisan solution to a situation none of us wanted to find ourselves in. I want to thank speaker Pelosi, Chairman Frank and many other colleagues for their tireless work on this bill. I encourage all my colleagues to vote for this bill.

   Mr. LANGEVIN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act and against this motion to recommit. 
   My friends, this is a cynical attempt by the Republican leadership to kill a bill that they never liked from the start. Too many people worked too hard and for too long on this legislation to let it be derailed now. 
   274 Members have cosponsored the bill. Three committees have passed it. And my two good friends, Patrick Kennedy and Jim Ramstad, have worked for years to reach this vote today. I will not let their hard work be for nothing. 
   Mr. Speaker, I know what it's like to live every day with a disability and how important it is to have the care and the resources that allow me to live a normal life. See, you can see my disability. It's obvious. But with a wheelchair, with adaptive equipment, it really levels the playing field. With other support I can live a very fulfilling and normal life. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, there are millions of people across this country who live with a silent disability, a hidden disability, struggling day in and day out with substance abuse, mental illness, chemical imbalance, other mental illness challenges, and they don't have the support that they need, and they struggle day in and day out. They don't have the support they need because they don't have mental health parity. We have the opportunity to change that and give them the care and the support that they need to live a normal life. 
   Patrick Kennedy, my good friend, has had the courage to speak for all those suffering from the hidden disability of mental illness. He's been a champion and a leader, and millions of people across this country are looking to him right now and they will be looking at all of us to pass this bill and allow them the access and the care and the treatment that they deserve. We can't let them down. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill and reject this cynical attempt and specious motion to recommit.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2007, which I am proud to cosponsor. I know many people have worked hard to bring this important measure to the floor, including my friend from Minnesota, the co-chair of the Bipartisan Disabilities Caucus, Mr. RAMSTAD. Most of all, I would like to recognize the commitment and perseverance of my good friend and colleague from Rhode Island, PATRICK KENNEDY. PATRICK has been my good friend for many years, and I have watched him harness his passion and his knowledge to address the challenges faced by those with mental illness. He has raised awareness about a topic that had previously been considered taboo by the American people, using his own personal experiences to humanize the issue of mental health. I know that the people of Rhode Island admire his leadership, and I thank him for his tireless efforts. 
   Mental illnesses and substance abuse problems are at epidemic levels in this country. According to recent estimates, more than 35 million Americans experience the disabling symptoms of mental illness. Depression alone costs employers over $35 billion dollars a year in lost productivity, and that figure does not even factor in the multitude of other behavioral and psychological disorders that challenge our society on a daily basis. Substance abuse also directly affects an estimated 25 million Americans. An additional 40 million are indirectly affected once family members of abusers and the injured victims of intoxicated drivers are considered. Put simply, the social and monetary costs of these problems are astounding. 
   This bipartisan legislation makes tremendous strides in ending the inherent discrimination in our insurance system against patients seeking treatment for these illnesses. It permanently reauthorizes and expands the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 to provide for equity in the coverage of mental health and substance-related disorders. It does not achieve equity by mandating that group health plans provide mental health coverage. However, if a plan chooses to offer coverage--as it rightfully should--then the coverage it offers must be no more restrictive in the financial requirements or treatment limits that are provided for medical or surgical disorders. This will mean equity in deductibles and co-pays, as well as in the frequency and number of visits. It will also establish parity for out-of-network coverage. In short, it will vastly expand coverage and access for those seeking treatment for their mental health. 
   Mental health parity is already available to members of Congress and over 8 million Federal employees under the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, FEHBP, at minimal additional cost to the program. It is time that we extend this benefit to all Americans, and this legislation takes us considerably closer to that goal. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (STEM CELL DEBATE -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, in recent months, researchers have created apparent embryonic stem cells from reprogrammed adult skin cells. This is an exciting new breakthrough, known as induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPS, which is an important and incredible milestone. However, it should not halt our efforts towards embryonic stem research. The iPS method is still in its earliest stages, and there is widespread debate among the scientific community as to the safety and effectiveness of its practical application. 
   Embryonic stem cell research remains the gold standard for potential therapeutic use. Further, it has laid the foundation of scientific knowledge that has made these recent discoveries possible. We should not abandon one area of research just because we have made progress in another. We must continue our investment, both public and private, into all areas of responsible stem cell research, whether that is adult stem cell research, embryonic stem cell research, or this new, exciting iPS method. It is the right thing to do. It offers great potential to offering cures for millions of people suffering from some of life's most challenging chronic conditions and diseases. The hope of millions of Americans depends on it.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2642, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2008. This measure shows what a high priority our Nation places on providing for our servicemembers, their families and our veterans. 
   The new Democratic leadership in Congress has faced many challenges in recent months regarding the treatment of servicemembers and veterans. Earlier this year, we learned about horrific conditions at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, including overused outpatient housing in disrepair, patients confused about where to go after serious operations, and the tangled bureaucracy confronting servicemembers and their families. It was clear that administrative policies needed to be revised, not only at Walter Reed, but across the system at locations both here and abroad. 
   It was also clear that increasing the funding level for military health care was a priority. As a result, Congress passed a supplemental spending bill that contained an additional $1.8 billion for veterans' health care, and today we will pass a bill that is $6.7 billion above fiscal year 2007 funds and $3.8 billion over President Bush's request. The total amount in this bill is even more than what is requested in the Independent Budget, a needs estimate published by four veterans' service groups. If passed, H.R. 2642 will mark the largest annual increase to VA health care funding in over 75 years. 
   Mr. Chairman, we must ensure that servicemembers wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan have the services they require and as well anticipate the increasing number of returning veterans who have earned their promised benefits. To that end, H.R. 2642 provides $43.2 billion for veterans medical care to alleviate the backlogged claims processing system and fund improvements for VA facilities. I am also pleased that this measure allots $600 million for new initiatives for improving mental health and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) centers, $1.9 billion to improve the electronic health records system, and $130 million to assist homeless veterans. 
   After a recent visit to the Providence VA Medical Center, I was impressed with the treatment of veterans, as well as the ongoing innovative research at the facility. I am also optimistic that upcoming construction projects will improve the facility, especially knowing that the VA will play a larger role in the coming years as more servicemembers return from ongoing conflicts. Today's bill provides $4.1 billion for ongoing maintenance and renovations of existing facilities, which will help Providence attain its goals. I am also pleased that $15 million is allocated for the Health Care Sharing Incentive Fund, which allows the Department of Defense and VA to increase research, improve access to care, and ensure a seamless transition for our veterans. 
   H.R. 2642 also includes $21.4 billion for military construction. This amount is $5.1 billion above the amount for fiscal year 2007, and will fully fund Base Realignment and Closure. This funding will also help improve training and quality of life facilities for active duty troops and members of the National Guard and Reserves, all of whom are playing critical roles in ongoing conflicts and need our support now more than ever. Finally, this measure includes $2.8 billion to help increase the size of the Army, Marine Corps, the National Guard and Reserves over the next five years. 
   Mr. Chairman, we must maintain strong support for our men and women in uniform and all those who have bravely served our nation, and H.R. 2642 will do just that. May we all keep those currently serving abroad in our thoughts and wish them a safe return home.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, we're here today with the unenviable task of considering H.R. 3997, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. During this difficult economic crisis, I am proud of this Congress for coming together at a critical moment to reach a bipartisan compromise to rescue our financial markets and, indeed, our entire economy. However, no one is celebrating today about the tough decisions that had to be made. 
   Over the last week hundreds of Rhode Islanders have contacted my office expressing serious concerns about the proposal and a firm belief that the taxpayers' needs must be a priority. I share their anger and frustration that for far too long, many on Wall Street were given carte blanche to make increasingly risky investments--investments which, in some cases, the firms themselves didn't even fully understand. There is plenty of blame to go around, from Wall Street to government regulators to Congress. Unfortunately, the actions of these firms do not take place in a bubble: they are inextricably linked to the everyday transactions of everyday American families. Our economy is in dire shape and drastic action is needed. If we do not act now, a domino effect could easily trigger major job losses and a significant period of economic downturn with negative consequences not just on Wall Street, but on every street in our country. 
   This crisis originated with faulty lending practices and the creation of subprime mortgages made to people who often could not afford to pay them back. These subprime mortgages were then pooled together into packages that were transformed into highly rated securities purchased around the world. The eventual collapse of the subprime mortgage market then infected the prime mortgage market, which in turn poisoned the entire financial system. In response, Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson proposed a plan under which the Federal Government would buy--at a deep discount--so-called ``toxic'' assets, which currently no one is willing to buy. These assets include home mortgages which have been bundled into such complex packages that there is great uncertainty about their underlying value. Secretary Paulson considers these purchases to be investments by the Federal Government, which could return a substantial proportion of their value to American taxpayers once the market has settled down. 
   I recognize the urgency of the situation and understand that Secretary Paulson and all responsible government leaders are trying to ward off even worse outcomes. This year, we have seen the fall of some of the largest investment banks in the world--Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch--and the last two standing--Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs--last week chose to be switched over to commercial banks, seeking greater protection at the price of greater regulation. Meanwhile, the Federal Government loaned $85 billion to American Insurance Group, Inc. (AIG), the 18th largest company in the world, when it was unable to access credit for its daily operations. On September 26, we also saw the biggest bank failure of our country's history when Washington Mutual collapsed. Just this morning, Wachovia was bought out  by another bank. Even Bank of America recently decided it would no longer extend new lines of credit to McDonald's franchisees, which have been turning a profit for years and run a clean balance sheet. 
   When the credit market seizes up at the highest levels, it is not just a problem for Wall Street. It quickly impacts all of us, making it harder for average families to secure car loans, home loans or mortgage refinancing. It means that small business owners can't access the quick capital they need to make payroll or invest in their companies. It impacts the student loan market, where more than 50 firms have abandoned or cut back their student loan programs. And it threatens the pensions and savings that our retirees are counting on. While no one wanted to be in this position, I do believe that passing this rescue plan is essential for Rhode Island families. 
   However, I have been vocal about my own concerns with the administration's original proposal, and I have outlined priorities that must be included in any bill I would be able to support. I am pleased that the legislation before us today is a vast improvement over the initial plan Secretary Paulson presented 10 days ago, and it contains significant protections for families across the country who had nothing to do with creating this crisis but are feeling its effects in many ways. First, this bill protects taxpayers by requiring strong congressional oversight over expenditures under the plan; giving taxpayers a share of profits in participating companies; and requiring a President to ensure taxpayers are repaid in full, with Wall Street making up any difference. Furthermore, we have ensured that CEOs do not benefit from risky behavior by severely limiting executive compensation and ``golden parachute'' packages for any firms that take advantage of the Government assistance. Finally, the bill requires the Government to implement a plan to reduce foreclosures as it buys troubled financial assets like mortgage backed securities. 
   At its core, H.R. 3997 authorizes $700 billion for the Treasury Department to buy distressed mortgage-backed securities, expiring on December 31, 2009. Of that total, $250 billion would be for immediate release, with another $100 billion upon a Presidential certification of need. The final $350 billion could be made available if the President transmits a written report to Congress requesting the funds, and Congress would have the right to disapprove this last installment. Spending authority would be overseen by a new Financial Stability Oversight Board, which will review the Treasury Department's actions and its effects on the financial markets and the housing market, and by a special inspector general office to conduct and supervise audits and investigations of the actions taken under this bill. Treasury must also report to Congress 60 days after it begins using this authority, and every 30 days thereafter. 
   Furthermore, H.R. 3997 establishes a joint congressional oversight panel to review the current state of the financial markets and the regulatory system. This panel will submit a report on the current regulatory system and its effectiveness at overseeing the participants in the financial system and protecting consumers. This provision is critical, since going forward, we must ensure that our financial sector is no longer allowed to put ordinary Americans in danger by pursuing high-risk behavior with little to no oversight. We must investigate companies that took advantage of lenient regulation or possibly acted outside of Federal regulations entirely. And we must learn from our mistakes, establishing new regulations and ensuring the laws already on the books are enforced. 
   Madam Speaker, let me assure my colleagues and my constituents that if I thought the bill before us today was nothing more than a hand-out to high-flying Wall Street investors who suddenly found themselves in trouble and decided they didn't like losing money, I would be the first in line to cast a no vote. Unfortunately, this problem is much bigger and much less selective about who it might hurt. We need to take action, and we need to do it now. This legislation represents a good, bipartisan solution to a situation none of us wanted to find ourselves in. I want to thank Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Frank and many other colleagues for their tireless work on this bill. I encourage all my colleagues to vote for this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to say that I rise in strong support of the FY 2008 Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill. I want to begin by commending Chairman Price's leadership in crafting a measure that will provide an additional $2.1 billion above the President's request and fill many of our remaining security gaps. 
   As chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity and Science and Technology, I am particularly pleased that this bill incorporates language I worked on to strengthen chemical security by allowing State and local governments to set chemical safety rules that are stronger than Federal mandates. 
   Further, this legislation incorporates an additional $307 million for aviation security, an area the 9/11 Commission highlighted as a priority. This bill will allow TSA to install vital explosive detection systems at commercial airports nationwide and will double the amount of cargo screened on passenger aircrafts. 
   This bill also takes the critical step of lifting the cap on TSA airport screeners, a provision which is of tremendous importance to T.F. Green Airport in my district. 
   In addition, H.R. 2638 incorporates robust funding to strengthen border protection, including $8.8 billion to fund  an additional 3,000 Border Patrol agents for FY08. 
   Finally, this legislation will help our first responders who place their lives on the line each and every day by restoring funding to the local law enforcement terrorism prevention program and the assistance to firefighter grants program. 
   Of course, no appropriations measure is perfect and this bill is no exception. I am especially disappointed with the inadequate funding level for R&D for cybersecurity. Cybersecurity poses potentially devastating threats to our Nation's critical infrastructure, and I hope we can improve the bill in this area. I have a later amendment to that effect that I hope to discuss with the chairman. 
   Overall, however, this is an excellent bill. I again want to commend the chairman and the committee for their outstanding work on this measure. It provides support to many critical programs, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H. Con. Res. 99, the Budget Resolution for FY 2008. This measure will provide robust funding for some of the most important programs to the American people, while simultaneously maintaining our commitment to fiscal discipline. 
   Last year, the Democrats promised to move the country in a new and better direction. The budget before us today restores many of the programs that the President proposed to cut, while allowing us to not only balance our budget but return to surplus by 2012. I am pleased that the Democratic budget meets our commitment to national defense and supports those who have served our country by providing significant increases for military and veterans' health care. We must not leave behind those who have risked their lives in defense of our Nation, and this budget includes $3.5 billion more than the President's to improve care in the areas of mental health, post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury--areas of great concern for our veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   As the Chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity and Science and Technology, I am proud to support a budget that properly invests in our homeland security initiatives. Unlike the President's proposal, we provide considerable funding for programs important to state and local law enforcement in Rhode Island, including the State Homeland Security Grant Program, which awarded approximately $50 million to Rhode Island from 2003 to 2006, and the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program, from which Rhode Island received $11.5 million from 2004 to 2006. By passing the Democratic budget, we can give first responders in Rhode Island the tools they need to keep our citizens safe. 
   In addition, the new Democratic leadership has made implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations a top priority for the 110th Congress. This task was completed in the first 100 hours, and today we underscore our commitment to those recommendations by providing sufficient funding to carry them out. 
   The Democratic budget also meets our Nation's domestic priorities, notably in the area of health care. While the President proposed to cut children from the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, our budget includes a $50 billion reserve fund to expand SCHIP to cover more of the nine million children without health insurance in this country. In Rhode Island's RIte Care program, federal SCHIP funds are leveraged to provide health insurance to many children living in families with at least one working parent or an income below 250 percent of the poverty level. RIte Care also covers certain pregnant women and parents, providing peace of mind for families who would otherwise face uncertainty about health care. Still, despite these relatively generous eligibility policies, there are still 18,680 uninsured children in the state, or 6.6 percent of all Rhode Island children, which is why additional support is needed to protect our most vulnerable. The Democratic budget provides that support. 
   This budget will also increase funding for education, social services, and job training programs by almost $8 billion over the 2008 program level in the President's budget, important steps that we must take to reverse 6 years of harmful cuts. Pell Grants, which offer so many American students the opportunity to access higher education, have seen a significant decline in purchasing power in recent years. Under this budget, we will raise the maximum Pell Grant to at least $4,600 and take significant steps toward making college a possibility for all of our Nation's young people. 
   The budget we are considering today also restores critical community development and social services programs that the President proposed to cut. Community and regional development programs like the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) provide vital funding for economic and community development in both urban and rural areas nationwide. This proposal will also restore funding to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) which helps lower-income families cope with rising heating and cooling costs. 
   In another effort to lower energy costs and provide a new vision for America's energy policy, the Democratic budget makes a major investment in alternative and renewable energy research, which will move us closer to energy independence and improve our environment. It includes an additional $300 million this year for the Department of Energy, which could be invested in renewable and alternative energy development and energy efficiency initiatives. It also establishes a reserve fund that could provide as much as $14 billion over 10 years to invest in clean and renewable energy resources. Just as our Nation rallied around President Kennedy's call to put a man on the moon, we must similarly harness the creativity and expertise of our citizens and private industry to develop new technologies and work toward energy independence. 
   The Democratic budget also recognizes the importance of preserving our environment and public lands for future generations by providing an additional $2.6 billion for environmental programs--9 percent more than the President's request. It also blocks the President's proposed cuts to vital environmental programs such as the Land and Water Conservation Fund, EPA clean water grants and our National Wildlife Refuge system. Rhode Islanders have a long history of protecting our natural resources, and I am pleased that this budget reflects those values. 
   Finally, this budget includes several greatly needed extensions of tax provisions that will continue to help middle class families and small businesses to prosper. The Democratic budget establishes a reserve fund that will continue to provide tax cuts to millions of working families nationwide, and it will reduce the burden of the alternative minimum tax (AMT) that adversely affects thousands of Rhode Islanders each year. Democrats are committed to reducing the increasing tax burdens on middle-class Americans in a way that adheres to the fiscally responsible pay-as-you-go rules adopted by this Congress. 
   For too long the American people have been forced to choose between losing funding for vital domestic programs and running record deficits that will ultimately be passed along for our children and grandchildren to pay. Today, we finally have the opportunity to support a budget that will fund programs thousands of Rhode Islanders rely upon, while maintaining our commitment to fiscal responsibility. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting yes on the Democratic budget resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (UNITED STATES FIRE ADMINISTRATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise to introduce an amendment that highlights the critical importance of deploying fire sprinklers in all commercial buildings. My amendment encourages the installation of fire sprinklers in commercial buildings and supports educational programs about installing them in residential buildings as well. 
   Five years ago, a tragedy struck in my home State of Rhode Island when a fire tore through the Station Nightclub in West Warwick. It was certainly a terrible awakening for all of us about the importance of fire safety. That fire, which killed 100 people and injured 200 more, could have been prevented, Mr. Chairman, if fire sprinklers had been installed throughout the building. Almost every Rhode Islander knows someone whose life was changed forever by that terrible night, and we all learned a very hard lesson on the importance of installing fire protection equipment in our homes, workplaces, our schools, and recreational buildings. I hope that with a renewed focus on installing fire sprinklers and other safety devices, that we can prevent a tragedy like the one in West Warwick from ever occurring again. 
   There is no question that fire sprinklers save lives. In fact, the National Fire Protection Association has no record of a fire killing more than two people in a public building equipped with a fully operational automatic fire sprinkler system. 
   So, to this end I have introduced a piece of legislation called the Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act, H.R. 1742, which would amend the Internal Revenue Code to provide an incentive to business owners for retrofitting existing buildings with lifesaving sprinklers. This legislation, which right now has 114 cosponsors, will reduce the tax depreciation time for retrofitting sprinklers in nonresidential real property from 39 years down to only 5. So a significant time reduction. Again, from 39 years down to only 5 years for this tax depreciation to take advantage of the retrofitting of sprinklers. 
   While it's clear that fire sprinklers save lives, Congress has to date not taken a position on the importance of this important technology. So I believe that it is critical that we lend our voice to this issue and hopefully save another community from ever experiencing the devastating losses that West Warwick did. 
   So while we may not always be able to prevent fires from occurring, we certainly can minimize the damage they cause and the lives that they take. My amendment that I am offering today is a sense of Congress, and takes us one step closer toward that goal. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, I strongly support reauthorizing the United States Fire Administration, and I would like to commend Chairman Gordon for his leadership in bringing this bill to the floor. This bill will allow the U.S. Fire Administration to continue to provide support services for fire prevention, firefighter training and education, and emergency medical services activities. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment as well, H.R. 4847. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I raise today in support of H.R. 521, which would designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located in Rock Island, Illinois, as the ``Lane Evans Post Office Building.'' I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill that honors my good friend and former colleague. 
   Lane has always served his country with honor. From 1969 to 1971, he served in Vietnam in the U.S. Marine Corps, and as they say, ``once a marine, always a marine.'' When he was elected to Congress in 1982, he immediately worked to make sure veterans were given the benefits that they deserve, and he lent his voice to issues that might otherwise have been ignored. For almost a quarter of a century in Congress, Lane was a champion of America's veterans, and his passion for this cause is truly missed. 
   Lane and I were able to develop a friendship that transcended politics. We worked together on many issues as members of the House Armed Services Committee. Serving others, especially his constituents, was something Lane did exceedingly well. I was able to see this firsthand when I traveled to his district in 2004. I was impressed, but not surprised, by the enormous number of people who showed up at an event he hosted, which certainly speaks to how well-liked and respected he was, and is, in the 17th district of Illinois. Serving with Lane was truly an amazing and educational experience, and his constituents were fortunate to have such a dedicated public servant as their representative in Washington. 
   Unfortunately, Lane has had to battle Parkinson's Disease since 1995. In his fight against this debilitating disease, he has shown his characteristic courage and perseverance that proved to everyone that he was not going to easily give up. Lane has also been a great partner in the effort to advance stem cell research, which is a matter of tremendous importance to me. While we miss having him fighting with us in Congress, he can be assured that our efforts will continue so that patients with spinal cord injuries, Parkinson's Disease and other conditions will benefit from this research in the future. 
   Mr. Speaker, it was a privilege to work with Lane Evans in the House of Representatives, and I am proud that today we honor his hard work and inspirational life with this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act, and I would like to thank the Democratic Leadership of the House of Representatives for bringing this critical bill to the floor. In my home State of Rhode Island, the high cost of oil and gas have become the top concern for families and businesses struggling to keep up in today's economy. This legislation promotes short term solutions to increase supply of domestic oil and gas, while establishing a long term national energy policy that invests in the development of renewable energy resources. 
   This legislation will open the Outer Continental Shelf to responsible oil and gas development between 50 and 200 miles off the coast, requiring state approval between 50 and 100 miles. It will protect national marine monuments and sanctuaries, as well as the Georges Bank fishing area off the coast of New England. Further, the Interior Department will be required to ensure that drilling is only approved if it can be done in a manner that protects the coastal environment, marine environment, and human environment of the State coastal areas and the Outer Continental Shelf. We cannot sacrifice the health of our coastlines and the people who live there, and I am pleased that this bill takes a safe and responsible approach to domestic drilling. 
   While I support the provisions to increase domestic oil production, I have said time and time again that we cannot drill our way out of our national energy crisis. The U.S. represents 25 percent of the world's daily oil consumption, yet we only have two percent of the world's reserves--relying solely on new production simply doesn't add up. Under this bill, revenue from domestic offshore production will be reinvested into the development of renewable energy resources, such as wind, solar, and bio-fuels, to bring clean, affordable solutions to our Nation. I also strongly support a provision in this bill to require electric power companies to produce at least 15 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2020. Furthermore, the legislation includes several proposals requiring the Department of Energy and Department of Housing and Urban Development to create new efficiency standards for both residential and commercial buildings and to help educate consumers on how to become more energy efficient, therefore limiting our demand for foreign oil. 
   I am also pleased to see tax credits included for the promotion of more energy efficient appliances and vehicles. Increased demand for green products will bring new jobs in green technology to our communities. Further, because this bill rolls back tax breaks to big oil and uses revenues from drilling to pay for the increased investment into renewable resources, we will not leave debt behind to be paid for by future generations. 
   I believe that it is critical for our nation to achieve energy independence and to end our reliance on foreign oil, while preserving our environment for future generations in a fiscally responsible manner. The Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act reaches a careful balance in support of these efforts, and I am pleased that this Congress is putting the safety and security of our Nation's families ahead of excessive industry profits. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of energy independence by voting yes on the Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (JOB CREATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 7110, the Job Creation and Unemployment Relief Act, which will provide funding for job creation and preservation initiatives, infrastructure investments, and economic and energy assistance. This important measure represents our commitment to help hard-working Americans weather these turbulent economic times. 
   In February, Congress passed the Recovery Rebates and Economic Stimulus for the American People Act, which aimed to inject $150 billion into our economy to revitalize our markets, increase consumer confidence, and protect against recession. This legislation provided rebates to Americans that put money directly into their pockets. While this short-term recovery plan was helpful to American families, our country's economic crisis has since worsened, and additional action by Congress is necessary. In August, 84,000 Americans lost their jobs, making it the eighth straight month that our economy has seen reductions in the workforce. The number of unemployed  Americans is the highest it has been since 1992, and unemployment claims have increased by more than 38 percent this year. Sadly, in my home State of Rhode Island, the unemployment rate has risen to 8.5 percent--the second highest in the Nation. My constituents have reached out to me and the Federal Government because they need help in this struggling economy to refinance their mortgages, pay their home heating bills, secure good-paying jobs, and find affordable health care. 
   H.R. 7110 begins to answer their call by providing a critical and immediate boost to the many Rhode Islanders, and Americans across the Nation, who are struggling to find work. It provides 7 weeks of extended benefits for those ho have exhausted regular unemployment compensation. This is in addition to the 13-week extension passed in June of this year. Residents in high unemployment Sates, like Rhode Island, may also be eligible for an additional 13 weeks of benefits. In addition this measure provides $500 million for job training, including assistance for dislocated workers programs, youth employment activities, and customized help to those receiving unemployment benefits. This bill will give hard-working Americans another chance to continue their job search and provide for their families. 
   This bill also includes investments in infrastructure and renewable energy technologies that will have an immediate impact on the economy by creating jobs and meeting existing needs in our country. While Rhode Island's coastline is one of the most beautiful in the Nation, it presents our State with unique infrastructure challenges. H.R. 7110 provides $12.8 billion for highway infrastructure, which is critical to the hundreds of thousands of Rhode Islanders who rely on the safety of our State's highways and bridges. I am pleased that the bill also provides an increase in funding for the Nation's drinking water infrastructure, which has been underfunded by the Bush Administration for the past several years. Three billion dollars is also included to repair and upgrade our schools, $1 billion for repair and construction projects for public housing, and $4.6 billion to upgrade and expand public transportation. 
   Also included within the stimulus package is a temporary increase in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) to assist State Medicaid programs. This is particularly important for Rhode Island, which is currently faced wIth a $400 million budgetary deficit fueled in part by unsustainable increases in Medicaid expenditures. These funds are designed to prevent cuts to health insurance and health care services for low-income children and families, as well as generate business activities, jobs, and wages that Rhode Island would otherwise not see. 
   Our country has faced economic hardships and recessions before, and I have no doubt we will weather this current downturn. However, we must provide Americans with the necessary tools to turn this economy around. I encourage my colleagues to pass this bill and give a hand up to those who are most vulnerable during these trying times.

   Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Chairman, I am pleased to rise in strong support of the Ferguson-Langevin amendment. Last year, I was so pleased to work closely with Mr. Ferguson to ensure the passage of the Lifespan Respite Care Act, which will offer relief to so many family caregivers across the country. 
   I had the privilege of traveling with Mr. Ferguson to Iraq going back a couple of years now, and I know his personal commitment to this issue. He shared the story with me about his mom, and so I know, as in my case as well as with Mr. Ferguson, this is certainly a very personal issue that we have personal knowledge about and we care passionately about. So I am pleased to join him today and in the effort to direct funding now for this important program. As I mentioned, I know firsthand what a difference a dedicated caregiver can make in the life of a person with a disability or chronic condition. 
   Family caregiving is an essential yet often overlooked aspect of our Nation's health care system. The ability to live at home and remain a part of one's community can make a tremendous difference in a person achieving independence, recovery, or treatment. And whether they are caring for a child with a behavioral disorder or a parent with ALS or a spouse with multiple sclerosis, we all know someone who is a family caregiver. They live in all of our communities and they are often silent heroes, ensuring family stability and helping those who struggle with disease or disability to avoid more costly out-of-home placements. 
   We were so excited last year when this Congress really took a bold initiative in enacting the Lifespan Respite Care Act, and it gave hope to so many families across America. Today, this amendment that we are proposing directs $10 million toward the Lifespan Respite Care Act, which would authorize grants to make quality respite care available and accessible to family caregivers regardless of age or disability. So it is exciting if we can actually put now the funding into the Lifespan Respite Care Act that we so desperately need to help America's families who are providing this type of care in the home. 
   I urge all of my colleagues who are so supportive of the passage of this bill to vote in favor of the Ferguson-Langevin amendment. 
   I also want to commend my colleague Mr. Ferguson, the gentleman from New Jersey, for his passion and dedication on this issue. It has truly been a team effort. And, again, I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. I want to thank the gentlelady, and before I begin on my comments on H.R. 3, the stem cell research enhancement act, I want to just thank my colleagues for their important comments on Iraq and the direction that the Iraq war has taken and the failed policy that we have seen in Iraq and the strain that it has put on the families of soldiers, the soldiers themselves. Clearly, we need a change in direction in America. That is what the American people expect. 
   This 100 hours agenda, obviously, is an important topic. I rise in strong support of the 100 hours agenda. As a four-term Member of Congress, it has been exhilarating for me to return to Washington and tackle the issues of the American people which have long been ignored. I am so proud to be a part of this new direction and a Member of this Chamber. 
   As we prepare for the embryonic stem cell research debate which will take place tomorrow, I am reminded that one of the primary reasons I ran for Congress, which was to make a positive difference in people's lives. The 110th Congress is being ushered in with a tremendous sense of hope and optimism. In the first legislative week, we have taken great strides towards improving the lives of hardworking Americans by increasing the minimum wage and fully implementing the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. 
   H.R. 3, the stem cell research enhancement act, is yet another example of this agenda of hope. This legislation will remove the restrictions that current administration has placed on the advancement of medicine and the hopes of millions. 
   Tomorrow, we will hear from both sides of the stem cell debate about whether the Federal Government should support this type of research. We will hear promises and stories of tremendous scientific advancement.  
   We will hear the limitations on these advancements, and we will also hear some distortions. But I come before you tonight with confidence; confidence in the science of stem cell research; confidence that the American people overwhelmingly support this legislation; confidence that tomorrow a great majority of my colleagues will once again vote in favor of the stem cell research enhancement act; and confidence that, one day, once all of our Nation's leaders will rally all around all types of stem cell research, and we will see big changes in the field of medicine and in the lives of so many people who are suffering today. 
   So tonight, I rise, I rise to help spread this message of hope and optimism to our constituents who are watching at home; for the 400,000 Americans who are living with MS; the 60,000 American family whose have faced the fear of a loved one's Parkinson's diagnosis this year; the thousands of Americans who have seen family members come to Alzheimer's disease; the 250,000 Americans who, like me, live with the constant challenges of a spinal cord injury, and so many others. To all of you, I say: Help and hope are on the way. 
   I want to thank my colleagues for giving me time tonight and being part of this 100 hours agenda debate, particularly, again, what you have done for enlightening the American people on our position of the war on Iraq and the new direction that we need to take in this country. 
   Thank you very much.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of the Fair Minimum Wage Act (H.R. 2). This bill will bring a long-overdue measure of fairness to the paychecks of millions of hardworking Americans. 
   We have now reached the longest period of time without an increase in the federal minimum wage since its creation in 1938. While the minimum wage remains stagnant, the cost of living for countless Americans continues to skyrocket. 
   In my home state of Rhode Island, the average two-bedroom apartment costs over $1,147 per month. As a result, many people would need to obtain more than three full-time, minimum wage jobs just to afford a decent home, and that does not take into account other critical living expenses like food and medicine. This is an unacceptable reality that millions of hardworking Americans continue to face. 
   Raising the minimum wage is a critical first step in Congress's efforts to strengthen the economic security of our Nation's families. The Fair Minimum Wage Act will increase the federal minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 incrementally over a 2-year period. 
   Americans who work hard to make an honest living should not be forced to live in poverty, and by passing the Fair Minimum Wage Act, we will help ensure that all Americans have the ability to provide for their families and prosper. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Fair Minimum Wage Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009. Having served on the House Armed Services Committee, I know that it handles some of the most complicated and contentious issues before Congress, but through a combination of hard work and a commitment to bipartisanship, it has been able to assemble a good bill that all Members should support. I would particularly like to thank Chairman SKELTON and Ranking Member HUNTER for their leadership and their efforts to enhance our national security. 
   The members of this body hold significantly different opinions about what our Nation's role should be in Iraq. Personally, having voted against the authorization of the use of force in Iraq, I believe that our current combat operations are doing significant and systemic damage to our military readiness and that we need a new strategy that emphasizes diplomatic and economic efforts and that allows us to bring our troops home. Despite our differences on Iraq policy, though, my colleagues and I stand in full support of the men and women in uniform who serve our Nation, as well as their families. This legislation recognizes their service by providing a pay raise of 3.9 percent--an increase of 0.5 percent over the President's budget request. It also rejects the President's ill-advised proposal to raise premiums and co-pays for participants of TRICARE, the military health care system. Congress recognizes that other options exist to reduce the cost of health care and that we must not place an undue burden on our military families. To that end, H.R. 5658 establishes several new preventive health initiatives, which will keep people healthier and reduce future costs. 
   As co-chair of the House Submarine Caucus, I am particularly pleased that the bill before us makes a major investment in our national security by providing an additional $722 million for advanced procurement of a second VIRGINIA-class submarine in FY2010--one year ahead of schedule. Last year, Congress provided $588 million to expedite the VIRGINIA-class construction schedule to attain two submarines in FY2011, and this legislation moves the target date even sooner. Submarines are one of the most effective and flexible platforms in our military, but if we don't build more quickly, we will lose our strategic advantage over nations that are rapidly expanding their naval forces. Furthermore, this funding will help our submarine industrial base, which, without additional work, will face layoffs, and our Nation could lose their specialized skills and expertise. The men and women who work at Electric Boat in my district make the best submarines in the world, and I am pleased that this legislation will allow them to expand their contributions to our national security. I am deeply grateful to Chairman IKE SKELTON and Seapower Subcommittee Chairman GENE TAYLOR--as well as my friend and neighbor JOE COURTNEY and my co-chair on the Submarine Caucus RANDY FORBES--for their commitment to our submarine force. 
   This Congress has shown a commitment to our Navy and recognizes the importance of shipbuilding. While I applaud many provisions in this bill that will help restore the size of our fleet, I have concerns about the decision to delay the purchase of the third Zumwalt-class destroyer (DDG-1000). Instead of funding the President's full request, the bill provides $400 million that may be used either to purchase long-lead materials for the thud DDG-1000 or to begin procurement of two Arleigh Burke-class destroyers (DDG-51). The DDG-1000 is the first installment in the Navy's Family of Ships line, which will develop new technology for later insertion in the next-generation cruiser and other surface ships. Delaying DDG-1000 will prevent the development of new technologies and weapons systems that are necessary to address current and future threats. Additionally, while purchasing additional DDG-51s will help us increase the size of our fleet, they cannot fulfill the mission requirements of the DDG-1000, which was specifically built to have greater capability and a smaller crew. As we move forward with this bill, I ask that the committee keep these concerns in mind. 
   I am very proud to support H.R. 5658, which provides our men and women in uniform with the resources, equipment and services they need to continue their excellent service to the Nation. I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure.

   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Skelton-Berman-Lowey amendment, and I want to commend the sponsors for proposing this amendment. 
   Having served on the Armed Services, Intelligence, and Homeland Security Committees, I have seen firsthand the stovepiping that occurs in the various parts of government responsible for national security. I recognize the urgent need to encourage greater interagency cooperation, both in strategic planning and at the operational level. 
   Our Nation has many ways to promote stability and peace throughout the world and protect our Nation. We often see a focus on our hard power assets, such as use of our military, but we also use our diplomacy, financial assistance, or other ``soft power'' assets such as cultural exchanges and communications. We need far better coordination and cooperation between our hard and soft power assets to truly achieve a comprehensive national security strategy for the United States. 
   This amendment would create an advisory panel to encourage collaboration among Department of Defense, State Department, and USAID. This is an important first step in promoting a comprehensive view of national security, and I'm confident that the sponsors of this amendment will build on this effort. 
   I look forward to working with them to encourage more interagency cooperation so that the United States can be more effective in reaching our national security goals.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1429, IMPROVING HEAD START FOR SCHOOL READINESS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the conference report on H.R. 1429, the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act. This bipartisan legislation provides services to one of our most vulnerable populations--children from low-income families. By passing this measure today, over 900,000 disadvantaged children ages 3 to 5--including over 3,000 in Rhode Island--will have access to health services, the necessary tools to enter kindergarten, and a foundation for their success later in life. 
   Studies show that low-income children often lack the richness of books in the home, proper nutrition, or access to a continuum of health services. For over 40 years, Head Start has provided comprehensive early childhood development services to low-income children, with strong emphasis on the involvement of families and the local community. H.R. 1429 would increase funding for quality improvements to Head Start and requires that by 2013 at least half of Head Start teachers nationwide have at least a baccalaureate degree in early childhood education. 
   Today, half of the children enrolled in Head Start are from working poor families. For this reason, I am pleased that this conference agreement increases the income eligibility to 130 percent of the poverty level so that families struggling with work and childcare will have another option. I also believe that stopping the program's National Reporting System is essential until proper testing methods for these young children are carefully developed. H.R. 1429 also establishes a set of procedures to improve accountability in the Head Start program, which will lead to improvements for all those served by Head Start. 
   Earlier in the year, H.R. 1429 passed both the House and the Senate with overwhelming support. I am proud that the 110th Congress is on the verge of passing this conference report after nearly a decade of failing to reauthorize Head Start. For all the children who benefit from this program, I look forward to sending this bill to the President for his signature.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (CREDIT CARDHOLDERS' BILL OF RIGHTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5244, the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights Act. As a cosponsor of this legislation, I believe it is a sensible approach to reforming major credit card abuses and improving consumer protections for cardholders. 
   Credit cards have become an integral part of the American economy, offering consumers instant access to a convenient, flexible source of financing. Unfortunately, more and more Americans are turning to their credit cards to help pay medical and utility bills, buy groceries, and make ends meet in this troubled economy. Credit card debt now consumes a sizeable portion of the average family's income. To make matters worse, the playing field between card companies and consumers has become very one-sided in recent years. A credit card agreement is a contract between a card company and a cardholder, but these companies have taken advantage of their customers with deceptive billing practices and hidden fees. Meanwhile, money that families are forced to devote to these unfair rates and charges is money that is not being spent on goods and services that could help bolster our struggling economy. 
   Cardholders deserve more bargaining power, and the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights Act helps level the playing field. Cardholders are entitled to accurate information and the right to make decisions about their own credit. This bill will ban interest rate increases on an existing balance unless the borrower is 30 days overdue and require card companies to give cardholders notification 45 days before any interest rate increase. This legislation also protects vulnerable consumers from fee-heavy subprime cards and prohibits issuing cards to minors. H.R. 5244 would also ban ``universal default'', where a card company raises the interest rate on one card if the cardholder misses a payment on a separate credit card or their credit score lowers. All of the provisions in this bill are the result of careful study and analysis over the past year, and I believe this deliberative approach has produced a very balanced and moderate bill. 
   Madam Speaker, instead of looking the other way while Americans fall deeper into debt, Congress must protect their financial interests and put an end to the tricks and traps made by credit card companies that undermine a competitive market. The balanced reforms in the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights will help do just that, while also helping to foster fair competition and the values of the free market. I encourage all my colleagues to vote for H.R. 5244.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOUSE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1433, the District of Columbia Fair and Equal House Voting Rights Act of 2007. 
   Today, the House of Representatives has a chance to correct an injustice that affects the nearly 600,000 residents of the District of Columbia. These citizens pay Federal taxes, serve in our military and the Federal Government and graciously host millions of American and foreign tourists every year, yet they remain unable to have their views represented in Congress. It is indeed ironic that the capital of our Nation, where our government and many non-governmental organizations work to promote freedom and liberty in other countries, is not representative of the ideals that we urge others to value. We have the chance to rectify this glaring problem today. 
   One of the primary justifications of the American Revolution was our forefathers' opposition to ``taxation without representation.'' Indeed, in my home town Warwick, angry Rhode Islanders attacked and burned the British customs ship H.M.S. Gaspee in 1772 to demonstrate their opposition to British rule--one of the earliest acts of rebellion leading to the American Revolution. Fortunately, the residents of the District of Columbia have not resorted to such extreme tactics to achieve justice, but they have been more than patient, waiting more than 200 years for a right that is enjoyed by 300 million other Americans. 
   The bipartisan legislation before us today would give the District of Columbia a voting member in the House, as well as create a second new seat for Utah, thereby raising the number of Members in the House to 437. It would finally grant Washingtonians a voice in Federal legislation involving health, governance, budgeting, taxes, gun control and other matters directly affecting their lives and livelihoods. Our current system of disenfranchisement for District residents does not befit a nation as noble as the United States, and it is time for change. 
   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 1433 so that we may grant fair representation to the residents of Washington, DC.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3222, the Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2008. I would like to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Chairman MURTHA, and the gentleman from Florida, Ranking Member YOUNG, for their efforts to craft a strong bipartisan bill and for their tireless dedication to our national security and to the men and women in uniform who protect us. 
   Ensuring a strong national defense is one of Congress's greatest responsibilities, and at no time is that more evident when our servicemembers are overseas in harm's way. While the members of this body may disagree about our next steps in Iraq, we all agree that we must support the soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and civilians who are serving their country and facing some challenging missions. Further, we agree that we must have a military that can protect our Nation against current threats and respond to emerging challenges we may face in the future. As a member of the Intelligence Committee and a former member of the House Armed Services Committee, I believe we need a flexible and an adaptive  military--one whose efforts are coordinated with other assets of national power such as diplomacy, foreign assistance and international cooperation--to achieve our national security goals. 
   Congress recognizes that our Nation is only as strong as those who defend us, and the bill before us makes important steps to enhance the health and well-being of those serving our Nation. It provides a 3.5 percent pay increase for our men and women in uniform, an increase over the President's recommendation of 3.0 percent. It continues our efforts to increase the size of the Army and Marine Corps in order to reduce the strain on our military caused by repeated troop deployments. In order to treat those currently in our military health system and to meet the needs of those returning from combat, it includes $23 billion for defense health programs, $416 million more than the President requested. It also postpones the President's recommended cost share increases for Tricare beneficiaries, a proposal that would have caused hardship to our military families and retirees. 
   H.R. 3222 also makes significant increases to vital non-proliferation programs. For years, the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program has allowed the U.S. to work with Russia and other nations in the former Soviet Union to dismantle their nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. As the chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity and Science and Technology, I know that one of the most important safeguards to preventing an attack using a weapon of mass destruction in the U.S. is to secure dangerous materials at their source to prevent them from getting into the hands of terrorists. To this end, the Defense appropriations bill includes $398 million for Cooperative Threat Reduction--$26 million more than the current level and $50 million more than the President's request. 
   Finally, H.R. 3222 invests in systems and technology to protect against current and future threats. I am extremely pleased that the measure includes an additional $588 million for advance procurement of materials that could lead to the construction of a second Virginia-class submarine as early as next year. Our Navy has estimated that we need 48 attack submarines to meet the needs of our military commanders. Yet, under the Navy's current 30-year shipbuilding plan, they do not expect to increase production to two subs per year until 2012, causing a perilous decline in our future sub fleet--dropping below 48 ships in FY2020-33 and hitting a low of 40 in FY2028 and FY2029. I have long advocated increasing our build rate of Virginia-class submarines to two per year so that we have sufficient capabilities to address emerging threats. However, the Navy has repeatedly delayed its two per year target date, causing instability in the industrial base. In FY2004, the Navy expected to build two subs per year in FY2007. By FY2005, the target had moved to FY2009. That date was pushed back again and again, and now stands at FY2012. Meanwhile, our defense industrial base in Southeastern New England has suffered layoffs of submarine designers and engineers, whose specialized skills would be very difficult to reconstitute if lost. Without immediate action, we risk shrinking our sub fleet to perilously low levels, precisely when nations such as China are expanding and modernizing their navies. After visits to Rhode Island and Connecticut earlier this year, Chairman MURTHA stated that building more submarines would be a priority, and this legislation demonstrates his commitment to fixing this dangerous problem. On behalf of the submarine industrial base in Rhode Island, I thank him and Ranking Member YOUNG for their leadership on this important national security issue. 
   I am pleased that one of our final actions before departing for the August work period will be passing this important legislation, which demonstrates Congress's commitment to national security and deserves the support of all in this chamber.

   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, this past week the Director of National Intelligence came before the Congress and told us that there was an important gap in our Nation's intelligence capabilities. So we responded swiftly, by crafting legislation tailored to concerns outlined by Director McConnell. We did what the Director of National Intelligence asked us to do: we drafted legislation that protected America. 
   But we also did one thing that the administration did not ask us to do: we protected the Constitution; we protected civil liberties. Because we believe that you can both protect the Nation and the liberties upon which it was founded. 
   Regrettably, that is not the legislation that is before you today. This bill undermines longstanding protections for the civil liberties of Americans. It sweeps aside constitutional norms that have governed the relationship between the people and the government since its founding. It puts all domestic spying power back in the hands of Alberto Gonzales. Now, that ought to scare everybody. It scares me. It makes FISA a rubber stamp for the Attorney General, and it fails to provide for adequate oversight of the activities that it authorizes. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against the Senate bill that is before us tonight so that we can once again bring up the House bill that strikes a balance between protecting America from terrorists and preserving our civil liberties.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, it is with great pride that I rise in support of H.R. 3221, which will help our nation take a major step toward energy independence. I applaud the hard work and dedication of Speaker PELOSI, Majority Leader HOYER and the Democratic leadership, as well as of the ten committees that contributed to this historic legislation, which I am proud to cosponsor. 
   The Democratic Congress has made it a priority to enact a forward-thinking energy policy that will strengthen our Nation. In January, the House passed H.R. 6, the CLEAN Act, which laid the framework for a new energy policy that guarantees access to affordable power, encourages energy conservation efforts, and pursues increased use of environmentally responsible and renewable sources of energy. Today we take the next step in that endeavor by considering H.R. 3221. This comprehensive bill includes a multitude of innovative programs and common-sense solutions to improve energy efficiency, invest in groundbreaking technologies, create the necessary infrastructure for alternative fuels and ensure that our workforce is properly trained for the economy of the future. 
   As I have said many times, we cannot dig or drill our way out of our energy crisis. We need new strategies to develop sources of energy that will move our Nation away from our reliance on oil and gas. This effort will benefit our environment by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, our economy by creating new industries and jobs, and our national security by reducing our dependence on foreign oil. Our nation has a history of successfully accomplishing great tasks when we work together, such as when we united to put a man on the moon. We need a similar effort with our national energy policy, and I am confident that the American people have the creativity, and resolve to succeed. 
   We are not only investing in a new energy policy for America, but we are also doing it in a fiscally responsible manner. Gone are the days of corporate welfare and tax dollar handouts to oil and gas companies that are reaping record profits while consumers pay increasing prices at the pump. This legislation rescinds wasteful subsidies and closes loopholes that have allowed oil and gas companies to avoid taxation on their income. Consequently, the new programs and investments contained in this bill will not add to the deficit. In so doing, we demonstrate our commitment not only to our Nation's energy security, but also to its economic security. 
   Today we will consider an amendment offered by the gentleman from New Mexico, Mr. UDALL, to require electricity suppliers to have 15 percent of their electricity come from renewable sources by 2020. As a cosponsor of the gentleman's legislation to create a renewable electricity standard, I strongly support the amendment and urge all my colleagues to do so. I am proud to represent Rhode Island, one of more than twenty states to have enacted laws to set targets for electricity from renewable sources. Rhode Island has been ahead of the curve in promoting clean electricity sources, but the federal government must follow suit so that our entire Nation can reap the benefits of renewable energy. 
   While I feel this bill could do more--particularly by increasing vehicle fuel efficiency standards, which have not risen appreciably in the last 20 years--I am proud that Congress is finally taking bold steps toward establishing a new energy policy that invests in new technologies, promotes the development of clean and renewable fuels and moves us toward energy independence. I urge all my colleagues to support this measure.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. I thank the gentleman for yielding on this historic occasion and for the purpose of a great celebration and recognizing the great victory of the Boston Red Sox in this year's World Series. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 782, a resolution that congratulates the Boston Red Sox on winning the World Series on October 28, 2007. As a life-long Red Sox fan, I am so pleased to be here with the rest of the New England delegation to show our appreciation for the Red Sox players, coaches, front office, and the rest of the Red Sox Nation. 
   The 2007 Red Sox were dominant from the beginning of the season, which is not easy when you have 162 regular season games in a year. In the World Series, the Red Sox faced the Colorado Rockies, a team that had won 21 of their last 22 games, leading up to the last showdown. That statistic didn't faze the Red Sox at all, though;  and whether it was in Boston or Denver, the pitchers made their pitches and the batters showed how hard it was to get an out in their lineup. 
   With a sense of inevitability, the Red Sox swept the Rockies in four games to win their second World Series in 4 years. 
   Every player on the team made a contribution. From veterans like Curt Schilling to rookies like Jacoby Ellsbury, Mike Lowell, who helped to keep the Red Sox on top during the regular season and rightfully won the World Series Most Valuable Player. 
   The 2007 Red Sox not only worked hard; they enjoyed themselves as well and kept the fans entertained, which is easy to do when you love what you do and you're good at it. 
   We watched Jonathan Papelbon strike out batters, and then we waited for a celebratory dance at the end of the game. It's not often in professional sports that you see a team full of players that has such a strong bond. 
   It's always a good year when you can follow your baseball team all the way from the beginning of April to the end of October. It's an even better year when they can take the World Series trophy on a parade through Boston. 
   The 2007 Red Sox played this year with confidence and class and showed us the true definition of team. I look forward to 2008 and adding on to two World Series trophies that we've already won this century. 
   Again, my congratulations to a great team. Congratulations Boston Red Sox and Red Sox Nation. 
   I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for yielding, along with his great comments.

   I would also like to extend my gratitude to all of the advocates of disability and business communities who have united behind this important cause and worked diligently with Members of Congress to ensure a fair and strong compromise. 
   The American Disabilities Act, or ADA, was truly one of the most significant pieces of civil rights legislation of the 20th century. As someone who has lived with the challenges of a disability both before and after the ADA's enactment in 1990, I have experienced firsthand the profound transformation this law has created in our society. 
   I remember well what it was like before the passage of the ADA and where accommodations were seen as personal courtesies or privileges as opposed to a civil right. I can remember what it was like coming down to Washington as a young intern for Senator Pell from Rhode Island and how challenging it was to find good, reasonable public accommodations. And I remember what it was like in Rhode Island before the ADA was passed in terms of voting, and I was not able to vote independently on my own. I had to have help in the voting machine. And it wasn't until after the ADA was passed and I became Secretary of State and changed our election system that it was truly possible to vote independently on my own. 
   The ADA has broken down countless barriers and helped millions of Americans to flourish in their personal and professional lives. It has also served as a vital tool against discrimination in the workplace and in public life. Unfortunately, a number of court decisions over the years have diluted the definition of what constitutes a disability, effectively limiting the ADA's coverage and excluding from its protections people with diabetes, epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, and various developmental disabilities. 
   The bill before us today reaffirms the protections of the ADA and renews our promise of equality for every American. The ADA has as its fundamental goal the inclusion of people in all aspects of society, and I am very pleased to say that the ADA Amendments Act brings us one step closer to that goal. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill and send a strong message that discrimination in any form will never be tolerated in this great Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding and also in particular thank and recognize the gentlewoman from Colorado  (Ms. DeGette) and the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle) for their exceptional leadership, and that of many others on the stem cell research bill who have fought so hard to bring us to where we are today. I am proud to be a partner with them in this effort. 
   Mr. Speaker, America has waited a long time for the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, and I am proud to rise in support of H.R. 3 and be a part of a Congress that has made this a top priority. This legislation has strong bipartisan support in both Chambers of Congress and enjoys the support of up to 70 percent of the American people. Most importantly, it offers hope and the promise of a cure to millions of people who are living with the constant challenges and burdens of chronic disease and disability. 
   Mr. Speaker, when I was injured in an accidental shooting almost 26 years ago, I was told that I would never walk again. Now, I always held out hope that someday that would change, that through the miracles of science and prayer, someday there would be a cure for spinal cord injuries.     
   It is only until now that that possibility of a cure has become truly real. 
   I am the first to admit that my understanding of stem cell research has involved ongoing education, thought and prayer. As a pro-life Member of Congress, I have not taken my decision to support this legislation lightly. But I have come to the conclusion that being pro-life also has to be about caring about those people who are living among us with some of life's most challenging conditions and diseases and caring about the possibility of both extending and improving the quality of life itself. That is what the promise of stem cell research offers. 
   Over the years, I have had the good fortune to learn about stem cell research from some of America's most renowned scientists as well as pro-life leaders like Senator ORRIN HATCH and a dear friend of mine who is certainly on my mind today, Christopher Reeve. 
   My education on this issue has filled me with tremendous hope not only that stem cell research might lead one day to a cure for spinal cord injuries, but that one day a child with diabetes will no longer have to endure a lifetime of painful shots and tests. I truly believe that families will no longer one day have to watch in agony as loved ones with Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease gradually decline. I am thrilled to be able to share this hope with millions of others. 
   We live in exciting times, truly at the threshold of a new generation in medicine. Today, newly spinal-cord-injured patients, many of them teenagers as I was, are told about developing treatments and scientific progress. They face a world, very much the same challenges that I faced in 1980. But they also face a time with real hope and the real promise of a cure. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3. It is the right thing to do.

   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act, which will help cities and towns, but most importantly, individuals and families that have been adversely impacted by the foreclosure crisis.  
   In my home state of Rhode Island, this problem is particularly acute. Foreclosures have increased by 20 percent in the last few months, and it is our most vulnerable communities that have been disproportionately affected. 
   Last weekend I teamed with Rhode Island Housing--a nonprofit organization dedicated to keeping housing affordable--to hold a workshop for those facing foreclosure. While we helped many local families, it is time for the Federal Government to do its part on a national scale. 
   I commend Chairman Frank and Chairman Rangel for their leadership in bringing this critical measure to the floor. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, as chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity and Science and Technology, I have worked to bring greater attention to the issue of cybersecurity, which remains a vulnerability in our national infrastructure. 
   I believe it is critical that adequate funding for cybersecurity research and development be made a priority at the Science and Technology Directorate.     
   Unfortunately, this issue has been largely overlooked within the Department of Homeland Security. In fact, out of the $22.7 million in fiscal year 2007 funding appropriated for the S&T Directorate for Cybersecurity R&D, only $13 million actually has been spent on cybersecurity. The rest has been reallocated to other programs at the directorate. For fiscal year 2008, the President slashed the budget again, requesting only $14.8 million, which is an $8 million cut from the previous year. 
   As the chairman knows, my subcommittee has raised attention to this  issue, and the full committee authorized $50 million for cybersecurity research and development. As the committee's authorization and appropriations bills move forward, I would like to work with the chairman so that we can assure appropriate funding for cybersecurity research.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3773, a careful and reasoned approach to electronic surveillance. Though people have talked a lot about immunity, we must remember that because of changes in technology, this is a bill to update the way we conduct electronic surveillance. 
   I approached this subject with two principles in mind. First, our surveillance must be effective. Second, the rights of Americans must be protected. On the second point, there is a real difference between the Senate and the House bills. 
   The issue is how both bills handle the calls of Americans. Under the Senate bill, the DNI and the Attorney General approve surveillance and then go to the court, with no set timeline for ruling. Under the House bill, the program of surveillance, not the specific individual targets, is submitted to the court. The government will essentially ask the court: Is this method of handling the communications of Americans appropriate, careful, and, most importantly, constitutional? 
   The approval of a program of surveillance allows the government to get approval before there is an operational requirement. So there will never be any operational sacrifice here. If it were going to slow down intelligence collection or cause operational problems, I can see where some might take issue with that. But the simple fact is that the way this bill is drafted, there is no excuse for not getting the approvals in place in advance. 
   I am all for strong intelligence authorities. The beauty of this bill is it combines that with care for our civil liberties, without sacrificing either.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND MEDICARE PROTECTION ACT OF 2007--Continued -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3162, the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act. I know that this was not an easy piece of legislation to put together and I appreciate the hard work of my colleagues on the Committees on Rules, Energy & Commerce and Ways & Means. 
   This bill is an important step in addressing the health care crisis faced by millions of families. Access to affordable insurance and quality preventive care is critical to the well-being and security of all Americans. The CHAMP Act will ensure that all eligible children are afforded the opportunity to enroll in State Children's Health Insurance Programs and takes important steps to improve efficiency and secure the solvency of the Medicare program, relied on by so many of our seniors. 
   The State Children's Health Insurance Program SCHIP, known as RIte Care in Rhode Island, has made health insurance a reality for over 12,000 children in my home State this year--the majority of them in families where one or more adult is part of the workforce. It is a critical component of health care delivery in Rhode Island, as it is across the country. I am so honored to be part of a Congress that is taking steps to ensure that all children who are eligible for this program are able to participate. By reauthorizing the SCHIP program, we renew our national commitment to achieving the goal of insuring all children whose parents cannot afford private health insurance coverage. 
   This bill also contains important components for Medicare beneficiaries. The elimination of overpayments to private plans that participate in Medicare delivery is a necessary step to increasing efficiency of this program. This action will go a long way in preventing premium increases for Medicare beneficiaries and will strengthen Medicare's finances for the future. While we still have work to do in improving certain aspects of the Medicare program--particularly the prescription drug benefit--this bill will ease the process for seniors who wish to change their prescription drug plan, and it will increase access to preventive services, saving lives and money. 
   Finally, I would also note that this legislation contains a fix to the scheduled 10 percent cut in physician payments under Medicare. I am pleased to support this fix and look forward to working with my colleagues to craft a permanent solution to the flawed funding formula that continues to recommend such cuts. We cannot offer high quality health care to our Nation's seniors if health care providers cannot afford to see Medicare patients. 
   I am pleased that this Congress has made access to health care a priority, particularly for our Nation's children and seniors. I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of the CHAMP Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act. This legislation will expand the Federal definition of hate crimes to include crimes which a victim was selected because of his or her disability. 
   So much has been done over the years to ensure inclusion of Americans with disabilities in our communities. Sadly, though, there have been shameful instances where these Americans, who may look or speak differently than others, are victims of abuse, neglect or targeted crimes. Investigating and prosecuting hate violence against someone with a disability involves unique challenges to law enforcement. Many violent crimes against people with disabilities go unreported or unprosecuted. Providing Federal resources to law enforcement is essential to help ensure proper prosecution of these crimes. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1592, the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007. This legislation will expand the Federal definition of hate crimes, allowing for Federal resources for law enforcement in their investigations and prosecutions of hate crimes. 
   I come to the floor today to draw attention to the inclusion of crimes in which a victim was selected because of his or her disability. 
   The Supreme Court's Olmstead decision, the ADA and other progressive policies have resulted in increased inclusion of Americans with disabilities in our classrooms, workplaces and communities. As a nation, we are growing in our acceptance of those who are perceived as ``different.'' But this effort has not been without growing pains. Many people with disabilities look or speak differently or struggle with challenges like chronic seizures. We have seen too many shameful instances where these Americans are the victims of abuse, neglect and targeted crimes. 
   I recently learned the story of Ricky Whistnant, a mentally retarded adult man who was excited to have the opportunity to live independently at the age of 39. With the support of a local social service agency, he moved out of a Connecticut state group home and learned to cook for himself, maintain an apartment and be a part of the community. One evening, after cooking himself a chicken dinner, Ricky went to the corner store to buy some soda. He encountered a group of teenagers who mocked him, followed him back to his apartment, hurled a soda bottle at him. After he fell, striking his head on a windowsill, the boys continued to kick and taunt him. Ricky died a short time later in the hospital. 
   Ricky's story is extreme, but it is not isolated. It represents the reality of the challenges faced by individuals with disabilities. Investigating and prosecuting hate violence against someone with a disability involves unique challenges to law enforcement, and sadly many violent crimes against people with disabilities go unreported or unprosecuted. 
   As policymakers, we have a responsibility to address this problem. The inclusion of disability in the Federal hate crimes statute is a meaningful and substantive way to combat violence against Americans with disabilities. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 1592.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 3406, the Senate-approved ADA Amendments Act of 2008. Passage of this bill will clear the way for the President's signature and finally renew our promise to the American people that discrimination in any form will never be tolerated. 
   I would like to thank my good friend, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, who has been a real leader and champion on behalf of the disabilities community. I would also like to express my appreciation to Chairman Miller for his continued leadership on this critical issue, as well as Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner. This has truly been a bipartisan effort. 
   The ADA was groundbreaking civil rights legislation. And as someone who has lived with the challenges of a disability both before and after the ADA's enactment in 1990, I have experienced firsthand the profound changes that this law has effected within our society. 
   The bill before us today reaffirms the protections of the ADA and upholds the ideals of equality and opportunity on which this country was founded. In July, we celebrated the 18th anniversary of the ADA. It was a day to reflect on our past accomplishments, our current challenges, and future opportunities. I can think of no better way to honor the spirit of this landmark bill and the spirit of all those who fought for its passage than by passing the ADA Amendments Act and restoring Congress' intent to ensure the ADA's broad protections. 
   Mr. Speaker, people with disabilities represent a tremendously valuable, and yet in many ways untapped, resource in this country. By fostering an environment of inclusion and empowerment, we can provide the means for every individual to fulfill his or her God-given potential. 
   The ADA Amendments Act will help us realize this important goal. I strongly urge my colleagues to support the passage of this bill and send it to the President for his signature. Again, I thank all those who were part of making this day possible, particularly, again, our majority leader, Steny Hoyer, for his great leadership.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3123, which would allow Liberians living in the United States to be eligible for a 1-year extension of their temporary protected status. This measure, introduced by my colleague from Rhode Island, Representative Kennedy, will give Liberian refugees in our State an opportunity to plan their return home instead of being forced back before they are ready. 
   For many years, Liberians were ruled by the cruel hands of dictators, including Samuel Doe and Charles Taylor. They controlled their country by fear and violence, which provoked the United States Government in 1991 to seek temporary protected status for Liberian nationals who were in the U.S. 
   Since Charles Taylor was forced out of office, Liberia has made progress in peace and democracy building efforts, and the election of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in 2005 has brought stability to the region. President Johnson Sirleaf has made many efforts to improve relations with both the U.S. Government and Liberian communities across our country. However, Liberia's security situation, while stable, is still fragile, and its economy and state structures remain devastated by war. 
   In Rhode Island, our Liberian population has become part of the fabric of our community. They work for local companies, they attend our schools, and they enrich cities and towns. The majority of Liberians in our State wants to return to their homeland, but they understandably wish to first ensure the country's safety and stability. In the meantime, they are learning how to better serve their country by taking advantage of opportunities offered to them in the United States. They are an integral part of  our communities, and in return, we owe them the chance to return when they are ready--and without fear--to Liberia.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 493, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, which extends crucial Federal protections against discrimination based on an individual's genetic information. 
   The new millennium has seen unprecedented scientific advances in genetic research that have brought a renewed hope of solving today's most difficult medical puzzles. Since the human genome was fully mapped in 2003, many in the scientific and medical communities have viewed genetic medicine as the next step toward finding better diagnoses, treatments and possible cures for a wide spectrum of diseases. These advances have also raised legitimate ethical concerns about the potential misuse of genetic information in workforce and insurance related decisions. Although current law already addresses certain aspects of this issue, the importance of protecting individuals from discrimination and safeguarding the right to privacy cannot be overstated. 
   This bill will guarantee more comprehensive protections from discrimination in health insurance and employment on the basis of genetic information. Specifically, it will prohibit group health plans and health insurers from denying coverage to a healthy individual or charging that person higher premiums based solely on a genetic predisposition to develop a disease in the future. Furthermore, it bars employers, employment agencies, labor organizations or training programs from using an individual's genetic information when making hiring, firing, job placement or promotion decisions. 
   Genetics is a field of study that offers tremendous promise for medical advancement, but we must give thoughtful consideration to the implications of these emerging discoveries on society. No individual should fear discrimination based on genetic technologies. H.R. 493 will allay concerns about the potential for discrimination, encourage individuals to participate in genetic research, and take advantage of genetic testing, new technologies, and new therapies. I thank Congresswoman Slaughter for her leadership on this issue and urge my colleagues to support its passage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Conference Report on H.R. 4137, the Higher Education Opportunity Act, which will reauthorize the Higher Education Act through Fiscal Year 2012. This is the first time in almost a decade that this bill has been reauthorized, and I am proud to be part of a Congress that has placed such a high priority on making college a reality for all of our Nation's students. This bill builds on legislation that passed last year to help lower college costs and boost federal loan support for our students. Given the state of our economy, it is imperative that we invest in our education system to promote new employment and ensure that today's students can adapt to the jobs of tomorrow. 
   Two of the main goals of the Higher Education Opportunity Act are to make a college education accessible to all students and to lower college costs for those students and their families. I am pIeased that this bill increases the maximum amount of Pell Grants, which help 5.5 million low-income and minority students attend college, from $5,800 to $8,000 by the 2014 academic year. This meaure also boosts funding for the TRIO program and the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Program (GEAR UP), which provide college readiness and support for low-income and first-generation students. H.R. 4137 ensures equal college opportunities for students with disabilities by creating the National Center for Information and Technical Support to improve college recruitment, retention, and completion of students with disabilities, and would also expand eligibility for Pell Grants for students with intellectual disabilities. 
   H.R. 4137 also establishes a user-friendly website to provide students and families with helpful information about college pricing, and will streamline the cumbersome filing process for Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Families will now be able to receive estimates of their expected contribution and the amount of financial aid they may receive. H.R. 4137 requires higher education institutions and student loan providers to give borrowers fair and full information on their loan terms and repayment options, as well as promote financial literacy and education for students and families. 
   One of the goals of the 110th Congress is to create a new generation of innovators so that we continue to build an educated, skilled workforce in the vital areas of science, math, engineering and information technology. To maintain our international competitiveness and economic advantage in the coming years, our Nation must invest more in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education. That is why I am pleased that H.R. 4137 includes many new initiatives and increases STEM funding. These new programs include grants for colleges and universities to provide incentives for students in STEM majors to teach in these academic areas; the YES Partnership Grant Program, which provides funding to eligible colleges to support minority youth engagement in STEM fields through outreach and hands-on experiential learning; and the Robert C. Byrd Mathematics and Science Honors Scholarship Program, which focuses on encouraging students to earn degrees in math and science. 
   H.R. 4137 increases college aid and support for our veterans and military families by requiring colleges and universities to treat students returning from military service as continuously enrolled students and preventing active duty servicemembers from accruing interest on student loans for the duration of their activation. The measure also encourages those students who commit to a job in high-need areas and public service for at least five years by establishing a $10,000 loan forgiveness program for nurses, early childhood educators, foreign language specialists, child welfare workers, school counselors, public sector employees, medical specialists, and mental health professionals. This measure further addresses the  shortage of nursing faculty by establishing competitive grants to fund scholarships for nurses studying for advanced degrees with the intention of becoming faculty. 
   In recent years, our country's college and university campuses have seen terrible tragedies. H.R. 4137 will boost campus safety by helping all colleges develop and implement state of the art emergency systems and campus safety plans, and will also create a National Center for Campus Safety at the Department of Justice. Administrators and students on campuses across the country have also pushed for environmental, or ``green,'' initiatives, and this measure supports these efforts by providing funding for environmental sustainability programs. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4137 shows that Congress is committed to the success of our students, and we will work to make sure that they can pursue their dreams without the burdens of unnecessary costs and debt. While we may find ourselves facing hard economic decisions, we must empower the next generation with the necessary tools and invest in their education. The College Opportunity and Affordability Act will set a blueprint for the future, and I encourage all my colleagues to vote for this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1338, the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would narrow the wage gap between men and women. As a cosponsor of this bill, as well as a cosponsor in previous Congressional sessions, I am pleased to see this legislation finally debated on the House floor.  
   H.R. 1338 would strengthen the Equal Pay Act, which makes it unlawful for an employer to pay unequal wages to men and women that have similar jobs within the same establishment. The Paycheck Fairness Act would allow women to sue for punitive damages, as well as compensatory damages. Currently, women who seek compensation for unequal pay can only recover back pay, or in some cases, double back pay. While this bill would increase penalties for employers who pay different wages to men and women for equal work, it also provides incentives such as training programs for employers to eliminate pay disparities and grant programs to help strengthen the negotiation skills of girls and women. 
   Some may argue that these changes are not necessary, but the numbers speak for themselves. Despite greatly increased commitment to the labor force over the past 45 years, women working full time make 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man--less than a 20 percent increase since the Equal Pay Act was signed into law in 1963. Even more troublesome, African-American women earn 66 cents to the dollar and Latina women earn 55 cents to the dollar. According to a Census Bureau study, male high school graduates earned $13,000 more than female high school graduates in 2006. Women with a bachelor's degree employed year-round earned $53,201, while similarly educated men earned an average of $76,749. This same study also noted that the pay difference between men and women grows wider as they age. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bill so that women like Lilly Ledbetter do not have to argue their case for equal pay all the way to the Supreme Court, so that single mothers do not have to worry whether or not they are being treated fairly by their employers while they provide for their children, and so that daughters entering college can reach their full potential when they graduate. 
   Finally, I would like to thank my friend Congresswoman DeLauro for her many years of leadership on this issue, as well as inspiring women of all ages across our country.

   Our operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have put great strain on our military, and this bill will reverse the decline in readiness. It adds funds for force protection programs such as mine resistant combat vehicles, IED countermeasures and body armor and a much deserved pay raise for the troops. 
   I'm also pleased that the measure recognizes the importance of submarines to our national security by adding $588 million to construct a second Virginia-class submarine as early as 2009, 3 years earlier than planned. This is welcome news to the men and woman at Electric Boat in Rhode Island, as well as Groton, Connecticut, as well as our entire submarine industrial base, which is threatened by an insufficient workload. The Navy's current shipbuilding plan would have our submarine fleet drop to dangerously low levels in future years, just as other nations are increasing their naval capabilities. 
   I've been working exceptionally hard for 6 years to address this important national security issue, and I thank Chairman Skelton and Seapower Chairman Taylor for their commitment to a robust submarine force. 
   This is a good bill and a good rule and, Madam Speaker, I urge its passage. And I thank my colleague for the time.

Currently, employees may take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act to care for a newborn or adopted child. 
   H.R. 5781 will help the United States Government compete with the private sector in order to recruit the best and brightest employees and retain that talent. In 2007, a Government Accountability Office report found that countries offering paid parental leave experienced increased employee retention and a reduction in the amount of time women spend out of the workforce. Disappointingly, the GAO also reported that the U.S. lags behind other industrial nations in providing policies that support working parents and their children. In fact, 169 countries guarantee women leave with income in connection with childbirth.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (REMARKS ON THE SCHIP VETO OVERRIDE -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the SCHIP program and urge all of my colleagues to vote to override the President's veto of this bill. 
   While the number of uninsured adults has steadily climbed over the past 10 years, the number of uninsured children in our Nation has declined by nearly a third. This is a direct result of the SCHIP program which began in 1997 with the goal, and indeed the national commitment, of providing health insurance for children whose parents cannot afford private health coverage. I was proud to be a part of a Congress that was able to craft a responsible and critical reauthorization of the SCHIP program, one that would ensure that all eligible children can participate. 
   However, while Democrats and Republicans here in Congress were able to put politics aside for the sake of this critical program, the President chose not to do so. His veto means that thousands of children in Rhode Island and millions more across the country will be denied access to health insurance. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to vote to override the President's veto and show our support for a program that has been tremendously successful in supporting working families, strengthening our health care system, and keeping our children healthy.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 716, a resolution supporting the goals and ideals of the National Cyber Security Awareness Month. I want to thank my ranking member, Mr. McCaul, for his support of this resolution. I commend the other gentleman from Texas for his leadership on this issue as well. 
   Each year the National Cyber Security Division of the Department of Homeland Security joins with the National Cyber Security Alliance, the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, and other partners to support National Cyber Security Awareness Month. The goal of National Cyber Security Awareness Month is to show everyday Internet users that by taking simple steps, they can safeguard themselves from the latest online threats and respond to potential cybercrime incidents. 
   Mr. Speaker, these safeguards taken by everyday home and office users are a critical component in protecting not only these individuals themselves, but the larger universe of computer and Internet users as well. We all have a role to play. Unfortunately, though, it would be dangerous to believe that simple steps by end users will sufficiently combat the larger threats associated with an increasingly networked society. 
   As chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity and Science and Technology, I have held a number of hearings this year on our Nation's cybersecurity posture and the various vulnerabilities in our critical information infrastructure. This is an area where I plan to hold increasing hearings and provide intense oversight because cybersecurity vulnerabilities can significantly impact our national and economic security. 
   Mr. Speaker, we all know that security networks can help prevent problems like identity theft, but secure networks can also protect our nuclear power plants, our electric grids and other critical infrastructure. 
   Sadly, the issue of cybersecurity has been largely ignored and misunderstood for far too long. This is an area that needs greater attention and far greater oversight, making sure that both government is doing what it is supposed to do, as well as the private sector, to make sure that our computer networks are as secure as they possibly can be. This is truly an issue of national security. 
   The oversight that the Homeland Security Committee is undertaking will help change that, but much work remains to be done. I want to commend Chairman Bennie Thompson for the attention that he has given this issue as well. 
   We must continue to bring together greater attention to this issue by dedicating resources to securing cyberspace, such as increased funding for cybersecurity research and development, but we must also demand accountability and prompt action from those officials tasked with developing comprehensive strategies for securing cyberspace. 
   I am proud to recognize October as National Cyber Security Awareness Month, and I hope that the passage of this resolution will bring greater attention to the importance and urgency of securing cyberspace. 
   I want to thank Chairman Gordon for his leadership in bringing this measure to the floor. Again, I want to thank my ranking member, Mr. McCaul from Texas, for his partnership in highlighting the importance of cybersecurity, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this important resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (ESTABLISHING PROGRAM TO MAKE GRANTS REGARDING BACKUP PAPER BALLOTS -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5803, legislation that would establish a voluntary program so election officials can offer voters a backup paper ballot in the event of an emergency. Now when I served as the Secretary of State for the State of Rhode Island, I reformed our State's voting machines and election processes to make them more accurate and accountable. From that experience, I know that ensuring confidence in our voting system is the cornerstone of our democracy. 
   As the 2008 election promises to bring out record numbers of voters to the polls, H.R. 5803 will boost confidence among the electorate by ensuring that voters are not turned away from the polling places, do not wait in long lines and do not incorrectly receive provisional ballots because of malfunctioning voting systems. H.R. 5803 authorizes $75 million to establish a voluntary, and I repeat voluntary, opt-in grant programs for State and local governments that wish to provide backup paper ballots in the coming November elections. 
   Although many States already require emergency paper ballots, the 2008 Presidential primaries revealed that many jurisdictions do not have the resources to provide backup ballots. For example, during Pennsylvania's 2008 Presidential primary, a Philadelphia precinct experienced failures with both of its electronic voting machines causing voters to wait in long lines or even leave without voting at all because of a lack of emergency paper ballots. Now we can't allow that to happen. H.R. 5803 provides the necessary resources for States to prepare for potential problems so that voters are not turned away from the polls because the voting system malfunctions. 
   The National Conference of State Legislatures and the National Association of Counties support H.R. 5803 because it is meaningful and respectful of State authority in election administration matters. H.R. 5803 has been crafted to allow jurisdictions to determine when and how the backup ballots are distributed. The legislation is not a mandate, and it's purely a voluntary option for jurisdictions to consider. 
   In closing, I would like to thank the Elections Subcommittee Chairwoman LOFGREN for her leadership in bringing this bill to the floor today in the first place. And I would also like to thank my friend from New Jersey (Mr. Holt) who has raised awareness about the importance of voting machine accuracy and accountability. I have been proud to work with him on a number of efforts, and I look forward to our continued cooperation. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 5803 to ensure that we maintain public confidence in our voting procedures as we approach this coming election season.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 362, the 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act. 
   As you know, it is a sad truth that American students' performance in science and math is below that of other developed countries. Like many of my colleagues, I am concerned that without increased attention to this issue at the elementary, high school and postsecondary levels, our country's technological leadership could decline and ultimately harm not only today's students but tomorrow's economy as well as our national security. 
   This legislation provides a framework for improving math and science education by investing heavily in the recruitment and training of teachers. 
   In recent years, I have had the pleasure of observing several of the ``For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology,'' or FIRST Program's competitions. This program is designed to inspire young people to take an interest and participate in science and technology. Through FIRST, teams of students and their mentors work together to solve complex, real-world problems or design actual pieces of technology. They are given the opportunity to compete against their peers, all the while developing self-confidence, good sportsmanship, and critical life skills.  
   The talent and drive of the students I have observed in the FIRST competitions leaves me encouraged--in fact, awestruck--by the potential of America's high school students. I have seen first hand that with quality resources and instruction, our children can do great things in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Today, our support for H.R. 362 is a tremendous step towards bringing these resources to future generations, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the conference report to the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, and I urge my colleagues to adopt it. 
   As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I am pleased that this conference report will improve our security and protect the freedoms that make this country so great. It includes critical funding for counterterrorism, human intelligence and counterintelligence efforts, as well as making strong progress in improving our overhead architecture. And on that point in particular, I commend not only Chairman Reyes but also Congressman Ruppersberger, as well as the staff for their hard work in this area, and I was proud to be a part of that effort. 
   Furthermore, as my colleagues have discussed, it brings the intelligence community in line with the rest of our national security professionals by requiring it to abide by the Army Field Manual when conducting interrogations. As a member of the Intelligence Committee and, in general, members of the Intelligence Committee, we devote many hours behind closed doors addressing some of the most important national security issues facing our Nation. This conference report reflects the high priority that the committee, led by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Reyes), places on congressional oversight of the intelligence community. And I commend the chairman for his stepped-up efforts to ensure that oversight is a greater priority for the Intelligence Committee. 
   We have included a number of provisions to restore a greater role for the Congress and to ensure that our intelligence activities are not subject to political influence. This measure requires the Central Intelligence Agency's Inspector General to audit all covert action programs every 3 years, for example. It also requires the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to provide Congress with a comprehensive listing of all special access programs to ensure that the intelligence community is keeping us fully informed of these activities. 
   It requires a report on compliance with the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 and provisions of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 regarding detentions and interrogations and mandates that the administration provide Congress with the Justice Department's legal opinions related to these activities. And it requires semi-annual reports on what we know about nuclear programs of Iran and North Korea to make sure that we have accurate and timely information. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, strong oversight is essential to effective government and to the ability of our intelligence community to respond to the threats that we face today. This conference report will demand accountability and give our intelligence professionals the resources that they need to keep Americans safe. 
   I want to thank, again, the chairman for his hard work, as well as the ranking member on this bill and as well as Members of the Senate for their hard work on this conference report.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, tonight I am honored to be able to speak this evening about the issue of universal health care, one of the biggest domestic challenges that is facing our country at the present time. I am also pleased to be joined this evening and who will be speaking in just a few minutes, by the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays) on the issue of universal health care. 
   Mr. Speaker, again I am very pleased to have this time to speak on a topic that remains of paramount concern to individuals and families across the country, and that is again the issue of health care in America. 
   Health care costs, Mr. Speaker, are rising in the United States at an alarming, alarming rate. Yet despite the fact that we spend more per capita on health care than any other industrialized country, we produce very disappointing outcomes by a number of important measures. One major attributable factor is the high level of uninsured in America. 
   Furthermore, the U.S. remains the only developed nation that does not guarantee health coverage as a right to all of its citizens. Today, there are nearly 47 million Americans who lack health insurance coverage, leaving one in six without access to proper medical care. What makes these figures more shocking is that over 80 percent of the uninsured come from working families. As the cost of health care continues to rise, it is clearly burdening our families and placing American employers at more and more of a competitive disadvantage. Therefore, I believe it is our duty as policymakers to offer a new vision and new solutions to fix our ailing health care system. 
   Providing quality, affordable health care to every American has been a long-time priority of mine. And it is in this spirit of furthering the national dialogue on this important issue that my colleague from Connecticut, Congressman Chris Shays and I have worked together to introduce H.R. 5348, the American Health Benefits Program Act of 2008. 
   This bipartisan universal health care proposal is based on a tried-and-true program that has stood the test of time, and that is the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program or FEHBP as it is called. Currently over 8 million Federal employees, retirees and their dependents receive health insurance coverage under FEHBP. This includes Members of Congress. 
   This program uses a system of managed competition between private insurance carriers and provides enrollees with a large menu of coverage options. Its use of bulk purchasing power helps contain costs and brings stability to the system. In 2007, this resulted in an average premium increase of just 1.8 percent compared to the private market average of 6.1 percent. And by the way, I have yet to come across an employer, at least in my home district, or anywhere in the country, for that matter, who has only realized a 6.1 percent increase in their health care costs. Generally it is in the double digits and sometimes you can be talking about 20 or 30 percent or more increases to a given health care plan in any given year. Our proposal basically would use that successful model to provide similar benefits to all Americans, establishing the first ever American health benefits program or AHBP. 
   Now the development of AHBP will be guided by eight fundamental principles, and they are on this chart to my right: choice, shared responsibility, affordability, portability, continuity, preventive care, and health care reinvestment. I believe these are the types of principles that we have to have in any type of system and they are certainly the core tenets of our universal health care proposal. 
   Now under AHBP, employers who wish to continue negotiating with private insurance carriers may do so as long as the coverage they offer meets a basic standard set by AHBP. However, employer-sponsored coverage is proving to be more and more cost-prohibitive for businesses as health care costs continue to outpace inflation and insurance options drastically fluctuate from plan to plan. That's why AHBP allows companies to choose to pay a fixed predictable payroll tax according to their size and average employee earnings. 
   We have a chart here which says that depending on the average number of employees that a company has, as well as according to their average salary, they would pay a certain percentage of their payroll tax. For example, on the very lower end where you have the small businesses that have the lowest average earnings, that company would only pay a maximum of 4 percent of payroll. 
   On the higher end, you would have the companies that at the very highest end would pay no more than 10 percent of payroll. There would be a certain cap on the average earning itself. 
   So my point is that there is a range of options here. There is a range of plans to choose from, but this is also an affordable way for employees to have health care coverage. 
   Basically we are separating out the coverage from the workplace itself. We need to get away from the issue of just employer-sponsored coverage. I think it is the best way to go, and it is a sensible proposal. 
   For many businesses this may cost less than they currently spend on premium contributions and health care and health plan administration. Payroll tax revenue under the system we are proposing will basically create a funding stream to allow for a fixed government contribution of 72 percent toward health care premiums of every participating American. 
   Individuals in AHBP will have the responsibility to pay for the remaining share of their premiums, to the extent that they can afford it, again with the lowest income earners receiving subsidies to ensure affordability. 
   This new program is not a single-payer system. It is not one size fits all, and it does not reinvent the wheel. Medicare, Medicaid and veteran services and other public programs that are tailored to specific populations will remain intact. Additionally, no one will be denied coverage or discriminated against based on their health status or preexisting condition. That is a very important tenet of this proposal. 
   AHBP will use basically an expanded system of managed competition to ensure that private insurance carriers compete for enrollees on the basis of benefits as well as efficiency, service and price. It will offer portable and continuous coverage and incentivize investment in disease preventive and  long-term preventive care which decrease the costs of care over time. 
   Investments in health information technology will also lower costs while increasing quality and efficiency. 
   Mr. Speaker, instituting meaningful systemic reforms will require a fundamental shift in how we view employer-provided coverage and health care delivery. While it is critical that businesses maintain a role, I believe it is essential that we change our perspective of health insurance as a privilege or benefit tied to employment. Instead, we must look at it as a right and a responsibility to be shared by the community. Individuals and employers, health care providers and the government, all have key roles to play in reaching a truly inclusive and efficient health care model. 
   The unsettling truth is that society already pays for the uninsured. Some think that there is no cost associated with the uninsured. That is completely not true. Society already pays for the uninsured, but it does so at tremendous cost and with staggering inefficiencies. Individuals without health insurance are most often forced to seek care from doctors and hospital emergency rooms only after their illnesses reach catastrophic levels, drastically increasing the risk of complications and the cost of treatment. 
   Our most recent estimates place total uninsured medical expenses at nearly $125 billion a year. That is staggering. Approximately $41 billion of this total comes in the form of uncompensated care which is predominantly borne by the government and financed by the taxpayer. Beyond this, the cost is also reflected in the form of higher health insurance premiums that everyone pays. This cost is only compounded by the lost income due to reduced employment and job productivity. However, Mr. Speaker, the most disturbing costs are not the monetary costs in nature, but the immeasurable price that we pay in human lives each year as a result of inequitable, inadequate care. 
   A recently released analysis estimated that 22,000 deaths nationwide occurred last year resulting from adults not having health insurance, averaging one death every 24 minutes. This is simply an unacceptable price to pay for delaying necessary reforms to our health care system, and we need to change it. 
   The challenges we face in fixing our ailing health care system are great. However, the costs of inaction are even greater. 
   Mr. Speaker, the time has come for policymakers at all levels and across the ideological spectrum to take action toward developing a health care system that really works for our Nation, one that offers Americans choice, calls for shared responsibility, and is affordable to all.     
   I believe our proposal introduces a practical model for universal health care while leaving room for further discussion on this very complex issue. And, Mr. Speaker, I believe this is not a Democratic or a Republican issue. It's not a conservative or a liberal issue. It's an issue that matters most to the American people. 
   And on that note, I am pleased to yield this evening to the gentleman from Connecticut, my partner in this bipartisan universal health care bill and this effort to finally, once and for all, solve our Nation's health care crisis, the gentleman from Connecticut, Mr. Chris Shays.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. I thank the gentleman for his words and also his passion and support on this bipartisan universal health care bill. Your input has been invaluable in crafting this bipartisan bill and bringing it to where it is today, and we hope that this, now, continues, where we begin the process of fixing our health care system, bringing it to the top of the public policy agenda. It is clearly long overdue. 
   The American people are asking, they're demanding that we fix our health care crisis, and that we cover the uninsured, not only cover the uninsured, but making health care affordable. This is something that's long overdue. 
   I think it's a national disgrace that we have 47 million people in this country without health insurance. And as we have both pointed out, that because of that, it's a major contributing factor in that we have the highest cost and the worst outcomes in comparison to other industrialized nations. Again, the high number of uninsured is a major contributing factor to that statistic. 
   So the fact that we have a bill now is exciting because it's based on a template, a tried and true program that's already working. 
   When I first came to this debate, I said, this is one of the most, the biggest challenges facing our country right now. And I said, why can't we solve it? And is there anything out there that is working now that serves as an example of what we could base a universal health care system on? 
   And after studying it and looking at it, I said it's really right before us, and that's the Federal employees health benefits program. Right now, we have, the Federal Government, as mentioned earlier, negotiates a variety of different health care plans for more than 8 million Federal employees, dependents and retirees. You've got everything, and the choices of options that are available, from the very basic plan with the small premium and the small copay, up to the more classic comprehensive Blue Cross-type plans and everything in between.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. That's right. Absolutely. And it's equally important to recognize that this is not a big government-run plan. We're not creating another big government bureaucracy. It's government negotiated but it's private competition. It's managed competition. Private insurers would be able to compete for now enrollees based on benefits, efficiency service and price. So the insurance companies have an incentive now to economize, find efficiencies. They would have to deliver on what has been negotiated in the various plans, and that would be clearly spelled out, but they would now be challenged to find ways to do things like invest in preventative and early care, which there really isn't necessarily the incentive, I believe, right now for insurers to do that, because, for example, when it's tied to employment, you know, we all, people change jobs several times throughout their careers. There's no guarantee that an enrollee that starts with an insurance company today is going it would be Insurance Company B, you know, wouldn't be with the Insurance Company A years down the road. They would be with potentially another insurance company, which means, you know, why should Insurance Company A invest in all this early preventative care, when, down the road, when someone gets older and we all become greater consumers of health care, that, why would they, that company wouldn't benefit from the investment that they made, where under this system they would. You may change plans within a particular company, but you may very well be with the same insurance company or plan throughout most of your life.

   Mr. LANGEVIN. Right. 
   And I think that is an important point, if I could just interject. The high costs of health care now are putting not only a tremendous burden on our individuals and families, but it's putting our companies at a significant competitive disadvantage in terms of those companies overseas whose nations have universal health care. And so it is not particularly burdening in individual business itself in foreign countries where it is here where companies bear much of the costs of providing universal health care. 
   So we're helping to change the dynamic, if you would, of how health care is provided in America. And, again, we're changing it from an employer kind of run system, a sponsor system, to now a universal health care model that everybody is participating in, and it's not necessarily tied to employment. Again, businesses still have an important role to play, we all do. Businesses, government, health care providers.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Right. And that's an important point to make. 
   There are some employers that, though they offer health insurance, the company may only offer one plan, and it may not fit the needs of all of the employees. It may be good for some but, again, not everyone. 
   Under this plan, there would be a variety of plans to choose from: again, a very basic plan with a small premium, a small copay, up to the more comprehensive-type programs, and several options in between. And it's basically bringing everyone into one insurance pool. 
   So you're bringing a younger, healthier population into the program; you're spreading risk, which leads to more stable costs; and we talked about the fact that the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program under last year only had a 1.8 percent increase in its health care plans on average and the private sector had about a 6.1 percent increase. And I think that's even modest. 
   So, again, a good model here. 
   I'm glad that you raised the issue of the commission because it is important to look at the reasons for the rising costs of health care and then look at what options we can employ to achieve cost containment and bring stability to the system. Things like employing health information technology, the electronic medical records that we're talking more and more about these days, the cost of prescription drugs and how that system is run, and how we pay for prescription drugs. I'm looking at performance-based outcomes that the commission would look at. Again, all important tenets of achieving cost containment. 
   And you rightly pointed out that employers, in determining whether they like the system or not, are going to look at the range of costs or percentage of payroll that they would contribute based on the size of their company. Employers, I suspect right now, hopefully this will encourage them to ask, what are we paying as a percentage of payroll right now, and that figure will determine, in many ways, whether this system works better or worse for them. I suspect that in many cases it will be better. 
   And we pointed out that the smaller companies with the lowest average salaries would pay no more than 4 percent of their payroll toward this payroll tax. And the larger companies with the highest salaries would pay no more than 10 percent of payroll and not to exceed more than $12,000 per employee.

   Mr. LANGEVIN. I couldn't agree more. This is one of the most challenging issues facing us in our time right now. It's going to take time and effort to get the message out and hopefully encourage support for our plan. 
   I'm glad that you and I have made a commitment to travel the country so that we can help to bring the plan before people, hopefully to educate the American people about what we're proposing, and offering this as a viable solution to our Nation's health care crisis. It's clearly long overdue. And in my home State of Rhode Island, it's the number one domestic issue that I hear most about. It is directly tied in many ways to the health of our economy and making sure that our companies can be competitive in this global market. It's important to individuals and families. 
   And no person should have to worry if they're going to lose their home because they come down with a catastrophic illness or a family member comes down with a catastrophic illness, but that happens every day across this country right now because of the present health care system. And again, it's not that there is no cost associated with the uninsured. If someone is that sick and they need to be treated, they're going to go, very often, to the hospital, to the emergency room where they're going to be seen. But usually by then it's at the end stage of an illness where a person is so sick that they have to be likely hospitalized, or the cost of treating them is far more expensive than it otherwise would have been at the earlier stages when early intervention, early care would have made all the difference if it were with a prescription or some other treatment. Now we're offering a system to change that.

   Mr. LANGEVIN. I thank the gentleman from Connecticut again for his words and his support in helping to craft this bipartisan universal health care bill. 
   Like you, I believe that the American people deserve the same kind of health care coverage as Members of Congress. And this is a bill that achieves that goal. It's something that is long overdue. It's something that is vitally important to every family across America, making sure that our families are taken care of, our businesses can stay competitive, and that we're offering something that is affordable, not only for the short term, but for the long term. 
   In closing, for individuals, the American Health Benefits Program offers choice, affordability, and portability. You can take the coverage with you if you change jobs. And on the side of how we provide this coverage, it's managed competition whereby insurers would now have to compete for enrollees based on benefits, efficiency, service and price; again, a good model for guaranteeing coverage, but making sure that it's affordable, with an important component of cost containment, making sure that we're looking at using the most innovative technologies out there, such as health IT records, and other things that would make sure that we're providing the most efficient and affordable care possible, but comprehensive care.

I look forward to traveling the country with you as we talk to groups across the country and hopefully enlisting their support,  and ultimately the support of all the Members of this House and the Senate. 
   I look forward to the day where we can pass this bill in both Chambers and put it on the President's desk for the President's signature, and again, truly make a difference for the people that we serve. I think it's the right thing to do. 
   With that, I thank my colleague from Connecticut for his friendship, his valuable input and support on this bipartisan universal health care bill. And I also want to take a minute just to thank the Speaker for giving us time to discuss this very important issue.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (RAIL AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding, and I want to commend him on his outstanding leadership in bringing this bill to the floor. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act, H.R. 1401, which will significantly strengthen the safety of our Nation's rail and mass transit systems. 
   Mass transit systems worldwide have long been terrorist targets.     
   Within the past few years, terrorists have exploited security vulnerabilities to carry out attacks on mass transit systems in London, Madrid, and Mumbai. We are fortunate to have escaped attack here in the United States, but make no mistake about it, the threat continues to be very real. 
   Each day, over 11.3 million Americans utilize our Nation's rail and public transit systems. Therefore, we must strike a delicate balance between tightening security and allowing for the free flow of passengers heading to school, work, and recreational activities. 
   One of the ways we can make a difference is in training our mass transit and railway personnel. Rail and mass transit security workers are our first line of defense in identifying abnormal activity and protecting passengers from potentially harmful situations. It is therefore vital that we equip them with the training that they need to be effective. Now, this legislation will create mandatory security training programs to prepare all front-line railroad and public transportation workers for potential threat conditions. 
   I am also pleased that this bill finally authorizes additional funding for enhanced security efforts. On average, Mr. Chairman, we spend $9 per air passenger annually on security but only 1 penny per rail and mass transit passenger. This is clearly an unbalanced approach to our transportation security. 
   Now, while we should continue to allocate sufficient funding to secure our aviation sector, we must also increase the resources we dedicate to rail and mass transit. I am confident that H.R. 1401 will bring us another step closer to achieving this goal. 
   Mr. Chairman, we have certainly come a long way in making our Nation safer since September 11, but we are still not yet safe. This bill, combined with other homeland security measures passed in recent months, will close many of the existing gaps and make our Nation safer. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece of legislation. Again, I commend the chairman for his leadership in bringing this important bill to the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act of 2008, H.R. 2830, which will allow the Coast Guard to appropriately balance its dual missions of safety and security. In the past few years, we have increasingly depended on the Coast Guard to ensure our shores against drug smuggling, acts of terrorism, and other suspicious activity, while simultaneously keeping recreational and commercial boaters safe. 
   Unfortunately, the Coast Guard has been required to do more with less. This important measure will reverse that trend by providing an additional 1,500 Coast Guard personnel and $8.4 billion in increased funding to ensure that the Coast Guard can carry out all of these responsibilities successfully. I am particularly pleased this bill will increase oversight and efficiency of the Transportation Worker Identification Credential, or the TWIC program as it's known, which has encountered numerous problems since its inception nearly 6 years ago. Many businesses, particularly those in my home State of Rhode Island, particularly those hiring seasonal and temporary employees have experienced economic hardship under the program. But the bill before us will help fix many of the problems associated with the TWIC program. 
   Finally, H.R. 2830 will require the Coast Guard to protect and enforce security zones around all existing liquefied natural gas, or LNG facilities, and encourages State and local entities to assist the Coast Guard with this important mission. This provision will allow LNG facilities to safety operate in densely populated areas, such as those in my home State of Rhode Island. 
   In closing, Mr. Chairman, I commend both Chairman Thompson and Chairman Oberstar for their leadership in bringing this bill to the floor today, and I urge my colleagues to support the measure.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend this body for getting us back on track to fully implementing all the recommendations made by the bipartisan 9/11 Commission. The 9/11 Commission provided an objective and eye-opening assessment of how terrorists were able to exploit our security vulnerabilities on September 11 and made 41 key recommendations to address these shortcomings. Unfortunately, 2 1/2 years after the Commission's report, glaring threats still remain. 
   Just over a year ago, the 9/11 Discourse Project issued a report card that gave the administration Ds and Fs in some of the most critical areas. Today, we finally have an opportunity to ensure that the 9/11 Commission's tireless efforts were not in vain. H.R. 1 would shore up remaining vulnerabilities and implement recommendations that have been ignored completely or have been only partially addressed until now. 
   As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on the Prevention of Nuclear and Biological Attack in the 109th Congress, I am pleased that this bill makes it more difficult for terrorists to obtain nuclear materials. It strengthens our global nonproliferation programs, which have proven successful in securing the most dangerous nuclear material abroad. 
   To further protect our homeland from nuclear threats, H.R. 1 also requires 100 percent screening of cargo. 
   Finally, this legislation will help our first responders, who place their lives on the line each and every day, by funding State and local interoperable communications systems essential for emergency response. H.R. 1 also significantly improves information sharing, which is our first line of defense. 
   This is a good bill, and I urge passage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend this body for considering legislation which with finally get us back on track to fully implement all of the recommendations made by the bipartisan 9/11 Commission in 2004. 
   The 9/11 Commission provided our nation an objective and eye-opening assessment of how terrorists were able to exploit our security vulnerabilities on September 11th and made 41 key recommendations to address these shortcomings. 
   Unfortunately, two and a half years after the Commission's recommendations, there are still glaring threats that remain to be addressed. In fact, just over a year ago, the 9/11 Public Discourse Project issued a report card that gave the Administration D's and F's in some of the most critical areas. 
   Today, we finally have an opportunity to ensure that the 9/11 Commission's tireless efforts were not in vain. The legislation before us would shore up remaining vulnerabilities and implement recommendations that have been ignored completely or only partially addressed until now. 
   As the former Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Prevention of Nuclear and Biological Attack, I am particularly pleased that this bill contains several provisions to make our nation more secure from the threat of a nuclear attack. H.R. 1 strengthens our most effective global non-proliferation programs, like Cooperative Threat Reduction and the Global Threat Reduction Initiative. These programs have proven successful in securing the most dangerous nuclear material abroad, before it can get into the hands of those who would do us harm. 
   Additionally, this measure gives the United States the power to sanction individuals involved in the illegal trade of nuclear material. It also builds upon the recently enacted SAFE Ports Act by requiring all cargo containers be scanned before leaving their port of origin and improves the quality of their inspections. 
   Today we are also taking a long-overdue, comprehensive approach to the vulnerabilities that remain in our aviation system. Under this measure, we will finally screen 100 percent of cargo on passenger planes and improve airline screening checkpoints to detect explosives. This measure will also create a redress process for passengers misidentified against the ``No Fly'' or ``Selectee'' watchlists who have been wrongfully delayed or prohibited from boarding a flight. 
   This measure provides significant support to first responders, who place their lives on the line each day, by funding state and local efforts to obtain the interoperable communication systems essential for emergency response. Additionally, our bill will considerably improve information sharing, which is one of our most effective forms of defense. H.R. 1 will strengthen fusion centers across the country, helping state and local law enforcement build relationships across every level and discipline of government and with the private sector to help ensure that criminal intelligence and other information is shared with those who can put it to the best use. 
   Finally, this legislation will protect the privacy and civil liberties of Americans, while effectively combating terrorism. Under this measure, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board will be reestablished as an independent agency, which will greatly enhance the Board's oversight functions and help to ensure that we do not sacrifice freedom in the name of security. 
   The best way to honor those who died in the attacks of September 11th is to learn from the lessons of that tragic day, and this bill brings us much closer towards achieving this goal.

   Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution expressing support for designation of the week of February 4 through February 8, 2008, as ``National School Counseling Week.'' I am proud to be a cosponsor of this resolution, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank our school counselors for their hard work. 
   I am committed to ensuring that all school districts, particularly those with the greatest economic needs, have access to the necessary resources to retain talented teachers and school counselors. I have enjoyed a wonderful working relationship with school counselors in my home State of Rhode Island. I have seen firsthand the difference that the quality school counselors in our State are making in our children's lives and understand the tremendous need for the training and placement of more of these professionals in our schools. 
   We must make sure that our school counselors have the resources necessary to help our children, and that is why I am a strong proponent of increasing funding for the Elementary and Secondary School Counseling Program--one of the programs that No Child Left Behind promised to expand. Funding from this program helps to ensure that all school districts have the ability to retain talented teachers and school counselors. However, despite this promise, school counselors and other advocates have had to fight hard to  maintain this program at the elementary level, and this year marks the first time it has enough funding to reach high school students. It has been and will continue to be a priority of mine to ensure that the federal commitment to education matches what we ask of school districts. 
   While we designate one week to honor our school counselors, let us pledge to help them the rest of the year with the resources they need--and deserve.

   It is unfortunate that there are children in our country who do not know their worth, and because of this, many end up failing in school or falling into troubled lives. Mentors help these children get back on a path to success by imparting the most important message--that they too can succeed. Mentors have helped youth build up their self-esteem and work on their academics and social skills. Many mentors also help students reach their potential by helping them prepare for college and career development. 
   Madam Speaker, I hope that by recognizing January as National Mentoring Month, we can honor the positive effect that mentoring has had on the youngest members of our society. I also hope that highlighting the importance of these relationships encourages others to seek out mentoring opportunities in their communities. This not only helps our children, but our society as a whole.

   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act, which will bring greater transparency to lending practices nationwide. The housing market is under significant stress, and many families cannot keep pace with ballooning mortgage payments. 
   Unconventional mortgages have left countless Americans facing foreclosure. Unless we act soon, millions more may lose their homes. With this bill, we combat unscrupulous lending practices and bring transparency to the process by requiring mortgage originators to be licensed and mandating full disclosure of loan terms. Perhaps most importantly, mortgage originators must certify that consumers have a reasonable ability to pay back loans and that they are not predatory in nature. We have seen too many lenders steer consumers into loans they cannot afford. 
   This measure will address persistent problems in the housing market and bring financial stability to families. I thank Chairman Frank for his leadership, and I urge support for the bill.

   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3773. This legislation does exactly what our Constitution requires us to do: protect security while preserving civil liberties. 
   Maintaining that balance has sometimes been difficult, and the events of 9/11 have made it even more challenging. However, the RESTORE Act is a carefully crafted solution. We all recognize the gravity of the threats facing our country, and this bill gives the Director of National Intelligence all the authority he has asked for to fight terrorism while at the same time it protects civil liberties. 
   Further, the RESTORE Act provides for rigorous and independent oversight from the courts, the Congress, and the Department of Justice Inspector General. In our committee markup, I successfully offered an amendment to even strengthen this oversight by preserving the FISA Court's role to review compliance with their rules every 90 days for the life of a court order. 
   Rigorous oversight is why the Bush administration objects to this bill. They want unfettered authority. Unfortunately, we have seen what happens without checks and balances, and I will not allow that to happen again. As Members of Congress, we took an oath to defend the Constitution and the principles on which it was founded.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3773. 
   Today, as we have so many times in our history, we are wrestling with the question of how best to protect security while preserving liberty. That struggle has always been challenging, and the events of 9/11 made it even more so. But today, the RESTORE Act provides a carefully crafted solution to that problem. 
   We all recognize the gravity of the threats facing our country, and that is why this bill gives the Director of National Intelligence all the authority he has asked for to fight terrorism. The legislation updates FISA to address new developments in technology so that our intelligence activities are not constrained based on what method of communication suspects happen to be using or where the communication may be routed. The bill also clarifies that no warrant is needed for foreign-to-foreign communications. These are requests that the DNI has made and which are included in the bill. 
   However, unlike the so-called Protect America Act, which passed in August, the RESTORE Act provides for rigorous and independent oversight from the courts, the Congress, and the Department of Justice Inspector General. 
   Additionally, during the Intelligence Committee's consideration of the bill, I successfully offered an amendment to strengthen the oversight by preserving the FISA Court's role to review compliance with their rules every 90 days for the life of a court order. By having the FISA Court review the procedures and guidelines used by the DNI and Attorney General when determining that prospective targets are located outside the U.S., we provide another safeguard against the collection of communications of people inside the U.S. Finally, the bill requires greater congressional oversight of the program so that we can monitor how it is being implemented and make any changes that may become necessary. 
   Such rigorous oversight is why the Bush administration objects to this bill. To them, the Protect America Act that passed in August is just fine the way it is. They want unfettered authority, without checks and balances. But we have seen what happens when the administration is given free rein, and I will not let that happen again. 
   I want to be clear that this is not a perfect bill. While in theory it is a vast improvement over the Protect America Act, in reality, this legislation will only work if everyone involved follows the rules that Congress establishes and remains within the confines of the law. Like any program, and indeed more so than most, this one could be subject to abuse, and we must remain vigilant in our efforts to ensure that does not happen. We have included meaningful safeguards and significant checks and balances in this measure. However, these provisions are only as strong as the individuals and agencies implementing them. Congress must continue to conduct robust oversight and insist on the briefings and information to which we are entitled. If we fail in these efforts and abuses occur, we will have ourselves to blame. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have faced grave threats before. Our Constitution was drafted at a time when the very survival of our Nation was in doubt. Yet our Founding Fathers made the preservation of basic liberties part of the fabric of our national identity. 
   As Members of Congress, it is our sworn duty to defend the Constitution and the principles on which our Nation was founded. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3773, which protects security while preserving the liberties that make this country great.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. 2669. Since my arrival in Congress, I have worked to support initiatives that would expand access to higher education for all students, regardless of disability, background or economic circumstances. Need-based federal student aid programs have leveled the playing field for so many students, yet in recent years the purchasing power offered by a Pell grant has dwindled. Meanwhile, college education costs have soared, and more and more students struggling to keep up with loan repayments have found themselves locked into high interest rates and unable to consolidate their debt. Others have seen their dreams of higher education go unrealized, due to concerns about how they could possibly pay for it. 
   Today, Congress takes a meaningful step to address these issues. The College Cost Reduction Act, the single largest investment in education since the GI bill, will cut interest rates in half on subsidized student loans over the next four years, make student debt more manageable for those facing economic hardship and increase the purchasing power of the Pell grant. Additionally, this bill will encourage and reward public service by offering loan forgiveness and repayment of our most dedicated military service members, nurses, early childhood educators and others who take on some of the most needed and challenging--but not the most lucrative--professions. In the battle to improve access to affordable education, the passage of the College Cost Reduction Act is a tremendous victory. 
   I strongly believe that the passage of this bill into law will make America stronger. While our Nation certainly faces challenging times of war and economic hardships, we should take tremendous hope and pride in the investments that Congress is making in the future by expanding access to higher education. I am proud to support this legislation and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 2669.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (TAX INCREASE PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Temporary Tax Relief Act (H.R. 3996), which will provide tax relief for hard-working, middle-class Americans. However, while I strongly support shielding these taxpayers from the Alternative Minimum Tax, I am deeply disappointed that our efforts to pay for this fix now, rather than charging it to future generations, have been blocked. 
   Congress first enacted the alternative minimum tax (AMT) in 1969 to ensure that 155 wealthy taxpayers paid their fair share of the federal income tax. But because the tax was not indexed for inflation, it has since become outdated and unfair. Without a fix, this year over 23 million Americans--and 75,000 Rhode Islanders--would be forced to pay nearly $2,000 in additional taxes to which they were never intended to be subjected. Today's bill will provide a one-year patch to prevent these middle-class Americans from being caught in the ever widening-net of the AMT. 
   While everyone agrees that AMT relief must be passed swiftly, I am concerned with the circumstances under which this bill is being considered. Just two months ago the House of Representatives passed a fiscally responsible measure that fully complied with pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) rules. In fact, I was proud to vote twice for legislation that provided for the necessary AMT relief and was fully paid for. Unfortunately, Republican obstructionism has forced us to consider a measure that will add $50 billion to the national debt. Fixing the AMT is important, and taxpayers should not suffer the consequences of political games. What saddens me is that there was an easy way to accomplish this goal without adding to the deficit, and we chose to ignore it. 
   I am also disappointed that this measure provides only temporary relief rather than presenting a long-term sustainable solution. We must develop a more permanent and fiscally responsible solution to the AMT, as it will continue to affect an increasing number of taxpayers in future years. 
   I would like to thank Chairman RANGEL for his leadership in bringing this measure to the floor, and for his valiant efforts to follow a more fiscally responsible course. I am hopeful that as we continue to debate national tax policy, we will develop permanent solution to the AMT issue which does not place the burden of paying for it on our future generations. 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, today I am voting against H.R. 3996, a bill adjusting the Alternative Minimum Tax. While the bill helps some middle class families, it does so at the expense of expanding our national debt and burdening the next generation with the cost of paying for it. I voted for the original version of this bill that came before the House earlier this fall because it was fiscally responsible. It brought relief to middle class families in a budget-neutral way by closing tax loopholes for hedge fund  managers and corporate CEOs who shield their income off-shore. Unfortunately, the Senate stripped out the provisions that would replace the revenue lost through this AMT adjustment, so I cannot in good conscience support it. 
   The AMT was originally enacted to ensure that high income taxpayers pay at least a minimum amount of federal taxes. It prevents individuals from taking unfair advantage of the various preferences and incentives under the regular income tax and reducing their income tax liability below what we as a society consider an appropriate tax contribution given their wealth. The reckless tax policies advanced by President Bush during the past 6 years further complicated the way the AMT is applied. As a result, it will affect around 20 million families next year, many of whom the AMT was not originally intended to reach. 
   Reforming the AMT is warranted, and that's why I voted for this bill when it was paid for. Now we have a $50 billion give-away that's not paid for. Instead, it will increase our national debt, a debt financed by China and other nations. And the next generation--our children and grandchildren--will be stuck paying China back instead of investing in America. That's wrong. I believe that we must adhere to the pay-as-you-go rules that this House adopted at the beginning of the year. Just as a family has to balance its checkbook, the federal government must do the same. A federal government that is not fiscally sound cannot make the necessary investments we need in education, health care, housing, defense, homeland security, and other national priorities.

   Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my support for S. 2499, the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Extension Act. This bill includes a number of provisions that are essential to the continued delivery of vital healthcare programs to our Nation's most vulnerable citizens. 
   This measure offers much-needed relief to physicians that serve our Medicare population by providing a 6-month suspension of the 10-percent cut in Medicare payments scheduled to occur on January 1, providing instead a modest increase of 0.5 percent. It also extends important incentive payment programs that provide a 5-percent bonus to physicians serving areas with a shortage of doctors, while ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries have continued access to therapy services through June 30, 2008. 
   Also included in this bill is a vital extension for the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) through March 31, 2009. Currently, 24,900 Rhode Islanders are enrolled in  the SCHIP portion of Rhode Island's model RITE Care program. As a proud Representative of Rhode Island and a longtime supporter of SCHIP, I cannot stress enough how important this program is to the health and well-being of our children, expectant mothers and parents alike. Although this was not the outcome that I and many of my colleagues originally envisioned for SCHIP, this extension is crucial for States like Rhode Island that are facing tremendous budgetary shortfalls. 
   Madam Speaker, access to quality, affordable healthcare is integral to the prosperity of every American. While I am pleased that this Congress was able to reach a compromise to provide temporary relief for our country's most important safety net programs, I believe that we have the potential to do so much more. Health care providers that have pledged to continue serving the aging, disabled, and low-income citizens deserve more than stopgap measures and temporary relief. This Congress has an obligation to take meaningful action to reform and stabilize the Medicare provider payment system, as well as to ensure the continued strength and success of our Medicaid and SCHIP programs. To that end, I will continue to work in a bipartisan manner with my colleagues in an effort to guarantee that these issues are properly addressed in this and future Congresses.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act. I commend the sponsors. I believe that this is a necessary and compassionate step in helping families recover from problems caused by the continuing mortgage crisis. 
   Let's face it. Unscrupulous lending practices have taken their toll as hardworking families struggle to keep pace with ballooning mortgage payments. 
   Under current law any debt forgiven by a lender is treated as phantom income and subject to taxation. At a time when so many families are already in crisis, it is fundamentally unfair to penalize them by taxing money they may recover through refinancing their mortgage or foreclosure of their homes. 
   The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act will change the Tax Code to prevent forgiven mortgage debts from being assessed as gross income. This critical measure will help address the persistent problems in the housing market that have resulted from unfair lending practices. And I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 (H.R. 3648). This measure is a necessary and compassionate step in helping individuals and families recover from the problems caused by the continuing mortgage crisis. 
   Unscrupulous lending practices have taken their toll on hard-working families, who are increasingly unable to keep pace with their ballooning mortgage payments. We have all seen how the skyrocketing interest rates associated with nontraditional mortgages, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, have devastated families nationwide. These families are often left with few options. They may either try to renegotiate the terms of their mortgage for fixed interest rates, or be forced to foreclose on their homes. Both options can be emotionally difficult and are further complicated by the hefty taxes that may result. 
   Under current law, when a lender forgives all or part of a loan, it is required to report the amount of debt forgiven to the IRS and to the homeowner. That amount is subsequently treated as ``phantom income'' and is subject to taxation by the IRS. At a time when families are already in financial dire straits, it is fundamentally unfair to penalize them by taxing the money they recover through either refinancing their mortgage or foreclosure of their homes. 
   I am proud to support the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act, which will change the Tax Code to prevent forgiven mortgage debts from being assessed as gross income. This improvement will limit the financial penalties families incur when refinancing their homes at fixed rates and could even keep some families on the brink of foreclosure from losing their homes. I am also pleased that, under this legislation, people would not be unfairly taxed when a lender voluntarily agrees to waive prepayment penalty fees. 
   The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act is a critical measure that will help address the persistent problems in the housing market resulting from unfair lending practices. This legislation is another important step toward fixing the mortgage crisis nationwide, and will help stabilize families throughout the Nation and our economy as a whole.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, every day now, it's becoming more and more apparent that the President's troop escalation plan is not stemming the civil war in Iraq. 
   In fact, since the plan took effect earlier this year, violence in Iraq is up, and our soldiers are paying a heavy price on the battlefield. For months now, Democrats have stood united in our commitment to forge a new direction in Iraq, but our efforts have received very little support from congressional Republicans. 
   It appears that is beginning to change. Earlier this week, one of the most respected Members of the Republican party on international affairs, Senator RICHARD LUGAR, said that we must recalibrate our strategy in Iraq to fit our domestic political conditions and broader needs of national security. Then yesterday, Senator Voinovich said that he doesn't believe the Iraqis are going to get it until they know we are leaving. 
   Both Senator Lugar and Senator Voinovich's comments are a blow to the White House and serve as yet another example of long-time supporters of the President's Iraq policy believing we are long overdue for a new direction. It's time for the congressional Republicans to face the reality and join us in dramatically changing course in Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 312, the Budget Resolution for fiscal year 2009. This proposal fulfills an important commitment that we have made to the American people by investing in fiscally responsible tax relief to millions of households and in programs that strengthen the economy, make America safer, and help families struggling to make ends meet in an economic downturn. 
   On February 6, I expressed my strong concerns over the misguided budget request that the President transmitted to Congress. I am very pleased to see that the budget before us today restores many of the important programs that the President proposed to cut, while achieving balance by 2012. It is more vital than ever that we remain responsive to the needs of the American people, while maintaining strong fiscal stewardship to ensure our financial obligations are not passed along to our children and grandchildren. 
   Any budgetary blueprint that we expect to bolster the economy must also include an investment in education and job training programs that will promote new employment and ensure our workforce can adapt to the jobs of the future. Unfortunately, those programs were not priorities for this Administration. Under the President's proposal, Rhode Island would see $1.5 million less for after-school programs and a cut of almost $6 million for career and technical education. In contrast, the Democratic budget resolution would provide $7.1 billion more than the President for vital education, job training, and social services programs nationwide in 2009. 
   I am pleased that this resolution addresses the President's failure to make higher education affordable for students with economic challenges, especially in Rhode Island, where college tuition has risen 45 percent in 4 years. This measure also includes crucial funding for the Democratic innovation agenda and the America COMPETES Act, which will enhance our edge in math and science education and research. To maintain our economic advantage in the coming years, our Nation must invest more in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, education. 
   Also critical to America's economic prosperity is a budget that promotes fiscally responsible tax relief to millions of families struggling to make ends meet. In particular, this measure includes a 1-year patch to keep millions of hard-working, middle-class Americans outside the ever-widening net of the alternative minimum tax, AMT, and it is 
   fully offset. In addition, the Democratic budget will extend the R&D tax credit, which will spur economic growth, create new jobs, and help struggling small businesses regain their competitive edge. 
   Community development and social services programs will play an important role for businesses and families as we attempt to reclaim our economic prosperity, and I am proud to support a budget that funds these initiatives. This budget restores community and regional development programs, like the Community Development Block Grant, CDBG, program, which provides vital funding for economic and community development in both urban and rural areas nationwide. The House Democratic budget resolution also reverses cuts to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, and the Weatherization Assistance Program, which helps people actually reduce their energy consumption. These programs are vital to places like Rhode Island where families are struggling with astronomical heating costs. 
   This budget resolution also includes $1.2 billion more than the President's budget for energy programs. As families face unprecedented costs to heat their homes and put gas in their cars, it is imperative that we fund efficient and renewable energy programs. H. Con. Res. 312 does this by encouraging the production of renewable energy alternatives, increasing energy efficiency, investing in new energy and vehicle technologies, and training workers for ``green collar'' jobs. This resolution also encourages mass transit by increasing funding for Amtrak. I am proud that Rhode Island has already started many of these initiatives, but Democrats recognize that we need to support them on a broad, nationwide basis. 
   Equally important during this challenging economic time is the continued need for strong health care funding. The Democratic budget measure rejects the President's proposed 10-year cut of over $500 billion to both Medicare and Medicaid, two vital safety net programs serving our Nation's elderly, low-income, and disabled citizens. It also provides  an increase over the President's proposed discretionary health care budget to fund programs that emphasize support for disease-prevention, food safety, and access to quality health care for underserved populations. I am also very pleased to see that this budget will accommodate up to a $50 billion increase to expand children's health insurance to cover millions of uninsured children. 
   Health care also remains the highest priority for our Nation's veterans and the brave men and women currently serving in our Armed Forces. This resolution appropriately addresses veterans' needs by rejecting the President's proposed new fees and increasing veterans funding by $3.6 billion relative to the amount needed to keep pace with inflation. This will provide increased resources for the VA to treat 5.8 million patients in 2009, including 333,275 Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans. We cannot lose sight of the fact that the VA will play a larger role in the coming years as more servicemembers return from ongoing conflicts. 
   As the Chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, Science and Technology, I am proud to support a budget that properly invests in our homeland security. Unlike the President's budget, this resolution provides robust funding for programs important to State and local law enforcement in Rhode Island, including the State Homeland Security Grant Program, which awarded $34.8 million to Rhode Island from 2004 to 2007, and the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program, LETPP, from which Rhode Island received $11.5 million from 2004 to 2006. By passing the Democratic budget, we can give local law enforcement officials in Rhode Island the tools they need to continue to keep our citizens safe. 
   The Democratic budget resolution also makes America safer by investing in our Nation's transportation systems, including highways and waterways, providing sufficient funding as well as a reserve fund to facilitate new infrastructure initiatives. This budget also meets the President's funding level for the Department of Defense, but shifts resources to high priorities such as nuclear nonproliferation programs, which was a recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. Finally, this resolution responds to the current hardships faced by our servicemembers by funding quality of life improvements for the troops as well as their families. 
   In this time of uncertainty, the American people are relying on us as decisionmakers to put forth a plan that will restore our economic prosperity, strengthen our national security, provide relief where it is needed, and promote fiscal discipline. Today, I am pleased to rise in support of a Democratic proposal that will accomplish each one of these goals. This budget resolution represents a new roadmap toward achieving the true priorities of Americans, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting yes on this measure.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2419, FOOD, CONSERVATION, AND ENERGY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2419, the Farm, Nutrition, and Bioenergy Act of 2007, better known as the Farm Bill. This measure, which reauthorizes federal agriculture and nutrition programs for five years, reflects Rhode Island's priorities: protecting our farmers and surrounding environment and caring for the most vulnerable members of our society. 
   There has been much discussion about reforming the Farm Bill, particularly with regard to how payments are structured to producers of certain commodities like cotton, rice and sugar. H.R. 2419 begins this process by lowering the annual adjusted gross income of farmers eligible for subsidies from $2.5 million to $750,000 and also excludes farmers making more than $500,000 from non-farm income. This structure will prevent millionaires from receiving farm subsidy benefits, and will also make payments transparent. While I believe we should go further with reform, I look forward to building on this restructuring in future legislation. 
   This legislation increases funding by nearly $8 billion for the conservation title, which includes programs important to Rhode Island, such as the Environmental Quality Incentive Program, the Farm and Ranchland Protection Program, and the Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program. I am also pleased that H.R. 2419 includes funding for specialty crops, which will benefit our fruit, vegetable and nursery crop farmers. These farmers, who make up a large percentage of Rhode Island's farming landscape, will now receive equal assistance and access to conservation programs. 
   H.R. 2419 includes over $10 billion in increased funding for the nutrition title, which includes food stamps and other programs aimed to combat hunger and improve nutrition for children, the elderly and low-income Americans. Unfortunately, these members of our society face a stigma when they realize they must turn to the government for assistance, and this Farm Bill works to end that by renaming the Food Stamp Program as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and replacing food stamp coupons with Electronic Benefit Transfer cards. This bill also reauthorizes programs such as the Community Food Projects program, which awards grants to non-profit groups that establish community food projects targeted to low-income individuals, and the Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program, which provides vouchers for low-income seniors to purchase fruits and vegetables at farmers' markets. 
   This measure also increases funding for school nutrition programs, including the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, which will help purchase fruits, vegetables and nuts, and create more avenues for produce to flow from local farmers to schools. This is especially important in Rhode Island, where state lawmakers and local organizations have already taken the initiative in improving the eating habits of our students. In 2007, 26 of 38 RI school districts participated in the Farm to School Program, where produce is purchased from local farms. This Farm Bill will help those school districts continue in a healthy direction. 
   H.R. 2419 also helps northeast dairy farmers, including those in Rhode Island, by extending the Milk Income Loss Contract Program, which compensates dairy producers when domestic milk prices fall below a certain level. Further, this measure encourages the expansion of renewable energy research and production, contains a new section for horticulture and organic agriculture, and includes funding to make sure our food supply is safe and stable. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is not a perfect bill; however, this Farm Bill helps farmers meet growing environmental challenges, gives consumers more healthy food choices, and promotes critical renewable energy development. It was also imperative that the Farm Bill take into consideration the country's current economic state. This bill will help stock food banks across our country by increasing funding to the Emergency Food Assistance Program by $1.26 billion. I look forward to passing this measure into law.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (NUCLEAR FORENSICS AND ATTRIBUTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Nuclear Forensics and Attribution Act, H.R. 2631, introduced by my friend and colleague, Congressman ADAM SCHIFF. Through my work on both the Homeland Security Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, I have become convinced that the nuclear terrorist threat is real requiring the full and urgent attention of our government. 
   Now, last weekend, we received a stark reminder of just how real this threat is. According to media reports, A.Q. Khan's network provided nations, possibly Iran and North Korea, with blueprints for a sophisticated nuclear device small enough to fit on a ballistic missile. 
   Now, I take this threat very seriously, and as chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity and Science and Technology, I focus much of my attention on addressing our nuclear vulnerability. And I have always said that the core of our efforts must focus on a three-prong strategy: an approach of prevention, detection, and response. 
   Now, by strengthening our detection capabilities, we've certainly made it more difficult for those who wish us harm to smuggle in nuclear weapons or weapons of nuclear material across our border. In fact, we are currently screening 100 percent of all incoming cargo on the southern border, 98 percent on the Nation's seaports, and 91 percent on the northern border. And Director Vayl Oxford of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office assures me we will be screening 100 percent along our northern border by next year. 
   Now, I firmly believe that the surest way to prevent a nuclear terrorist attack from occurring is to prevent terrorists from obtaining nuclear weapons  or weapons-grade nuclear material in the first place, but all those who have these materials should be also put on notice that all nuclear material contains a unique signature that could be traced back to them. 
   Now, the Nuclear Forensics and Attribution Act is a critical mechanism for enhancing this capability. Nuclear forensics allows experts to study the mix of isotopes and other features of nuclear material that give it a particular signature, or fingerprint. Once a nuclear signature has been promptly identified, we can oftentimes trace the material back to a particular source. Now, this is perhaps one of the best proactive measures we can take to deter terrorists from acquiring and detonating a nuclear weapon. It's also a wake-up call for all nations that already have nuclear weapons or weapons-grade nuclear material to better secure it. 
   If nations around the world know they can be identified as the source of material used in a nuclear attack, they may think twice about proliferating knowing that they would be the target of any retaliatory efforts. 
   In short, Madam Speaker, when people think of tracing where a nuclear attack would come from, they think of the missile being launched from a particular location and then detonated at a target, and they would obviously know and would be able to trace that missile back to where it was originally launched from. And if anybody were to smuggle a nuclear device into the country and detonate it, they would get off scot-free. Well, nuclear forensics clearly shows that is not the case. 
   Any time that a nuclear weapon would be detonated or weapons-grade nuclear material would be used, it does come with a return address, and we would be able to trace it back. 
   I'm proud to be a cosponsor of this measure, and I'm also pleased that we're taking yet another step to protect Americans against a nuclear threat. 
   Again, I would like to thank Congressman Schiff for his leadership on this issue. I would like to thank my Ranking Member Mr. McCaul on the subcommittee for helping to bring this to the floor. And most especially I want to thank the chairman of the full Committee on Homeland Security, Chairman Thompson, for his leadership on securing the Nation against potential nuclear threats and for all of his great leadership on homeland security issues and for bringing this issue to the floor today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in reluctant opposition to the supplemental spending measure before us. Though I originally voted against giving the President authority to invade Iraq in October 2002, I supported every supplemental appropriations bill since then because I believed that, irrespective of how we might feel about our operations in Iraq, we must stand together in support of our troops in the field. Those spending bills provided much-needed body armor, up-armored Humvees and lED jammers and helped our men and women and uniform as they undertook challenging and often unconventional missions. 
   However, in the last 4 years, the situation on the ground in Iraq has changed, and we must adapt our strategy accordingly. We can no longer allow our military to referee what has become a civil war. The underlying causes of violence are now primarily sectarian in nature and can only be resolved by the Iraqis--a conclusion that nearly all foreign security experts accept. Consequently, we need a new approach that will support the Iraqi political process to end sectarian divisions in Iraq, help rebuild the economy and infrastructure, and promote maximum diplomatic efforts to bring an end to the violence. We can meet these goals by redeploying our troops out of Iraq--allowing a limited U.S. military presence solely for training Iraqi Security Forces, protecting our citizens and interests and hunting down al Qaeda and combating terrorism. 
   Earlier this year, the Democratic-led Congress passed a supplemental spending bill that would have demanded accountability of the Bush Administration and set the groundwork for bringing our troops home. Despite Americans' strong dissatisfaction with his handling of the war, President Bush vetoed that measure. I am deeply disappointed with that decision and with his subsequent unwillingness to work with congressional leadership on a true compromise that funds the needs of our troops while pursuing a new strategy for success in Iraq. The bill before us today does require that the President certify that Iraq is making progress in attaining certain benchmarks--a provision that will help Congress conduct greater oversight. However, it falls short of the accountability requirements in the earlier House-passed measure and gives the President far too much authority to continue prosecuting a war that has been mismanaged from the start by the civilian leadership. Despite my past support of supplemental spending bills, I simply cannot vote for the measure before us today. If we do not shift our mission in Iraq from a military approach to a comprehensive diplomatic and economic one, we run the serious risk of damaging the readiness of our military, doing long-term harm to our armed forces and endangering our national security. I will vote today to support our troops, and the best way we can do that is by getting them out of a civil war and bringing them home.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6331, the Medicare Improvement for Patients and Providers Act of 2008. I am pleased that the House of Representatives is taking action to address some immediate concerns within the Medicare program. This matter has regrettably become stalled in the Senate, and passage of this bill will affirm our commitment to ensuring continued access to care for America's Medicare beneficiaries. 
   This measure includes a number of important provisions, including increased access to low income assistance, additional supports for rural providers and beneficiaries, and an extension of access to therapy services through 2009. Additionally, this bill delays the impending 10.6 percent cut in Medicare physician reimbursements scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2008. Instead, it freezes payments for the remainder of 2008 and provides a modest 1.1 percent increase in 2009. This legislative fix, although temporary, will help ensure that access to care is not compromised and physicians can continue serving our most vulnerable populations. It is my hope that Congress will use these next 18 months as an opportunity to find a permanent and sustainable solution for the flawed reimbursement formula so that it more accurately represents the costs of providing care in the current market. 
   Also included in this bill is a provision to delay Medicare's competitive bidding program for durable medical equipment. Although competitive bidding was instituted to reduce spending within the already overburdened Medicare system, serious concerns have been raised over the implementation and potential consequences of this program. H.R. 6331 halts the implementation of the competitive bidding program for one year, while making necessary improvements to the bidding process and establishing quality standards for suppliers. This will constitute an important step towards a more efficient system that maintains the quality and access that beneficiaries deserve. 
   Americans everywhere are counting on this Congress to take action before July 1, to ensure that access to Medicare services is not jeopardized. I urge my colleagues to support this bill so that lawmakers can begin to discuss long-term, viable solutions to reform and stabilize the Medicare program.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (ESTABLISHING A QUADRENNIAL NATIONAL SECURITY REVIEW -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to introduce legislation this evening requiring the establishment of a Quadrennial National Security Review. I am joined in this effort by my friend and colleague on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry) who has been an advocate for enhanced interagency cooperation and improved strategic planning on national security issues. His input and support on this bill have been invaluable. 
   This measure has the support of Armed Services Committee Chairman Skelton, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Lantos, and Homeland Security Committee Chairman Thompson, as well as numerous other Members with strong national security credentials. 
   Currently, the United States establishes its national security goals in the National Security Strategy, required by law to be submitted annually to Congress. However, only two versions have been published in the last 6 years and those documents provide little insight into how we can harness all assets of national power to achieve our national security goals. 
   Many experts in the field of national security, including members of the 9/11 Commission, have emphasized the importance of using all of our Nation's capabilities and levers of influence to advance our national security goals. 
   Dr. Joe Nye, the former dean of the Kennedy School of Government and former Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, has written extensively about the need to supplement our military might with ``soft power,'' efforts to win the world's hearts and minds with our values and culture. 
   Successfully exercising this type of power requires that we pursue many fronts, including international diplomacy, democracy building, cultural exchanges, economic development, educational initiatives, and communication about our values and ideals. 
   Even though our Nation has many assets and capabilities to advance our national security goals, we have done a poor job of integrating them all. From my experience on the House Intelligence Committee, as well as the Homeland Security and Armed Services Committees, I am deeply concerned about the tendency of agencies with national security responsibilities to focus exclusively on their own programs' initiatives, while losing sight of the larger strategic goals, an unfortunate phenomenon that leads to stovepiping when information and intelligence are not shared among Departments and agencies. 
   Madam Speaker, we must ensure that all components of our Federal Government are working together toward the same purpose and that they are able to coordinate their efforts to the greatest extent possible. 
   In its ``Beyond Goldwater-Nichols'' study, the Center for Strategic and International Studies recommended the establishment of a Quadrennial National Security Review to create an interagency process that would identify national security goals, assess existing needs and capabilities, establish priorities for funding, and recommend specific policy and budget proposals. 
   From that recommendation, I have worked with other experts, Members of Congress, and committee staff to draft the legislation that we are introducing today. This bill would create a Quadrennial National Security Review, a process to coordinate all assets of national power and identify and achieve our national security objectives. 
   Under the measure, every 4 years the President would conduct a review of the national security goals of the United States in consultation with all relevant national security related Departments and agencies, as well as Congress. The process would include a thorough investigation of America's national security interests and objectives, the strategy for implementing security goals, risk assessments, identification of all assets of national power needed to meet security goals, an explanation of how agencies would coordinate their efforts, and an assessment of what additional resources are needed. The effort would culminate in a comprehensive national security strategy document, policy recommendations, and a unified security budget proposal that reflects national security priorities.  
   Finally, after publication of the QNSR, an outside panel of the national security experts would conduct independent review and perform their own analysis, reporting their findings to Congress and the administration within 2 years. 
   I am hopeful that the establishment of a QNSR and an independent review process will lead to greater coordination and cooperation and facilitate strategic budget and resource decision-making. 
   In closing, I would like to thank the many Members, staff and national security experts who have provided feedback and guidance in the crafting of this bill. It is not an easy task to move our entire national security decision-making structure forward from the status quo, but I know many people in this body recognize the importance of doing so, and I am optimistic that we are moving in the right direction. I urge my colleagues to join me in this vital effort.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (HOMELAND SECURITY NETWORK DEFENSE AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Homeland Security Network Defense and Accountability Act of 2008, H.R. 5983. The United States and its allies face a significant and growing threat to our information technology, IT, systems and assets, and to the integrity of our information. The acquisition of this information by outsiders threatens to undermine and over time could cost the United States our advantage over our adversaries. This is a critical national security issue that we can no longer ignore. 
   As chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity and Science and Technology, I have prioritized this issue in the 110th Congress. I have held seven hearings on cybersecurity issues, heard from hundreds of experts on how best to tackle these problems, reviewed information security best practices in the public and private sectors, investigated cyber incidents across the spectrum--from the State and Commerce Departments to our nation's electric grid--and uncovered and assisted law enforcement in investigating breaches at the Department of Homeland Security. It has become clear that an organization is only as strong as the integrity and reliability of the information that it keeps. 
   The legislation we're considering today represents a critical step toward improving the cybersecurity posture at the Department of Homeland Security by addressing two key issues: ensuring a robust defense-in-depth of our information systems, and holding individuals at all levels accountable for mitigating vulnerabilities. 
   This measure is composed of several important provisions. First, it establishes authorities and qualifications for the Chief Information Officer, CIO, position at the Department. In a number of hearings, I have heard concerns that the lack of an information security background can hamper the CIO's understanding and efforts to secure the Department's networks. We cannot allow future Presidents to repeat the mistakes made by this Administration in appointing unqualified individuals to this important office. 
   Second, the bill establishes specific operational security practices for the CIO, including a continuous, real-time cyber incident response capability, a network architecture emphasizing the positioning of security controls, and vulnerability assessments for each external-facing information infrastructure. These are fundamental elements of a comprehensive information security program. 
   Third, the bill establishes testing protocols to reduce the number of vulnerability exploitations throughout the Department's networks. Time and again we have heard that the Federal Information Security Management Act--or FISMA--does not operationalize security, and does not effectively reduce the number of successful attacks. We must change this, and we can do so by bringing together the heads of appropriate federal agencies to mitigate known attacks against our governmental infrastructure. 
   The fourth major provision of the bill requires the DHS Secretary to determine if the internal security policy of a contractor who provides network services to the Department is consistent with the Department's requirements. Again, this is standard operating procedure for all private sector companies; it should be so for the Federal Government as well. 
   Finally, this bill seeks a formal report from the Secretary on meeting the deadlines established by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB, for Trusted Internet Connections, TIC, encryption and authentication mandates. These are critical for the Department's efforts in information security, and I am not confident that the proper deadlines are being met. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support the Homeland Security Network Defense and Accountability Act of 2008 and thank Chairman Thompson for his leadership in bringing this important measure to the floor.

Despite the claims of those who support the Administration, this measure does nothing to protect those overseas who intend to do us harm. Instead, it is an important and vital effort to clarify the role of the FISA Court in light of advances in communications technology. As every member of the intelligence committee knows, the FISA Court already supervises aspects of foreign intelligence collection. The bill keeps the FISA Court engaged at the programmatic level, while ensuring that the Administration does not need individual warrants for foreign targets. 
   The administration's proposal would cut the court out of the process and let the Attorney General decide when American's liberties are infringed. Our legislation establishes meaningful, independent judicial oversight by the FISA Court. It protects America without sacrificing our civil liberties. 
   Our legislation is the responsible course, and I urge a YES vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (STREAMLINING OF SAFETY ACT AND ANTI-TERRORISM TECHNOLOGY PROCUREMENT PROCESSES -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Today, Madam Speaker, I rise in support of legislation I introduced, the SAFETY Reform Act of 2007, which will help ensure that safe and effective antiterrorism technologies are being deployed by the Department of Homeland Security to bolster our security throughout the country.     
   The Support for Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002, or SAFETY Act as it is known, was designed to provide incentives for development and deployment of antiterrorism technologies. 
   The SAFETY Act was intended to address the liability concerns of businesses and to pave the way for innovative development of key antiterrorism technologies. Unfortunately, a lack of personnel within the Office of SAFETY Act Implementation, an excessively burdensome application process, and a lack of communication between the Department's procurement and management divisions made for difficult implementation of the SAFETY Act. 
   This legislation which I have introduced, along with Chairman Thompson, Subcommittee Ranking Member Rogers and many other members of the Homeland Security Committee, should fix many of those shortcomings. 
   Last year the Homeland Security Committee held a subcommittee hearing highlighting some of the problems that arose from the SAFETY Act's implementation. We heard from a variety of industry leaders and experts that the application process was overly burdensome, and that it took far too long for the Department of Homeland Security to properly evaluate and approve many of the applications that businesses submitted.  
   While I am pleased to see that many companies with new and innovative technologies have already applied for the SAFETY Act program, the program can be effective only when the applications are properly approved. 
   My legislation, therefore, takes three important steps to improve the effectiveness of the application process. First, this bill will help facilitate communication between the Department of Homeland Security's procurement sector and the Department's Office of SAFETY Act Implementation, which is the entity tasked with reviewing the applications. This approach will allow officials at DHS to thoroughly review applications while also maintaining quick turnaround times. 
   Second, the bill would require that the Secretary employ a sufficient number of analysts in the Office of SAFETY Act Implementation who can deal with the ever-growing number of applications. Appropriate staffing will help ensure that the applications are being processed in a timely manner, thereby allowing us to deploy the newest and best technologies as quickly as possible. 
   Finally, this legislation will help raise awareness of SAFETY Act risk management provisions among procurement officers across Federal, State, and local levels, and throughout the private sector. 
   Contributions made by private enterprises are an extremely important component of our Nation's security, and our governmental policies should continue to encourage innovation, not stifle it. 
   By passing the SAFETY Reform Act, I am optimistic that we will be able to effectively streamline the application process and encourage participation in this program across all levels of government and the private sector. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the SAFETY Reform Act of 2007. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Our Nation is at war, and homeland security must be our top priority. The quicker that we can get these new and vital technologies in place that will better protect the American people, the better off we will all be. 
   So it is my intent that this act will clarify some of the problems with the original SAFETY Act and with the implementation that has been witnessed by the Department of Homeland Security, and I am pleased that we have brought this act to the floor today.

   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5959, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009. 
   While the bill contains a number of important provisions to strengthen our intelligence community and enhance national security that many of my colleagues have already been speaking about, I am particularly pleased that it represents a reasonable and measured response to the administration's cybersecurity initiative. 
   Now, this bill, the cybersecurity initiative, is the administration's response to the cybersecurity threats facing the Nation. And although the administration has been slow in recognizing this threat, I believe the cyber initiative is a move in the right direction, but requires careful scrutiny. 
   Now, this bill reduces funding in selected areas where it is not adequately justified. However, recognizing that cybersecurity is a real and growing threat that the Federal Government has been slow in addressing, the Intelligence Committee has authorized more than 90 percent of the administration's requests. 
   At the same time, the bill clearly demonstrates that the committee does not intend to write the administration a blank check for the cybersecurity initiative, which is a multi-year, multi-billion dollar project. 
   Now, we need a thorough assessment of the technical feasibility and scalability of the initiative and a careful balance between cybersecurity and privacy protections. Thus, the bill envisions an advisory panel of senior representatives of Congress, the Executive Branch and industry who can tackle these issues. 
   I was co-chair of the CSIS Commission on Cybersecurity for the 44th Presidency, basically a commission that will present a blueprint on cybersecurity for the next President. I have been deeply involved in developing recommendations for a national cybersecurity plan that protects, among other things, our critical infrastructure assets and infrastructure itself, as well as Federal networks and also the private sector. 
   Furthermore, as a member of the House Intelligence Committee, and as chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity and Science Technology, I will continue to ensure and exercise rigorous congressional oversight over this issue as it evolves. 
   The measure before us is an important first step in addressing our cybersecurity threats and closing that vulnerability and it is, obviously, a critical national security issue. And I urge my colleagues to support passage of this bill. 
   Again, I commend Chairman Reyes for his leadership, and also thank staff for the great work they have done on this bill today.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (PROVIDING FOR REDEPLOYMENT OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES AND DEFENSE CONTRACTORS FROM IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - May 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I commend the gentleman from Massachusetts for offering this important piece of legislation.     
   I voted against the war in Iraq, but I have since voted to give our troops the resources to succeed in their mission. They have done exceptional work. But they are now being asked to take sides in a civil war. This is not what we sent them to do, and it is time to bring our troops home. 
   Let us be clear. Removing our troops from the midst of a civil war does not mean we are abandoning Iraq. We will continue to train Iraqi security forces, support political reconciliation and economic reconstruction, and engage the international community to promote a lasting peace. Most importantly, we will continue to hunt down al Qaeda wherever they may hide. What we will not do is blindly follow the President's failed strategy, which has damaged our military without improving national security. 
   The situation on the ground has changed, and our plan should too. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to demand a new direction and end the conflict in Iraq and bring our troops home. 
   I thank the gentleman for offering this important piece of legislation.  
   Mr. Speaker, this measure will allow us to begin redeploying our combat forces in Iraq and pursuing a new strategy for success. I voted against giving the President authority to go to war, but I have since voted to give our troops the resources to succeed in their mission. They have done exceptional work, but they are now being asked to take sides in a civil war--resolving conflicts that stretch back for centuries. That is not what we sent them to do, and it is time to bring them home. 
   Let us be very clear about what this bill does, because there is a lot of rhetoric clouding this debate. Removing our troops from the middle of a civil war does NOT mean we're abandoning Iraq. We will continue to train the Iraqi Security Forces. We will continue to support political reconciliation and economic reconstruction. We will continue to engage the international community to promote a lasting peace. Most importantly, we will continue to hunt down al Qaeda wherever in the world they may try to hide. What we will not do is blindly follow the President's failed strategy--a strategy that has damaged the readiness of our military without improving our national security. The situation on the ground has changed, and our plan should be adjusted accordingly. Sadly, the President has decided to trust his own judgment over that of our military commanders, millions of Iraqis, and, most importantly, the American people. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to demand a new direction that strengthens our military and ends the conflict in Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY 2008. I particularly want to commend Chairman Reyes for his outstanding leadership, vision and work on this bill and getting us to where we are today. Equally important, I want to recognize the staff for their hard work as well. 
   Madam Chair, I have always believed that good intelligence is the pointy tip of the spear. This bill provides intelligence support for troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and strengthens information-sharing among Federal, State and local agencies. Most importantly, it enhances the full range of intelligence collection capabilities, tactical and strategic, near term and long term. 
   The United States relies heavily on satellites to gather intelligence. Our intelligence agencies, working with industry, have developed extraordinary capabilities that build upon proven technologies. And to ensure that we maintain our technological edge, this bill refocuses the Intelligence Community on evolving satellite technology while ensuring that our industrial base also remains strong. 
   And because nothing beats having eyes on the ground, this bill strengthens human intelligence collection capabilities by adding funds to both CIA and military collectors to receive training and operational skills in critical foreign languages while providing advanced technological tools that support intelligence collection. 
   This measure further strengthens intelligence analysis by investing in the people of the Intelligence Community. By establishing challenging career paths for intelligence professionals at FBI and DHS, it rewards good work and encourages America's best and brightest to serve. Many of these Americans, because of their personal backgrounds, possess a wealth of expertise on foreign cultures, societies and languages. But for the Intelligence Community to harness their potential, its staff must reflect the myriad experiences, talents and perspectives of the American people. 
   This bill takes important steps to enhance diversity in the Intelligence Community. For example, it requires the DNI to implement a multi-level security clearance system to ensure that Americans who are ineligible for the highest clearances because they have  relatives overseas and cannot be investigated, for instance, can still offer expertise in their roles. 
   It is a good bill, and I urge its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7321, the Auto Industry Financing and Restructuring Act. It is clear that the auto industry itself carries a great deal of responsibility for the crisis it faces today, due to an inability or unwillingness to take the steps necessary to compete in a 21st century market. Nonetheless, I recognize the urgency of extending federal loans to Detroit's automakers, as their collapse could trigger massive job losses and ripple effects throughout a wide range of industries. One in ten American jobs is linked to the domestic auto industry, and it is estimated that as many as 10,000 jobs could be affected by its failure in my home state of Rhode Island. 
   To win my support, it was imperative that this bill place strict conditions and requirements on the automakers receiving assistance, and I believe it meets that test. These companies will have to submit a final and acceptable long-term restructuring plan by March 31, 2009, and if adequate progress has not been made by February 15th, 2009 on efforts to stabilize the auto industry, the companies will be forced to repay their loan. Their restructuring plans must show how the companies will achieve long-term viability, international competitiveness and energy efficiency. Furthermore, upon enactment of this bill, the administration must immediately appoint a ``car czar'' to monitor the progress of these plans. This designee will also have veto power over company expenditures of more than $100 million. H.R. 7321 also demands accountability to taxpayers by banning golden parachutes to company executives, bonuses for the 25 most highly paid employees, and corporate jets. Finally, a company may not pay dividends to shareholders over the duration of the loan. 
   Mr. Speaker, our domestic car manufacturers have made some unwise business decisions in the past. However, the fall of the U.S. auto industry would be a devastating blow to our already fragile economy, impacting millions of workers and countless businesses, large and small. Today, we have the opportunity to give these companies a chance for survival and to point them in the right direction for our future needs as a country, which includes a strong manufacturing base for fuel-efficient vehicles. I encourage my colleagues to vote for H.R. 7321 and in support of the future of our country's auto industry.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (TEMPORARY TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for the Temporary Tax Relief Act, H.R. 3996. This comprehensive legislation will provide fiscally responsible tax relief for hard-working, middle-class Americans, help stimulate our Nation's small businesses and provide financial support to public servants nationwide. 
   The Temporary Tax Relief Act represents a new direction in tax policy that will offer assistance to thousands of Rhode Island middle-class families. I am particularly pleased that this legislation includes a 1-year patch to keep millions of hard-working, middle-class Americans outside the ever-widening net of the alternative minimum tax, AMT. Congress first enacted the AMT in 1969 to ensure that 155 wealthy taxpayers paid their fair share of the Federal income tax, but because they neglected to index the tax for inflation, it has since become outdated and unfair. If left unfixed, this year over 23 million Americans--and 75,000 Rhode Islanders--will be forced to pay nearly $2,000 in additional taxes. 
   The bill before us will also expand the refundable child tax credit by reducing the minimum income eligibility level from $11,000 to $8,500, thereby allowing more Rhode Island families to take advantage of this important credit. In addition, this legislation will help stem the rising cost of higher education by extending the above-the-line tax deduction for qualified education expenses up to $4,000. H.R. 3996 also provides much-needed tax relief to homeowners who do not itemize their deductions by permitting married couples to deduct up to $500, and single taxpayers to deduct up to $250, in property taxes, in addition to their standard deductions. 
   It's not just middle-class taxpayers who will reap the benefits of this bill. The Temporary Tax Relief Act contains a number of provisions that will help stimulate our Nation's small businesses, including a 1-year extension of the Research and Development, R&D, tax credit, which will keep American companies competitive and spur businesses to invest in the future and create jobs. Also included is a provision that will grant small businesses a tax incentive for committing to invest in local community development. 
   Finally, H.R. 3996 directs well-deserved financial assistance to our Nation's public servants. Under this legislation, more than 3 million teachers will be able to deduct out-of-pocket expenses, including books and other school supplies, for their classrooms. 
   I am also proud to support a provision to provide tax relief for thousands of American troops in combat under the Earned Income Tax Credit. 
   Perhaps most importantly, this measure is fully paid for and will not add a penny to our national debt. We made a commitment to the American people to abide by pay-as-you-go rules so that our children and grandchildren will not bear the cost of the decisions we make. Today we reaffirm our commitment to fiscal responsibility, while maintaining our promise to helping middle-class families and small businesses nationwide. I would like to thank Chairman RANGEL for his leadership in crafting a balanced, responsible and urgently needed bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. Though not a perfect piece of legislation, it is clearly far better than what we have today, and addresses a number of the many concerns that were raised about the administration's conduct of surveillance in this country. 
   As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I know that we must give our Intelligence Community the proper tools to protect us, while upholding the civil liberties of Americans. Today's compromise illustrates what this House can do when it deliberates with care, holds steady against fear mongering and acts in the best interests of the country and its citizens. 
   This bill is strong on civil liberties, and includes protections against infringement of our constitutional right to privacy. 
   First, the bill clarifies that FISA is the exclusive means by which the executive branch may conduct electronic surveillance on U.S. soil. No President will have the power to do an end-run around the legal requirements of FISA. This provision will prevent the types of abuses we've witnessed under this administration. 
   Second, this act requires a warrant from the FISA court to conduct surveillance of Americans abroad. Americans will no longer leave their constitutional protections at home when working, studying or traveling abroad. 
   Third, it requires prior approval by the FISA court of procedures the government will use when carrying out foreign electronic surveillance. This will ensure that the government's efforts are not aimed at targeting Americans, the so-called reverse targeting that we're all concerned about; and that if an American's communications is inadvertently intercepted, it is dealt with in a manner that guarantees legal protections. 
   It also requires and allows for, now, an IG investigation of this warrantless surveillance program that took place prior to Congress being made aware of this legislation.

This will ensure that the Government's efforts are not aimed at targeting Americans, and that, if an American's communication is inadvertently intercepted, it is dealt with in a manner that guarantees legal protections. 
   One issue that has been repeatedly addressed is whether telecommunications companies should be granted immunity against pending lawsuits for their involvement in the earlier surveillance program. For a long period of time, the Bush Administration stonewalled and did not provide Congress the documents we demanded to ascertain the role that the telecommunications companies played. Since then, I have reviewed a large number of classified documents on this matter, and I am deeply concerned about the manner in which the Bush administration conducted its surveillance program. Therefore, I am pleased that this legislation preserves a role for the U.S. court system, which will review the documents produced by the White House and other relevant documents to decide independently whether the telecommunications companies acted in good faith when cooperating with the Government. Only after that review would the courts decide whether the telecommunications companies deserve any form of liability protection. Furthermore, the legislation authorizes a joint investigation by the Inspectors General from the U.S. Department of Justice, National Security Agency, Department of Defense, and Office of the Director of National Intelligence to review the past actions of the U.S. Government and report to Congress on their findings so that we may take appropriate action. 
   Many today have said that the legislation before us is not a perfect bill, and I agree. Nevertheless, it is significantly better than the bill passed by the Senate and an immense improvement over the Bush administration's program, neither of which took sufficient steps to protect Americans' civil liberties. I know that the Democratic leadership negotiated a good compromise, and I will support it. However, as I have said before, this legislation will only work if everyone involved follows the rules and remains within the confines of the law. Congress must continue to conduct robust oversight to make sure the law is implemented as intended to maintain the critical and fragile balance of protecting our Nation and protecting civil liberties.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the rule and the Democratic budget for fiscal year 2008. This measure provides robust funding for our most important programs, while maintaining our firm commitment to fiscal discipline. 
   Last year, Democrats promised to move the country in a new direction, and that is exactly what this budget does. This budget restores many programs the President proposed to cut, while achieving balance by 2012. 
   It meets our commitments to defense and homeland security by implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations and funding port security and first responders. It also recognizes those who have served our country with significant increases for veterans health care. 
   The resolution meets our domestic priorities by blocking proposed cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, while providing funding to cover millions of children without health insurance, something particularly important to my constituents in Rhode Island. 
   It boosts funds for education programs such as Pell Grants and promotes investment in programs that helps us move closer to energy independence and improve our environment. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the Democratic budget so that we can meet the needs of all Americans and restore fiscal responsibility through this process.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of SCHIP and the millions of children from poor families who would be covered by this bill. It is critical that we take action immediately to save this important program. I wholeheartedly supported earlier versions of the SCHIP reauthorization, which would have enhanced and preserved a successful program that has made health insurance a reality for over 6 million children from low-income families. 
   I was tremendously disappointed that the President did not agree that strengthening SCHIP was a national priority. I could not disagree more with him. 
   But in response to his opposition, the House leadership has put forth the compromise version of this bill, one that addresses lingering concerns while retaining the core principles of this important program. This bill will protect the existing coverage for children and ensure that the lowest income children who are currently eligible but not enrolled would gain coverage, an additional 4 million children on top of the 6 million who are already covered. 
   It is the right thing to do. It is the moral and compassionate thing to do, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this rule and the accompanying legislation.

   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act. 
   In 4 years Congress has not been able to successfully pass an authorization measure into law. That all changes today, and I want to commend the chairman and the ranking member for their leadership in bringing the bill to the floor today. 
   Today, the Democratic majority is changing paths by making homeland security and appropriate oversight a priority for Congress, and under the leadership of Chairman Thompson, we will pass the bill this year. This bill provides us that opportunity while authorizing an additional $2.1 billion for the Department. This is truly an historic moment. While I applaud many provisions of this bill, I particularly would like to focus on a few key elements that will significantly improve America's security. 
   As chairman of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, and Science and Technology, I am particularly pleased that this bill incorporates legislation I introduced to improve the material threat assessment process under Project BioShield. This language requires the Secretary to effectively group similar threats together in order to move towards a ``one drug, many bugs'' approach to biosecurity that will allow us to combat multiple threats simultaneously. 
   H.R. 1684 also establishes a National Biosurveillance Integration Center based on a measure that I introduced. Biointelligence and biosurveillance provide the early warning systems necessary to detect the spread of disease, whether natural or intentional. This center will integrate data from biosurveillance systems with other intelligence to provide a comprehensive and timely picture of existing biological threats. 
   Lastly, this bill recognizes the importance of investing more in cybersecurity, a critical need at this juncture. We authorize an additional $50 million for cybersecurity research and development activities at DHS, critical resources to address one of our most pressing and underfunded needs. We cannot overestimate the importance of biosecurity. 
   Again, I want to stress the importance of cybersecurity, and we need to do more in this area. And I look forward to working with the chairman on this and other priorities. 
   I want to thank Chairman Thompson for including these and many other critical provisions. I am proud that we are well on our way to seeing the first ever DHS authorization bill signed into law. And I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure. 
   Thank you, Chairman Thompson, for your leadership.

   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am certainly grateful for the opportunity to offer this amendment, which would simply direct officials at the Department of Homeland Security to work with the National Organization on Disability on their Emergency Preparedness Initiative. 
   We all know that people with disabilities face unique challenges in their daily lives. They range from mobility  impairment to communications barriers, and they can become substantial obstacles in an emergency. 
   As we take steps to make our Nation a safer place, it is critical to keep in mind that if we neglect issues of accessibility and inclusion in our planning, the problems that surface later will be more complicated, more expensive and, in some cases, could cost people their lives. 
   After September 11, the National Organization on Disability, or NOD, as it is known, showed tremendous leadership by launching the Emergency Preparedness Initiative, or EPI, to ensure that emergency managers address disability concerns and that people with disabilities are included at all levels of emergency preparedness, planning, response and recovery. Indeed, this time of planning serves all those with special needs, not just individuals with disabilities but also the elderly and other vulnerable populations. 
   Now, with support from Congress and many in the disability community, EPI has become firmly established within the emergency management industry and among disability advocate organizations. 
   In my capacity as cochair of the Bipartisan Disabilities Caucus, I have worked closely with representatives from EPI to highlight these issues here on Capitol Hill and throughout the Nation. The work they are doing is a critical component to our national security, and I am proud to support their efforts.     
   As we work to keep all Americans safe and secure, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

So many people who lost their lives, both on 9/11 and as a result of Hurricane Katrina, were people with disabilities in particular. The tragic loss of life across the board was incredibly sad. 
   We want to make sure where we can prevent loss of life we do so and made sure that those with special needs are not forgotten and their needs are a forethought rather than an afterthought. That is what EPI is all about. I commend them for their hard work in putting together their emergency preparedness plans and working with emergency management officials to include the needs of people with disabilities. I urge adoption of the amendment. 
   Having no further speakers, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act, which will reauthorize the Higher Education Act for 5 years. This is the first time in almost a decade that this bill has been reauthorized, and I am proud to be part of a Congress that has placed such a high priority on making college a reality for all of our nation's students. This bill builds on legislation that passed last year to help lower college costs and boost Federal loan support for our students. Especially with the state of our economy, it is imperative that we invest in our education system to promote new employment and ensure that today's students can adapt to the jobs of tomorrow. 
   Two of the main goals of the College Opportunity and Affordability Act are to make a college education accessible to all students and to lower college costs for those students and their families. I am pleased that this bill increases the maximum amount of Pell Grants, which help 5.5 million low-income and minority students attend college, from $5,800 to $9,000. This measure also boosts funding for the TRIO program and the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Program (GEAR UP), which provide college readiness and support for low-income and first-generation students. H.R. 4137 ensures equal college opportunities for students with disabilities by creating a national center to improve college recruitment, retention, and completion of students with disabilities, and would also expand eligibility for Pell Grants for students with intellectual disabilities. 
   H.R. 4137 also establishes a user-friendly website to provide students and families with helpful information about college pricing, and will streamline the cumbersome filing process for Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Families will now be able to receive estimates of their expected contribution and the amount of financial aid they may receive. H.R. 4137 requires higher education institutions and student loan providers to give borrowers fair and full information on their loan terms and repayment options, as well as promote financial literacy and education for students and families. This measure also helps  reduce the cost of textbooks, which on average sets back a student $1,000 per year, by making sure professors have full textbook pricing when making purchasing decisions and by ensuring students receive advanced lists of textbooks for their upcoming classes. 
   One of the goals of the 110th Congress is to create a new generation of innovators so that we continue to build an educated, skilled workforce in the vital areas of science, math, engineering and information technology. To maintain our international competitiveness and economic advantage in the coming years, our Nation must invest more in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education. That is why I am pleased that H.R. 4137 includes many new initiatives and increases funding for STEM education. These new programs include grants for colleges and universities to provide incentives for students in STEM majors to teach in these academic areas; the YES Partnership Grant Program, which provides funding to eligible colleges to support minority youth engagement in STEM fields through out-reach and hands-on experiential learning; and the ``Robert C. Byrd Mathematics and Science Honors Scholarship Program'' which focuses on encouraging students to earn degrees in math and science. 
   H.R. 4137 increases college aid and support for our veterans and military families by requiring colleges and universities to treat students returning from military service as continuously enrolled students and preventing active duty servicemembers from accruing interest on student loans for the duration of their activation. The measure also encourages those students who commit to a job in high-need areas and public service for at least 5 years by establishing a $10,000 loan forgiveness program for nurses, early childhood educators, foreign language specialists, child welfare workers, school counselors, public sector employees, medical specialists, and mental health professionals. This measure further addresses the shortage of nursing faculty by establishing competitive grants to fund scholarships for nurses studying for advanced degrees with the intention of becoming faculty. 
   In recent years, our country's college and university campuses have seen unnecessary tragedies. H.R 4137 will boost campus safety by helping all colleges develop and implement state of the art emergency systems and campus safety plans, and will also create a National Center for Campus Safety at the Department of Justice. Administrators and students on campuses across the country have also pushed for environmental, or ``green'', initiatives, and this measure supports these efforts by providing funding for environmental sustainability programs. 
   Mr. Chairman, H.R 4137 shows that Congress is committed to the success of our students, and we will work to make sure that they can pursue their dreams without the burdens of unnecessary costs and debt. While we may find ourselves facing hard economic decisions, we must empower the next generation with the necessary tools and invest in their education. The College Opportunity and Affordability Act will set a blueprint for the future, and I encourage all my colleagues to vote for this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, over the recess I had the opportunity to have several public hearings back home, and Iraq was one on everyone's mind. The overwhelming consensus was that we need a new strategy in Iraq, a view shared by national security experts and illustrated by continued violence in the region. Today, we can chart a new path so that we can finally bring our troops home. 
   Americans know the Bush strategy isn't working, and today's Iraq status report confirms the lack of progress. The Iraqi Government has failed to promote political reconciliation, and our military is paying the price. Our troops have done a superb job, but they were not sent to Iraq to referee a civil war. 
   Today's bill requires our military to start redeploying out of Iraq within 120 days, to be completed by April 1, 2008. We will not abandon Iraq, but we must implement a new strategy based on political, economic and diplomatic initiatives. 
   I want to thank Chairman Skelton for his leadership on this measure, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to thank the gentleman from Mississippi, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee for his outstanding leadership on this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, the 9/11 Commission provided an eye-opening assessment of how terrorists were able to exploit security vulnerabilities on September 11. It made 41 key recommendations to address these shortcomings. We promised the American people that the Commission's efforts would not be in vain, and today we made good on that promise. 
   Our threat environment presents unique challenges. While good intelligence will always be the pointy tip of the spear, it will always be critical to our anti-terror efforts. We know that it's not foolproof. 
   Among the many things that this conference report accomplishes, it fulfills a key commission recommendation by creating a stand-alone program for communications interoperability. It also requires 100 percent advance screening of maritime cargo, which will ensure a weapon of mass destruction never even has a chance of reaching American shores by being smuggled in a cargo container. 
   I am proud to have served as a conferee on this bill, and I believe we have an excellent final product before us today. 
   The best way to honor those who died on September 11 is to learn from the lessons of that tragic day and take action. This conference report represents a major step towards that goal of which the American people can be proud. 
   I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee for his great work on this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. LANGEVIN. (HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, right now there are thousands of families in my home State of Rhode Island and across America who are struggling to keep their homes due to the fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis. 
   I rise in strong support of the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act to lend a helping hand for those reeling from the mortgage crisis. Just as importantly, it will restore confidence in our largest mortgage backers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
   I am pleased that this package includes also a key House-passed measure from an overhaul of the Federal Housing Administration to an affordable housing trust fund to construct, rehabilitate, and preserve 1.5 million housing units. This will address an issue that's particularly acute in Rhode Island, where affordable housing is so scarce that someone needs to earn more than two or three times the minimum wage just to afford an average two-bedroom apartment. 
   H.R. 3221 will also create an independent agency to regulate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Bank System to help ensure that these critical institutions remain strong.

   Mr. LANGEVIN. I thank the gentleman for the unanimous consent request and for the granting of it. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3221 will also create an independent agency to regulate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Bank System to help ensure that these critical institutions remain strong, and it's about time. 
   Four years ago I shared Alan Greenspan's concerns that GSEs were involved in risky investments. At that time I said it appears as though the increased risk the GSEs have been taking on is not related to their primary operation of purchasing affordable housing loans in the secondary market. Rather, much of their risk comes from derivative investments in an effort to maximize profits for shareholders. As we learned from Enron, complex derivative schemes may boost profits in the short term, but their long-run risk can be too difficult to manage, and this is where we are today. I'm glad that we fixed this problem by passing this legislation. 
   I commend the gentleman from Massachusetts for his hard work on this bill. I'm also glad that the President has finally lifted his veto threat and will not stand in the way of assistance to local governments to purchase abandoned and foreclosed properties. 
   This legislation is an important commonsense response to the housing crises and will help stabilize families in our economy.  
   I thank Chairman Frank for his leadership and all of my colleagues for their support for this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LANGEVIN. I thank the gentlelad y for yielding for the purpose of engaging in a colloquy with Chairwoman Lowey and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar). 
   Madam Chairman, thank you for engaging in this discussion to clarify the language related to international family planning and abortion restrictions in the bill. I understand that you have included a provision in the underlying bill that makes certain exemptions for contraceptives from the Mexico City policy. 
   I further understand that the intent of this provision is to allow international nongovernmental organizations, otherwise known as NGOs, to receive U.S.-donated contraceptives for distribution to the poorest men and women in the poorest regions of the world. 
   As the chairwoman knows, I do not support providing direct funding to international NGOs that do not adhere to the Mexico City policy. I have concerns that the language, as it is currently drafted, could be interpreted more broadly than intended and could be construed to permit not only the provision of cont raceptives, but also the provision of funding directly to organizations that perform or advocate for abortions. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Texas.

   Mr. LANGEVIN. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am grateful to have this opportunity to rise in support of the Lowey amendment. 
   I share Chairwoman Lowey's concerns about the lack of access to contraceptives, the lifesaving tool for disease prevention in the developing word. 
   The World Health Organization estimates that 80 million women face unwanted pregnancies each year. More than 150 million couples have no access to family planning, and more than 75,000 women die each year due to complications related to unsafe abortion. These staggering statistics reflect the dire situation in countries such as Ghana, Ethiopia, Romania and many others as nations struggle to provide health care and basic services to their citizens. 
   It is a tragedy that 24.5 million people are living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 12 million children have been orphaned by AIDS. I know that I speak for the vast majority of Americans when I say that we have a responsibility to respond to this crisis. 
   Like so many of my colleagues, I am opposed to abortion. And this position compels me to work to promote access to contraception and other methods of pregnancy prevention. I also feel that being pro-life means working to protect life at all stages, and to alleviate suffering wherever I am able to do so is an important priority. Rarely has the world known such intense suffering as that faced by sub-Saharan Africa today. 
   Mr. Chairman, we must do everything in our power to ensure that the money we spend on international family planning, $441 million in this bill, will be used in the most effective way. The Lowey amendment makes sure that we do that. 
   I want to thank Chairwoman Lowey for her leadership.

   Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I unfortunately must rise in opposition to the Smith-Stupak amendment. I have great respect for the passion displayed by Mr. Smith and Mr. Stupak and I share their opposition to abortion. However, in this instance I must strongly disagree with their decision to prevent the distribution of contraception to some of the most poor and needy people and nations in the world. 
   Mr. Chairman, we are asked to make an important decision in this year's debate on the Foreign Operations bill. Our commitment to providing international family planning speaks volumes about who we are as a nation. These funds reach some of the most vulnerable populations in the world and can literally mean the difference between life and death. 
   I know that Americans regardless of their position on abortion are horrified by the statistics on HIV/AIDS in Africa and the number of unwanted pregnancies and abortions throughout the developing world. I believe that it is our responsibility, as people committed to the sanctity of life and the basic human dignity of all people, to respond to this crisis. I believe that it is also our responsibility to do so in the most effective manner possible while staying true to our core values. The language that Chairwoman Lowey proposes makes it possible for the United States to provide developing nations access to contraceptive products, products that save lives. The Lowey language ensures that the organizations best equipped to distribute these products to the neediest, poorest parts of the world are able to do so. Finally, it respects the law of the land that prohibits Federal financial assistance to organizations that provide abortions or abortion counseling. 
   I know that crafting this language was no easy feat and I commend Mrs. Lowey for her dedication to moving forward with a bill that reflects the values of our Nation and respects the strong feelings that Members have on both sides of the abortion debate. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Smith-Stupak amendment and allow this critical, lifesaving assistance to reach those who so desperately need it. 
   I thank the gentlelady for yielding.
