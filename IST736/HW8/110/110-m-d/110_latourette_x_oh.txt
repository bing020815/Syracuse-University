<DOCNO>Mr. LaTOURETTE. (PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   And I want to add my congratulations to Mr. Oberstar and Mr. Mica as the leaders of our full committee and Ms. Brown and Mr. Shuster, the leaders of the subcommittee, for getting to this point. 
   And I won't rehash all of the good things about this bill that have already been mentioned, but I want to highlight two things. One is thanks to some good work by Mr. Kummant who is now the head of Amtrak. We had a number of labor organizations who were operating without contracts for 8 years. And now those contracts have been tentatively settled, and Mr. Kummant is working hard, together with authorizations contained in this bill, money set aside, and perhaps appropriations for the Congress to implement those agreements, and clearly that's a good step forward, not only for the travelling public but for Amtrak and for people who work on the airlines. 
   And the second thing I want to highlight is sort of the hidden treasure of this bill, and that is the $350 million a year each year for 5 years. Again, the brainstorm of the chairman, Mr. Oberstar, to implement high-speed intercity rail transportation in this country. 
   And I thought that it's more than symbolic that the fellow who was Speaker pro tem for most of the session this morning, Mr. Jackson of Chicago, should be replaced by Mrs. Tubbs Jones of Cleveland. And wouldn't it be wonderful to have a high-speed corridor go from Chicago, Illinois, to Cleveland, Ohio, and give people who are choking on the high cost of gasoline who don't want to fly that short distance to have the opportunity to go 120, 130, 150 miles an hour between Chicago and Cleveland. And that's the vision that Mr. Mica has talked about, and that's the vision that Mr. Oberstar has implemented in this bill. 
   It's a good piece of legislation, and it is really going to put the United States on the right track, as it were, and I'm grateful for all of your hard work.

   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1241 recognizes Ensign DeCarol Davis for her extraordinary achievements as a cadet at the United States Coast Guard Academy. Ensign Davis graduated in May of this year as the valedictorian of her class of 2008, and is currently stationed with the Prevention Department at Coast Guard Sector New York. 
   During her 4 years as a cadet, Ensign Davis was selected as the Academy's first Truman Scholar, honored as the 2007 Arthur Ashe, Jr. Female Sports Scholar of the Year, and served as the president of her Academy class. Ensign Davis also became very involved with student activities on campus and in the surrounding community of New London. 
   Ensign Davis is a shining example of the quality of men and women who make up the leaders and ranks of our Coast Guard, and I hope that the House's action today will encourage our young people to learn more about the Coast Guard Academy and the Coast Guard. 
   I support this resolution honoring Ensign Davis for her achievements. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a good resolution. This is a worthy honor. I urge all Members to support it. 
   The only reason I wanted to take a little bit of time is, after Mr. Coble spoke I was reminded that at our last Coast Guard hearing Mr. Coble made the observation that he had served in the Coast Guard some period of time ago and he wondered what happened to the ship that he had actually served on. And as Mr. Coble left the room, I felt bad, and even though we're a bipartisan bunch here, one of the Members on the other side of the aisle said he thinks he saw the ship in a tall ships museum. And I think that that was an unfair slight to Mr. Coble and I'm sure that that's not true. 
   I urge passage of the resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. LaTOURETTE. (AVIATION SAFETY ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. I thank the gentleman from Florida, the ranking member of the full committee, for yielding. 
   I rise today, Mr. Speaker, in support of H.R. 6493, the Aviation Safety Enhancement Act of 2008. 
   Commercial aviation is enjoying the safest period in the history of flight. In fact, there hasn't been a wide-body aircraft passenger fatality since 2001. This excellent record is the result of the hard work of the FAA's Office of Aviation Safety, which has some 6,900 dedicated employees, including 3,800 FAA aviation safety inspectors, who oversee approximately 19,000 aircraft, including the 7,000 aircraft that make up the entire U.S. commercial airline fleet. Their charge is as important as it is large. 
   Even with such an excellent record, however, the aviation community and the FAA must remain vigilant in protecting the traveling public. H.R. 6493 is an important bipartisan bill that will go a long way towards addressing the inadequacies in the FAA's oversight programs discovered during the Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General audit earlier this year. 
   In addition to efforts already undertaken by the FAA, this legislation creates an Aviation Safety Whistleblower Office; requires modification of Customer Service Initiative to eliminate references to airlines and certificate holders as customers; establishes post-employment restrictions for FAA flight standards inspectors, a 2 year ``cooling-off'' period; requires reassignment of FAA principal supervisory maintenance inspectors, rotates the SPMIs every 5 years; requires an FAA headquarters review of the Air Transportation Oversight System database with the establishment of a team to review the ATOS database every month, requires monthly reports of any regulatory trends, which a description of any should include corrective actions if appropriate. A quarterly report to Congress is also required. 
   I want to applaud the FAA for the level of safety it's overseen in recent years, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that will continue to build upon the already impressive safety record of the Federal Aviation Administration.

<DOCNO>Mr. LaTOURETTE. (CLEAN BOATING ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to begin my remarks by thanking the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Oberstar, and I will have a little more to say about the body on the other side and how it contrasts with how Mr. Oberstar and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on this side operates. 
   I also thank the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Taylor) for his dogged pursuit of this, and all of the other Members that Mr. Oberstar mentioned; and in addition one who he by oversight forgot, Candice Miller of Michigan, who was in the boat business before she came to Congress. And like most of us who live up on the Great Lakes, when she goes home, she hears about this. 
   I actually saw a couple of boaters the weekend before last, and they said that with all that is going on with fuel prices, they paid $500 to fill up their tanks to go out and boat, and they certainly didn't need an incidental discharge permit authorized by the Environmental Protection Agency to go out walleye fishing. 
   Relative to the way the two bodies work, when this matter was brought to the chairman's attention, he immediately said well, draft a piece of legislation, put it in, let's find out everybody that is interested. We will have hearings. We did in the subcommittee and the full committee. We had a markup, we prepared the bill, and then we waited and we waited and we waited. 
   Then today, I know some people who may keep track of the schedule of the House of Representatives may have seen the schedule for today's suspension calendar printed, and it said we would be considering H.R. 5949, and I just would ask people to not adjust their television sets, it is not a mistake, we are in fact doing the Senate bill because the great slumbering dinosaur that is the august body on the other side of the Capitol awoke from that slumber earlier this morning and in fact passed Senate 2766, which I am happy to say is identical word for word with the House bill and so we are going to consider the Senate bill because unlike others, we have no pride of authorship, we are more interested in getting this bill to the President for his signature to help alleviate the pain that some 13 million, 14 million boaters would have. 
   The original House bill was introduced to exempt recreational boaters from having to obtain an EPA permit for incidental discharges that are determined to be normal to the operation of the vehicle. The House passage today will prevent 16 million recreational boaters from being subject to Federal fines of up to $32,500. And let me repeat that, $32,500 a day for a guy who owns a 19-foot Starcraft that has an incidental discharge in Lake Erie. 
   What is an incidental discharge? An incidental discharge is if it rains and water pours off the deck of your boat; if you are out fishing and you have a cooler and you want to dump the melted ice over the side of the boat, that is an incidental discharge. In my part of the Great Lakes basin, we are a little heartier and maybe a little cruder than others, and sometimes we will go out with a cooler filled with liquid refreshments while we walleye fish, and sometimes that leads to a call of nature. That is an incidental discharge from a recreational boat that would have been subject to this discharge permit because of this judge in California. 
   And the Congress had to act because the judge indicated that these regulations go into effect in September. The EPA has already drafted model regulations so they were ready to go. And although the matter is on appeal, if we don't take action and get the President to sign it, it is going to be a big problem. 
   So again, I am very, very thankful to Mr. Oberstar and the other members of our committee. I am very thankful for the prompt action of the House of Representatives and thankful for the action of the United States Senate earlier today. I urge everybody to support this piece of legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for the purpose of closing on our side. 
   Mr. Speaker, again I want to thank Chairman Oberstar. This again is an example of how our committee works in a bipartisan way to deal with real issues affecting real Americans. 
   Just a couple of statistics for the purpose of the Record. In just the State of Ohio, there are over 415,000 recreational boats registered with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. One in every five boats registered in Ohio are located within the seven counties that I represent in northeastern Ohio. The Clean Water Act amendments that the court was allegedly interpreting were designed to deal with ballast water and to prevent the additional scourge of invasive species coming into our waterways, which those of us in the Great Lakes and the coastal regions know, the zebra mussels, the round goby, the sea lamprey, the Asian carp, we are all familiar with how terrible it is when something foreign to our ecosystem is introduced. 
   But the fallacy of the court's decision is that 99 percent of recreational boats don't have any ballast water so it would be tough for an invasive species to sneak into something that didn't exist. And, in fact, this court ruling would have even covered a kayak. If you, Mr. Speaker, wanted to go kayaking on the Cuyahoga River, you would have needed an EPA discharge permit for the purpose of your kayak. 
   Clearly it made no sense. There is no body or plethora of science that indicates that invasive species have hitched into inland water on kayaks or pontoon boats. This is a ruling that didn't make sense. And, sadly, it is taking congressional action, and I am glad that in this instance congressional action has taken place in both bodies and the President hopefully will soon sign this legislation. Again, my thanks to all who were involved. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. LaTOURETTE. (CLARIFYING PERMIT REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN VESSEL DISCHARGES -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Again, I want to praise a number of our colleagues, first and foremost among them, the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Oberstar, who introduced just yesterday, I think, H.R. 6556, and, again, would indicate that anyone that followed the House schedule doesn't need to adjust their television set. We are, in fact, doing Senate 3298 and not House bill 6556. 
   Again, it's thanks to the pressure, and I didn't know I was citing a biblical verse before, but give thanks to the pressure exerted by Chairman Oberstar indicating that we were prepared to proceed. 
   Just a quick story about those 200 meters to the other side, there is a rather famous clock on the other side of the Capitol called the Ohio Clock. Every time I have been over there it doesn't seem to be working, but it's right twice a day, and I think once today at least and in passing these pieces of legislation, the United States Senate has sent us a good piece of legislation, which we can send on to the President. 
   I rise in support of Senate 3298, and this has been the result of bipartisan, bicameral discussions by a number of Members on the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. 
   The House is taking action to approve this bill in conjunction with the recreational boating measure that we just passed, the court decision which would require this permitting business that we have talked about that was never contemplated by the Clean Water Act. 
   The bill will exempt small commercial vessels and all fishing vessels from obtaining these permits for 2 years while the agency studies the nature of impacts and discharges that are normal to the operation of these vessels. Following the submission of the required report, Congress will have better tools to determine if these discharges should be regulated or exempted, as is the case with recreational vehicles. 
   Enactment of this legislation and its companion will carry out an agreement made with Chairman Oberstar to address the entire scope of vessels that will be impacted by the pending EPA permit program. 
   I, again, want to commend Chairman Oberstar, thank him for working with us, and on our side of the aisle someone who has been dogged, and, I think, concerned as Gene Taylor of Mississippi was on the Democratic side of the aisle, on our side of the aisle Mr. Young of Alaska and Mr. LoBiondo of New Jersey were afraid that because we have 14 million recreational boaters, perhaps we would deal with that issue and then leave this issue hanging in limbo. 
   But, again, as a result of the reaching across the aisle and across the Capitol, can-do spirit of Chairman Oberstar, we were able to come to this moment in time. I guess the only thing that we can hope, is if the reference to the slumbering dinosaur is accurate, that 2 years is enough time for them to again awaken from their slumber and solve this problem when this moratorium expires. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of our time for the purpose of closing. 
   Mr. Speaker, just a couple of observations. I am glad that, again, Mr. LoBiondo has singled out Gene Taylor of Mississippi, who is a tireless champion on a number of these issues, and was dead set, as was Mr. LoBiondo and Mr. Young, on making sure that this piece moved with the other piece. And in honor of Mr. Taylor today on the floor, I actually wore chinos and a blue blazer, which is the Taylor national uniform, to commemorate his participation in the House of Representatives. 
   The other thing, before I came over to the floor I got the benefit of an e-mail that is being sent around by some environmental groups indicating that this somehow is a dangerous bill and is going to lead to pollution. And again, I will tell you, for those that are weak at heart and maybe nervous about that type of communication, first, again, over 99 percent of the recreational vehicles and vessels we are talking about don't have any ballast water. So the ballast water and invasive species issue that we are attempting to deal with is a nonstarter, literally, a red herring. 
   The second piece, and that is that somehow we are authorizing the discharge of noxious chemicals and pollutants into the water stream is also not correct, in that that was taken care of in the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. And what we are truly talking about here, Mr. Speaker, are incidental discharges, as I think I described during the discussion of the other bill. 
   I am grateful that we were able to permanently take care of our recreational friends; that we now have a 2-year window with which to collect additional data to make sure we get it right on fishing vessels. 
   I again commend Mr. Oberstar and our committee and our friends in the Senate for getting it to us; and hopefully President Bush will sign this soon, and this problem will be taken care of. 
   I yield back the balance of our time.

<DOCNO>Mr. LaTOURETTE. (PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. I thank the chairman of the committee, and I thank him for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is my 14th year in the Congress. This is the first year that  we've not had a major dustup over Amtrak, and that is a direct credit to the hard work on our side of Mr. Shuster and Mr. Mica, and on the Democratic side to Chairwoman Brown and the chairman of our full committee, who Ms. Brown has referred to as the guru of transportation. And I think this bill is one that deserves every Member's support. 
   I was glad that Chairman Oberstar, in his remarks, talked about the high cost of fuel and gasoline, and he talked about airlines. And I just want to throw another one in. Continental Airlines is a big carrier in my part of the world. They just announced they're going to lay off 3,000 people out of a workforce of 54,000. And in talking to them, their jet fuel costs in the last year have gone up $2.3 billion. And if you think about what $2.3 billion means, translated over the workforce, it means that if fuel hadn't gone up by that amount, everybody that works for Continental Airlines could have gotten a raise of $50,000. I mean, we're talking real money. 
   I just left a presentation by Michael Ward, the CEO, President and CEO of CSX, and his new advertising campaign as he attempts to convince those of us in Ohio and West Virginia and Pennsylvania and Virginia and Maryland to build the national gateway project. They can take a ton, a ton of cargo from Cleveland, Ohio, to Baltimore, Maryland, on a gallon of diesel fuel. Now, that is where we should be making our investments, and if we can do it with freight, we can certainly do it with passenger rail. 
   I'm excited about this bill not only because we're going to stop the sort of nitpicking that's gone on here about how much Amtrak could get as a Federal subsidy. I've been here when we had the administration send up zero as the Federal contribution; I've been here when they sent up $500 million. I think this year they sent up $800 million when everybody agrees that that's not sufficient. 
   The chairwoman and I have traveled the world looking at passenger rail systems. There is not a passenger rail system in the country, in the world, that makes money and doesn't rely on their government to make a contribution. 
   We have a societal choice. We can either have people get in their car and pay $4.05 a gallon for one person listening to the radio, or we can convince them that for trips of 400 miles or less that passenger rail is a viable alternative in this country. And Mr. Mica's vision of high-speed passenger rail is a viable alternative in this country, and they can get from point A to point B in a cheap, clean, environmentally friendly way; and this bill moves us in that direction. 
   So congratulations, I think, go around to Mr. Mica, Mr. Shuster, Ms. Brown, and Chairman Oberstar. 
   We should be embarrassed, Mr. Chairman, as Americans when you look at what the Asians and the Europeans are doing with passenger rail that we have such a sad state of affairs in the United States of America. It's time to stop it, and I just want to thank all four of the leaders of our committee for including a proposal to make a real commitment for the first time in the history, of recent history of passenger rail to the Midwestern part of this United States. 
   And I know, I know for a fact that if we put the Federal resources to build a high-speed rail line from Cleveland to Columbus to Cincinnati, people would beg, would beg to be on that train for 120 miles an hour to get their business done. 
   My congratulations. Good bill. We all need to vote for it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, today we recognize the 50th anniversary of Lake Sidney Lanier, an Army Corps of Engineers facility located in the State of Georgia. 
   Lake Lanier is one of 464 lakes in 43 States constructed and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
   Our Nation is blessed with considerable water resources that support our Nation's economy and quality of life. We need water for our homes, farms and factories. Water also supports navigation, generates power and sustains our environment. 
   Congress authorized the Buford Dam Project in 1946 just after the end of the Second World War. Groundbreaking for the project began in 1950. Constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Lake Lanier is a multipurpose, 38,000-acre lake that provides flood protection, power production, water supply, navigation, recreation, and fish and wildlife management. 
   Nestled in the foothills of the Georgia Blue Ridge Mountains, Lake Sidney Lanier is one of America's favorite lakes. Over 7.5 million people a year choose to visit Lake Lanier. With over 692 miles of shoreline, the lake is well known for its aqua-blue colored water, spectacular scenery and variety of recreational activities. 
   When completed, the total cost of construction, including land acquisition, was almost $45 million. When the gates of the dam were closed in 1956, it took more than 3 years for the lake to reach its normal elevation of 1,070 feet above sea level. 
   The lake is named for one of the Nation's most famous poets, Sidney Lanier. Born in Georgia in 1842, Mr. Lanier entered Oglethorpe College at 14 years of age, graduating at the top of his class in 1860. 
   While serving on the blockade runner ``Lucy'' during the Civil War, Mr. Lanier was captured and contracted tuberculosis while imprisoned in Maryland. Following the Civil War, Mr. Lanier played the flute for the Peabody Symphony and lectured at Johns Hopkins University. 
   While he is known for works like ``The Harlequin of Dreams,'' ``In Absence,'' ``Acknowledgement,'' and ``Sunrise,'' he is best remembered for ``The Song of the Chattahoochee,'' an enduring legacy for the native Georgian. 
   I urge all of our Members to support this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 853 honors the efforts of all of those that volunteered to assist the response to the recent oil spill in San Francisco Bay. Last month a cargo vessel collided with a span of the San Francisco Bay Bridge, resulting in a gash to the vessel's hull and the release of approximately 58,000 gallons of fuel oil into the bay. 
   Following reports of the oil spill, the Coast Guard, with its Federal, State and local government partners, initiated a response to the spill which has resulted in the deployment of 440 personnel and the recovery of more than 4,000 cubic yards of oily solids. 
   In addition to the critical work performed by the Coast Guard and other government officials, literally thousands of volunteers have assisted in cleanup operations at beaches throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. Volunteers have assisted professional cleanup crews in removing oil from beaches and have reported sightings of oil-affected areas and impaired wildlife to oil spill response personnel. 
   Additionally, volunteers were required to undergo at least 4 hours of hazardous waste and emergency response training before participating in the cleanup efforts. 
   I want to commend the Speaker of the House, Ms. Pelosi, and join with her today in thanking these volunteers and honoring their efforts to respond to this unfortunate event. 
   I also want to take time to thank all of the Federal, State, and local officials for their efforts to contain and minimize the environmental and economic impacts of the spill. 
   I urge all members to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of our time.

   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Thank you for yielding the time. 
   Congratulations to you, Mr. Goodlatte and Chairman Peterson, for this bill. I voted for it last time, and I will vote for it again today. 
   But the difficulty is that we find ourselves with about 5 days left in this 110th Congress. There was a famous emperor of Rome, Nero, who fiddled while Rome burned. I just want to talk a little bit about what we've been doing for 2 years since gas prices went up and the Democratic majority took over in January. 
   When they took over in January, gas was at $2.20 a gallon which was high, but people still said, ``Okay. I can still get by on that.'' But Congress, rather than dealing with what was going to begin to happen, on that day, January 29, we congratulated the University of California, Santa Barbara soccer team for doing swell stuff. I like soccer. I bet everybody that's on that team, their moms and dads, are proud of them. But when gas is going up, what are we doing that for? 
   Next one, February 6, it's gone up 60 cents a gallon. February 6, 2008, we declare National Passport Month here on the House floor. That's the most important issue in America, apparently, to the majority. 
   It passed $3 for the first time in my lifetime, and we're commending another soccer team, the Houston Dynamos. I bet they're a great soccer team, too, but gas is $3. The most important issue that we're debating on the floor of the House of Representatives is congratulating the Houston Dynamos. 
   Then $3.77. That should have gotten our attention. So what did they debate? Did we debate this bill or an energy policy? No. We declared National Train Day on that particular day with gas at $3.77. 
   Goes up on May 20, $3.84. On that particular day, I gotta tell you, we passed--and I don't even know what these are--Great Cats and Rare Canids Day. Maybe, Mr. Speaker, you know what a canid is. Somebody told me maybe it's a dog. But we're not debating energy. Our constituents are paying $3.84 a gallon for the first time in their lives, and we're recognizing great cats and canids. 
   Well, surely at $4 a gallon we have America's attention, the mighty House of Representatives, the new majority is going to debate energy. Nope. We declare the International Year of Sanitation. 
   I gotta tell you, Mr. Speaker, then it hits $4.14 on June 17, 2008. I bet we're going to debate energy now. I bet we're going to do this bill. No. We did the Monkey Safety Act. Folks, I love monkeys. They're cute, they're cuddly, they're everything else; but for crying out loud, when it costs $80 to fill up your gas tank, the most important issue in the United States of America is not the Monkey Safety Act. 
   It's time for this majority to quit monkeying around with our gas prices. It's no coincidence, Mr. Speaker, that at the same time we're doing the Monkey Safety Act, unemployment in this country goes from a little over 4 1/2 percent to where it is today, over 6 percent. 
   Quit fooling around. Quit horsing around. Some people say, Well, this chart doesn't go far enough. We also did some other important things after we got back. We declared National Watermelon Month, and we also indicated that we were going to recognize Bo Diddley. He's a great guy. I'm all for honoring him. But it's time that we tell our friends on the other side, You haven't done diddley about oil and gas.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   There is something in life called the Hobson's choice. And I never thought I would be here, and I think Dave Hobson who is retiring probably thinks it is named after him, but it is not. And what we are being told today is that we either give $700 billion to the Secretary of the Treasury because he says that is what is needed, in a plan that is untested, unworked; or, and if we don't just write this check, we are being told that all of our constituents are going to lose their life savings, their 401(k)s, their retirements. That is one hell of a choice, Madam Speaker. 
   And I come today with a big problem. The big problem is, where did the number come from? The number, Forbes Magazine last week, Treasury spokeswoman: It is not based on any data point. We just wanted to choose a really large number. Well, you know what: $700 billion is a really large number. 
   Last night we took an amendment to the Rules Committee, asked them to make it in order to stop this process, slow it down by a day. The vote was 8-4, along party lines. Eight Democratic members of the Rules Committee, who represent about 4.8 million people, told 305 million Americans we couldn't have a vote on that or anything else, including measures that are important to Democrats, such as bankruptcy and things of that nature. 
   This bill left the House and it went over to the Senate, and they larded it up: $192 million for rum. I guess we got the pirate vote in November. $100 million for NASCAR. $81 million for Hollywood. And my favorite, $2 million for wooden arrows for children. Now, I want children to have wooden arrows, but it doesn't belong in this bill. 
   And I have got to tell you, as a Republican I have never seen--I am finishing my 14th year--what just happened on the last vote. And we all know that folks back home don't pay attention to the rules. Twenty Republicans voted for the Democratic rule. If those 20 Republicans had not voted for that rule, we could have had an amendment on the floor, saving America $450 billion, which, as our friends like to tell us, is 4 years in Iraq, and we could have cut the pork. 
   As John McCain says, and sadly, for those 20 Republicans and those who aided and abetted them: we will make you famous, and you shall know their names. Shame on you.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. I thank the ranking member for yielding, and I actually moved to Bainbridge Township now, so nobody can find me. 
   Madam Speaker, this was a bad bill that we voted on Monday. It got a little better with some tax extenders, with the FDIC insurance, but it's gotten a lot worse, and it's gotten a lot worse because our friends on the other side of the Capitol just couldn't help themselves. They couldn't help themselves by larding this bill up with another $180 billion of tax giveaways. 
   As a matter of fact, Madam Speaker, I urge you to read yesterday's New York Times. There's a provision in here for $2 million for wooden arrows for children that apparently benefits a company in Oregon; and God bless any Oregonian that got it into the bill. And the CEO of the company says, we're waiting, and if we get it into the House bill and they pass it, we will be unpopping the champagne corks here, because this is a great deal for my company. 
   How am I going to tell the people back in Ohio that the champagne corks are popping in Oregon over a tax subsidy of $2 million for wooden arrows? $192 million for rum? 
   Madam Speaker, last night I took an amendment to the Rules Committee, and I asked one simple thing, to save half a trillion dollars, take the number down to $250 billion. I asked that the vote that when we come back, when the Secretary says he wants more money, make it a positive vote, not a negative vote that the President can veto, and I stripped the pork. 
   8 to 4 was the vote last night, Madam Speaker. Each of us represents about 600,000 people. 4.8 million people voted to deny 300 million people the vote. 
   There is not a rush. The Senate's in town. Let's do it right. We can save half a trillion dollars, and we can cut the pork. The pork doesn't belong in this bill. This is a financial rescue package. 
   We're being told that the economy is melting down. And the number, Madam Speaker, where did $700 billion come from? 
   The administration says we didn't have any data point. We just wanted to pick a really large number. 
   Come on. $700 billion--for NASCAR, rum, television and wooden arrows for children. 
   Vote ``no'' on this egregious rule and the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Madam Speaker, I can't address other Members, so I am going to make these comments to you. 
   I have heard a number of speakers on the other side say they wish they could have had other things, like the cram-down on the bankruptcy, money for ACORN and a lot of other things. The only way you are ever going to have that opportunity is to make our amendment in order and turn the negative vote in November into a positive vote. And any Member that thinks that if you vote for 700 and you go home and say, well, we really only gave them 350; no, you didn't. You gave them the full 700, because we have to say no to the additional 350. And if we say no, the President vetoes it, then it takes 290 Members to deny that $350 billion. 
   To the Democrats, Madam Speaker, I would say to you that make our amendment in order, come back on November 17, see how this program is working. And there is your opportunity, there is your leverage to go to your friends that want cram-down in bankruptcy and all the other things that their speakers are talking about. Give us the amendment; stop this overspending. The Secretary says he can only spend $50 billion a month. If we give him $250 billion, he still should have about $200 billion rolling around in his pocket when we come back.

<DOCNO>Mr. LaTOURETTE. (THE MAJORITY PARTY -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, this has been one heck of a day here on Capitol Hill. As a matter of fact, it's been one heck of a week. 
   About 13 days ago, the Secretary of the Treasury came down to Capitol Hill, said that our markets are a mess, Wall Street's a mess, and if we don't give him $700 billion immediately, it's going to be a big problem. And we take that seriously. 
   But then there was a little investigation, and they asked the Treasury, Where did you come up with the number $700 billion? Well, they answered it last week in Forbes Magazine, and here's the Treasury spokeswoman's quote: ``It's not based on any particular data point. We just really wanted to come up with a really big number.'' 
   Well, they succeeded. Seven hundred billion dollars is a really, really big number. It means really, really big things to Americans. 
   A lot of us, because the Treasury Secretary also indicated that he could only spend $50 billion of your money a month, we had an amendment last night and we said let's make it a lot less. Let's save half a trillion dollars, and let's give him some money. If he's right, he can rescue the economy and everything will be all right. We're going to put in place some reforms, and we will come back on November 17 and we will figure out whether it's working or not. That sounded like a pretty reasonable plan to a lot of reasonable people. 
   But that didn't happen. People who watch the House know that everything that comes to the floor comes to the floor pursuant to a rule. And the Rules Committee voted on that proposal last night, to save half a trillion dollars. And they voted ``no,'' 8-4. And, sadly, all 8 were members of the Democratic Party. 
   Each of us represents about 600,000 people. So 4.8 million people basically, through their representatives, denied 305 million Americans the opportunity to have a vote, to take 10 minutes and take a vote about whether or not we could save half a trillion dollars and perhaps not give the whole $700 billion of tax money to the Treasury. 
   Then the bill left the House, and it went over to our good friends in the Senate, who, of course, are very fiscally conservative. They're wiser than we are because they have 6-year terms; we only have 2-year terms. And do you think that they just were happy sending it back to us at $700 billion? No. They sent it back to us at $850 billion, and they added such wonderful things like $192 million for rum. 
   Now, listen, I like rum. And it may be some of the Senators were nervous that they were losing the pirate vote. I don't know. But there's $192 million for rum, $100 million for NASCAR. I like NASCAR, but what's it doing in this bill saving the treasury? There's $81 billion to Hollywood and $2 million for wooden arrows for children.  
   Now, listen, all of these projects might be okay. They don't belong in a bill when the administration is saying that we need to act now or else the economy's going to melt down. 
   But, you know, some of my friends back home say, well, 3 weeks, okay, if it's an emergency. What have you guys been doing? 
   Well, we had in August a little discussion around here, and I don't know how Mr. McCotter from Michigan feels, but my constituents were not really happy when gasoline went to $4 a gallon. And I'll bet we were probably talking about that and that's why we couldn't get to the economy. 
   Well, this Congress started in January of 2007. Gas was $2.22 a gallon. People said that's high, but, okay, I can get by. So the Congress got together and we decided--actually, it was the Democratic majority that decided that the most important thing that we could discuss on that day was congratulating the University of California at Santa Barbara soccer team for their championship. I like soccer. That's important. I'm sure their parents are real proud. But gas is $2.22. 
   Well, then it goes up to $2.84. And people say, well, sure, I'll bet now you're going to try to figure out an energy policy for the country. Well, on that day we declared it National Passport Month. And I know that everybody in America, when they filled up their gas tank at $2.84 a gallon, said, well, I know it's expensive but at least it's National Passport Month. 
   Then gas went up to $3.03. And we have all been told that we have to get the vote of the soccer moms to be reelected. So we tried that again. When gas was at $3.03, we commended the Houston Dynamo soccer team because we really like soccer. 
   Well, gas goes up to $3.77. Surely now your elected representatives in Washington get the picture, that we're going to vote on gas. We declared it National Train Month, folks. National Train Month. 
   Well, then it goes up a little higher, $3.84 a gallon. Your Congress, thanks to the new majority, figures the most important issue is the Great Cats and Rare Canids. And for those of us who don't follow this, canids are dogs. So basically we were voting on foreign aid for cats and dogs rather than dealing with energy. 
   Then it goes to $4.09. The first time in my history I paid over $4 for gasoline. Well, we're going to act on your behalf: We declared it International Sanitation Month because we really felt your pain. 
   It crested $4.14 on June 17 of this year. You know that the United States Congress was grappling with energy prices. You know that the United States Congress had to be grappling with this meltdown of the economy. The majority party that day decided that the most important issue facing America was the Monkey Safety Act. 
   Now, folks, you deserve better than the Monkey Safety Act. You deserve lower gas prices. And, folks, you deserve a better bill than you got today.

<DOCNO>Mr. LaTOURETTE. (SGT. MICHAEL M. KASHKOUSH POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. I thank the gentleman from Indiana for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank Chairman Waxman and Ranking Member Davis for moving this legislation expeditiously through the committee and on to the floor today. And I want to thank the other Mr. Davis from Illinois and Mr. Burton for so ably managing it today as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, Michael Kashkoush grew up in Michigan, and then he moved to Chagrin Falls to start high school. He was the beloved son of Marwan and Mary Jane Kashkoush. 
   He spent his freshman and sophomore years in Chagrin Falls, and then moved with his family to London for a year and returned to Chagrin for his senior year, graduating in 2001. 
   Michael was like many young men. His high school years had been about girls, friends, lifting weights, sports, and parties. He started college with great intentions, but didn't find it a good fit for that moment in his life and, after 2 years, he announced to his parents that he wanted to join the Marines. The exceptionally bright and capable young man said that he had led a soft life and wanted to be a marine because ``they're the toughest and most disciplined in the world.'' The Marines were the matching puzzle piece for this gifted former high school wrestler and football player. 
   Michael's father urged him to finish college and instead attend officers school, but Michael believed he could not lead unless he knew what it was that the grunts had to do. Marwan Kashkoush stood behind his son's choice. 
   Michael was an exemplary marine and was promoted to sergeant in 2005 in counterintelligence/human intelligence. He had never spoken Arabic, but at the Defense Language Institute in 6 short months he mastered the language. He had a limitless future in the Marines. 
   In 4 short years, the United States Marine Corps made Michael Kashkoush a man. They gave his self-described ``soft life'' purpose. He was very proud of his military service to our country. On January 23, 2007, just 10 days after being sent to Iraq, he died while conducting combat operations in Anbar province. 
   Earlier this year, Michael's father and stepmother, Phoebe Brockman Kashkoush, wrote to me and asked me if I would introduce this piece of legislation in honor of Michael. It was a wonderful idea, and it is a perfect one for Chagrin Falls, Ohio. 
   Chagrin Falls is a small, tight-knit community where neighbors are close and there is a genuine sense of community. It is a place where there are almost as many American flags as front porches, and when one of their own died, it deeply touched the community. 
   Chagrin Falls, a town of about 4,000 people, turned out en masse for the funeral services, and some 600 people crammed into St. Joan of Arc Catholic Church, where they sang a joyful, tearful rendition of Don McLean's ``American Pie.'' The Jaycees adorned street posts with hundreds of flags, and more than 300 people walked the half-mile trek from the church down South Franklin Street in blustery snow to Michael's final resting place. 
   It is fitting, Mr. Speaker, that the Chagrin Falls Post Office be named in honor of Sergeant Michael Kashkoush, and it is a wonderful remembrance for a family who has lost so much. 
   The father who first resisted his son's plan to enlist credits the Marines with changing his life. He said, ``They built me my best friend.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlelady for yielding, and I rise today to support the manager's amendment and to offer my thanks to the chairman of the full committee, Chairman Frank. 
   About a year ago in Ohio we had a 500-year event, and a lot of places that had never flooded, flooded. And what we found was that the current structure of the National Flood Insurance Program indicates that if the primary insurance, if there is a finding that it is underinsured, there is a penalty that attaches to it. It further goes on to say that if the penalty attaches and you don't pay out the limits on the first policy, you can't reach the secondary insurance. 
   We had people in our hometown that basically did what they were supposed to do; they bought the secondary insurance, they were fully insured. The condominium owners association, however, was underinsured, and therefore we didn't reach the policies. 
   The chairman joined with me in August in writing to FEMA to see if we could administratively reach some resolution. Sadly, we were unable to do that, and my thanks to Chairman Frank for including in his manager's amendment today something that not only reaches my constituents, because apparently that would be some kind of illegal earmark, but it reaches all people in the country that find themselves so afflicted. So my thanks to the chairman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the dean of our delegation for authoring this resolution. I also want to thank our Democratic friends from Ohio and Members from other States who I see gathering on the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is no way to describe today's news about our friend, Paul Gillmor, other than shock, a devastating loss to his family, to his friends, his colleagues, Ohio and our Nation. 
   Unlike a number of the other members of the Ohio delegation, I didn't come to Congress through the Ohio legislature, and so I didn't serve with Paul in the Ohio legislature, although I knew of him from Republican gatherings around the State of Ohio, he also was my mom's Congressman. She always told me the story about how excited the people were who were up in Lakeside, Marblehead and the Islands that Congressman Gillmor was going to come up and share his thoughts. But I didn't have the chance to work with him until I arrived here about 13 years ago. What I found was what I had heard, and that was that Congressman Gillmor was a hardworking, smart legislator who loved his family, loved his friends, loved this institution and the people he served. He was willing to take the time to show a young freshman around back in 1995. He was willing to share his vast knowledge of financial services with those that didn't quite have the same expertise. If you were having a sadness or a joy in your life, he was willing to share in that. And he was a wonderful fellow to sit and have dinner with. And after dinner, he was a wonderful fellow to sit around with and tell war stories. And over the course of the years, many of those stories were exaggerated with the passage of time and also the failing of memory, but it was always a good time. 
   I was reminded by my staff, because I want to talk about Paul's family, but I also want to talk about Paul's other family. And my staff reminded me, when they learned of Paul's passing today, that we were neighbors in the Longworth Building, and my staff told me how lucky we were to have a neighbor whose staff was always willing to walk us through another clueless day in the 104th Congress. And how you could always walk into the lobby, and how he taught us about constituent services because you would always find a bowl of Dum Dum suckers because the Spangler Candy Company was located in Bryan, Ohio, which was in the Congressman's district. 
   Our Ohio delegation is poor today with the loss of our friend, neighbor and mentor, Paul Gillmor. Our thoughts and prayers are with Paul's wife, Karen, his five wonderful children, and also, Mr. Speaker, with his Capitol Hill family, many of whom have been with him for many, many years and who miss him very badly today.

<DOCNO>Mr. LaTOURETTE. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Chairman Frank, for noble work in being handed really a pile of garbage and trying to make it better. Sadly, I cannot endorse the legislation he has worked so hard to bring today; and say this mess is not of his making. 
   Our leader, Mr. Boehner, appointed about 14 of us to do a working group to find an alternative to $700 billion, thinking that $700 billion is a lot of money.  
   And our recommendations had a number of principles. One is that the people that made the mess should clean up the mess. Thankfully, that was the insurance program which Chairman Frank and the Democrats have acceded to. And it also dealt with CEO compensation in the bill, which I am happy to see. 
   But there were three market reforms that could have taken this bill from $700 billion to maybe $100 billion, and it is what the folks that have been calling me asked for. Some have already been talked about on the floor, and that is the mark to market. And basically, to give an example, if you are a bank and you have a million dollar building in your portfolio but because the real estate market isn't doing so well, the bank examiners have come in and they have said your building is only worth $400,000 today. You haven't sold it. Nothing has happened to it. You are still collecting rent on it, but you have taken a $600,000 hit on your balance sheet. That has a doubled-edged effect in that now that you have a reduced balance sheet, you have to squirrel more cash so you can't make loans to people wanting to engage in business, people wanting to buy homes. It is fake. 
   The latest figures that I have seen indicate that this mark down by the bank examiners has taken $500 billion of assets down, with the multiplier effect of about $5 trillion that is not available. 
   We could double the FDIC reform and do the FDIC reform which I believe the chairman supports. And not one American has lost one penny in an FDIC-insured account of $100,000 or less. We could make it $200,000. 
   Lastly, the principle was that the taxpayer shouldn't pay for this. Private money should pay for this. Repatriate offshore funds from American corporations, and we could fix this problem.

<DOCNO>Mr. LaTOURETTE. (COPS IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the COPS Improvements Act of 2007. I want to congratulate Chairman Conyers, Mr. Weiner and Mr. Keller for bringing this bill forward. 
   My written statement talks all about the importance of adding a police officer school, resources officers and things of that nature. I want to talk about an aspect of the bill that I am particularly excited about, and that is the technology grants contained in the bill. 
   The police departments in my district were recently notified that the backbone radio system that we basically spent millions of dollars on a number of years ago is now going to become obsolete in 2011 because the manufacturer is no longer going to make the spare parts. In the small communities that I represent, it means a bill of $10 million. The technology upgrades in this particular piece of legislation are going to give my communities the opportunity to bid for grants that hopefully will replace that radio system and make our community safer. 
   Secondly, in the wake of the Virginia Tech shootings, I have heard from most of the school districts in my district that we need to build on the success of the last COPS bill where 225 school resource officers were added to the schools in the State of Ohio. And they are excited again about the opportunity to add new school resource officers in the schools to make them safer for all of the students in our school system and across the country. 
   So again I want to congratulate the sponsors of this legislation. And I thank Mr. Forbes for yielding.  
   I rise today to speak in support of the COPS Improvement Act of 2007. 
   Mr. Speaker, when I meet with law enforcement officials across my district, their biggest concern is that Washington keeps asking them to do more with less, especially in the aftermath of 9-11. Each year, they beg me to adequately fund the COPS program and to reinstate the hiring portion.  
   In my State of Ohio, the COPS program has been a godsend: 
   It has funded nearly 3,800 additional cops and deputies. 
   It has infused about 640 departments across Ohio with more than $227 million in Federal help. 
   More than 225 school resource officers have been added to Ohio. 
   More than $55 million has gone to Ohio departments to improve crime-fighting technologies. 
   In my district alone, in the Akron-Cleveland area, nearly $20 million has gone to local departments and 285 officers have been added to streets and schools in my district. 
   I met with about 50 police chiefs throughout my district early last month to tout this bill, and share the news that it was coming. They are thrilled with this legislation. Many departments in my district were able to add officers thanks to the COPS program, and they have kept them on their payrolls. 
   They have patiently waited for us to beef up the COPS program, especially as violent crime experiences an uptick. They want and need the Federal Government to help fund cops on the beat, new cops in schools, and they are thrilled that $350 million will be available for competitive grants to pay for laptop computers, radios, cameras, and all the technological marvels our police departments must have and can barely afford. 
   My police chiefs in Lake County recently found out that they have to replace their entire radio system because the manufacturer will no longer be able to repair or replace them. 
   My chiefs are thrilled that this bill recognizes the importance of school officers. They spoke of the need to keep schools safe, and the bond that develops with students so students can feel safe to confide in them. These school officers serve as mentors, friends and protectors--they are worth their weight in gold. It's a small investment to make. 
   In the days following the shootings at Virginia Tech, I heard from many school districts pleading that funding be made available for school resource officers. This bill will allow law enforcement to partner with the schools. I also heard from the Ohio School Resource Officers Association in the aftermath of Virginia Tech. They say passage of the COPS Improvement Act can't happen fast enough. The Senate passed it in March, and I am proud that the House will today. 
   This is great legislation. It's a good value for taxpayers. We ask our police to protect our homes, our businesses and our schools and for too long we've asked them to do it on the cheap.

   H.R. 753, as amended, designates the Clifford Davis Federal Building in Memphis, Tennessee, as the Clifford Davis and Odell Horton Federal Building. The bill honors Judge Horton's dedication to public service. 
   After service in the United States Marines during the Korean War and acquiring a law degree from Howard University, Judge Horton engaged in the private practice of law from 1957 until 1962.     
   His career included serving as an Assistant United States Attorney in Memphis, an appointment to the Shelby County Criminal Court, and serving as the President of LeMoyne-Owen College. 
   Judge Horton was appointed to the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee by President Carter in 1980. He served as its chief judge from 1987 to 1993 and became a senior judge on May 16, 1995. Two years later, he retired from the Federal bench; and, sadly, Judge Horton passed away last year on February 22.

This bill honors Rafael Martinez Nadal's contributions to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. 
   Rafael Martinez Nadal was born in the city of Mayaguez on April 22, 1877. In 1912, he became a lawyer and entered the Puerto Rican political arena. He was considered one of the most famous criminal lawyers in Puerto Rico at that time. 
   In 1914, Rafael Martinez Nadal was elected to Puerto Rico's House of Representatives for the District of Ponce. In 1920, he was elected to Puerto Rico's Senate, where he served as its President from 1932 to 1940. 
   Rafael Martinez Nadal was a strong defender of statehood in Puerto Rico and has been described as a political leader, a writer, a successful businessman, a brilliant orator and a distinguished lawyer. He passed away in July of 1941. 
   I support this legislation, congratulate my friend Congressman Fortu&#241;o, and urge our colleagues to do the same.

H.R. 802 was introduced by our full committee chairman, Jim Oberstar, and is similar language that was approved by voice vote in the House during the last Congress. I say ``similar to'' because there are some differences, and we noted those differences at the time of the markup of this legislation. 
   I want to thank the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Oberstar, and I also want to thank the distinguished chairman of our subcommittee, Mr. Cummings, for working with me and others on my side of the aisle to address our concerns with the introduced version of the bill. 
   The bill will implement international requirements for air emissions from  ships for purposes of U.S. law. Under this bill, the Coast Guard and the Environmental Protection Agency will be required to develop regulations that establish standards for emissions of ozone-depleting substances and other pollutants as well as marine fuel oil quality that are used in U.S. waters. I am happy to see that we are considering this legislation that will reduce our emissions from vessels operating in U.S. waters this early in the year. 
   Again, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar and Chairman Cummings for working with us to improve the bill. I urge our colleagues to support this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume for the purposes of engaging in a colloquy with the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee. 
   Chairman Cummings, if I could clarify, through this colloquy, the language that was included in sections 4 and 5. 
   First, section 4 authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Coast Guard, to designate special areas where vessels would be required to comply with vessel emission regulations under Annex VI to the MARPOL Convention. This section also directs the EPA to consult with a State if such an area is established in an area that is under the jurisdiction of that State. 
   Is it the chairman's understanding that the committee does not intend to require the agencies to consult with a State or to give a State any authority over a special area that is not wholly established outside of the three or, in some cases, nine nautical mile belt of waters that fall within the jurisdiction of a State?

   Additionally, Mr. Chairman, section 5 of the bill grants the EPA certain authorities to establish, administer and enforce regulations to implement MARPOL Annex VI. Is it the chairman's understanding that this language does not replace or reduce the Coast Guard's parallel authorities to administer and enforce regulations to implement Annex VI or other regulations under the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships?

<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Madam Speaker, tonight we are gathered to pay tribute to three of our Members from Ohio who are retiring, and we are going to speak about them in order. But, Madam Speaker, this has been a tough Congress for the Ohio delegation, the 110th Congress. Last year, our long time colleague and friend Paul Gillmor passed away suddenly and unexpectedly, and, of course, just a month and a half ago our good friend and long time colleague Stephanie Tubbs Jones passed away unexpectedly as well. 
   The news gets worse for us as we now arise to talk about three of our friends who have made the decision to retire: The dean of our delegation, RALPH REGULA; one of our great cardinals when we were in the majority, DAVE HOBSON, ``Uncle Dave''; and former judge and the highest ranking woman in the Republican leadership, DEBORAH PRYCE. 
   Before we extol more, I guess our new dean from the other side of the aisle, from Toledo, MARCY KAPTUR, has asked to spend a couple of minutes with us, and I yield to the gentlewoman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. I thank the gentlewoman, reclaiming our time. And as I introduce the other Ohio Members and others from perhaps around the country to speak about our honorees, I am going to say a couple of things about each of them before I hand it off to our colleagues. 
   First is the dean of our delegation, RALPH REGULA from Navarre, Ohio. I know his wife, Mary, is with us this evening and watching on in earnest. And if you ever saw a partnership, there is a partnership, RALPH and Mary Regula. Of course, Mary is a star in her own right because of her work at the First Ladies' Library and all that she has done. 
   Just two quick things about Congressman Regula. When I was trying to figure out whether I wanted to run for Congress in 1994, I came to visit Congressman Regula. And if you have been to his office, it is on the third floor of the Rayburn Office Building, and it looks like the Capitol is actually in his office when you look out his window. I think the Congressman saw me sort of admiring the view, and he said, ``Well, don't get too excited. It is going to take you about 30 years to get a view like this.'' 
   The second thing that is often forgotten now that we are in the 110th Congress, when Congressman Regula was in charge of Interior, he was the cardinal on the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, there was a furious assault by very conservative Republicans elected in 1994 against the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Humanities and the Arts, and Congressman Regula was really put under the gun and told that, look, you have got to defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. No more NPR, no more National Endowment for the Arts, no more National Endowment For the Humanities. 
   Congressman Regula was true, RALPH was true to his Republican provisions, but I would dare say that there wouldn't be public funding for those entities today if RALPH REGULA hadn't stood up as a stalwart in 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998. So anybody listening this evening that enjoys Public Broadcasting and thinks that it has a place in our American experience, I think needs to thank Congressman Regula. 
   I will talk more about HOBSON and PRYCE in a minute, but it is my pleasure to yield to my friend from Columbus, Mr. Tiberi.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. I thank the gentlelady, the new dean of our delegation or soon to be dean of our delegation from the Democratic side for those reflections and thoughts. Before I yield to our next Ohioan, Jean Schmidt, from southern Ohio, I want to talk a little bit about Dave Hobson. 
   I think it's appropriate that Ms. Kaptur talked about she doesn't know what Representative Hobson is going to do. A lot of us have been getting phone calls from his wife, Caroline, saying please find something for him to do so that she doesn't have to spend so much time with him. 
   Most of us in the delegation call him Uncle Dave. 
   Again, going back to 1995, aside from all of the other things that Congressman Hobson had to do, Newt Gingrich was the Speaker at the time in the 104th Congress. He assigned Congressman Hobson to babysit John Kacich, who was the Budget Committee chairman at the time, just to make sure that Congressman Kacich, who has a tendency to be a little exuberant, controlled that exuberance. 
   This Congress, this historic Congress that has the first woman as Speaker of the House, Ms. Pelosi of California, who sort of ribbed Congressman Hobson about the fact that every time the Speaker of the House goes on a trip, she needs a Republican, obviously, for it to be bipartisan. For some reason it is always Congressman Hobson. 
   I think that it's appropriate that Ms. Kaptur talked about infrastructure. Because even though Dave is from Springfield, Ohio, and that's his district, down around the Dayton area and his loves are Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, so many things, he, like Ralph Regula when they were cardinals, took care of all of Ohio. 
   If you had a problem, if you had a concern, if you had a need, he didn't say I am going to take care of me first. He said I am going to take care of Ohio and the country first and many of the things that are being built. Just in my  district, the Ashtabula River and harbor, he helped to secure $53 million to help clean up contaminated sediments. That never would have happened without Congressman Hobson. 
   It's now my pleasure to yield to my good friend and colleague from Ohio, Jean Schmidt.

   Mr. LaTOURETTE. I thank the gentlelady very much. 
   Our next speaker is another Ohioan, who is new to us. Before I introduce him, as promised, I want to say a couple of things about Deborah Pryce. As a couple of us have indicated in this Congress, I indicated it was historic because Ms. Pelosi is the first Speaker of the House. Deborah Pryce became another ceiling breaker when she became the chairman of the Republican conference. 
   You may remember that it wasn't a good year, a couple of years, 2005, 2006, for the Republican party, but somebody who was always cheerful, who was always helping Members with whatever their difficulties were, whoever was crafting messages and making sure that as we left Washington to return to our districts we had the tools necessary to do our jobs and communicate what it is we are doing, Deborah Pryce, in fact, did that. I am particularly fond of her because her prior life, she served as a judge, and my prior life was as a prosecuting attorney. She always brought that skill. 
   We serve on the Financial Services Committee together and, in the crisis that this country is now facing today, with the crisis of confidence on Wall Street, and the work that we have to do, Deborah Pryce as ranking member is a leader. She will continue to be a leader as she, in fact, exits the Congress. 
   Jean Schmidt made the observations about the challenges of being a woman in the United States Congress. Aside from that, on a personal level, I think the time that Representative Pryce has served in the Congress have had incredibly high highs, and incredibly low lows. Through all of that, she has always performed her job as a professional, one, and, two, whenever possible, with a smile on her face. If you really want to see a smile on her face, the day that I remember her smile being the widest was the day she brought her daughter, Mia, to the Financial Services Committee. I think Mia actually voted a couple of times on some matters. 
   My only complaint about Representative Pryce is a couple of years ago there was a fundraiser that she and Representative Tiberi had for me down in Columbus, for which we are all grateful for when our friends help us. Pat got up and gave this really long-winded introduction and made me sound better than I was. Deborah stood up and said, well, Steve LaTourette is here, he is a little different, he is a little weird, but please welcome him. Even though her observations were correct, it wasn't the warmest introduction that I can recall receiving. 
   It's now my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to one of our new friends, Bob Latta from Ohio.

   Mr. LaTOURETTE. I thank the gentleman very much. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, we're going to hear from our three retiring Members in order of seniority. The first, as I indicated, is Ralph Regula, the dean of our delegation. I don't know what we're going to do without Ralph around here. 
   As he comes to the microphone, I will just tell you that, when I, again, was elected in 1994 and I thought I'm a lawyer and that I was a prosecutor and that I'd like to be on the Judiciary Committee, Ralph put his arm around me and said, ``Son, you're going to the transportation committee.'' It was the smartest decision I ever made because I saw that the Judiciary Committee had the impeachment of President Clinton and all of this nonsense. The transportation committee is a bipartisan committee, as the Speaker knows, and to build America is not a bad thing. 
   It is now my pleasure, as we begin the final 15 minutes allotted to us, to yield to the dean of our delegation, Ralph Regula.

   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Madam Speaker, I thank the Dean of our delegation. And after that set of remarks, you know why this will be a hole in our delegation and for the country that we're not going to be able to replace. 
   Our next retiring Member has been described in a lot of different ways already, but there isn't an energy and or a water project across the country that doesn't have Dave Hobson's imprint on it. Never his name, because that wasn't what he was about. He was about making sure that we had the best infrastructure in the country when it came to energy and water. 
   And Congressman Regula again spoke of the fact that Newt Gingrich put Uncle Dave in charge of watching John Kasich, and I reflected on why that was. And I think it's because Congressman Hobson never gets upset; he's always placid. He's always calm. He never raises his voice. And what better influence could we have in dealing with Chairman Kasich. 
   It's now my pleasure to yield to Congressman Hobson.

   And before we recognize our last retiring Member, we've been joined by another new member of the Ohio delegation. And I want to express my appreciation and apologize to Congressman Manzullo and the Illinois delegation. We were supposed to split this hour 50/50, so anybody tuning in at home and wondering where the Illini delegation celebration is, we're going to talk, use our last few minutes; and then in the next hour stay tuned because Congressman Manzullo and the Illini bunch will come marching out on to the field. 
   And just to Congressman Hobson, I don't know if Congresswoman Pryce wants the record to reflect that she played the entire Ohio State band. I think perhaps had played all the instruments in the Ohio State band would be a better way of turning it. 
   It's now my pleasure to yield 1 minute to one of our new Members, JIM JORDAN.

   Mr. LaTOURETTE. The last retiring Member we have from Ohio is certainly not least, and we've talked about her service on the Financial Services Committee. 
   Madam Speaker, when I joined the committee, I think we had six Ohioans on the committee, Stephanie Tubbs Jones, Paul Gillmor, who's passed, Bob Ney, who is not with us anymore, PAT TIBERI, he's now been promoted, Mike Oxley was the chairman, and Congresswoman Pryce who of course is, I think, the third or fourth ranking Republican on the committee. And now, with all these retirements and passings, I'm the only one going into the next Congress if I'm lucky enough to be re-elected.     
   And so I'm kind of sad that they all left me, but I will always cherish serving with them, and it is my pleasure to recognize the gentlelady, Ms. Pryce.

   Mr. LaTOURETTE. I think I have about 1 minute left, and I'm not going to insult Mr. Manzullo by giving him a minute to talk about his retiring. So he's come up with some parliamentary scheme to make it all work and honor Mr. LaHood and Mr. Weller, who are both classmates of mine, who are retiring. 
   But I think, Madam Speaker, from this last hour, which we didn't know it would take an hour, but we should have expected it would have taken an hour for each of our retirees, we are richer for having served with RALPH REGULA, DAVID HOBSON, and DEBORAH PRYCE; and we in the institution will be poorer with their retirement, but we will always remember the gifts that they have given us; and it shall be our challenge, both Republicans and Democrats as Members of the United States Congress, to stand on their shoulders and follow in the example that they've set for us. 
   I thank you, Madam Speaker.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, I speak on this motion with the greatest respect for the gentlelady from Tennessee. But I would say that in my prior life, before coming to the Congress I was a prosecuting attorney, and I was responsible for sending a lot of people to prison. 
   I also had a responsibility to go down and visit people that I'd sent to prison. And I remember the first visit that I made down to one of the prisons in Ohio, and there's these trustees outside the prison gates with white stripes on the side, and they were given trusted positions within the prison. 
   And I said, who are the trustees? How do you get to be qualified to be a trustee? And they said, well, they're murderers. And I said, what do you mean, they're murderers? They said, they're murderers. 
   What we find is that in the crime of murder, most murders in this country are committed in crimes of passion, a husband murders a wife, a wife murders a husband, a boyfriend and so forth and so on. But they are also the least likely people to ever commit crime again. 
   And what concerns me about the requirement of receding to the Senate provision in this is that it ignores the opportunity for rehabilitation. It ignores the opportunity that people  make mistakes, and they're not a threat to national security, and they can be good productive people. They can work in our ports. 
   And I am concerned that murder is one of the automatic disqualifiers. I am also concerned that the other list of crimes that have waiting periods of 5 to 7 years, they have nothing to do, in my mind, with terrorism or port security. 
   And I am all for a system where the Secretary or even in law the Congress of the United States says, you know what, if you committed a crime of violence we're going to take an extra look at you; but to be automatically disqualified, either forever or for a considerable period of time, I think disturbs me. 
   I intend to vote against the motion. I respect the gentlelady's opinion and why she's brought this motion, but sadly, I can't agree with it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. I want to thank the distinguished ranking member for yielding, and I want to thank the body for its indulgence as we wrap up this important debate. 
   I want to describe and discuss an amendment I was going to offer but did not and some of the reasons for it. Contained in this bill is a $2 million earmark for the Parker Hannifin Company of Cleveland, Ohio, for the hybrid drivetrain program. 
   I am not going to offer the amendment for three very important reasons. One is the earmark was requested by my good friend and neighbor, Congressman Tim Ryan; two, in doing research on the hybrid drivetrain program, it is a good one, and three, Parker Hannifin is a great company that I am going to talking about in a minute. 
   But my amendment would have redirected the $2 million from the hybrid drivetrain program to their plant in Eastlake. Parker Hannifin has announced their intention in the near future to close a plant in Eastlake, Ohio, and cause the loss of 177 jobs. 
   Most of the folks that work there have been working there for a number of years and are members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. But I want to talk a little bit about Parker Hannifin and why I am not offering the amendment and then have a request at the end. 
   Parker Hannifin Company was started in 1918 by a guy named Arthur Parker. Just to show you how some of our entrepreneurs have had tough experiences, in 1919 there was a truck accident that wiped out the entire inventory of the company, and he had to go back to another job. He started again; and at the height the Depression, he bought an auto plant in 1935 in the City of Cleveland, and then during the height of World War II, employed 5,000 people in Cleveland, Ohio, supplying the war effort. 
   The war ended. Mr. Parker died. Again, the defense contracts dried up. It looked like there wasn't going to be any progress for the company. His widow said no, and they continued to reinvest in northeastern Ohio and northeastern Ohio continued to reinvest in them and they rewarded them as well. Today, they are a $10 billion company employing 50,000 people worldwide. 
   My simple request is, I am not going to ask to redirect this money to the plant in Eastlake, Ohio, but as this bill moves forward, I would hope that we can continue to talk to the folks in Cleveland and Parker Hannifin, because if you think about this $2 million, some of those 177 machinists who potentially will lose their jobs paid into the Federal Treasury some of the money that comprises this $2 million that is going to the hybrid drivetrain project, and I hope that we are able to resolve this in a way that we not only have the new technology for fuel efficiency that comes from the hybrid drivetrain technology, but given northeastern Ohio's solid commitment to this company since 1918, that they take that into consideration as we move forward and they make tough decisions in this global economy as to whether or not these jobs remain in northeastern Ohio. 
   Again, I very much thank the ranking member and the chairman for their indulgence.

   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to rise in support today of the Senate amendment to H.R. 802, the Maritime Prevention Pollution Act of 2008. I want to give credit and pay tribute to the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Oberstar, and the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Cummings of Maryland, for their diligence in working this bill and working the will of the committee and today the will of the House. I join Mr. Oberstar in expressing my regret that the other body has not acted in as prompt a fashion, and therefore we may be too late with this legislation. Hopefully that isn't the case. 
   This type of legislation is exactly what our committee should be about. Those of us, as the current occupant of the chair who hails from the Great Lakes region, as does the chairman of the full committee, know the great work that has gone into the restoration of the Great Lakes over many, many years. I am reminded as I listened to the chairman talk about the action or inaction of the other body that Johnny Carson, before the restoration of Lake Erie in particular was in full swing, used to joke that Lake Erie was a place where fish went to die. I think it is appropriate to say that at this moment in time, the Senate, regardless of who is in charge, is a place where bills go to die. 
   This bill will implement international requirements to reduce air emissions from ships for purposes of U.S. law and will establish more stringent standards for the emissions of airborne pollutants from ships as well as the sulfur content of fuel oil used in United States waters. 
   As Members may remember, the House first passed this bill in March of 2007, again thanks to the splendid leadership of Chairman Oberstar and Chairman Cummings, with a broad bipartisan majority. Since that time, the bill has languished in the other body, to the point where we may well be prevented from voting on proposed amendments to the underlying convention at the next meeting of the International Maritime Organization. As a result, our abilities to push for strengthened measures have been significantly weakened. 
   Nonetheless, this is important legislation. I am pleased we will be sending it to the President as a first step to improve environmental conditions in our ports and along our coasts. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I know that it will come as a surprise to the Speaker that I spend just a couple of minutes talking about energy today, and I want to talk about it in the context of our committee. 
   I think the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Oberstar, can probably cite the statistic, but every year I have been here, and this is my 14th year in the United States Congress, the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I think under both Republican and Democratic leadership, has distinguished itself in the bipartisan and efficient way in which we craft our legislation and actually get something done, when the other body is willing and when the chief executive is willing to sign it. 
   I thought I heard before our July 4th recess Mr. Oberstar talk about the many numbers of bills that we have actually moved through the House, through the Senate, that have been signed into law, and it far exceeds a lot of the work that some of the other more contentious committees in this body, by their nature, no criticism intended, can compile, and I think it is in direct correlation to and as a direct result of the respect that we have for each other on both sides of the aisle on that committee, and now the stern but fair leadership of the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar). 
   That brings me to a frustration that I found and encountered over the Fourth of July recess. I was talking to Mr. Oberstar. I didn't quite have the adulation poured upon me at parades that he had in his district in Minnesota. There were some people that thought that $4.10 was a little bit much to be paying at the pump. 
   But the message that I got pretty loud and clear is that they want us to resolve it. When you pull into the gas station, there isn't a Republican pump and there isn't a Democratic pump and there isn't an independent pump, there is just gas that costs a lot of money today, and someone making $8 an hour in Ohio for a $320 per week gross paycheck is struggling, with $60, $70 filling up the tank to go to and from work. 
   There are a lot of opinions, and I will get into those in just a second, but I was reminded for the 12 years we were in the majority I happened to be supportive of something known as Davis-Bacon, which is the Federal prevailing wage law, and our committee is responsible for producing the Water Resources Development Act. 
   We were stymied for years in getting necessary water infrastructure projects out to our communities because of the sort of Davis-Bacon problem, and that is the then majority leader believed that if it came to a vote on an amendment, at that time by one of our colleagues who is not with us anymore, Mrs. Kelly of New York, that that issue would prevail, and much to the dismay of Members in the then majority party, who happened to be a majority of the majority but were a minority of the House, if that vote were permitted to have taken place. That was a frustrating thing, and, sadly, I think we find ourselves there again on this energy question. 
   There are Members in this House who advocate additional exploration and drilling in the United States, both on and offshore, in the West, in Alaska, off the east coast and the west coast. There are some who say no. There are some who advocate a replenishment and an increased investment in renewable, wind and solar. The gentleman from Minnesota is an expert on photovoltaic electricity, and certainly he has passed legislation that would be supportive of increased research and development of that type of energy generation. 
   There are those who believe like the French we should add nuclear power back into our portfolio. France, I believe, generates about 80 percent of its power through nuclear power. We haven't had a nuclear power program in this country for a number of years. There are those in this House that object to that and don't think that that is a good idea as well. 
   But the point is that I think that at $4, $4.10, $4.11, we have reached the price point where the American public, who has to get up and buy food, send their kids to school, pay their bills, pay their taxes and fill up their gas tanks, don't really want to hear why we disagree and what we can't agree on.     
   I think that they are looking for a solution. And there are a lot of people in both parties who are bellicose on this issue, and I don't intend to do that. But I think I would say that the time to have this national debate is now. We need to determine what direction the country is going to go in. And like most issues, the Democrats aren't 100 percent correct, the Republicans aren't 100 percent correct. But we are expected to be the leaders of the Nation and we are expected to come up with solutions. 
   So I would hope, not in the spirit of the old Water Resources Development Act where we were not permitted to have the House work its will, that the current leadership of the House would let the Members of the House work their will on what the energy policy of this country should be to give some relief to our citizens. 
   And since I am in a commending mood, Mr. Speaker, I would nominate the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar), the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, to be the designee of Speaker Pelosi to head up this effort and use the same bipartisan manner he uses on all other issues to get us out of this mess. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. LaTOURETTE. (MARITIME POLLUTION PREVENTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the reason that I nominated the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) as sort of the energy czar of the United States Congress is exactly the reasons that he indicated. If you look at the legislation that has effectively dealt in part with the difficulties we find ourselves in, the gentleman's transit legislation certainly gets people into mass transit and out of their automobiles and saves fuel. 
   The gentleman's Amtrak legislation is historic, and in the short run a robust Amtrak means good things for America in terms of jobs and moving people to and from work. I think I saw something on the news where they were tracking what has happened to people's behaviors since the price of gas has gone up, and I believe Amtrak has seen a 13 percent ridership increase since gas has increased, a testament to Amtrak, and also a testament to the gentleman's bill that made sure that Amtrak isn't operating hand to mouth as we move through this process. 
   Similarly, the gentleman's vision for intercity rail in this country is again something where we lag far behind our friends in Asia and Europe, and he has for the first time, at least since I have been here, put real money, $350 million a year for 5 years, into the notion of high-speed intercity rail connections principally in the Midwest of the United States. But all of us recognize that that piece at least is some years away in terms of it being a viable alternative and impacting the cost of gasoline. 
   So, again, I would make the suggestion that there are good ideas on both sides of this aisle. There are many gifted Members of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats. We should have a national debate. And, for the sake of the people that I represent and others represent, we should get something done and we should get them some relief today. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, I was talking to Mr. Rayfield and we were trying to remember whether it was General William Tecumseh Sherman who said: If asked, I will not run. If nominated, I will not serve. If elected, I will not serve. 
   I think that is what the gentleman from Minnesota said to my suggestion and I hope he in fact reconsiders that, because of all of the people in this body, he commands tremendous respect  on both sides of the aisle. He has demonstrated again and again not only as the ranking member in previous Congresses of our committee but now as the chairman that he can put together the best ideas of both sides, and not only move forward ideas that he firmly believes in but find consensus and actually get bills done and signed into law. So I hope the gentleman, unlike my fellow Ohioan, General Sherman, reconsiders. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. LaTOURETTE. (QUESTION OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. I thank Mr. Hastings for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am not happy to have the opportunity to speak today. The gentleman from Washington is my classmate. We were both elected in 1994. The distinguished chairwoman of the Ethics Committee I've known for 25 years. I served on the Ethics Committee for 4 years, had some of the same circumstances that Mr. Hulshof was previously talking about at the time. Mr. Hastings and Mrs. TUBBS JONES were also members of the Ethics Committee. 
   And there's a reason that we take that oath of secrecy, and it's why, unlike Mr. Hulshof, I voted ``no'' last night. My belief has always been that the ethics process here has worked when left to its own devices, and by ``left to its own devices,'' when leadership on either side stays out of it and permits five good Democrats and five good Republicans to consider what is sometimes a messy business. But it needs to be not aired in public as, sadly, this new whatever we did last night will do, because, and I used to be a prosecuting attorney, as did the chairwoman of the committee, there are many times when a case is brought to you and there are no facts to support that case, but you will be accused on page 1 and the case will be dismissed on page 45, and when you're in public life, by the time you get to the retraction on page 45, your career is ruined. 
   So every Member that embarks upon the ethics process takes the oath that we will hold close to us and not discuss with our colleagues, not discuss with the press, not discuss with others if we have a Member under investigation, if allegations are made against a Member, not to protect a Member, not to shield that Member from scrutiny, but so that we don't shoot the Member until there has been an adjudication that he or she has done something wrong. I took that oath. Every member of the committee takes that oath. We take that seriously. 
   Now, yesterday evening when I was preparing to make a determination as to how to vote, I received a memo from DOC HASTINGS, Representative Hastings, that had included in it the opinion of the nonpartisan, bipartisan professional staff of the Ethics Committee where they opined on how, if at all, what was being done last night would impact upon the ethics process of this House. I have to tell you that the memorandum wasn't written for Republicans. It wasn't written for Democrats. It was nonpartisan, bipartisan, and I found a lot in it that I thought that's an interesting point and I hadn't actually thought about it. I was grateful to receive that memorandum from DOC HASTINGS, not knowing how it came to my possession or attention other than DOC HASTINGS provided it. 
   I'm dismayed on this point of personal privilege, however, to then be in receipt of a letter written by my friend the chairwoman of the committee that, in my opinion, has a tortured construction of rule 7 of the committee. It correctly indicates that we take the oath of secrecy and matters should only be discussed in accordance with the rules of the House. Mr. Hulshof, I think, has adequately talked about 7(d), and what that indicates is that we're not supposed to talk about if Representative Y is under investigation until that matter moves to the public phase, that being the adjudicatory hearing, which we achieved against the gentleman from Ohio a number of years ago and which we were all involved in.     
   It does not, in my opinion, indicate that when a memorandum that might be instructive to the other Members of the House on a matter before the House should remain secret. And I would just say that we would then read paragraph 7(g) that indicates that, ``Unless otherwise determined by a vote of the committee, only the chairman or ranking minority member of the committee, after consultation with each other, may make public statements regarding matters before the committee of any subcommittee.'' 
   The gentleman from Washington says that is what he did. And if the gentleman from Washington did that, I find no violation of the committee rules. I find no violation of the House rules. And I think what is most unfortunate, and it really goes into why the matters before the Ethics Committee need to remain secret, the letter suggests, it doesn't suggest, it says that Representative Hastings has broken the rules of the House, and if he does it again, there is going to be a complaint. Well, if someone feels that way, then file a complaint. But it is entitled to the confidentiality which it is now indicated has somehow been broken. 
   And I want to indicate that besides my disappointment, that what is roiling this House, and I think those of us that are centrists, moderates, those of us that are institutionalists, we now are roiled in the House because the rules don't seem to be the rules. The rules apply when people think they should apply. And if the rules don't apply, well, then we will make a new rule. 
   And last night's example, and it ties in directly to this point of personal privilege, couldn't be any clearer. The new majority, because of the Medicare part D vote that Representative Hulshof talked about that we wrongly held open for 3 hours to achieve a certain result, in outrage in response to the culture of corruption that permeated this place until 2007, led to a rule change. And the rule change was that we will hold no vote open in this House for the sole purpose of affecting the outcome or changing the outcome. 
   Well, that is just what we did last night, sadly, Mr. Speaker. For 12 minutes, 12 minutes after the final vote was cast, the vote was held open. It was 204-209. And during those 12 minutes, four Members of the majority party were persuaded to switch their votes. There is no other explanation. But where we find ourselves, and why this point of personal privilege is so important, where we find ourselves is that the rule is written in such a way that says you can't hold the vote open for the sole purpose of affecting or changing the outcome. 
   Now, we are going to have to bring in Kreskin. We are going to have to have ESP to climb into the mind of the presiding officer. And unless the presiding officer says, do you know what, I know what the rule is, I know what clause 9 of rule XX says, but I kept the vote open to affect the outcome. Short of that, there is no way to enforce the rule. And it puts us in a very difficult place. And I would ask my friends that are today in the majority to remember the 12 years that they were in the minority that they felt so oppressed, and in many cases had the right to feel oppressed, by some of the heavy-handed tactics that were employed on the conduct of this floor. 
   When you have a rule that can never be enforced, when you have rules that you don't pay attention to, it leads to discontent. It destroys the fabric of the institution. The minority serves an important purpose in the House of Representatives. It is the loyal dissent. It is to make sure that the majority just can't run roughshod and do what they choose to do in violation of rules, practices, precedents and procedures. 
   I fear, Mr. Speaker, that last night the rules were once again broken. I believe that the totality of the circumstances will demonstrate that. But what I do not find is that my friend and classmate from the State of Washington violated rule 7 of the Ethics Committee.

<DOCNO>Mr. LaTOURETTE. (EXPRESSING SYMPATHY FOR VICTIMS OF OCTOBER 28, 2007, FIRE IN OCEAN ISLE BEACH, NORTH CAROLINA -- (House of Representatives - November 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, this past weekend, more than 600 people gathered at Federated Church in Chagrin Falls OH, to mourn the loss of Allison Walden, 19, a 2006 graduate of Chagrin Falls High School and the daughter of Terry and Diane Walden of Chagrin Falls. 
   Allison was one of seven students to die in the tragic beach house fire in North Carolina. 
   Her father, Terry, said she was a wonderful girl and full of life. She had a scholarship to University of South Carolina, where she was a sophomore studymg pre-med and a member of the Delta Delta Delta sorority. She had planned to return to her beloved Chagrin Falls after graduation and study anesthesiology at Case Western Reserve University. 
   This senseless fire that took the lives of seven wonderful young people capped a very difficult year for the Walden family. 
   Their son, Greg, a 2005 Chagrin Falls graduate, is a student at Virginia Tech and was there in April when a deranged student shot up the campus, killing 33 people Fortunately, Greg, an honors engineering student, was unharmed in that horrific attack. I can't imagine as a parent going through that, and then losing your only daughter just five months later in another tragedy. It is just unspeakably cruel. 
   As their father said, ``What is the chance that out of all the schools in the country that our children would go where tragic events unfold?'' 
   On behalf of the 14th Congressional District, my sympathies go to the Walden family on their horrible loss, and may they find comfort in their family, friends, faith and community.

<DOCNO>Mr. LaTOURETTE. (QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. I thank the leader for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have to say, this is a very sad debate. I was one of the members of the Ethics Committee that was not reappointed that was referenced to in the distinguished majority leader's presentation. I will tell you this; before coming to Congress I was a prosecuting attorney in my hometown. 
   I served on the Ethics Committee for 4 1/2 years. I found the Ethics Committee to be a place where five Members of each party came together and treated the rules fairly, treated the Members fairly, and treated the rules of this House more than fairly. 
   I sat through and listened to only the second time since the American Civil War that a Member of this House was expelled, my friend, James Traficant of Ohio, but the evidence warranted it. 
   These competing resolutions, in my opinion, continuing the dumbing down of the House. Now, I don't know whether Representative Jefferson is guilty or not guilty of the things that he has been indicted for by the Justice Department. But even Members of Congress, ladies and gentlemen, are entitled to a presumption. And there was a reason that in the Traficant case the Ethics Committee waited until the judicial process worked its will, and that is two things; one, you've got to find out whether the person is guilty or not guilty of what they are accused of. Two, when you have competing investigations, you can actually impede the prosecution of someone who has committed a crime with the Department of Justice. 
   Your side started this ``culture of corruption'' last year; we're going to start the ``House of hypocrisy'' this year. Stop dumbing down the institution. 
   Members of Congress are human beings. When they are charged with a crime, they should get the full weight of the law. If they are guilty, they should suffer the penalty not only of going to prison or jail, but they should be expelled from the House. But to rush to judgment and to permit the United States Department of Justice or some rogue district attorney, like I happen to believe in Tom DeLay's case, I know you guys aren't big fans of Tom DeLay, but you are sending a message that a common prosecutor in my district, your district, your district, your district can indict you tomorrow, and on the basis of that you are removed from your leadership position, you are removed from your committees, and you may not have done a darn thing. 
   I think this is a sad day for this House. And I know that I am going to be in the minority tonight, I'm actually in the minority, so it will be a double minority, but I intend to vote against both of these resolutions. I am sorry we've come to this. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment that I have offered with Mr. Miller of North Carolina be modified and amended, and I will describe that--but then I know the Clerk has to report it--just by adding 2 words, on line 7, after the word ``foreclosure'' adding the word ``process,'' and on the next line, after the words ``foreclosed property,'' add the word ``maintenance.''

<DOCNO>Mr. LaTOURETTE. (FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. If the gentleman would yield to me on his reservation, I would make this observation to the gentleman and to the House. This amendment that Mr. Miller and I crafted, obviously, one of the things that vexes, and it doesn't matter whether it's financial services or anything else, one of the things that continues to vex and cause tension between the Federal Government and the States is this whole issue of preemption. 
   So when Mr. Miller came to me with the original amendment, we began to hear some concerns. And quite frankly, the concerns were are you opening the door to a Maryland-type situation, where they can pass a State law that says that nobody can foreclose on property for 5 years, 10 years, 15 years. And clearly, although I happen to think that that kind of abrogation of property rights is an unconstitutional exercise of legislative authority, I understood the concerns. 
   And so I will tell the gentleman on his reservation that we sought the advice of the OCC and the OTS and received a list of things that are already preempted. And as I think the gentleman has accurately stated, the manner, the process in which foreclosures have happened have always been the purview of the States. And then the boarding up of properties or the maintenance of properties that are foreclosed.  
   And so it is my attempt through this unanimous consent request, I think, from all Members, and I think Members on both sides of the aisle have some concerns about this. This wasn't limited to Republican Members. There were some Democratic members that had concerns as well. The OCC has indicated to us that this answers that concern. It doesn't deprive them of their authority under the National Bank Act. Some of the banking institutions that were originally concerned about the amendment have indicated the that this is language that they can live with. 
   And just as a Republican Member of the House, I would say to the gentleman from Georgia, under his reservation, that this is typically the point in our debates where our distinguished chairman of the Financial Services Committee skewers us as Republicans for being for States' rights on some days and being against States' rights on other days. It was my goal to make sure that States' rights were preserved on those things that they've always had the opportunity to regulate, and not impinge upon those, but also recognizing that not all the best ideas in terms of how to proceed on process or maintenance necessarily emanate from this Chamber. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding on his reservation.

<DOCNO>Mr. LaTOURETTE. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--Continued -- (House of Representatives - June 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. First of all, Mr. Chairman, I want to compliment you on the way you have conducted this debate. In happier times I had the privilege of being where you are, and I have to tell you, you have done a tremendous job and I appreciate it very much. 
   I am pleased to offer this amendment with my friend, a colleague from Cleveland, Ohio, Congressman Kucinich. 
   This amendment basically recognizes what I think that every Member of this House should recognize: that the implementation of the passport travel requirements in the Western Hemisphere has been a disaster. The State Department and Department of Homeland Security made an estimate, and they have been swamped. My constituents call me on a regular basis saying that they have applied for passports 12, 14, 20 weeks. They don't have their passports. Their trips are canceled. And this is a bad thing. 
   You would think in the face of that track record that perhaps we wouldn't go to phase 2. Phase 2 says that we need to have documents as we cross the border by land into Canada. Where Congressman Kucinich and I are from, we go through Detroit or Buffalo and the southern border as well. But that hasn't been the case. 
   On Friday the two agencies announced, reluctantly, that, you know what? We have got it wrong, and as a result we are not going to require passports for air travel to the Caribbean or to Canada anymore, and that a photo ID will be sufficient. However, even with this chaos, the administration has vowed that it will move forward with phase 2 on January 1. 
   Now, I want to commend the chairman of the Rules Committee, Congresswoman Slaughter, for the work that she has done to put in this bill triggers that say maybe we don't have it right. Let's do some pilot programs and things of that nature. But those provisions were put in this bill before this disaster happened. And I don't assume that I am the only Member of this body that has received angry phone calls from their constituents and say, you know what? Maybe, maybe, we just need to slow it down. 
   So this is a complete prohibition. It says to the Department of Homeland Security in this bill, and we will do it again in the State Department bill, saying we gave you until June of 2009 to get this right, to come up with the Pass card, to come up with whatever you are going to come up. But please, please, don't do this to our constituents on January 1, 2008. 
   Mr. Chairman, at this time it is my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to my good friend and colleague from Cleveland, Ohio, Congressman Kucinich.

<DOCNO>Mr. LaTOURETTE. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank my friend and classmate, Mr. Jones of North Carolina, for yielding me the time, and also for his leadership on this issue, and had the President followed his very respectful letter of January 10, we would not be having this debate on this resolution drafted by the Democratic leadership. 
   Mr. Speaker, like most Americans, I desperately want us to succeed in Iraq, and I was heartened by the Iraq Study Group report, and I was heartened when the President of the United States said we were going to take a fresh approach in Iraq. I fear, however, that this is not a fresh approach, that this is more of the same. I also fear that our course of ``more of the same'' could lead to the deaths of more Americans. 
   I know that the President believes in his heart that the surge will succeed. I like and respect the President of the United States, but we tried last year a surge of about 12,000 troops in Operation Together Forward. The result has been an escalation of sectarian violence and attacks on our troops that has been unprecedented and unrelenting. 
   If I thought that the presence of 21,500 additional American troops in Iraq would quell sectarian violence and stop the killing and aggression towards Americans in Iraq, I would support it. If I thought that the presence of 21,500 new American troops would cause the Maliki government to get their house in order and their country in order and make the Iraqis step up and do their duty to protect their country, I would support it. 
   Instead, we find ourselves with an Iraqi security force that has more time in training than the young people that we are sending from our country to defend theirs, yet they cannot get the job done. It is time to ratchet up diplomacy, make the Iraqis accountable for their own security, and kick off the training wheels that we have tethered them to. 
   Even the Pentagon has warned that an escalation of troops in Baghdad could fuel the jihadists, cause an uptick in attacks and embolden al Qaeda even more. What shakes me to the core, however, is that we plan to send these additional troops into harm's way without adequate equipment and vehicles. General Speakes, the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff for Force Development, recently laid out a bleak scenario, a surge without enough armor kits and without enough up-armored trucks. 
   Others within the military add there won't be enough up-armored Humvees, which even as fortified as they are offer no match for the destruction and the power of the IEDs that are used against our troops. One senior Army official speculated that the only way, the only way, there will be enough Humvees for this surge is if five brigades of up-armored Humvees fall out of the sky. 
   This prognostication takes me back to what I thought was one of the most insensitive remarks uttered by a public official during the course of this war, the former Secretary of Defense in 2004, who indicated you go to war with the Army you have, not the Army you want. 
   Mr. Speaker, I can't believe that 26 months later we are going into a surge with what we have got instead of what we need. It is not fair to the men and women already in Iraq, nor those on the way, and the costs are too high, both in American lives and also the toll on the American spirit. Make no mistake, like all Americans I support our troops and am eternally grateful for their courage and their sacrifice, and I hope and I pray that we succeed in Iraq. 
   Some of the troops that will be part of the surge are already in Iraq. I wish our President had chosen a different path, but he did not. I wish my Democratic colleagues had chosen a different approach and allowed my party to offer alternative language, but they did not. It is what it is, but that does not change my resolve that this surge is not in the best interests of this Nation. 
   May God bless our country, our troops in the field, and the President of the United States.

   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Madam Speaker, H.R. 2722, the Integrated Deepwater Program Reform Act, makes significant changes to the Coast Guard's Deepwater program and will reform the way that the Coast Guard oversees, manages, and carries out the program as the service takes on the lead systems integrator responsibilities. 
   I want to add my thanks on the floor tonight and appreciate the cooperation of Chairman Oberstar and Chairman Cummings to consider both at the subcommittee and during the full committee markup amendments from our side of the aisle to improve the bill through the markup process. The bill that we are considering today is the product of several oversight hearings and has been developed under the regular order in both the subcommittee and full committee markups. I want to thank both chairmen for their efforts to develop this bill in a truly bipartisan manner  
   Madam Speaker, I appreciate the cooperation of Chairman OBERSTAR and Chairman CUMMINGS to consider amendments from my side of the aisle to improve this bill through the markup process. The bill that we are considering today is the product of several oversight hearings and has been developed under the regular order in both Subcommittee and Full Committee markups. I thank both Chairmen for their efforts to develop this bill in a bipartisan manner. 
   Our Subcommittee has held four hearings to oversee the Deepwater program over the past six months, and we have delved into the problems that have troubled this critical acquisition program. This bill addresses many of the areas that were identified through our oversight process. This bill will provide the Coast Guard with the framework to turn the program around and to support the successful acquisition of enhanced vessels, aircraft, and systems necessary to carry out the service's many missions. 
   However, I do want to point out that despite problems with some Deepwater program--most notably the failed 110 to 123 conversion, the program has had successes. Most importantly, the improved communications between shore, sea and air assets have already led to improved operations. 
   I also want to note that not all of the program's problems result from contracting issues. The program has never been funded at the level the Coast Guard determined it needed to carry out the program in the timeframe it described. Unfortunately, it appears those funding shortfalls will only get worse in the coming fiscal year. In fiscal year 2007, $1.1 billion was appropriated to carry out the Deepwater program. For fiscal year 2008, the Administration sought $837 million for the program, the House has provided $698 million, and the Senate has approved an amount of $770 million. At those levels, acquisitions of new ships and aircraft will be further delayed, meaning that ready-to-be-retired legacy ships and planes will be kept in service longer. Those assets will, in turn, incur higher maintenance costs further reducing the funds available to acquire new assets. 
   The bill before us today improves the organization and administration of Deepwater and seeks answers to questions about the implementation of the program. However, if Congress and the Administration continue to fail to seek and provide funds at the level planned for, then Deepwater has no chance of meeting its targets and goals. 
   While this bill will not solve the problems that result from funding shortfalls for the Deepwater program, the bill will give the Coast Guard adequate time to build its in-house staff and capabilities to the level necessary to successfully assume the lead systems integrator role and to put in place arrangements to acquire additional personnel and expertise from the private sector and other Federal agencies. This is a necessary programmatic change. 
   I support this bill and urge all Members to approve H.R. 2722.

   H.R. 735 designates a Federal building under construction at 799 First Avenue, New York, New York, as the Ronald H. Brown United States Mission to the United Nations Building. Ron Brown was born in Washington D.C., grew up in New York City, and had a distinguished career and exemplary life. This is a good piece of legislation  
   Ron Brown was born in Washington, DC and grew up in New York city. After attending Middlebury College, he commanded several units in the United States Army and served with distinction. Following his service in the Army, Ron Brown attended St. John's Law School. 
   After finishing law school, Ron Brown began a career as a lawyer and a lobbyist. He served as chief counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee under the chairmanship of Senator TED KENNEDY. In addition, he chaired the Senior Advisory Committee of the Institute of Politics at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University and was an elected member of the Council on Foreign Relations. 
   Ron Brown's career culminated in his appointment as Secretary of Commerce by President Bill Clinton. Tragically, his life ended abruptly while on a trade mission to Croatia in 1996. Secretary Brown was an accomplished politician and diplomat. 
   I would like to note that after the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure marked up this bill, the State Department raised concerns about setting the precedent of naming a U.S. Embassy. I hope the chairman could work with the State Department to resolve this issue before this bill is signed into law.

<DOCNO>Mr. LaTOURETTE. (RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY YEAR OF THE FOUNDING OF THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Madam Speaker, House Resolution 822 recognizes the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Port of Los Angeles. The Port of Los Angeles is the busiest port in the United States in terms of maritime cargo volume and, when combined with the adjoining Port of Long Beach, is the fifth busiest commercial seaport worldwide. This trade is a critical component to our national economy and directly and indirectly supports millions of jobs nationwide. 
   The port has also taken action to lessen impacts on the surrounding areas and the environment by recently implementing a comprehensive strategy to reduce emissions from ships and port operations. 
   I join the resolution's sponsor, Congresswoman Richardson of California, and all of the cosponsors in recognizing the Port of Los Angeles' first 100 years and in wishing the port continued success in the future. I urge all Members to support the resolution.

   Mr. LaTOURETTE. I want to thank the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Oberstar, and the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Costello, together with the ranking member of the full committee and subcommittee for working with me on this amendment. 
   The chairman of the full committee is fond of saying that the civil aviation system in the United States is the safest in the world because under his leadership, and with the work of others, we have built in an amazing amount of redundancy. Redundancy not only deals with the equipment that flies in the air, the air traffic control system; but it also relies upon the fact that you need to have sufficient capacity should there be a disaster, or weather, or other things. 
   As a result of this amendment, if this amendment is agreed to, we will make sure that northeastern Ohio continues to have sufficient capacity in its civil aviation system. 
   I urge the passage of the amendment and would be happy to yield to the chairman of the full committee.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Cummings from Maryland, for bringing this important measure to the floor in such a bipartisan way. I enjoy continuing to work with the chairman on a variety of matters that affect the Coast Guard and our Nation's maritime industry. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 549, which recognizes the importance of America's Waterway Watch program in enhancing our Nation's maritime security. America's Waterway Watch was established by the Coast Guard to encourage America's 70 million recreational boaters to report suspicious activity in the maritime environment to local law enforcement agencies. The program is a nationwide initiative that is similar to the Neighborhood Watch program that is so effective in many of our neighborhoods back home. 
   Through America's Waterway Watch program, the Coast Guard, the Coast Guard Reserve, and the Coast Guard Auxiliary are actively educating the public on actions and behavior that constitute suspicious activities. These outreach efforts are being made in cooperation with our Nation's recreational boaters, marine dealers, marinas, and other businesses located near waterways. America's Waterway Watch program acts as an important force multiplier for Coast Guard and local law enforcement and enhances the capabilities of local and regional security programs. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the resolution's sponsor, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), and all of the other cosponsors for rightly recognizing this important community program. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of the Members of the House to support this resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. I thank the gentlelady for yielding me time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 496, the reauthorization of the Appalachian Regional Commission. While we would have enjoyed having the House bill on the floor, we appreciate very much having the Senate bill. I want to express my thanks during the first part of my remarks to the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Oberstar of Minnesota, for really making sure that this happened. I had the pleasure of being the chairman of this subcommittee in a couple of previous Congresses ago, and this is a difficult bill to navigate through the House and the Senate. 
   And the fact that we're here today is a tribute to the leadership of the gentleman from Minnesota. I also thank the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Mica of Florida. And I want to thank a colleague of mine from Ohio, because in this bill we have added three counties in Ohio to the 29 counties in Ohio already located within the ARC. And the last county was Columbiana County added in 1990. We now are adding in this bill Ashtabula, Trumbull and Mahoning Counties. 
   And the fact that they're in the bill is not only a credit to Mr. Oberstar, Mr. Mica and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, but also to Mr. TIM RYAN, the Congressman from Youngstown, who shares at least two of those counties with me. And we saw the vital need to have them included in the ARC. And we're very grateful. 
   On the Senate side we are grateful to Senator Voinovich for making sure these counties, despite the fact that we have been at this 5 years, and every year we get the counties added in the bill, and then it goes over to the Senate and somebody has a goofy idea over there and they drop out. This year I'm grateful that Senator Voinovich and our colleagues in the House have maintained these three counties in the bill. And just the way when my friend and colleague from Ohio (Mr. Space) was speaking, we recognize the value of John Kennedy's vision when he dispatched folks to look at the conditions in Appalachia. And we've really moved light years from that. 
   The ARC is a template for economic development in all of those regions. And we just want to be part of it. If you look at a map of the State of Ohio, the only sort of areas of white, and white being where there is no Regional Development Commission, Federal Commission, are the three counties that are being added today.     
   Just one example, Kinsman, Ohio, the home of Clarence Darrow, the famous orator and attorney, is looking at a major sewer project. We are working with the United States Department of Agriculture, but by being in the ARC, they will get extra points, extra opportunities to make that a reality. So when you are dealing with 300 landowners and a price tag of $20 million, the assessment isn't astronomical in terms of $70,000 or $80,000 just to hook up the water and sewer. 
   So we are excited about this opportunity and very grateful that this bill has come to the floor in a way that adds these counties. 
   I would say to Mr. Space that we are all suffering, rural America, suburban America, exurban America. I don't like to trumpet in a partisan fashion on the floor, but I will tell you the folks in my part of Ohio want us to do something. They have said enough arguing. You have a lot of brainy ideas in Washington, DC. It is time to stop favoring one group over the other. Let's bring it all together and let's talk about oil, let's talk about coal, let's talk about nuclear, let's talk about renewables, but get it done so I can put gas in my gas tank.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Oberstar, for moving this legislation so expeditiously to the floor. H.R. 342 was introduced by our colleague, Representative JO ANN EMERSON of Missouri, and it designates the United States courthouse located in Cape Girardeau, Missouri as the Rush H. Limbaugh, Sr., United States Courthouse. 
   I also want to commend Mrs. Emerson's commitment to this legislation. She recognized Rush Limbaugh, Sr.'s tremendous record of public service and has provided a fitting tribute for one of the most remarkable figures in Missouri history. 
   This bill honors Rush Limbaugh, Sr., a remarkable lawyer whose awards and accomplishments over a legal career that spanned eight decades are too numerous to count. 
   Mr. Limbaugh was born in 1891. He attended school at a one-room schoolhouse and excelled academically from the start. He attended the University of Missouri at Columbia and the University of Missouri School of Law, paying his way through school by doing carpentry work, working on a farm, waiting tables and firing furnaces. 
   After passing the bar in 1916, he was admitted into the practice of law in Missouri and immediately opened a law office in Cape Girardeau. 
   Limbaugh was known for being extremely hardworking and ethical; he was also known for his fiery advocacy and ability to craft creative solutions. 
   President Reagan once remarked that Limbaugh, Sr.'s contributions read like a virtual who's who of accomplishment. His resume accurately depicts the image of an extraordinary man, superb lawyer and model citizen. 
   During his career, he tried more than 60 cases before the Supreme Court of Missouri and acted as city attorney and general counsel of Cape Girardeau. He was also a member of the advisory committee for the drafting of the Probate Code of Missouri, president of the Missouri Bar, and president of the State Historical Society. In his free time, he also taught Sunday school and served as a Boy Scout leader. 
   Limbaugh, Sr. rose to national prominence when he served as a representative of the United States on a 6-week lecture tour to the newly independent India on constitutional government and the United States judicial system.  
   Limbaugh, Sr. called Cape Girardeau home. It is only fitting that we name the new United States courthouse in his honor and recognize his accomplishments and dedication to his community. 
   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation and encourage my colleagues to do the same. 
   I would indicate to my good friend, the chairman of the full committee, that I have no additional speakers. If he is prepared to yield back, I would yield back my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. LaTOURETTE. (DIRECTING ADMINISTRATOR OF GENERAL SERVICES TO INSTALL A PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEM FOR THE HEADQUARTERS BUILDING OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate, again, the chairman of our full committee, Mr. Oberstar, for not only being the author of this legislation, but for bringing it to the floor in such an expeditious manner. 
   H.R. 798, introduced by Chairman Oberstar, directs the administrator of GSA to install a photovoltaic system at the headquarters building for the Department of Energy and authorizes appropriations to carry out the project. I know, when the chairman speaks of his passion, of what he speaks; and I know he has been committed for over 30 years to adding a solar energy component to the DOE headquarters building. 
   The photovoltaic system authorized by this bill to be installed at the Department of Energy building was chosen through a competitive process. In 1999 the U.S. Department of Energy National Renewable Energy Laboratory, in cooperation with the American Institute of Architects and the Architectural Engineering Institute, sponsored a design competition to select the winning sun wall design for the south wall of the new headquarters for the Department of Energy. The winning design, called the Solarnet, was selected from 151 entries. The winning design, as the chairman has mentioned, is 300 feet long, 130 feet high and incorporates 24,750 square feet of power generating panels. The DOE building was designed and constructed to include a solar energy system on the south wall, which was never constructed. Currently, the south wall is just a big expanse of concrete. H.R. 798 will complete what was left unfinished. 
   This project was previously authorized in the 109th Congress. Similar language directing the administrator of GSA to install a photovoltaic system for the headquarters building was incorporated into the energy policy act of 2005. 
   Mr. Speaker, one of the first things you learn as a new Member of the Congress, and I believe the current occupant of the chair is a new Member of Congress, is that some of our colleagues know a little bit about a lot. Some know a lot about a little. 
   When you join the Transportation Committee, what you know about our chairman is he knows a lot about a lot. And it is not a surprise, nor is it ever a surprise when I go to a markup or a hearing and hear Chairman Oberstar talk about the history of steel or the history of transportation, or the transcontinental railroad. One of my favorites is always his focusing on 1956 and the opening of the Wellend Canal and what that meant to those of us in the Great Lakes. 
   But what I didn't know until I had the pleasure of chairing this subcommittee two or three Congresses ago was that he was such an expert on photovoltaic electricity. And one of the most pleasant hearings that I can recall having in that subcommittee was a hearing on this subject matter and listening to the gentleman from Minnesota expound on his 30-year quest. 
   And what I came away with from that hearing, and again being the beneficiary of his great knowledge, was the fact that if we had made the investment that the gentleman is talking about in this bill today 30 years ago, we would be talking about comparable rates of electricity generation. We wouldn't be talking about 25 cents a kilowatt hour. Perhaps we would be down in the 3 to 7 cent range, and the opportunity that has been wasted by not, in fact, making that investment back when the gentleman first came forward with Senator Humphrey to make this a reality. 
   And so I hope that this becomes the first of many pieces of legislation that the gentleman offers. And I will tell him that I will be supportive, not only of his present endeavor, but his future endeavors as well. 
   Again, I congratulate the gentleman for his 30-year pursuit of this goal, and I urge all of our colleagues to be supportive. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, if I could just yield myself a moment to close before yielding back my time. 
   When the chairman was talking about Arkansas, I too had the pleasure of being in Arkansas, I think, before Mr. Boozman was elected to the Congress, when one of the Hutchinsons was in that seat, and I had the pleasure of meeting John Paul Hammerschmidt, whom I know that the gentleman knows and was fond of working with for so many years. Just to show how we all come from different places, I noticed that all the wildlife in Arkansas was nervous when we were down there, particularly the raccoons. And another one of our colleagues, MARION BERRY, was with us on that trip for the opening of a new airport, and he indicated that his largest fundraiser was a raccoon roast. And I had not experienced that until he I had gone down to the gentleman's district as well. 
   I urge passage of the bill, and I thank the gentleman very much. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. LaTOURETTE. (RAIL AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. I thank the chairman, and I thank Ranking Member Mica for yielding me the time. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to commend the chairman and ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee for bringing this important legislation to the floor. As Mr. Shuster indicated, there are some good provisions in the bill that will improve our Nation's rail network and the flow of freight and passengers using that. However, there is something very troubling in the manager's amendment which will be discussed soon. 
   Without careful consideration, there is a provision in the manager's amendment that could be detrimental to anybody who wants to ship anything on rail in this country or any passenger who wants to ride on Amtrak. 
   Unfortunately, section 3 of the manager's amendment is crippling to the bill. This section will undermine the efforts of the U.S. Department of Transportation and FRA's efforts to create a sound national safety policy. As Mr. Shuster indicated, for decades the preeminent jurisdiction has been maintained by DOT. Section 3 destroys that Federal preemption. 
   Under current law, States can enact safety laws as long as they address the unique local safety hazard. The amendment before us will change that and will allow States to effectively override Federal policies. With this amendment, the railroads could have 50 different sets of local laws to follow, and Federal law would no longer provide the blanket policy for the carriers to follow. 
   A few of the things that we look at on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is how DOT and FRA are doing with the implementation of our laws and regulations relating to the safety and security of the Nation's railroad. In addition, as a committee we also look into issues such as capacity on railroad network, and how efficiently and effectively the network is working for the freight passengers using the network. 
   Because this provision has been inserted into the manager's amendment without the benefit of bipartisan testimony and hearings, the catastrophic consequences of such provision have not been debated or considered, in my opinion, in regular order. I call for regular order today, Mr. Chairman. I know that the chairman of our full committee and the ranking member of our full committee are thoughtful Members, deliberative when it comes to our Nation's transportation laws. This provision severely cripples the good work of our committee, in my opinion, the good work of DOT, and FRA. We should not make radical changes to the law without careful bipartisan consideration. The consequences that has not occurred. 
   I would indicate that Chairwoman Brown has had a hearing. And I know the gentleman from North Dakota is preparing to speak on the horrible events that occurred in Minot, North Dakota. We also had the benefit of what used to be the American Trial Lawyers Association. I think in the greatest PR stunt in the universe they are now the American Association for Justice; they are no longer the Trial Lawyers. 
   I think that the gentleman's concern can be addressed without throwing out the Federal preemption, and I am saddened that the manager's amendment does that, and I hope my colleagues will oppose the manager's amendment because of section 3.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. I want to thank Mr. King for yielding. 
   I listened very carefully to the colloquy between someone I have the greatest respect for in the entire Congress, Chairman Oberstar, and the gentleman from North Dakota. We had the gentleman from North Dakota and some of his constituents and people from the American Association for Justice before the committee. 
   I happen to believe that anybody who is injured as a result of fault by another person should have his or her day in court and should be compensated when that is required. But the problem we have with section 3, section 3 undoes decades of Federal preemption when safety matters are concerned on the Nation's railroads, and the situation that we are going to find ourselves in is the one that Mr. Shuster described: States will be free to pass 50 different sets of safety regulations, and trains are going to have to stop at the border and comply with this, that or the other thing. 
   If section 3 simply said what happened in Minot, North Dakota, is horrible and those people should have their day in court to have the ability to seek compensation, I would be the first one to support it. 
   I am afraid, however, and with as much respect as I have for the chairman of the committee, Mr. Oberstar, when the title of the document, section 3, is ``No Preemption of State Law'' it is going to have an unintended consequence. It is going to undo the fabric of our Nation's rail system. I think for that reason alone, notwithstanding whatever Mr. Mica had to say, for that reason alone, we should have come together in a bipartisan way, recognizing the strengthens of both the Homeland Security and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and gotten this right. 
   This, in my opinion, is a ham-handed approach that should be defeated.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. To the distinguished chairman of our full committee, I just want you to know how well your staff is taking care of you today. As we were calling up the bill, knowing you were traveling back, I didn't know you were coming from Appalachia, but Mr. McCarragher came over and said, ``Could you talk as long as possible so we can get the chairman back here?'' And now I don't have to do that, so I don't think I will need the full 5 minutes. 
   I do want to remark on the ARC, Madam Speaker. No one can stand up and say that the vision of John F. Kennedy implemented by legislation in 1965 by Lyndon Johnson has not been a wonderful success in dealing with the abject poverty of the Appalachian region. 
   The chairman rightly talked about the infrastructure part of our committee's assignments. But one of my favorite hearings, when I had the pleasure of being the chairman of the subcommittee, is when the ARC stakeholders would come in and talk to the Republicans and Democrats on the subcommittee. And aside from industrial parks, aside from roads, aside from bridges, aside from safe drinking water, they beamed with pride about how their graduation rates had improved and how the young people in their region were now taking pride in the education they were receiving, and they were graduating from high school at record numbers, something that would not have happened had it not been for the ARC. 
   I came to the floor this afternoon to specifically thank the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Oberstar, and also the chairman of the subcommittee, Ms. HOLMES NORTON, together with Mr. Graves and Mr. Mica. One of John F. Kennedy's most oft quoted quotes is: ``A rising tide lifts all boats.'' And so Congressman TIM RYAN and I looked around and we saw, boy, everybody around us, to the east, to the south, to the west, seems to have participated wonderfully well in the Appalachian Regional Commission. And if you put a map of the Midwestern United States up, there's only a few little white squares, and they are regions that Congressman Ryan and I represent, Ashtabula, Trumbull and Mahoning County. We had a discussion with Chairman Oberstar during the course of the markup of this legislation, and it seems that Congressman Ryan and I weren't the only ones interested in this. And as a result of those discussions, Chairman Oberstar has added 13 additional counties to the purview of the Appalachian Regional Commission. 
   So I came down today, Madam Speaker, to thank the chairman for working with us. And I firmly believe that the addition of these three counties in Ohio, together with the 10 counties located throughout the region, are going to permit our people in transitional counties to benefit the same way as other counties have benefited since 1965.

   Mr. Chairman, it's my understanding that it is current practice for seamen on passenger vessels to be paid in cash. Section 405 authorizes the deposit of their pay into certain approved accounts. The section also requires that those funds be available for withdrawal. I understand that, as a practical matter, many seamen want to make sure that they can make those withdrawals in cash.

   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Chairman, the unnumbered section in your  amendment that replaces section 318 as reported by the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee adds a new subsection, subsection (d), to section 3316 of title 46 of the United States Code. Under paragraph (2) the Secretary may delegate the Coast Guard's authority to a foreign classification society ``to the extent that'' the government of the society's home country, one, accepts plan review, inspections, or examinations conducted by ABS, and, two, provides to ABS equivalent access to inspect, certify, and provide related services to offshore facilities under that country's jurisdiction. 
   I understand that some foreign countries do not use a delegation system but instead accept plan reviews, inspections, or examinations performed by classification societies as part of a comprehensive operating plan submitted by the offshore leaseholder. Concerns have been raised that the Secretary may construe acceptance of the ABS plan reviews, inspections, or examinations as part of those comprehensive plans to be something less than full acceptance of plan review, inspections, or examinations in the United States, thus limiting the work that classification societies headquartered in those companies could perform in the United States and limiting the work that ABS can perform in foreign offshore markets. 
   Would the Chair be willing to work in conference to clarify what constitutes fair and full access by ABS to work in foreign offshore markets and by foreign classification societies headquartered in countries which do not use delegation schemes to work domestic offshore markets?

   Mr. Chairman, as you know, during the consideration of this measure before the Rules Committee, I offered several amendments related to discharges from recreational vessels. Those amendments were not made in order under the rule. 
   I am still concerned about the impact the proposed regulations may have on more than 16 million recreational boaters in the United States. At the Rules Committee, you were more than gracious in suggesting that we would work together to develop legislation, hold hearings in the committee and move legislation quickly to the House on this subject. 
   I would ask the chairman, and in saying this I also want to give a tip of the hat to Candice Miller of Michigan, who has been a real champion on this issue as well, but I would ask the chairman if you would be willing to work with us to bring legislation to the House floor and to get it prompt consideration, as this deadline is now approaching in September?

   It is now my pleasure to yield 1 minute to the coauthor of the amendment with me, who spoke during the course of the general debate and who, when this issue was coming up, because of the importance of natural gas and because of the importance of natural gas in the gulf coast, immediately came to me and said, can we continue to work on this as we bring it to the floor? And I again want to commend Mr. Boustany and his colleagues from the gulf coast for bringing this to our attention.

   Mr. LaTOURETTE. I thank the gentleman. I had intended to claim the time in opposition, even though I am not opposed to the amendment. I would indicate to the chairman and the sponsors of the amendment that we are prepared to accept the amendment. 
   I do have some concerns about the scope of the alleged incidents that will be reported via the Web site and the manner in which it will be presented, but I pledge to work with the amendment's sponsors as we move this bill to conference to facilitate those.

   Mr. LATOURETTE. Madam Chairman, we are prepared to accept this amendment. The Coast Guard is a multi-mission military service that must have the ability and flexibility to respond to numerous concerns and threats in the maritime domain. 
   We share the concern of the sponsor that no one Coast Guard mission should be elevated in precedence to the expense of the service's many other responsibilities. 
   I want to congratulate Mr. McNerney, a new Member of the House, for bringing this amendment to the floor, bringing it to our attention. 
   I would be happy to yield to the distinguished chairman for any observations he would have.

   Mr. LaTOURETTE. I want to congratulate Mr. Bilirakis on this amendment, and we all had the privilege of serving with his dad, Mike, and he's a ``Gus'' off the old block, and he's doing a fine job not only in this amendment but also the Waterway Watch program. 
   We're prepared to accept the amendment. The Coast Guard has operated a pilot program in Mona Pass, Puerto Rico. It has been extremely successful. We're aware that the Coast Guard intends to expand the program in the Caribbean Basin to make it a permanent program. His amendment would accomplish these goals. 
   For that reason, I support the amendment and congratulate Mr. Bilirakis.

   Mr. LaTOURETTE. I thank the chairman for yielding. We are also prepared to accept this amendment. We think it's a good amendment. 
   Although I was very taken by the gentleman from Massachusetts' prose, I would indicate we did have a pretty extensive hearing in the Coast Guard Subcommittee on this particular bridge and this waterway up in Fall River. I'm never caught short about the imagination of the Massachusetts delegation. 
   Just to be clear, the FERC approval of that site was based upon one bridge. After the delegation applied for the construction of a new bridge and there was a proposal to demolish the old bridge 100 yards from the new bridge, the Massachusetts delegation has fallen in love with this old bridge. As a result, it is not a navigable waterway. That was the basis for the Coast Guard's decision in this matter. I congratulate Mr. Markey for not only his good amendment but also the Massachusetts delegation in general for their ingenious work.

   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Madam Chairman, we're prepared to accept this amendment, although I must say we have concerns about the overall effect  the language will have on the requirements under the Transportation Worker Identification Credential program and port security levels in general. 
   As we all know, and the committee has received voluminous testimony, TWIC readers will not be available for some time. However, in my opinion, we should not relax identification requirements once the readers are in place in our Nation's ports. The evidence at the committee is that we're not dealing with an unknown universe of individuals, we're dealing with a universe anywhere from 750,000 to 1.5 million people who will eventually come and require a TWIC card. 
   I look forward to working with Representative Zoe Lofgren and commend her on behalf of this 85-year-old gentleman, and others, for bringing this matter to our attention. I look forward to working with Chairman Oberstar and Chairman Cummings and Representative Zoe Lofgren in the conference to perhaps tweak the TWIC language and make sure that we're not saying that, in fact, the alternative identification measures are biometric, and they're not saying that we're going to use someone's driver's license as a substitute for those procedures. 
   I look forward to the conference, and would be happy to yield to the chairman for his observations on the amendment.

   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Reclaiming my time for a minute, it is my understanding that the gentleman from Georgia is going to ask unanimous consent to withdraw his amendment, and I want to express my appreciation because the amendment, from my perspective, is problematic. We do concur in the concerns that have been expressed in the colloquy between the chairman and Mr. Broun, and I want to congratulate Dr. Broun as another new Member of the House who has really stepped up to the plate and brought important issues before this body. 
   I would tell the gentleman that we did have some pretty illuminating hearings on the Administrative Law Judge, and the current Acting Chairman and I both served as prosecuting attorneys, she was also a judge, and I would tell you that my experience, and I think she would echo this, is that people can accept when they come into a forum if they lose, as long as they believe that they have lost fairly. The testimony that we received was that there are a number of people that don't have that feeling going in. It was our hope by making this small adjustment that even when they are ruled against, they will say, I got my day in court. 
   That was the objective. I do appreciate the gentleman's concern. I promise him that we will continue to work on it as it goes to conference. 
   I would be happy to yield once again to the gentleman from Georgia.

   Madam Chairman, we wholeheartedly support this amendment and congratulate the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kirk) for his catch and for his unwavering diligence and vigilance on Great Lakes water quality issues. Those of us that have the pleasure to represent districts that are near or abut the Great Lakes know the damage that has been done by invasive species, both plants, animals and pathogens. The gentleman's amendment improves upon our bill. 
   As I said before during general debate, I am so proud of this committee's work on this ballast water exchange program. It really is a shining example of how Members of both parties can come together and do the right thing and the noble thing, and that, of course, all begins at the top with Chairman Oberstar's leadership.

   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2830, and I'll tell you why in just a second, but just a couple of editorial notes. One is that it is my belief that this Coast Guard reauthorization is brought to the floor in the best traditions of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. And I want to commend the ranking member of our full committee, Mr. Mica, for his diligence and work, and also for expressing his remaining concerns. 
   I also want to express my appreciation to the chairman of our subcommittee, Mr. Cummings, who I've had the pleasure now of working with about a year and a half, and I will tell you there is no Member that is more dedicated to not only the mission of the Coast Guard, but the safety of those that they entrust with supervising. It is a pleasure to serve in the post of ranking member with Mr. Cummings as the chairman. 
   And, also, a special affection for the chairman of the full committee. I made the observation at the beginning of this Congress, and I'll repeat it again today, that obviously, as a Republican, none of us were excited about being thrust after 12 years from the majority party to the minority party, but if there was to be a Democratic Chair of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, there is no one more deserving, in my opinion, perhaps in the history of the institution, than the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar). He really takes our committee, no matter what the issue, above partisanship to the goals of the Transportation Committee, and that is, safeguarding our waterways and building America. 
   And, lastly, while I'm saying nice things about people, I am pleased, Mr. Chairman, that the Speaker of the House, Mrs. Pelosi, has installed you as the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole for the consideration of this piece of legislation. 
   I rise in strong support of this bill. And I am especially proud of the ballast water provisions and the marine safety provisions located within the bill. 
   This bill will establish national standards requiring the treatment of ballast water to minimize the introduction of invasive species into the Great Lakes and other U.S. waters. The bill will build on a lot of work that has already been done. Those of us that are from the Great Lakes know very well the importance of this issue. 
   I am disappointed that we'll have a colloquy later with the chairman of the full committee relative to an amendment that was offered at the Rules Committee that would protect millions of recreational boaters from falling under a discharge permitting program designed for large oceangoing vessels. In the absence of this language, come September recreational voters will be facing fines of up to $32,500 a day for violations of program rules. For more than 30 years, Mr. Chairman, both recreational and commercial vehicles were exempted from these programs, and I hope that the majority will join us to develop language addressing these understandings. 
   As well, when we get to the amendment portion of the bill, I have an amendment that I'm offering with Mr. Boustany of Louisiana that addresses some of the concerns raised by the ranking member, Mr. Mica, relative to waterside security for liquefied natural gas facilities. 
   Again, I want to thank the Chair of the subcommittee and the full committee for working with us. I want to thank Mr. Boustany for his dogged work to make sure that we come up with a resolution that not only fits with the reality of assets that are available, builds on a long tradition that we established in 2005, but also permits us to move forward with the goal of attaining cheaper energy for Americans through the form of natural gas. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, I thank the Chair very much and would reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. LaTOURETTE. (INTEGRATED DEEPWATER PROGRAM REFORM ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First, Mr. Speaker, let me tell you what a pleasure it is to see you on a Saturday morning, rather than Monday through Friday. 
   This is a good bill. It is an important bill. We have some reservations that I'm going to talk about in a moment, but I think the fact that you and I are here together with the full committee chairman and subcommittee chairman on a Saturday morning--and I've been advised we'll be here after 1 o'clock tomorrow afternoon on a Sunday, certainly a rare occurrence in the proceedings of the United States Congress. And I was just talking to my colleague, Mr. Lungren from California, and we wouldn't be here doing this important bill if we had permitted Secretary Paulson and some Members of the other body to perform the bum rush and get us to approve $700 billion of taxpayers' money to bail out people that made bad decisions on Wall Street.     
   So this is really what we call in Ohio a two-fer, in that we have the opportunity to continue to negotiate in a bipartisan way to attempt to resolve these differences. And, at least from my perspective, those differences need to be resolved, that those who created the mess should clean the mess up and private capital should recapitalize the markets rather than the taxpayer. So hopefully those discussions--you know, we're doing important work here today, but those are on a much higher level, I'm sure. 
   But, you know, the interesting thing, from just a political standpoint for me today, is there's a commercial running back in northern Ohio--where I happen to be from--condemning me for wanting to write a $700 billion check to Secretary Paulson in this matter. And  here, when I woke up this morning and I watched the news, the national media and the national Democratic Party is condemning me and my colleagues for standing in the way of giving $700 billion to the Treasury. So I'm really at a loss for how these things work. 
   But I am glad to be here on this bill. And I'm glad that we're here on a Saturday to get this bill done. I have run out of superlatives to talk about the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Oberstar, and I would add to that the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Cummings. It is beyond a pleasure to work with these gentlemen. 
   And I think this piece of legislation is an example of why the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is far and above better than any other committee in the United States Congress, because I don't love everything in this bill, I'm sure that the chairmen don't love every piece of this bill, but they have always and consistently approached negotiations on legislation in a way that I think that we would be better served if we practiced in all legislation, and that is, they have their ideas, and as the majority party they are certainly in the position to have more of their ideas than we're permitted to have our ideas, but they welcome our ideas. 
   And the negotiations on this bill not only began as the hearings that Mr. Oberstar detailed and Mr. Cummings detailed, but we were negotiating this bill, this final product, just a couple days ago because they are still willing to listen to suggestions, and I think that that's a credit to the leadership of Mr. Oberstar and Mr. Cummings. And if, in fact, more committees operated like that, we would be a better place. 
   As I indicated, Mr. Speaker, I support many of the provisions in this bill, H.R. 6999, the Integrated Deepwater Program Reform Act of 2008. This bill will make significant changes to the Coast Guard's Deepwater program and the way the Coast Guard oversees, manages and carries out the program as the service takes on the lead systems integrator responsibilities. 
   I do have some concerns, as I mentioned, relative to the requirement over the lead system integrator responsibilities being assumed by the Coast Guard within 180 days of enactment. But I'm going to tell you that that really was the last piece of our negotiations. And again, as for the chairman of the full committee and the chairman of the subcommittee, we could have gone to that meeting and they could have said, that's nice that you have concerns, but too bad. And they acquiesced in doubling that time from 90 days to 180 days, and I am more than grateful for that. With the help of Chairman Oberstar and Chairman Cummings, H.R. 6999 will provide more time for the Coast Guard to build up its own staff, resources, and capabilities than was proposed under the Senate bill. 
   I fully support the inclusion of the language that would give the Coast Guard enhanced authorities to interdict stateless submersibles and semi-submersibles at sea. And a little bit later we're going to hear from our colleague from California (Mr. Daniel E. Lungren) who has been a champion of this issue for a number of years. 
   In recent years, the Coast Guard has been highly successful in stopping the importation of drugs by sea. I think last year they had a record year. These successes have forced the drug cartels to look at better ways for them to avoid Coast Guard assets on their way to the United States. 
   Recently, the Coast Guard has witnessed a sudden and dramatic increase in the use of submersibles and semi-submersibles by would-be drug importers. This language will allow the Coast Guard to apprehend and prosecute these individuals without forcing Coast Guardsmen to risk their lives to pull out the bales of illegal drugs from a sinking submarine, as is the case now. 
   And that's a lot of fancy language, but basically, Mr. Speaker, what's going on is these drug dealers are towing submersibles behind boats that have no flag, that have no certification. And when the Coast Guard is about to close in, they pull the plugs, basically, sink the submarine to the bottom of the Earth, and the way that our laws are currently written is the only way you can prosecute these drug dealers that want to poison our society with cocaine and other drugs is for the Coast Guardsmen to jump on board the sinking submarine and try and pull out a little cocaine so that we can prosecute them. This language--and you will hear from some of the champions of this bill in a minute--is important, and I'm glad it's in the bill today. 
   Lastly, I do want to note that the Coast Guard has concerns that the independent review requirements may lead to increased costs and delays in the delivery of some deepwater assets. I know that we will continue to work with the majority to closely oversee the impacts of the bill on the Coast Guard and acquisitions as we move forward next year and beyond. 
   I support this bill and, with the comments that I've made, ask all Members to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume before I yield to the gentleman from California just to say that the chairman has hit the nail on the head when it comes to Great Lakes shipping. And he, again, deserves great credit for, after 7 years, moving the Water Resources Development Act. 
   And I would just add to that, the gentleman from Michigan sitting behind me and to my right, VERN EHLERS, and the chairman's work on the Great Lakes Legacy Act, which has the opportunity to clean up the contaminated hotspots within the Great Lakes. And as a result of that--and I'm not trying to be a pig about it or anything--but as a result of that, one of the first major cleanups was in the Ashtabula Harbor; $53 million, and the Ashtabula Harbor was dredged for the first time in over 35 years. 
   So when the chairman talks about shallow drafts and the cost that it increases to shipping and having to make three trips instead of one trip, the chairman is exactly right. And I look forward to continuing to work with him in a bipartisan way to move this along. 
   It is now my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to one of our experts on submersibles, the gentleman from California (Mr. Daniel E. Lungren).

<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2095, the Federal Railroad Safety Improvement Act of 2007. A number of the speakers who will speak on this bill today, when the bill was first introduced I had some difficulty with some of the provisions, but I want to thank Chairman Oberstar, Chairwoman Brown, Ranking Member Mica and Ranking Member Shuster for continuing the great hallmark of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and working through those issues, be it limbo time, be it Federal preemption, be it a variety of other issues, and reaching a product that was brought to the floor today that I think that most, if not all of us, will be supportive of, as well.     
   Just a moment about Chairman Oberstar. When the majority changed, there's more Democrats on the committee than there are Republicans. They could write their own bill. But that hasn't been the way this committee has ever worked, and that isn't the way Chairman Oberstar is running the committee either. He reached out  to our side of the aisle to talk about these issues, and the result is that he has brought to the floor a piece of legislation that will overwhelmingly pass sometime later this evening. 
   Mr. Chairman, this important legislation will bring industry and government a long way towards the shared goal of improving rail safety. Although the number of train accidents decreased last year by almost 500, it is unclear whether that 1-year progress will continue. We are and we should always be looking for new ways to improve safety, not only for railroad employees, but for the surrounding communities as well. 
   Despite everyone's best intentions, disasters will strike. As the current Speaker pro tempore is well aware, in January of 2002, a Canadian Pacific train derailed 31 of its 112 cars in Minot, North Dakota. Five tank cars carrying anhydrous ammonia, a liquefied compressed gas, catastrophically ruptured, and a toxic vapor plume covered the derailment site and surrounding area. More than 11,000 people were impacted, and there was one fatality. More than 300 people were injured, including two members of the crew. Damages in that event exceeded $2 million, and more than $8 million has been spent for environmental cleanup efforts. 
   Mr. Chairman, just last week in Painesville, Ohio, about a mile from my district office, a CSX train derailed 30 of its 112 cars. A car containing ethanol exploded and fire engulfed several cars containing grain and ethanol. It burned for a number of days. More than 1,000 residents were evacuated, schools were disrupted, and roads, highways and businesses closed. Fortunately, in our event there were no injuries, but it was a tremendous disruption in the lives of many people. The six law enforcement agencies and 24 local fire departments that responded put in an untold number of overtime hours. Officials are only now evaluating the environmental fallout as they search for a cause. 
   To its credit, CSX Rail has stepped up following this incident. They are paying for hotel rooms of displaced persons, assisting in a variety of manners with the recovery and cleanup efforts, and have shown that they are willing to take responsibility when something goes awry. Our local responders and CSX worked together and provided a seamless response in Painesville. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am also happy to announce that following my conversation last Friday with Tony Ingram, the chief operating officer of CSX, the company has offered to work to cover the costs incurred by our local first responders. I greatly appreciate that and know that this is going to be a huge relief to cash-strapped communities in my district whose budget cannot handle the overtime. 
   While CSX is doing its best to minimize the damage this derailment has caused, it goes to show that when accidents do happen, this disruption is enormous. We must do everything that we can to prevent these types of incidents from occurring. The bill that Mr. Oberstar has brought forward today before the Congress takes a number of steps in the right direction. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LaTOURETTE. I thank the Chair for his wholehearted opposition to the amendment. 
   Basically a couple things. I want to thank the chairwoman of the Rules Committee, Ms. Slaughter, for making this rule in order and give a shout out to Betty Sutton, my fellow Ohioan who is on the committee that advocated that this be made in order. And I don't know if the Speaker is still on the floor, but, Madam Speaker, you can now take credit that this was the only amendment offered. It's made in order. You have a complete open rule on this piece of legislation; so it's a day of celebration. 
   The way this came about is to date we have given away about $335 billion of TARP money, a bill that I opposed along with a number of my colleagues, and the intended purpose doesn't appear to have happened. People aren't being kept in their homes. People have to have perfect credit scores to buy a car, and they're using the funds, some banks, to buy other banks. In Cleveland, PNC will use $7 billion to buy National City Bank. 
   This amendment is simple. Chairman Frank has had excellent oversight hearings, but the fact of the matter is the answer we are getting from Treasury is there's no way to track this, and they say the bankers come in and say, sure, we're going to spend the money the way we are supposed to, but nobody knows. It's inconceivable to me that we can't figure out where the money is going and they can't be made to certify that they're spending it for what we thought they would spend it for. So I called Chairman Frank, and I said can we get this done? And he said, well, find Al Green. And I called Al Green, and we worked together on a stand-alone bill. This may be the last day we're going to be here until the next administration comes in. I think we need to know where the 335 went before January 20. 
   So knowing this legislation was coming up, we drafted an amendment, Al Green and I, and we are going to introduce a stand-alone bill tomorrow, I guess. But it basically says that if you've taken $400 billion of TARP money, you have to certify on your quarterly report that you've engaged in new lending and show us how you've done it and if not, why not. And it's a reasonable amendment. I urge support. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, at this time before I yield to my next speaker, I just want to say that Mr. Green is hiding his light under a bushel basket. His assistance in the drafting of not only this amendment but also the stand-alone legislation was invaluable, and I appreciate Chairman Frank putting the two of us together. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time it's my pleasure to yield 1 minute to my colleague from Cleveland, Ohio, Congressman Kucinich.

   Mr. LaTOURETTE. I don't have any further speakers, and I would just yield myself the balance of the time and indicate that I think it's a good amendment. 
   Listen, we were told, even though I didn't support the TARP Program, we were told, it was advertised as this money was going to free up credit, free up interbank lending, help people buy cars, help people who are subject to foreclosure stay in their homes. Just today, on the front page or in the business section of the Wall Street Journal, one of the companies that has received billions of dollars is now engaged in about $10 billion of speculative losses rather than doing the intended purpose. 
   All this amendment says is until the Obama administration gets in place, in fact, they have to file, on their report, on December 30, that if they took money, if they wanted to participate--nobody put a gun at their head and said you have to participate--but if you participate in the program, and you take billions of dollars from the taxpayer, you have to demonstrate that you are engaged in new lending. That's all there is to it. 
   In the brief amount of time that I have left, I would just ask the chairman a procedural question. 
   I think it's a good oversight vote that every Member would want to be recorded on. I am mindful of people wanting to catch airplanes. Do you think we should have a recorded vote on this or not?
