<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENTS TO H.R. 6, ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, we stand today on the verge of a new energy horizon, one that promises a more secure America, an America with thousands upon thousands of new manufacturing and high-tech jobs, an America with lower and more stable energy prices, an America at long last responding to the threats of global warming. But this America will only be realized by ushering the legislation before us into law. 
   This bill reflects a bold vision, a vision to respond to many of the gravest threats facing our Nation, a vision befitting the United States Congress, the world's greatest deliberative body. 
   There is much to laud in this legislation. This bill would increase American energy independence, strengthen national security, lower energy costs, grow our economy, and create new jobs, reduce global warming. Now, the focus on the renewable electricity standard provision: a Federal RES is long overdue, and I thank you for your commitment to this provision. Thank you to my Democratic and Republican colleagues who joined me in offering this amendment in August and to the 220 Members who supported its passage. 
   In closing, I would like to remind my colleagues that we are not here to defend the status quo; we are here to lead. We are here to ensure America's standing as a model of ingenuity, creativity, cutting-edge thinking, and revolutionary ideas. Failing to usher this legislation into law I fear will threaten that standing. 
   The renewables revolution which we will be ushering in through this bill and the RES provision is good for business, it is good for the environment, and it is good for the security of our Nation, and I urge my colleagues to support it.  
   Mr. Speaker, today, we stand on the verge of a new energy horizon. One that promises a more secure America. An America with thousands upon thousands of new manufacturing and high-tech jobs. An America with lower and more stable energy prices. An America at long last responding to the threats of global warming. 
   But this America will only be realized by ushering the legislation before us today into law. 
   This legislation reflects a bold vision. A vision on the scope needed to respond to many of the gravest threats facing our Nation. A vision befitting the United States Congress, the world's greatest deliberative body. 
   There is much to laud in this legislation. The first increase in CAFE requirements in over 30 years, which will save American families an estimated $700 to $1,000 per year at the pump. An historic commitment to American biofuels that will fuel our cars and trucks. 
   And, of great importance to me and my constituents, the inclusion of a renewable electricity standard. An RES, as it is known, requires electric utilities to generate 15 percent of their electricity through renewable resources and energy efficiency measures. 
   I would like to thank the Speaker in particular for her commitment to this provision, the several colleagues who joined me in offering this as an amendment in August, and the 220 Members who supported its passage at that time. 
   Opponents of an RES claim that it would increase electricity costs for consumers. Study after study has shown the contrary. It has consistently been found that a strong Federal RES could actually save American consumers money. A recent study conducted by the Union of Concerned Scientists found an RES would save consumers $13 billion to $18.1 billion on electricity and natural gas bills cumulatively by 2020. In March, the energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie projected that consumers would save more than $100 billion with an RES in place. They also found that with more diverse energy sources and a decrease in fossil fuel consumption, reduced demand for natural gas would lower prices by as much as 20 percent by 2026. 
   And while consumers are saving money, a Federal RES also helps make our Nation safer and less dependent on foreign sources of energy. Almost all new electricity generation in the last decade has been fueled by natural gas. The biggest sources for future natural gas supplies are Iran, Russia, and Qatar, which together hold 58 percent of the world's natural gas reserves. Increasing the production of domestic energy from biomass, solar, wind, and other renewable sources helps us reduce our dependence on foreign countries, thereby securing America's energy independence. 
   The requirements under this RES start modestly, and increase gradually. It includes many provisions both to help utilities meet the requirements, and to reward those utilities that meet the requirements ahead of schedule. It allows States, many of whom have moved far ahead on this issue, to have standards that are more rigorous. It has support from the business community, the labor community, the faith community, and the environmental community. 
   It is an idea, Madame Speaker--like all included in this legislation--whose time is long overdue. 
   My colleagues, we are not here to defend the status quo. We are here to lead. We are here to make the difficult decisions necessary to ensure America's continued standing as a model of ingenuity, creativity, cutting edge thinking, and revolutionary ideas. Failing to usher this legislation into law will, I fear, threaten that standing. 
   Passing this legislation today should not be considered one of the difficult decisions we have to make. And to those for whom it is a difficult decision, I urge you to join me and the millions of Americans across the country who recognize that the renewables revolution is good for business, is good for the environment, and is good for the security of our Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. First let me thank the chairman and ranking member for their work on this bill, which provides a bold vision for moving this country forward along a path of clean energy independence and limits spending on new nuclear weapons. 
   My district has a particular interest in this bill, as I represent the scientists, employees, and community of Los Alamos National Laboratory, also known as LANL. The scientists at LANL are the best in the world and they work with a commitment to both national security and the pursuit of scientific knowledge. In recent years, there have been administrative and managerial difficulties, which we all agree are unacceptable. Nevertheless, the mission of the lab and the workers are the two things that I will always fiercely defend. 
   Stockpile stewardship, the core mission at LANL, certifies to the President every year that the nuclear stockpile is safe, reliable and accurate. My amendment will help ensure the stability of that mission and thus the rigor of our Nation's security, while also building a bridge to the future. 
   It will restore funding to the President's request for three specific areas, including upgrades to the Road Runner computer; the readiness and technical base and facilities at LANL; and the scientific campaign. In so doing, I propose to reduce spending in the office of the NNSA Administrator. 
   The Road Runner computer upgrades will increase LANL's supercomputing capability and keep the lab's ability to conduct computer simulated weapons testing at state-of-the-art. Additionally, the capacity can also be used for advanced non-weapons materials research, and thus broaden the scientific capability of the lab. The amendment restores proposed reductions in Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities at LANL, which would grind to a halt any safety improvements in the lab's infrastructure. 
   Finally, the science campaign is at the heart of stockpile stewardship. It sustains our Nation's capabilities and understanding of nuclear weapons, which is essential to protecting our Nation. It also allows us to keep our treaty commitments and not perform nuclear testing. 
   I believe that the cuts in this bill to our Nation's premier national security laboratory hurt the core mission and inhibit the laboratory's ability to transition toward the necessary work on energy independence. 
   LANL must prepare for the future, which includes diversification of its mission. As Chairman Visclosky has recognized in this legislation, securing our Nation's energy independence is one of the most critical areas of our national security. LANL has an important role to play in this regard. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, in closing, first of all, the  NNSA is the problem, not the scientists. NNSA was put there to bring a better security situation, and security has deteriorated since they are there, and that is why I take the money away from the NNSA Administration. 
   Secondly, I know we can't legislate on an appropriations bill, but I think it would be very appropriate to take a look at the role that NNSA should play in this whole situation, if not return to the Department of Energy managing the nuclear complex. They did a better job. 
   The vast majority of scientists at Los Alamos work on a broad variety of subjects, not only weapons activities. They stand ready to conduct the research that is most essential to our Nation. However, we need to make sure that these top scientists can do their jobs and have the support they need to work on other missions.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. (IN MEMORIAM OF ARMY SERGEANT JAMES AKIN -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Army Sergeant James Akin, a true American hero who lost his life while serving his country in Iraq. James was one of four soldiers killed near Baghdad on Sunday, June 3, 2007 when a roadside bomb detonated alongside the Humvee he was driving. He was killed less than a month before his 24th birthday. 
   James was a successful businessman who sold his retail cell phone company at an age when most Americans are just beginning their professional career. But he was always more interested in serving the public than himself. James felt that a public servant is effective through action and experience rather than rhetoric. To that end, he enlisted in the Army and was deployed to Iraq in the fall of 2004. He was honored to serve his country, and, envisioning a future political life, he wanted to understand issues of military conflict from the perspective of a war veteran. 
   I regret that I did not know James personally, for those who did describe him with love, and they do so passionately. The many messages posted on his personal web page by those who knew him convey the tremendous admiration they had for him, and illustrate the caring, influential and thoughtful man that he was. They describe a father figure, a brotherly adviser and a considerate, deeply loving and equally loved husband. 
   A current member of my staff, Sarah Cobb, who worked with James on a congressional campaign in Albuquerque, said of him: ``He truly was what is said of him--gregarious, outgoing and effervescent.'' 
   The love James had for his country and his countrymen was infectious. He openly and honestly told anyone he met of his future desire to run for President of the United States. He encouraged those he knew, and those he did not, to stay informed and to be involved in government and the electoral process. From what I have learned of James, I believe that if his life had not been cut short, he may indeed have addressed the Nation from the floor of this great Chamber. 
   Today, there is a void in the lives of all who knew him, and New Mexico is a lesser place for having lost him. Yet James will live on in the hearts and minds of those he touched, and New Mexico is lucky to call him a native son. 
   In 2004, James managed the New Mexico State senate campaign of my friend Victor Raigoza. Though they did not win that tough political battle, James showed the true measure of his character when he sent the following words of wisdom and encouragement to Mr. Raigoza: ``Live life to serve, because you can. Dissent, because you can. Enjoy freedom, because you can. Remember always that the measure of our progress is not whether we can provide more for those who have plenty, but whether we can provide enough for those who have little.'' 
   My heartfelt condolences go out to James' family and James' wife Syreeta, his father and namesake James, and the large number of friends, extended family members and fortunate individuals whose lives he touched. 
   I spoke to Syreeta last Friday and told her how much the Nation appreciates James' service to his country. To Syreeta and James' family, thank you for your sacrifice. 
   I believe I speak for all New Mexicans when I say our Nation will always maintain a priceless debt of gratitude and the utmost respect for the service and sacrifice of Army Sergeant James Akin. He will be missed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the Gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Murtha for his help on an important issue to me and the men and woman at Cannon Air Force Base in my district. 
   Since the early stages of this legislation, Mr. MURTHA has worked with me to include aircraft for SOCOM and AFSOC, which has recently expanded to Cannon. Cannon is the new home to the 27th Fighter Wing, which is being stood up and is in need of aircraft appropriate to the specific job performed by these soldiers. 
   That is why I am pleased that the supplemental includes money for CV-22 and MC-130J aircrafts designated for AFSOC. This will greatly assist in accelerating the capabilities at Cannon and will give the men and women serving there the tools they need to help keep America safe. The CV-22s and MC-130Js are integral to the training and mission work done by the 27th. 
   I am fully committed to ensuring that our soldiers have the training and equipment they need to protect our nation, which is why I requested this funding. I would like to once again thank Mr. Murtha demonstrating our shared commitment to our soldiers by including funding for these aircraft.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Thank you very much. And I very much appreciate the gentleman yielding. 
   Let me say, first of all, to Congressman Cleaver, you told a story that I think we hear over and over again about the effects around the world. You told it for Greenland. You took a trip up there that I think is going to go down in history as a turning point. 
   The Speaker of the House, you were with the Speaker, Nancy Pelosi. She takes this trip to Greenland, she sees this ice cap, sees what's going on and has said to the United States House of Representatives that she is going to do something about this, put it on the schedule and move it forward. So all of us, I think, Representative Inslee, are very gratified by that because we feel that there has been a sea change here in the House. We have gone from just a few short years ago ignoring this issue to now where the Speaker says we are going to do something about this, and that is very gratifying. 
   I would like to point out, too, I think that ice cap is in some places two miles thick. And so people should realize when we are talking about a two-mile thick ice cap, if that thing melts, it raises the oceans, and many of our costal areas in America would be under water. 
   But, Jay Inslee, I agree with you very much. We don't want to paint doom and gloom. This is about optimism. And you have been an incredible leader on energy. I hope you will a little bit later explain to everybody your new Apollo Energy Act, because that is one of the areas that you have led out in particular. I know you are writing a book on energy. You have done so many things here in the Congress in terms of leading on this issue. 
   The one point I wanted to jump off on, you mentioned new technology. I don't have any doubt that we are going to be able to unleash unbelievable new technological solutions to energy. I also believe that there are a lot of things that we can do right now that we could, as a Congress, and I think you are going to see this in the energy package that the Speaker puts forward in July and calls up, things that we can do right now to make a real difference on CO  
   2, on pollution, and on energy efficiency. And let me just tick off a list here. 
   Fuel efficiency of automobiles. I think easily today we could end up doubling, it is technologically feasible, doubling the fuel efficiency of the fleet, going from about 24 miles per gallon now up to close to 50, and we could do that very easily. 
   On wind energy. New Mexico is one of the places in the United States of America which has the benefit of having a constant wind, and we have already ramped up from zero to 10 percent in the last 5 years. So 10 percent of our last electrical base is wind. There are many other places in the Nation that can do that. 
   And people are now starting to purchase, as Representative Inslee knows, people are starting to purchase, on their electric bills they can sign up and say I want clean energy, and many times that is hydro, which Jay has up in the Northwest, solar, which many of us have in the Southwest, or wind or some other form.  
   Conservation. There is an awful lot we can do there. We know that in the European countries they use half what we do. And so there is a lot of waste going on out there. 
   The one little simple thing I marvel out in European countries, and all of us who travel, is that when you go to a European country and you stay in a hotel, when you go out of the room, they have a button at the door that shuts off all the lights. You just punch one button and all the lights are shut off. As you know, in almost every American hotel or motel, you have to go around individually and shut out every light. And they have done that technological thing, Jay, to try to look for ways to do savings and make it easier for people to do it. 
   Energy efficient bill. Once again, I think that we can do a lot there. This is a huge contributor in terms of CO  
   2, energy efficient, more efficient appliances, air conditioners, things like that, and a new energy portfolio for our power companies, where we take a mandate and say to power companies you will produce by 2020 20 percent of your power from renewable sources. 
   So I think those are some things we can do now, and I hope we will talk in a little bit about some of the things specifically we would do on carbon dioxide emissions. 
   I would like to yield back to the gentleman from Washington.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Representative Inslee, your optimism and Representative Cleaver's optimism is what should imbue this entire debate because there are many, many things we can do. 
   Just to give you another example, in New Mexico, when I was back going to town hall meetings several months ago, I visited an area outside Taos, New Mexico, and this small, little operation was set up to collect all of the fast-food oils in town. They would go to the various hamburger joints and others and collect these excess oils that were basically being thrown away. They were having to pay companies for somebody to come and take them. 
   These individuals were taking them, and they said, we will just take them off your hands. You don't need to pay us. And they went out and they set up an operation with just a couple of tanks. They put the oils in there. They put a little bit of lye in. They mixed it up. They had a chemical process. And I rode around that day in a diesel truck where they pumped the fuel right from these tanks, and that was biodiesel. 
   They told me that from their testing and everything that they had understood, is that this was completely clean fuel. In fact, it took them a while to convince the City of Taos to run the city bus on this fuel, because the mechanic was very worried. He said, this is new. And this is going to cause a problem. 
   Well, it ended up they said, we will do it for a trial period. They did it for 6 months in the city bus. The mechanic took the engine apart to retool it, and he said it looked like the engine hadn't even been operating over that 6 months. It was so clean. 
   So there are wonderful things that we can do. There are great success stories out there. We need to get out that word, and we need to move in a clean energy future. I mean that is the real key to things. 
   I would like to talk just a minute about how do we get there? Because the people are probably asking, they are watching us and they are saying, why is it that the American people, by 70 and 80 percent say we should move to clean energy, we should do all the things we have been talking about this evening. Why aren't we doing that? 
   Well, the reason is because the rules of the game right now are set up to favor the established industries that are there. The laws, the regulations, the subsidies, the tax credits, for the most part, are emphasized and pushing us towards fossil fuels as we know. 
   All these laws and regulations and subsidies kind of shape the energy market. As many of us know, this energy bill we recently passed, I think in 2005, most of the subsidies in that bill went to major, mature industries; oil, gas, nuclear, coal. 
   So one of the things we have to do, and I know Representative Inslee has been working on this, he is going to be doing this in his committee come this summer, is how do we change the rules of the game? How do we put a price on carbon dioxide emissions to change the whole marketplace? I think that is what we are going to be doing this year when we start getting into energy. 
   I have a bill, Congressman Waxman has a bill, Representative Inslee is on a variety of bills, Senator McCain over in the Senate has a bill. But the basic theme of these bills is, put a price on carbon dioxide and start moving us in a new direction.

   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Inslee, one of the things that you mentioned early on, and I think we are being held back. You were in England and you talked to Tony Blair and Tony Blair's minister. The G8 countries are meeting. There is no doubt in these G8 countries, the meeting going on right now, they want to set for these industrialized countries a specific cut in CO  
   2 emissions. They want to commit to a specific cut. They came into the G8 meeting saying let's have a specific cut on CO 
   2 emissions; and our President went over and sidetracked that and derailed that and basically said, no, we don't want to commit to that. 
   I think the big debate here is are we going to have voluntary measures or are we going to move towards some mandates and a cap in trade system and a regulatory system so we can get ahold of this.

   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam Chairman, I want to begin by taking the time to congratulate Chairwoman WASSERMAN SCHULTZ for her excellent work on this bill as well as in the subcommittee the past couple of months. It has been a pleasure to work with you and I look forward to working with all other Members as we continue to address the concerns of all people working in and visiting the Nation's Capitol. 
   I would also like to commend Ranking Member Wamp for his work. Together the chairwoman and ranking member have fostered a collegial bipartisan atmosphere. 
   The bill before us is a good bill, a bill that brings us necessary security upgrades, that shows a commitment to increased oversight, and does it in a fiscally responsible manner. 
   Among the bill's many important provisions is funding for the Greening the Capitol Initiative. This initiative will enable us to start switching from coal to cleaner burning natural gas for the running of the Capitol powerplant. Pages live in the shadow of the Capitol powerplant. It will allow us to purchase energy efficient light bulbs, and will allow us to begin other energy savings operations throughout the Capitol Complex. 
   The bill includes necessary funding for the Office of Compliance, which will allow that office to conduct oversight of the utility tunnel improvement efforts and health and safety issues. During hearings in the subcommittee, I have raised concerns, along with several of my colleagues, about the utility tunnels and workers and I am pleased to see that the Office of Compliance will receive the resources it needs to oversee the ongoing situation. 
   This bill also includes funding for the Library of Congress and several of its extremely important programs, such as the Books for the Blind Program, which provides services to blind and physically handicapped patrons including the production and distribution of books and magazines in Braille and electronic media. 
   Again, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and thank Chairwoman WASSERMAN SCHULTZ and Ranking Member WAMP for the efforts they have put in to the subcommittee this year to ensure that the Capitol Complex and various agencies around us are run well and efficiently.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of legislation to rename the VA Medical Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico after Raymond ``Jerry'' Murphy. I believe this naming will go far to honor a veteran who gave so much of his personal life and professional career to this Nation. 
   After serving as a Marine Corps captain in Korea and earning the Congressional Medal of Honor, Mr. Murphy spent over 20 years as the VA Director of Veterans Services at the very VA medical center this legislation would rename after him. He was a tireless advocate for veterans and helped thousands of veterans and their families over the decades. 
   While the entire delegation has risen in strong support of this legislation, it should be noted that both New Mexico's veterans' service organizations and John Garcia, the Secretary of Veterans Services in New Mexico and a veteran himself, initiated this renaming, bringing the service of Mr. Murphy to our attention and suggesting the legislation. 
   Both Senator Domenici and Representative Wilson are to be commended for introducing this legislation, and Senator Domenici for getting it out of the Senate and getting it over here to the House so that we could act upon it. 
   Additionally, I would like to thank Chairman Filner for his leadership on this legislation and his leadership on all veterans issues. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. Murphy fell ill with cancer and passed away before this honor could be bestowed upon him. However, this naming will ensure that future generations of New Mexicans will learn of the selfless work of Mr. Murphy, and hopefully many more will emulate him in devoting their lives to public service. 
   Mr. Murphy personified duty, and I'm pleased that this legislation will be passing the House today.

   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Let me also say that our chairman is an incredible tennis player, and I always like to be on the same side of the net with him rather than on the other side. 
   I would like to first of all congratulate Norm Dicks and Todd Tiahrt for their leadership and their bipartisan cooperation on this bill. We haven't seen this kind of leadership in a long time, I think it's very impressive, and I want to applaud it. 
   Let me also say that we have done some very significant oversight in this subcommittee of the appropriations. We have tackled a variety of issues. We've had all the Departments in. We've taken a very, very hard look at the kinds of things that are going on in these Departments. We also haven't seen that in a long time. One of the things that Chairman Dicks and Ranking Member Tiahrt have done is restore the public witness day. That's something that's very important and hasn't been around for about 10 years, where every member of the public can walk in and comment and tell us what their point of view is. Much of those points of views that were reflected in the committee are specifically in this bill. 
   I also want to thank Mr. Stephens and all of the staff. They've done a pretty incredible job. What this bill is about is the stewardship of our natural resources. This is a bipartisan tradition that started many years ago, over 100 years ago with Teddy Roosevelt and the first chief of the Forest Service, Gifford Pinchot. This was a Republican tradition and started out as a Republican tradition, and we hope that Republicans will join us in a bipartisan way on this bill rather than picking it apart, because this moves the country in a very, very important direction, and this bill also reflects the Nation's values that we haven't seen reflected in the appropriation bill over the last 6 years.     
   Let's just look at what's happened over the last 6 years. The Forest Service is down, 35 percent. This bill isn't able to restore all of that, but we start working back up. The EPA, a cut of 29 percent. 
   There we're talking about law enforcement and doing things about cleaning up air and water and toxics, an unconscionable cut in the EPA of 29 percent. This bill moves it back in the right direction to restore those enforcement capabilities, and a cut in the Interior Department of 16 percent over the last 6 years. 
   This bill once again starts to move us back in the right direction. This bill is about protecting public lands, protecting wildlife, recreation, and clean air and clean water. 
   One of the other things that I think this bill does that is very important is fund the National Park Service. I urge all of my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, to support this bill. It's a good bill, and they have done a great job at pulling it together.

   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I thank the gentlelady from California for her leadership and hard work on this important issue, and also the ranking member. 
   Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to take a minute to thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee) who is the lead cosponsor of this legislation, not only for his support, but for his work on this issue during the last Congress. This is only one of many critically important issues he has championed as cochair of the Congressional Native American Caucus. I am also honored to be a co-vice chair on the caucus, and I am honored to work with him on this legislation. 
   I would also like to thank my colleagues who supported this bill by joining me as cosponsors. 
   The important legislation before us today, H.R. 545, allows tribal governments to apply for three programs vital to the fight against methamphetamine: the COPS Meth Hot Spots program, the Drug-Endangered Children program, and the Pregnant and Parenting Women Offenders program. These programs were authorized last year as part of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act, which was included in the U.S. PATRIOT Act reauthorization. Unfortunately, tribal governments were unintentionally left out as possible applicants for the Hot Spots and Drug-Endangered Children programs. And while tribes are included as eligible applicants for the Pregnant and Parenting Women Offenders grant program, clarifying language was needed to ensure there is ample coordination with tribal service providers. 
   This legislation simply insures that consistent with tribal sovereignty, tribes can apply for the Hot Spots and Drug-Endangered Children grant programs. It also ensures greater coordination with tribal service providers in the Pregnant and Parenting Women Offenders grant program. 
   The manufacture and use of methamphetamine is one of the fastest  growing drug problems in the Nation. Thousands of labs continue to be found across the country. And while the number is slowing and slowly decreasing, drug traffickers have supplanted this decline with meth produced in other countries. 
   Unfortunately, the meth situation has been disproportionately much worse in Native American communities. The 2005 National Drug Survey on Drug Use and Health reported a past-year methamphetamine use rate of 1.7 percent for American Indians, and 2.2 percent for Native Hawaiians. These rates are dramatically higher than Anglos and other ethnic groups. 
   Mr. Speaker, this situation is absolutely unacceptable. The persistent use of methamphetamine on tribal lands and across America may come to an end. And I believe that passing H.R. 545 is an important step towards achieving this goal. 
   I urge my colleagues to support passage of this legislation. 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I want to just thank Mr. Udall on his excellent work in helping to correct this oversight. I urge this bill's adoption.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam Speaker, 4 days ago, I opposed a bailout plan that did too little for homeowners, too much for executives, and nothing to prevent Wall Street from repeating the mistakes that got us into this crisis. That bill would have put the U.S. taxpayer on the hook for $700 billon to bail out Wall Street, the very people whose irresponsibility helped to undermine America's economy and threaten the jobs and life savings of millions of American families. 
   Make no mistake: America faces a serious crisis. We must do something, but we cannot let fear drive our decision-making. Our solution should meet the demands of the day without producing more suffering in the future. We have the time to get this right, but the proposal we considered on Monday had significant problems. 
   At that time, I suggested several commonsense changes to Monday's bill. Those changes have not been made. 
   I said we must do more to protect taxpayers. Today's bill still falls short. 
   I said we should do more to protect responsible homeowners and their neighbors from foreclosures and plummeting property values. This bill still falls short. 
   I said we must ensure executives who ran their companies into the ground cannot walk away with millions in taxpayer-funded golden parachutes. This bill still falls short. 
   And I said that while American taxpayers continue to struggle we should not bail out foreign companies whose governments are doing nothing. Again, this bill still falls short. 
   Perhaps most importantly, this legislation does nothing to protect us from facing a similar crisis in the future. Today's situation is the direct result of a culture in Washington that allowed Wall Street to gamble with America's future. This legislation sends the message that when Wall Street's gambles do not pay off, the taxpayer will bail them out. Imagine for a moment that you send a friend into a casino and tell him: if you win, you keep the winnings; if you lose, I'll pay your losses. You would expect nothing but irresponsibility, and that is exactly what this bill will give us. We need commonsense rules to protect against that irresponsibility, and this bill provides none. 
   For all these reasons, I will vote against today's proposal, just as I voted against very similar legislation 4 days ago. The only difference between this bill and the bill we rejected on Monday that has anything to do with America's financial markets is an increase in FDIC insurance limits. This may do something, but it is nowhere near enough to justify supporting today's bill. 
   Whether or not this legislation passes today, Congress must keep working on a new framework for our financial system. Experts have produced good proposals on a variety of issues. Some have even passed this House. But we also need to begin working on a systemic overhaul of our regulatory structures, our financial rules, and the incentives that govern our markets. In this hour of crisis, we have a rare opportunity to protect future generations from the turmoil we have seen. We must seize this opportunity. 
   Unfortunately, the Senate has chosen to add unrelated provisions rather than fixing a deeply flawed proposal. I want to note that my vote today does not suggest any disagreement with the important package of tax cuts that was added in the last few days. I have consistently supported tax cuts for the middle class, including fixes for the Alternative Minimum Tax. I have advocated mental health parity legislation, and voted for it repeatedly. I have fought for tax credits to spur green industries and produce jobs. And I have worked to protect the Secure Rural Schools and Payment In Lieu of Taxes programs that would be extended by this bill. However, even with these provisions, I cannot support a $700 billion taxpayer bailout--a plan that will have a large and widespread impact for generations--that has been rushed through with so many serious flaws and so many problems left unaddressed. 
   Today's vote is difficult, but I believe it is what's right for New Mexico's Third Congressional District, and the people of New Mexico and our Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. (EASTERN NEW MEXICO RURAL WATER SYSTEM AUTHORIZATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 5710, The Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System Authorization Act. In so doing, I would like to thank Chairman Rahall and Chairwoman Napolitano for their efforts in bringing this legislation to the floor today. This important bill will authorize the Bureau of Reclamation to help communities in eastern New Mexico develop the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System (ENMRWS). 
   There has long been a recognized need for a reliable and safe supply of potable water for eastern New Mexico. After years of drought and ever-increasing community growth, this water supply project is now absolutely critical for the continued economic well-being of Curry and Roosevelt counties in eastern New Mexico. 
   These eastern New Mexico counties are built on a strong agricultural heritage, and the communities are known for their great sense of unity and mutual support. With the threat of extreme water scarcity, eastern New Mexico counties are rallying to ensure community survival. 
   The Ogallala aquifer currently provides 100 percent of the municipal and industrial water supplies and the vast majority of agricultural water for eastern New Mexico. However, both the quantity and quality of this groundwater reserve have declined severely in recent decades. It is estimated that this groundwater supply will not be able to sustain current use into the next decade, and may be functionally depleted within 25 years. 
   For 45 years, water users in eastern New Mexico have worked to develop an alternative source of municipal water that will be sustainable into the future. The Eastern New Mexico Rural Water Supply Authority, consisting of nine communities in the Curry and Roosevelt counties of eastern New Mexico, was formed in 2001 to oversee the development of a rural water system. This Authority has expeditiously and effectively finalized the studies and planning necessary to move forward with this project. 
   The Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System Authorization Act is the result, and it has come after years of research, years of consultation, years of planning, and years of negotiation. The legislation is strongly supported by the communities involved, by the state of New Mexico, and by the entire New Mexico Delegation. H.R. 5710 passed by unanimous consent in both subcommittee and full committee, and it is my hope that the bill will continue to garner strong bipartisan support on the floor today and in the Senate as it moves to that chamber. 
   I applaud the efforts of the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water Supply Authority, of the state of New Mexico, and of the counties and cities involved in this project. They have worked expeditiously and tirelessly to finalize the studies and planning necessary to move forward with this project. 
   The establishment of the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System is essential to the socio-economic survival of communities in eastern New Mexico. While vital to New Mexico, H.R. 5710 is just one piece in the larger puzzle of water resources in the arid west and across the nation. As our nation is confronted with changing and extreme weather, states and communities must work to address water scarcity with conservation efforts, with new technology, and with negotiation of water rights. 
   H.R. 5710 builds on the ongoing efforts of the 8 cities and counties participating in the  project. These communities are working to establish innovative approaches to conserving water both agriculturally and domestically. They are part of a movement in the west to recognize the limitations of this precious resource and to work within these limitations to build strong communities. 
   The Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System Authorization Act is key to the survival of numerous New Mexico communities, and is part of a wider national approach to sound water management. We cannot stand by and watch vibrant communities dissolve into western ghost towns, especially when solutions exist. I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 5710 and help provide a positive, long-term solution to a pressing water need in the rural West.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam Speaker, I rise today to voice my opposition to H.R. 5349, which extends the Protect America Act. Last August, I joined 182 of my colleagues in opposing the Protect America Act. I opposed the PAA then because I felt it did not adequately protect our civil liberties from a continually over-reaching executive branch. The Bush administration has repeatedly tried, and with some degree of success, to extend its powers in ways that I believe encroach on our civil liberties. This legislation continues to allow these surveillance activities without providing adequate safeguards to protect Americans from this encroachment on their civil liberties. 
   The passage of the PAA was hasty and ill-conceived. Our intelligence community will not stop its activities should this bill expire. In fact, the PAA explicitly states that authorizations issued prior to its expiration would remain in effect until their expiration. Knowing that our Nation can continue to protect itself until more balanced legislation is passed, I can not support this extension. 
   Last November, the House took a stand and passed the RESTORE Act, a strong bill that gives our intelligence community the resources it needs to do its job, but also ensures that our Constitutionally guaranteed rights remain intact. Because the RESTORE Act was able to achieve all these purposes, I was able to support its passage. Because the PAA does not achieve this balance, I cannot agree to let it remain our rule of law. I continue to believe that we must have the best possible intelligence to protect our nation, but that it can be done in a manner that does not uproot the basic rights and principles guaranteed to us by our Founding Fathers. I look forward to working with my colleagues to build on the RESTORE Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. (COMMEMORATING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VIETNAM VETERANS MEMORIAL -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, our nation prides itself on establishing monuments and memorials in remembrance of the past. We shape marble, bronze, granite and stone into physical commemorations, hoping that they will reflect particular ideals of justice, principles, and beliefs from our country's history and encourage those who visit to embody the same ideals. Twenty-five years ago, the Nation found itself dedicating a memorial to a war that was bitterly fought both at home and abroad and trying to find within that memorial the peace and solace that had been elusive for so long. 
   The memorial design created by 21-year-old Yale University undergraduate Maya Lin, and managed by the National Park Service, wrought emotional reactions from the crowd when it was dedicated in November 1982. Thousands of veterans, regardless of their personal feelings on what the war had meant to them, found themselves moved by the Wall. Their faces reflected against the names of the dead etched into the black granite, visitors found that this memorial was not simply a standing block of stone, but instead was a moving tribute that refused to separate the past from the present, merging the two and forcing them to coalesce into a semblance of calm. 
   Now 25 years later we continue to see the effect of the memorial. Families and friends leave at the base of the memorial personal belongings of those whose names lie above. Boisterous crowds traveling noisily from monument to monument fall silent when entering the cut of earth that starts the Wall, their eyes skipping from name to name, recognition on their face that each one represents an individual who gave their life for their country. And those who fought and returned home see the names of fellow soldiers, an attempt not to justify or explain those losses, but simply to honor and remember them. 
   Early this month, the Wall was vandalized and the face of the granite desecrated. While long-term damage is not expected, this act of dishonor flies in the face of what the memorial represents. I hope that every single one of my colleagues will join me in denouncing those who committed this vandalism. 
   With each new year the wounds of the Vietnam War further heal, the passage of time helping to wear away the dissonance and divide. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial plays a large role in this process, bringing us together not only to remember what occurred and what was lost, but also to ensure that we do not forget. It is fitting that we commemorate the anniversary of this memorial and again offer the grateful thanks of our Nation to those who served.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I rise today to state my support for this legislation that would provide a long overdue increase in the minimum wage for millions of workers around the country. As many of my colleagues have stated today, Congress has failed to increase the minimum wage for more than 9 years. This is the longest period in the history of the minimum wage that it has not been increased. This is unacceptable and I am pleased we finally are taking action today to remedy this situation. 
   America's families have seen their real income drop by almost $1,300 since 2000, while the costs of health insurance, gasoline, home heating, and college attendance have increased by almost $5,000 annually. America's families have been squeezed for far too long. Increasing the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour, which this legislation would do over the period of 2 years, is not a panacea for the hard working men and women who earn the minimum wage in our economy. However, everyone can agree that additional money in the pockets and savings accounts of these 13 million Americans will be of some help. 
   I strongly support H.R. 2 and urge my colleagues to do the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. (COLLEGE STUDENT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5, the College Student Loan Relief Act. As many of my colleagues have explained, H.R. 5 cuts in half over the next five years the interest rates on subsidized student loans for undergraduate students. This will make college more affordable and accessible for low- and middle-income students and their families. 
   Since 2001 tuition and fees at public universities have increased by 41 percent after inflation. During that same period tuition and fees at private universities have also increased by 17 percent after inflation. At the same time, interest rates on student loans have risen by almost 2 percentage points, adding another increasing cost to students and their families. It is estimated that 4.4 million high school students will be prevented from attending a four-year public college over the next decade, and another two million high school graduates will be prevented from attending any college at all, because of financial barriers. 
   In my home state alone, over 20,000 students currently have subsidized loans at four-year institutions, at an average debt of over $12,000. For these students starting school in 2007, over the life of the loan they will save over $2,000, while the average student starting school in 2011 will save over $4,000 over the life of the loan. While this savings is certainly significant, more than saving money, this legislation will provide opportunity to students across New Mexico, and the country, who otherwise might not be able to attend college. This is an inestimable value both to each of these students, as well as to our respective state's and our nation, which benefits from having a highly skilled and well-educated workforce. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Obey, and Chairman Murtha have put together a very solid piece of legislation. This bill puts us on a path to end this war. This legislation holds the Iraqi Government accountable, and it holds President Bush accountable. Let us not forget, this is an Iraqi Government that refuses to pursue national reconciliation. 
   This bill takes President Bush's benchmarks and puts them into law. This is a bill about accountability. Others have said we are handcuffing, micromanaging. No, this is a bill about setting a policy to extract us from a misguided war. 
   I ask my colleagues, vote for this bill because it tells the Iraqis it is time for you to step up and defend your country.  
   I rise today in support of this important legislation and would like to thank Chairman OBEY and Chairman MURTHA for their work in crafting this critically important bill. There are no easy choices to be made regarding Iraq, but the choices they have made are the right ones. 
   I believe there are two fundamental issues we must address concerning the on-going war in Iraq. First, we must provide the resources necessary for our troops on the ground so they can protect themselves and our allies. Second, we must redeploy them as soon as we can, and bring to an end American involvement in ill-conceived, poorly planned, and mismanaged war. 
   I believe this legislation achieves both of these goals. The bill provides more funding for the equipment and training of our troops than the President's request. It offers a new direction that promises to finally bring closure to our open-ended commitment in Iraq. And Mr. Speaker, this bill promises to give our returning troops the health care that they need, with the honor they deserve for honoring us with their service. 
   As the people's body, it is imperative that the House of Representatives listens to the will of the people. Equally important, it is imperative that the President listen to the will of the people. 
   After four years, $400 billion dollars, and the tragic loss of 3,200 service men and women, every survey of public opinion shows a clear majority of Americans disapprove of the President's handling of the Iraq War. And more Americans believe Congress, not the President, should be primarily responsible for setting policy in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, with passage of this legislation, we are taking the first steps to end our involvement in a war that currently has no end in sight. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation and move us in a new direction in Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to establish a 15 percent national renewable electricity standard by the year 2020. In doing so, utilities are permitted to meet up to 4 percent of this requirement through energy efficiency measures. This amendment will save consumers money, stimulate our economy, and strengthen our national security. 
   The aim of this amendment may seem far reaching, but the mechanism for doing so is not. A 15 percent national renewable electricity standard by the year 2020 is essential to our national security future. 
   Equally important to this debate, however, and contrary from what you hear from our opponents, the RES is absolutely achievable. In fact, almost half of the States of the Union already have an RES in place, but the full potential for renewable electricity will be left unrealized without the adoption of a Federal program to enhance the efforts of these States. We must enact a Federal RES, and we must do so now. 
   Momentum has been building, as evidenced by the fact that many of the RES standards enacted by States already have been exceeded. Subsequently, the standards have been increased. A national RES has passed the Senate three times. It has proven itself effective, efficient and popular. And it's time for the New Direction Congress to bring those benefits to the rest of the Nation.

   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great remorse that we are considering the legislation before us. I believe that the basic foundation of our Nation is inextricably linked between our national security and our civil liberties. Indeed, it was the very battle to secure our civil liberties that brought our Nation into being. Unfortunately, the current Attorney General and the White House continue to obfuscate the line between these links by casting inflammatory rhetoric that has little basis in truth. 
   And now we have bad legislation and few options. The Senate has sent this bill to us and has gone home, leaving the House in the position of considerable difficulty. The effort of the House leadership in the last six months, and in particular in the past two weeks, has been one of compromise, of negotiation, and of listening, and the legislation upon which this body voted on yesterday demonstrated that. That is why I voted in favor of its passage. The legislation today is little more than an ill-advised attempt by the Senate at a quick fix that will do nothing to protect our civil liberties and everything to give the continued opportunity of threatening American citizens' freedoms. 
   It is absolutely essential that the Congress deliberate extensively before reaching a final legislative conclusion on a matter of this magnitude. As with my vote on the PATRIOT Act, I do not believe that changes to the FISA Court--and allowing the surveillance activity of the Attorney General to remain untethered and unchecked--should be supported simply due to the rhetoric of a few. I have supported the investigation of the Attorney General because I believe he has failed in his duties to protect the American people from a deterioration of our basic civil liberties. For all of these reasons, I will vote against today's legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to support passage of this legislation to designate as wilderness the lands in and near the Sabinoso Wilderness Study Area (WSA), located in my district. The Sabinoso WSA is one of New Mexico's special places and deserves to be protected and accessible to all. 
   The Sabinoso WSA comprises approximately 20,000 acres and is situated in San Miguel County, 40 miles east of Las Vegas, New Mexico, and 25 miles northwest of Conchas Dam State Park. During a trip I took to the area, I was immediately struck by the ecological, scenic and recreational value of the land. Sabinoso's soil includes a thick section of colorful sedimentary rocks, typical of desert rock formations throughout the West. The area's scenic and densely vegetated landscape is also home to a rich diversity of wildlife, such as red-tailed hawks, western scrub-jays, broad-tailed hummingbirds, mule deer, bobcats, and gray foxes. All of these natural resources will provide outstanding opportunities to hunt, hike, horseback ride, take photographs, and simply experience the unspoiled lands of our ancestors. 
   During the 2007 session of the New Mexico State Legislature, House Memorial 53, which calls on the New Mexico Congressional delegation to support the establishment of the Sabinoso Wilderness Area, was introduced by State Representative Thomas Garcia and passed unanimously by a vote of 66-0. 
   Unfortunately, this beautiful piece of land is currently inaccessible to the general public. Designating the area will help provide access to the land for everyone. Opening Sabinoso will also create important new economic development opportunities for the surrounding communities. 
   The bill that comes to the floor today is a result of compromise and open dialogue. It is a bill that addresses the concerns of, and is supported by, all parties involved. It is an example of the positive results that come from Federal agencies, local landowners, and wilderness groups working together towards a common goal. I would like to thank Chairman Grijalva and his staff for their tireless efforts to find compromise between these different groups, and to ensure that the rights of local private landowners would not be compromised. 
   I again encourage my colleagues to support this bill to establish a wilderness area that will help to preserve the natural beauty and cultural heritage of New Mexico.

   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 430, which calls on the Islamic Republic of Iran to immediately release Dr. Haleh Esfandiari. 
   Dr. Haleh Esfandiari, a highly respected member of the Washington, DC and Maryland communities, is currently serving as the Director of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. In December, she traveled to Iran to visit her ailing mother, something that she has done countless times before. On her return to the airport, her travel documents and personal effects were taken from her. When she attempted to obtain replacement travel documents in Iran, she was instead subjected to days upon days of interrogation and essentially placed under house arrest for several months. 
   Last month, Dr. Esfandiari was summoned by the government and was taken to the infamous Evin prison, where she is currently being held. She has been accused by the Iranian Intelligence Ministry of trying to set up networks of Iranians to start a revolution to bring down the government. In fact, she has long advocated for building bridges between the United States and the Middle East 
   Iran's imprisonment of Dr. Esfandiari is entirely baseless and shows a disregard for the rule of law as well as the Iranian government's continued claim that they would like to gain the world's respect. We must demand Dr. Esfandiari and all other Americans that are being held without just cause be released by the Iranian government.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, for the past several months, Congress has debated one of the most important issues that we face: the struggle to protect America while preserving the guaranteed liberties that make America great. During this vital discussion, some argued that Congress should stop deliberating and pass a reckless proposal that would unnecessarily sacrifice our constitutional rights. I disagreed. The legislation we discuss today, which was the product of deep deliberation and compromise, will keep America both safe and free. It is a credit to this House and to the American people. 
   Today's legislation contains a number of carefully crafted provisions intended to protect the civil liberties of Americans at home and abroad while ensuring that the intelligence community can do its job. The wisest decision the House made in this bill was to grant telecommunications companies an opportunity to defend themselves in a confidential FISA court trial. This is in stark contrast to the administration's attempt to provide retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies that may have violated the law. The Bush administration claims that the telecommunications companies have evidence that would exonerate them but cannot be revealed in court because of confidentiality concerns. Our bill ensures that the American people will get their day in court and the companies will have the chance to defend their actions. This compromise is fair to the companies and to those whose rights they may have violated. 
   I believe we can protect our Nation while upholding the values that make America a beacon of hope to people around the world. America is strong because we are a nation of freedom and a nation of laws. By refusing to grant blanket immunity to those who violated Americans' rights, the House reaffirms the rule of law and the importance of liberty. The Senate should follow our lead.

   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer a commonsense amendment that will better ensure the safety of our Nation's citizens, both in the air and on the ground. 
   In my district last November, in a situation that is unfortunately still far too common, a drunk driving accident resulted in the deaths of a mother, a father and three children. Left behind in Las Vegas, New Mexico, is one sole-surviving child. The family of six was on their way home from a soccer match when their minivan was struck by a drunk driver speeding down the wrong side of the interstate. 
   As the investigation unfolded, we learned that only a few hours earlier, the drunk driver was already visibly intoxicated on an airline flight to New Mexico. While other passengers noticed that the man appeared to be intoxicated, he was served more alcohol on board the flight. Just 2 hours after deplaning with a blood alcohol content four times the legal limit, the man took to the highway, killing this family and himself. 
   In the aftermath of this horrible tragedy, I learned that Federal regulations prohibit an intoxicated person both from boarding a plane, as well as drinking during a flight. However, the airlines are not required to train their flight attendants on how to identify intoxicated passengers. In order to help prevent a problem from occurring, those in charge must first be able to identify the warning signs. Adequate training to identify and deal with intoxicated passengers is critical to ensuring attendants make informed decisions when serving alcohol. 
   My amendment works to ensure airline personnel receive this training. It requires airline carriers to provide gate and flight attendants with alcohol-server training to help them recognize intoxicated persons. As New Mexico's Attorney General, I helped implement this training in the service industry, because research shows this knowledge is critical to combating the problem. Training would occur annually and would also provide situational training on how to handle inebriated individuals who are belligerent. 
   The intention of my amendment is to prevent drunk driving, but it does much more. While inebriated passengers pose a danger once they deplane and drive, they also pose a danger during flight. It is no secret that when too much alcohol is involved, tempers are more likely to flare, individuals are more likely to behave inappropriately, and decision-making skills are drastically impaired. For all of these reactions to alcohol, flight attendants must have training on how to handle those people. It is a commonsense approach for the safety of all people in flight. 
   Unfortunately, my amendment cannot prohibit all tragic drunk driving accidents from occurring, but it will implement a system to make it more difficult for passengers over the legal limit from boarding planes, deplaning and driving home. Training to identify intoxicated passengers is critical to ensuring that the attendants make informed decisions when allowing people to board a flight and when deciding whether to serve them alcohol.

   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, we must see that flight attendants are trained in a way that allows us to ensure the safety of those people in their care, our Nation's fliers. But this amendment can do much more. It may also help to ensure the safety of those who were nowhere near the airplane. My amendment cannot prevent every tragedy that comes from alcohol abuse, but it is one more valuable step we can take.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. (HARDROCK MINING AND RECLAMATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to mark the passage of H.R. 2262, the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act. H.R. 2262 takes long overdue action to reform the 1872 Mining Act. That law, the General Mining Act of 1872, was written to encourage westward expansion and to generate the supply of minerals needed in our Nation. Back in 1872, a charge of $5 an acre to mine hard rock minerals in remote areas of the undeveloped west was probably a pretty fair price. The fact that the price is still the same today is simply ludicrous. 
   As a result, private companies, both domestic and foreign, have been able to profit handsomely by mining on public lands without the need to pay the American people any royalties or to even clean up the messes they leave behind. By some estimates, the antiquated 1872 Mining Act has allowed over $245 billion worth of minerals to be extracted from more than 3.4 million acres of public lands without returning to the American people, the owners of those lands, a single cent in royalties. Today, we took a necessary step toward bringing this policy into the modern era. 
   H.R. 2262, introduced by Representative NICK RAHALL, the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, requires mining companies to pay royalties to the American people for the minerals they mine from public lands and to properly reclaim lands damaged by mining. It also allows for the prohibition of mining on environmentally sensitive lands, and it creates a fund to begin the clean up of nearly a half million abandoned mine sites. 
   I sincerely hope that the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act sees swift passage in the other Chamber so we can send it to the President to be signed into law. Even though we have already waited 135 years to take action on this matter, time is truly of the essence. In 1872, hardrock mining mostly took place in the middle of vast undeveloped lands. Today, however, with over 375,000 mining claims spread throughout the rapidly developing West, some of our last pieces of unspoiled lands are threatened. According to the New York Times, many of those 375,000 claims are within 5 miles of 11 major national parks, including Death Valley and the Grand Canyon. 
   Over 89,000 of those claims were staked in 2006, largely due to the renewed interest in nuclear energy and the concomitant increase in the price of uranium. In New Mexico alone, almost 2,000 claims were staked in 2006. Many New Mexicans, most particularly members of the Navajo Nation, have already suffered devastating injuries from uranium mining in the past. H.R. 2262 will bring some much needed balance to the use of our public lands and, in so doing, help protect the health of our citizens. I am proud to support Chairman RAHALL's efforts and I encourage our colleagues in the other Chamber to do the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. (CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA TO END ITS CRACKDOWN IN TIBET -- (House of Representatives - April 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res 1077 and to express my concern over recent and ongoing events in China. Since March 10th, when Tibetan protests began in Lhasa, there have been demonstrations in at least 48 locations. While there are some accounts of violent actions, most Tibetan protestors have been peaceful. Unfortunately, the Chinese government has not taken the same approach in responding to these protests and protestors. While we do not know the true number, it is estimated that at least 3,000 Tibetans may be under detention. And it is even more unclear how many people have perished because of the Chinese government's excessive response to these largely peaceful demonstrations. 
   The Tibetans are a peace loving and resilient people, and even under the Chinese occupation they have been able to retain their culture. Unfortunately, while responding harshly, the Chinese government has also placed blame for the situation at the feet of the Dalai Lama. This, despite the fact that none of the purported evidence is linked directly to the Dalai Lama. 
   As these demonstrations continue, it is important that the Chinese government distinguishes between the peaceful protestors and the rioters, and that it honor its own constitutionally guaranteed freedoms of speech, association, and demonstration. 
   Passing this resolution today sends the message to the Chinese Government that this is what we expect, and that we will not turn a blind eye to their actions. On the contrary, we are closely monitoring what occurs in Tibet and will continue to do so. As China's engagement in the international community continues to grow, we must call on the Chinese government to honor the commitments it has made to both Chinese and international law. This resolution does just that, and I strongly support its passage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my support for H.R. 3773--the Responsible Electronic Surveillance That is Overseen, Reviewed, and Effective (RESTORE) Act of 2007. 
   In August, Congress unfortunately passed the Protect America Act, a piece of legislation that allowed the surveillance activities of this Administration to go unchecked. Though I opposed that bill, the House was left little choice but to pass that flawed bill. While it is true that modernization of our foreign intelligence laws was necessary to meet the security and intelligence needs of this nation, the Protect America Act went beyond what was essential and instead allowed the continued infringement of American's civil liberties. 
   Thankfully, today we have before us a piece of legislation that gives the intelligence community the authority it needs to protect Americans while also protecting civil liberties that are the bedrock of our nation. This bill modernizes our foreign surveillance system and authorizes necessary funding for training, personnel and technology resources at DOJ, NSA and the FISA Court to expedite the FISA process. Additionally, it ensures that nothing inhibits lawful surveillance for the purpose of protecting the nation and the troops from threats posed by terrorists. 
   Also of great importance, unlike previous bills considered by the House, this bill includes vital checks and balances on the Administration. It prohibits warrantless surveillance of Americans and requires a court order before targeting Americans' phone calls or emails. It also requires a finding of probable cause before conducting surveillance on Americans abroad, which was not required under previous legislation. To ensure greater accountability, the legislation mandates audits on the  Administration's warrantless surveillance program and the communications collected under the program. 
   Most importantly, this legislation ensures that it is the courts and not the Administration that decides whether or not an American's communications are targeted. The bill requires the FISA Court to review targeting procedures to ensure that they are reasonably designed to protect Americans and target people outside the United States. It also requires the Court to review the Administration's compliance to ensure that when the government conducts electronic surveillance on Americans, it obtains traditional, individualized warrants from the FISA Court. 
   Mr. Speaker, for far too long this Administration has been able to extend its power and authority, often to the detriment and subversion of our nation's basic principles. Today, we are passing a bill that will finally curb the Administration's actions and restore a measure of accountability that has been sorely lacking for too long. For these reasons, I support the vitally necessary RESTORE Act.

   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam Speaker, I rise today with great disappointment that the intransigence of the President and the minority in the Senate has presented us with only bad options to fix the AMT. If we do nothing, this bad tax is going to affect families it was never supposed to affect. The bill forces us to choose between saddling middle class families in New Mexico with additional tax burdens under the AMT and saddling our grandchildren with debt because of the fiscal irresponsibility of past Congresses. 
   Twice this year the House has done right by middle class families, fixing the AMT and paying for the fix by closing two different tax loopholes that allow some of the wealthiest in the Nation avoid income taxes. The minority in the Senate, unfortunately, spurred by the President whom they continue to follow in lock-step, blocked both of those commonsense efforts because they don't represent the middle class. 
   So we find ourselves in the predicament we face today. I do not believe that middle class families in my state should be penalized for the poor choices and fiscal irresponsibility of the minority in the Senate and the stubbornness of the President, and I reluctantly support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, 2 days ago, this body passed an omnibus appropriations bill that, while limited in its priority only to the most basic domestic needs in this country due to the stubbornness of the President and Republicans in the Senate, funded over a half a trillion dollars for important programs that will help all Americans. Now, however, we are being asked to attach to that bill $70 billion in unchecked, unconditional, and unqualified spending for the war in Iraq. It is absolutely unacceptable that we continue to provide the President with funding without providing explicit requirements that he redeploy our troops from Iraq, bolster our diplomatic efforts throughout the Middle East, and engage other countries in the region in a political solution. For those reasons, I will be voting against this funding. 
   Our soldiers have acted with unquestionable bravery and patriotism in Afghanistan and Iraq. They have given their time, their devotion, and in some cases their lives. And it is time for them to come home. Yet, their military accomplishments are not being complemented with political or diplomatic accomplishments. The Iraqi government refuses to step up to the plate, move toward reconciliation, and unite the Iraqi people. 
   As we prepare to start a new year, it is expected for people to reflect on what has transpired from the past, learn from their mistakes and decide how they can improve in the future. This does not hold true for the President, who instead is blindly demanding unfettered war funds without demonstrating any plans for removing our troops from harm's way and turning Iraq over to the Iraqi people. We cannot and must not continue on this path.

   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, first of all, I think people should understand that the views that are being enunciated here are not the views of the bipartisan appropriations subcommittee that I serve on. Mr. Tiahrt and Mr. Dicks have worked very hard to produce a bill that I think is an excellent product. It really answers the question these gentlemen have raised earlier: What is this bill about? Because what they are talking about cutting, folks, is cutting to the heart of what the American people love. 
   Let's talk a little bit about that. They want to talk about 1 percent, 4 percent and all of that. But they don't want to talk about what they are really cutting. 
   Now, the National Wildlife Refuges, the American people love. This administration is talking about closing down 200 National Wildlife Refuges because we don't have any personnel in them. So you want to continue that. The speakers here today want to continue  those cuts and close down National Wildlife Refuges. 
   If you ask the American people, do they love their American parks and do they want rangers to be there to service them? The American people are going to say, yes, of course, they do. Well, these gentlemen want to cut them. That is what is going on here. They want to cut the parks and cut park personnel. There is a huge backlog in the parks. They don't want to do anything about it. They want to cut further. 
   The other part of this bill which is very, very important, is we are always hearing about local communities needing water and sewer. Your side always talks about mandates. Well, this bill is about giving local communities water and sewer grants through the EPA so that they can clean up so that cities don't have to be polluters. 
   So, we ought to get a little question in reality here when it comes to the fringe element that is coming out here, not the bipartisan subcommittee that put this together.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, this legislation, the third supplemental bill we have considered this year, has many merits. However, I am extremely disappointed that it does not include a plan for phased redeployment of our troops. It is past time that we chart a new path in Iraq. 
   I have supported the previous versions of this legislation because they required that the White House demonstrate milestones of success and progress in Iraq with an explicit timeline for troop removal. But to now give the President a blank check would be unacceptable. We have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on this war and have yet to see even the beginning of the dividends of democracy promised to us by the President. Additional funding must include sufficient requirements for evidence of success. We also need an understanding of how much longer we will be in Iraq. 
   It is significant that the new Democratic leadership in Congress has ensured that appropriations funding bills are now focused on the soldiers and I am pleased to see that this bill includes funding for the armor and equipment needed. Nevertheless, this bill, with its absence of a plan for phased regional redeployment of American troops, will only further ensure that we stay in Iraq with no end in sight. The best way to support our troops is to give them the tools to do their job, and to change our policy to bring them home as safely and quickly as possible. 
   I believe this President must be held accountable for the deteriorating situation in Iraq and for lacking a plan to succeed. I believe it is the role--and the right--of Congress to be substantially involved in the direction of our foreign policy. And I believe that our men and women in uniform deserve better leadership. For these reasons, I cannot, and will not, support continuing to fund this war without a distinct time line for redeployment, and I will be voting ``no.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 744 and in honor of this country's Native American veterans. 
   For well over 200 years, Native Americans have provided military and strategic service to the U.S., acting as patriotic soldiers and standing side-by-side their fellow citizens in defense of our country. There are nearly 200,000 Native American veterans in the U.S. today, including members of every single tribe and pueblo. In New Mexico, there are countless stories of heroic Native American men and women serving in uniform. 
   I am proud to have sponsored earlier legislation to honor Native American veterans. During the 106th Congress, I introduced a bill to honor the Navajo Code Talkers with the Congressional Gold Medal in honor of their dedicated service during World War II. These brave interpreters used their native tongue to carefully transmit confidential Allied messages regarding the movement and strategy of millions of fellow soldiers. Not once was their code broken. Sixty years after their service, these men were honored in the Capitol Rotunda with the Congressional Gold Medal. 
   This past Congress, I was privileged to sponsor a measure to allow Native American tribes to be eligible for grants to establish state veterans cemeteries on tribal land. This long overdue legislation ensures that those Native American veterans who desire to be buried at home will not have their final wishes denied. I was happy that it was passed and am encouraged that we will soon see the first state veterans cemetery locate on tribal land. 
   To date, 47 Native Americans have given their lives in Afghanistan and Iraq. We honor their memory and their sacrifice by ensuring the Native American veterans who return home and granted the respect they deserve. As we approach Veterans Day later this week, we must remember that Native American have served our nation with pride, and continue to put on the uniform with bravery, honor, and dignity. I urge all of my colleagues to thank all veterans for their service, and to recognize the considerable sacrifice given by our country's Native Americans.

   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I thank the gentleman. 
   They say on the other side, and the gentleman has said, that we have a spending problem and that they left the country in better shape. Our friends on the other side are talking about leaving the country in better shape. I think we need, Mr. Chairman, to remind them of the history here. 
   What we're talking about is just 6 short years ago President Clinton left office with a budget surplus of $5.6 trillion, and a lot of us at that time were talking about how we were going to invest in education and health care and the important things that our country needs and that make our country stronger. 
   And in 6 short years, 6 short years, our Republican friends have driven this country into a deficit situation. We're  talking projected now on a 10-year basis $3 trillion or more in deficit. 
   So I don't see how our friends on the other side of the aisle can claim the mantle of fiscal responsibility. I don't see how they can claim in any way that they have left the country in better shape. I don't see how they can claim that they're fighting spending. I mean, this was, under them, borrow and spend, borrow and spend. That was the message. And what we're trying to do here in this particular piece of legislation is get under control a situation where we invest again in the things that the American people really care about: invest in education, investing in our workers so that we can have a competitive workforce, investing in Pell Grants to help students get the very best education.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. (GLOBAL WARMING -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about global warming and our energy future, the epic challenges of our time. 
   First, I want to applaud our leader, Speaker  Nancy Pelosi, for recognizing the importance of this issue to our children and our grandchildren. And I think she is right to put a deadline for the House to act. 
   Energy independence and global warming are of paramount concern to the American people. Most polls show the American people, by 70 to 80 percent, think these are very serious problems. 
   Today, a significant development occurred on this front. In the Capitol this morning, the U.S. Climate Action Partnership issued its call for action. This group is composed of environmental groups, World Resources Institute, NRDC, Environmental Defense, the Pew Center on Global Climate Change; industrial giants like Alcoa, BP, Caterpillar, Duke Energy and Dupont; and many others, including our power company in New Mexico, PNM Resources. 
   Listen to what they say in their report: ``We know enough to act on climate change.'' 
   ``The challenge is significant, but the United States can grow and prosper in a greenhouse gas constrained world.'' 
   ``In our view, the climate change challenge will create more economic opportunities than risks for the U.S. economy.'' 
   ``We need a mandatory flexible climate program.'' 
   This report is significant, because major U.S. companies have stepped up to the plate and called for action now. They are optimistic. They believe we can get this done. In the 109th Congress, the Udall-Petri legislation, H.R. 5042, had most of the components called for by this partnership. We will reintroduce it in the 110th and try and capture these up-to-date recommendations. 
   Udall-Petri stands for immediate action. Our bill is a mandatory cap-and-trade system that uses the marketplace. It puts a price on carbon dioxide emissions. Our bill has a safety valve which balances economic losses with emissions reduction achievements. And our bill provides the flexibility to unleash American business ingenuity. 
   I told the partnership their first agenda item should be to meet with President Bush. Their message needs to be heard in the White House. The President has called for a voluntary program. While his voluntary program has been in place, we have seen no reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. In fact, we have seen every year in the 6 years a 2 percent increase every year. President Bush should take note of these business leaders and let's join together to leave the planet a better place for our children and grandchildren.  
   Madam Speaker, this morning myself and several Senators and Representatives including the Senate Majority Leader REID and House Majority Whip HOYER had the honor of participating in an unprecedented meeting with the CEOs of DuPont, GE, Duke Energy, Lehman Brothers, PG&E, FPL Company, Caterpillar, Alcoa, BP America, and PNM Energy from my home state of New Mexico, and the heads of the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, Environmental Defense, and the World Resources Institute. The United States Climate Action Partnership, as this organization of CEOs is named, has coalesced around the urgent need to enact a federal global warming policy, and to enact it now. I am humbled both by the commitment expressed by these leading global corporations and by the enormity and importance of the task we here in Congress have before us to craft policies to address perhaps the most pressing issue of our generation. I applaud them for their leadership and courage on this issue, and I look forward to working with them. 
   The time for debate about whether or not global warming is real and whether or not it is  attributable to human activity on this planet, has passed. America must lead the global effort with a national global warming policy. We can no longer sit and reap the benefits of fossil fuels without mitigating the negative effects they are having on our planet and our way of life. We cannot, we must not, leave this one up to our children. 
   It is now the moment in time when we must create a policy to address global warming. To that end, my good friend and colleague from Wisconsin, Mr. TOM PETRI, who was also present at the meeting this morning, have developed a comprehensive greenhouse gas emissions control bill. We introduced the Keep America Competitive Global Warming Act during the 109th Congress and are currently making minor changes to the legislation for reintroduction in the coming weeks. Our legislation will put our country on the path to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, while not jeopardizing American competitiveness, American jobs, and the American economy. 
   The bill is an economy-wide, upstream, cap-and-trade policy that covers all greenhouse gas emissions. However, to provide some certainty to the economy, the bill provides for an unlimited number of 
   additional ``safety valve'' allowances. This safety valve provision provides cost-certainty to industry and will help ensure that this policy will not result in economic harm. We believe it is better to have a policy that works slowly yet surely rather than one that might prove economically unworkable. Many companies, including some who were present at this morning's meeting, have expressed the need for a safety valve in any mandatory greenhouse emissions control legislation. 
   Some of the other key provisions of this legislation include the creation of an Advanced Research Projects Agency at the Department of Energy to explore the truly out-of-the-box, high-risk, high-payoff research that will be necessary if we are to get to a low or no carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas world. Technological advancement hold the key to the long-term solution of global warming. Our bill also includes resources for workers, entities and localities who may be negatively impacted by this policy. Also, Madam Speaker, to address concerns about American competitiveness, our legislation ensures that the United States will not be put at a competitive disadvantage relative to developing countries or countries not taking actions comparable to ours to stem greenhouse gas emissions. 
   Madam Speaker, the message we hear from scientists is clear, we must act immediately to stop global warming. We must do so, however, in a responsible manner that does not cost American competitiveness and American jobs. Mr. PETRI will soon be reintroducing our reasonable, certain, and efficient global warming legislation. Please join us in combating one the most pressing issues facing our country today.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. (AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam Speaker, with all of the rhetoric about today's loan package, it is easy to lose track of the decision we have to make. We can, as some have suggested, decide to let two of America's largest businesses go bankrupt in the coming months. If that happens, more than 2 million workers will likely lose their jobs. Communities across this country will be devastated. According to estimates, New Mexico alone stands to lose roughly 10,000 jobs. New Mexicans who ask nothing more than to work hard and provide for their families will be forced to put their dreams on hold. 
   Or, we can pass this bill. 
   Nobody disagrees that the auto industry has made mistakes. Car company CEOs have been reckless and short-sighted. While Japanese companies were rushing to produce hybrids, American companies were suing states like New Mexico to stop energy efficiency standards. While other companies were investing in the cars of the future, Big Three executives were trying desperately to turn back the clock. They refused to anticipate rising energy prices. Today, their irresponsibility threatens their companies, their employees and millions of American workers. 
   But we should not punish 3.3 million American workers and their families for the errors of a few executives. Yes, car company CEOs have been reckless and short-sighted. But that ends today. If this proposal passes, American car companies will trade in their Hummers for hybrids. And in the process, they will build an industry ready to compete in the 21st Century. But all these changes will not be possible unless we act now. 
   Unlike TARP, which I opposed, this plan tells executives that if they do not change, they will not survive. If the auto industry does not have an acceptable viability plan in three and a half months, they will not see another dime of taxpayer money. Whatever money they have received will have to be repaid immediately. 
   Today's vote does not spend one additional taxpayer dollar. We have already approved $25 billion to help the American auto industry build energy efficient cars. I supported that because it was necessary to force Detroit to modernize. Today's legislation simply provides some of that money right now to make sure that there is an American auto industry to modernize. More importantly, this bill provides increased oversight to ensure that taxpayer dollars help American workers and drivers, not stockholders or executives. It mandates that our money will not be spent on executive salaries, dividends or corporate jets. It institutes unprecedented controls to protect the people's money from misuse. Most importantly, it ensures that Detroit can no longer continue with business as usual. 
   Madam Speaker, we face great economic challenges, some of the most difficult in decades. Job reports last week showed half a million jobs lost in November alone. This is not a perfect bill; it is just the best we could get from this president. But given the current climate, we cannot afford to risk another 3 million jobs by refusing to act. That is why today I will be voting yes. 
   Thank you, Madam Speaker.

The tools offered by the SBDCs can assist these entrepreneurs with the information and opportunity to build sustainable businesses in their communities. 
   H.R. 2284 also ensures participation of governing bodies of Indian tribes, Alaskan Native entities and Native Hawaiian organizations by requiring grant recipients to request their advice on how best to provide assistance. Our intent is to ensure that these business development tools are provided in a culturally sensitive way. 
   Small businesses create 75 percent of all new employment opportunities and make up 99 percent of all employers. They anchor our neighborhoods, provide jobs and contribute to the overall economic development of many communities. That is why it is so imperative that we take steps to help ensure that small business development reaches the places in this country where economic prosperity has yet to be fully realized. 
   I have the great honor of representing 14 Pueblos, the Jicarilla Apache Nation and a portion of the Navajo Nation. Many of these communities would greatly benefit by more economic development. It is clear we can do more to aid Native American entrepreneurs in my district and throughout the country. I hope to help rectify this situation with the passage of this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. (HONORING NAVAJO CODE TALKERS STEWART CLAH AND CHARLES GUY -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of two Navajo Indians and celebrate the American heroes who passed away last week. Stewart Clah and Charles Guy were members of the elite Navajo Code Talkers. They did not simply rely on their ancestral language to relay critical United States military communications. Rather, the innovative Navajo Code Talkers used their native language to build a succinct and unbreakable code for military communications during World War II. 
   We will never know exactly how many American lives were saved or how many American military operations were successful because of their ingenuity and sacrifice. But we do know Stewart Clah and Charles Guy and the rest of the Navajo Code Talkers will forever be remembered as critical to the Allied victory during one of the world's darkest hours.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for H.R. 1, which will finally implement in full the recommendations made by the 9/11 Commission. This is an extremely important day for our Nation. 
   I want to specifically express my support for the inclusion of provisions that protect our privacy and civil liberties. Last Congress, I worked with Representatives Carolyn Maloney and Christopher Shays to introduce the Protection of Civil Liberties Act which would have made the Privacy and Civil Liberties Board an independent agency and granted it the power it needed to fully do its job. I am pleased that the Conference Report works to ensure that the Board will finally be able to fully operate as our country's independent civil liberties watchdog. 
   The Conference Report before us today gives the Board independence by finally removing it from the administration's control and provides it with the funding necessary to do its job. It authorizes the Board to have access to all the relevant information it needs to carry out its responsibility, and gives the Board more power to subpoena potential witnesses. Additionally, the Board will be required to regularly report to Congress on its activities, findings, and recommendations, and to inform the public of its activities as well. 
   Clearly, for years our country has been headed in the wrong direction regarding the protection of our civil liberties, and a fully independent Civil Liberties Oversight Board will serve as an important first step to bring our nation back on course. We must not continue to undercut the civil liberties our Constitution guarantees under the false pretense that they cannot be maintained in a post-9/11 world. I strongly believe the American public deserves both security and privacy and, today, action in the House ensures that this can occur. I urge my colleagues to support this vital piece of legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this important resolution and with great hope that this debate and vote will signal an important step towards the end of the Iraq war, a war so ill-conceived, so ill-planned for, and so ill-executed that it has cost our Nation almost $400 billion, ignited a civil war, and further destabilized an already fragile Mideast region. Most importantly, this war has  resulted in the deaths of over 3,000 of our bravest military men and women. These men and women enlist in the Armed Forces trusting that their Commander in Chief will send them into harm's way only as a last resort and only with a clear plan for victory. 
   Madam Speaker, on both of these counts, the President has failed our soldiers. 
   It is time for us to redeploy our troops and redeploy them now. We have an opportunity to send a loud and resolute message to the President that his misguided judgment must cease, this war must now be subject to intense scrutiny and accountability by this Congress; and that he must heed the will of the American people, the overwhelming majority of whom now strongly disapprove of his handling of this war. Sadly, however, this President is tone-deaf when it comes to the most pressing issue of the day. 
   For the past 4 years, the President repeatedly stated that troop strength in Iraq would come from recommendations by generals on the ground. Yet by moving forward with his escalation plan, the President is ignoring solid military advice. General Abizaid, CENTCOM commander, stated: ``I do not believe that more American troops right now is the solution to the problem. I believe that the troop levels need to stay where they are.'' Additionally, according to various reports, General Casey repeated to the NSA Director his warnings that to send more troops to Iraq would be counterproductive. He believed it might make the Iraqi Government less likely to defend itself. 
   That concern was shared by the Iraq Study Group. In one of their recommendations they stated that the Iraqi Government must make substantial progress on national reconciliation, security, and governance. Without progress, we should reduce our political, military, and economic support for the Iraqi Government. 
   Tragically, the Iraqi Government has shown no progress on any of these fronts. We must not be a security blanket for an ineffectual government. But the President's escalation plan is exactly that, asking little of Iraq's Government while putting the lives of our soldiers squarely in the crosshairs of Sunni extremists and Shiite militias. 
   Many in the military leadership have stated that the solution to the Iraqi quagmire at this point must be 80 percent political and 20 percent military. This escalation plan is 100 percent military with no significant political breakthroughs either having been reached or even on the horizon. Rather than implement a rigorous diplomatic strategy, the administration has instead begun escalating the rhetoric with Iran, causing many people throughout the Nation and the world to fear another misguided military action. 
   Our soldiers have done everything that has been asked of them, and more. They have served bravely and honorably. They have trained Iraqi forces to the best of their abilities. But they cannot be asked to calm the sectarian violence ripping Iraq apart without leadership from Iraqi politicians. Yet the President is asking exactly that. 
   Last year, after visiting Iraq, I called for a phased redeployment by the end of 2006. That time has come and gone. Today I call on the President to finally listen to the American people. Today I call on the President to finally listen to the Congress. It is time to move our troops out of the middle of this civil war. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and send a clear message to the President that the time for this war is over
