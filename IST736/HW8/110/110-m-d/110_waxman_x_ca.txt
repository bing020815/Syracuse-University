<DOCNO>Mr. WAXMAN. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, as one of the original cosponsors of the House version of this bill, I am happy to see that it is about to become law. This reauthorization affirms to our partners around the world that we are with them for the long haul in the fight against HIV, TB, and malaria. 
   The bill retains many of the important provisions of the House version. It authorizes strengthening of local health systems and health care workforces. It supports fiscal responsibility by directing the purchase of safe drugs at the lowest available prices. And it encourages operational research and the translation of lessons learned into effective programming. 
   The bill incorporates Congresswoman BARBARA LEE's legislation to eliminate the HIV travel ban. This is an important policy step. And it is an important message that we reject this relic of a time when fear and stigma drove much of the nation's' response to AIDS. 
   But unfortunately, fear and stigma around HIV are still very real, particularly when we talk about prevention. This bill notes the importance of supporting healthy behavior change, and encourages the expansion of male circumcision as an effective prevention method. But I think there are parts of this bill where Congress could have spoken more directly to the need for honest, evidence-based prevention programming. 
   Injection drug users around the world are among the most vulnerable to HIV prevention. This bill makes only brief mention of the need for prevention strategy and other programs for this population. Our implementers should understand how crucial this focus is to fighting the epidemic, not only in countries with HIV driven mainly by drug use, but also in countries with emerging, concentrated drug-related epidemics. 
   The same applies to men who have sex with men. Due to stigma and denial, the HIV prevention, treatment, and care needs of sexual minorities are often unmet. This bill makes only passing reference to men who have sex with men, but the program should be implemented in a way that truly recognizes the needs of this population. 
   People involved in sex work are also very vulnerable to HIV infection, along with many other health and social risks. I'm disappointed that we haven't eliminated the current requirement that recipients sign an ``anti-prostitution pledge.'' The requirement has reportedly had the unintended consequence of scaring grantees away from doing effective outreach programs for sex workers. But U.S. officials, and all of our partners, should know that Congress wants this law implemented in a way that best respects the public health needs of this severely marginalized group. 
   Finally, I have concerns about integration of activities. I am particularly disappointed that the bill does not explicitly encourage the close integration of HIV programs with family planning and other reproductive health services. What's more, language added to the bill's ``conscience clause'' could hinder effective integration, when we should be doing everything we can to encourage referrals to important health services. 
   All of these concerns do not outweigh my deep respect for what the global AIDS program has accomplished, and my strong support of its reauthorization. They do underscore  the need for ongoing oversight of how the program is designed and implemented, particularly in efforts to reduce HIV transmission. 
   The first 5 years of PEPFAR showed that a remarkable scale-up of effective treatment was possible in the developing world. It's time to use all of the public health knowledge and resources we have to do the same for prevention.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. 
   Madam Speaker, this is truly an historic day in the fight against tobacco, but it took us far too long to get here. 
   In 1994, the tobacco executives stood before my subcommittee, held their hands up, swore to tell the truth, and then immediately lied under oath and said, ``Nicotine, it's not addictive. Children, we don't try to market to children.'' Of course, the opposite was true. 
   In 1996, the FDA tried to regulate tobacco products, but the Supreme Court told them they needed specific congressional language to give them that authority. Now, 12 years later, here we are, finally giving the FDA that authority to regulate the leading preventable cause of death in America. 
   Every one of us knows the tragic consequences of cigarette smoking. We've seen loved ones die, suffer. We've watched others grow sick. Many of us have felt the grip firsthand of addiction, but the worst of all is what happens to children. One thousand children start smoking each and every day. Four hundred thousand Americans die every year. 
   The minority leader said: When is enough enough? 
   Well, cigarettes, one of the most dangerous products on sale today, is not regulated at all. This bill would give the FDA, the only agency with the right combination of scientific expertise, with regulatory experience and with a public health mission, the ability to oversee the products effectively. 
   The FDA can stop that marketing to kids. They can prevent manufacturers from misrepresenting their products as ``light'' or as ``safer.'' They can require changes in cigarettes. They can change the level of nicotine so that people who smoke and who want to give up smoking will have a fighting chance. They can regulate ingredients such as formaldehyde or benzene or radioactive elements or any other deadly chemical. 
   Now, some have argued that the FDA is overburdened, that they can't do another job. Well, they are overburdened, and they're not well funded, but this bill has a user fee built into it to raise the money from the tobacco companies to give the FDA the ability to go and regulate this product. 
   The breadth of support for this bill is from the AARP to the American Academy of Pediatrics and from the Southern Baptist Convention to the Islamic Society of North America. It is supported by the American Lung Association, by the American Heart Association and by the American Cancer Society--the groups that are best situated to understand the damage caused by  tobacco. We've tried to accommodate specific concerns we've heard about this bill to provide fairness and flexibility for convenient stores and for others. 
   Join in support of this legislation. It is a bipartisan bill, and I urge its adoption.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAXMAN. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4040, CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise in favor of this bill, which marks a great step forward in protecting our children and all Americans from unsafe products. I want to thank Chairman Dingell, Chairman Rush, Ranking Member Barton, and all the other conferees for their hard work in moving this bill forward. 
   I believe this is an extremely strong bill. It provides critically needed new authorities, personnel, and resources for an agency that has grown all but defunct in recent years. I look forward to a day when we can all feel safer as a result of this legislation. 
   There are many important pieces in this bill, as others have noted--new lead limits, mandatory toy standards, third-party testing, a ban on phthalates, whistleblower protections, and much more. In all of these areas we have strengthened Federal law and provided for better national enforcement with respect to consumer products. 
   At the same time, I am pleased that we have preserved essential State authorities, which are an important tool in protecting consumers. State laws and State action were the catalyst for much of this bill, and it is important that we preserve their ability to take actions in the future whenever it is needed. 
   I would like to engage Chairman Dingell in a colloquy to address the issue of preserving State warning requirements. 
   I am pleased that the bill protects State warning laws related to consumer products or substances, such as California's Proposition 65. The conference report clarifies that any warning laws in effect as of August 31, 2003 are not preempted by this Act or by the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. This important clarification effectively harmonizes the four statutes that are enforced by the Commission. Other laws enforced by the CPSC, including the Consumer Product Safety Act, clearly do not preempt or affect State warning requirements like Prop 65. 
   I want to make sure that we have corrected any ambiguity with this conference report and harmonized all the Commission's statutes on this point particularly, as well as the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. 
   I want to yield to Chairman Dingell and ask, is it also your understanding that nothing in this legislation or any of the laws enforced by the Consumer Product Safety Commission will preempt or affect Prop 65 in any way?

   Mr. WAXMAN. I thank Chairman Dingell. Again, I am pleased to support this bill today. I am going to submit a longer statement for the Record, but I want to commend all those who have been involved in bringing about legislation that Democrats and Republicans can support and state with good, clear conscience that it is a very important step forward for consumers.  
   I am pleased to speak in favor of this bill, which marks a great step forward in protecting our children and all Americans from unsafe products. I want to thank Chairman Dingell, Chairman Rush, Ranking Member Barton, and all of the Conferees for their hard work in moving this bill. 
   I believe that this is an extremely strong bill. It provides critically needed new authorities, personnel, and resources for an Agency that has grown all but defunct in recent years. I look forward to a day when we can all feel safer as a result of this bill. 
   There are many important pieces of this bill, as others have noted--new lead limits, mandatory toy standards, third-party testing, a ban on phthalates, whistleblower protections, and much more. In all of these areas, we have strengthened Federal law and provided for better national enforcement with respect to consumer products. 
   At the same time, I am pleased that we have preserved essential state authorities, which are an essential tool in protecting consumers. State laws and state action were the catalyst for much of this bill, and it is important that we preserve their ability to take such action in the future, whenever it is needed. 
   One critical state law in this process was California's Proposition 65, which requires manufacturers to label any product that contains a known carcinogen or reproductive toxin. That law has played a unique role in protecting all Americans for decades, so it was important to me that we not interfere with it in this legislation. 
   I am therefore pleased that the conference report makes clear that any state warning laws like Prop 65 that were in effect as of August 31, 2003, are not preempted by this Act or by the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. This important clarification effectively harmonizes the four statutes that are enforced by the Commission. Other laws enforced by CPSC, including the Consumer Product Safety Act, clearly do not preempt or affect state warning requirements like Prop 65. The Federal Hazardous Substances Act, however, is ambiguous as to its effect on state warning requirements. I am pleased that we have corrected this ambiguity with this conference report and harmonized all of the Commission's statutes on this point. 
   I am also pleased that under another key provision of the legislation--the new prohibition on phthalates--states retain the ability to regulate phthalates in product classes that are not regulated under this legislation. States also retain authority to enforce any toy safety standards that were in effect on the date of enactment of this bill, as long as they notify CPSC of the standard. I am pleased that the bill includes explicit language to preserve states' ability to regulate alternatives to phthalates, such as other chemical plasticizers that might be used as substitutes to the phthalates that will be removed from toys under this law. 
   The bill itself does not address the use of hazardous alternatives to phthalates when the prohibition goes into effect, so it is critical that states can act in this area. California has a law on phthalate alternatives and it is important that that law will remain in effect as the new Federal ban on phthalates enters into force. 
   Finally, I am pleased that under the bill, states have the authority to require additional or more effective testing protocols. Because testing protocols can change over time as tests become more sensitive and science evolves, states must be free to move ahead even when Federal requirements lag behind. The states' ability to act quickly and proactively provides an essential backstop of protection for consumers, and this bill makes sure that backstop remains in place. 
   Again, I thank Chairman Dingell and Chairman Rush for putting together such a strong bill for all Americans.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAXMAN. (ANIMAL DRUG USER FEE AMENDMENTS OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of our subcommittee for yielding to me. 
   This bill that we are considering now, the Animal Drug User Fee Act, or ADUFA, will enhance and improve FDA's ability to promptly review new medicines for animals, and that is very important that we all support this. 
   This reauthorization has also given us an opportunity to look at providing FDA with new tools to address a related public health crisis, the problem of antibiotic resistance caused by the industrial farming practice of using human antibiotics for non-therapeutic uses in food producing animals. 
   We now have an overwhelming body of evidence showing that the overuse of antibiotics in industrial farm production is threatening to destroy the effectiveness of some of our most important antibiotics for human use. Many of the world's most prestigious experts, the Institute of Medicine, the Pew Commission, World Health Organization and Government Accountability Office have warned about the dangers to global public health of such widespread overuse. These drugs are breeding resistant microorganisms that can and do get transferred to humans. They also leach into the environment and show up in our drinking water. The experts have told us that the more antibiotics we consume, the more resistance develops. 
   The ADUFA bill we are considering includes a provision to increase the availability and accessibility of data on the amount of animal antibiotics being distributed. This data will help us to determine how resistant bugs are developing and inform research on ways to stop those bugs from threatening human health. 
   This is an important step forward, and I appreciate the cooperation of Chairman Dingell and Chairman PALLONE in helping us to get this done. 
   But let me be clear: This is only just the beginning. We, in Congress, need to do much more to address the problem of antibiotic resistance. It is imperative that we look at ways to curtail the practice of using the same antibiotics that are so vitally important for preventing and curing human disease for non-therapeutic uses in food-producing animals. 
   I look forward to continuing to work with our colleagues on this important issue.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, the legislation we are considering provides FDA with critical tools the agency has been desperately lacking in its efforts to protect the American public from unsafe drugs. This legislation will provide FDA with the ability to require companies to update their drug label with new information, and FDA won't have to haggle with companies to get them to make those changes. 
   It also says, in giving FDA this labeling change authority, Congress is making it clear that we do not intend to impact a drug company's responsibility to promptly update its label with safety information on its own accord. 
   The legislation also gives FDA the authority to require companies to conduct postmarket studies and clinical trials of drugs. And it creates a mandatory clinical trial registry and results database to increase the transparency of those trials.     
   Mr. Speaker, before we break our arms trying to pat ourselves on the back, I want to express my deep disappointment that today we are walking away from a critical opportunity to make some reasonable adjustments to the windfall profits that drug companies receive for conducting pediatric studies under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act. This is not about whether those pediatric studies should be done. We all agree about that. They are being done now. There is no question they will continue to be done. But if we were to cut back slightly on the term of exclusivity for only the blockbuster drugs, that would make a great deal of difference to people who are paying the high cost for pharmaceuticals. 
   In my view, we lost that opportunity, and it is going to hurt a lot of our consumers. In my view, there is simply no justification for rewarding companies with incentives that are so far in excess of the actual cost of doing the studies themselves. 
   I am also deeply disturbed the legislation fails to remove the sunset on FDA's authority to require pediatric studies under the Pediatric Research and Equity Act. There is absolutely no reason Congress needs to keep revisiting this commonsense measure that allows FDA to get essential information about whether new therapies are safe and effective for children. 
   So although I am pleased that today will provide FDA with important new authorities and resources, I must express my deep regret that we fail to take this opportunity to help individuals, businesses, State governments and insurers who pay the bill for the higher prices that result when generic competition is delayed for these expensive blockbuster drugs. I think it is a shame. We are talking about drugs of $5 billion in sales a year. If they spend a couple million dollars for their studies, they are being overreimbursed at the consumer's expense.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, the legislation are poised to pass today provides FDA, for the first time, critical tools that the Agency has been desperately lacking in its efforts to protect the American public from unsafe drugs. 
   This legislation will provide FDA with the ability to require companies to update their drug label with new safety information. Our goal here is to address tragic situations like Vioxx. In that case, because FDA could not compel the company to promptly make a labeling change, the Agency haggled with the company for 14 months before consumers were finally warned about serious cardiac risks in the drug label. This is simply unacceptable. 
   However, this legislation will make clear that, in giving FDA this labeling change authority, Congress does not intend to impact, in any way, a drug company's responsibility to promptly update its label with safety information on its own accord. Under FDA's current regulations, companies are required to add new warnings to their labels as soon as they learn of new dangers, even if FDA has not yet required the change. 
   In promulgating those regulations, FDA made a sensible policy choice. FDA recognized that the companies themselves are in the best position to know about risks associated with their own drugs. Logically, then, the companies should also be charged with the duty to make consumers aware of a drug's risk at the earliest possible moment. FDA recognized that drug safety is first and foremost a shared responsibility between the Agency and the company. And, today, Congress is making it clear that we do not mean to disrupt that balance. 
   This legislation will also give FDA for the first time the authority to require companies to conduct post-market studies and clinical trials of drugs. Another section of the bill creates a mandatory clinical trial registry and results database to increase the transparency of those trials. Both of these provisions will make a critical contribution towards increasing the safety of our drugs once they are on the market. 
   But I want to express my deep disappointment that this legislation failed to adopt a compromise that would have provided consumers with much-needed relief from the ever-increasing cost of drugs. Today, we are walking away from a critical and very rare opportunity to make some reasonable adjustments to the windfall profits drug companies receive for conducting pediatric studies under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act. 
   This is not about whether these pediatric studies should be done. We all agree about that. They are being done now. And there is no question that they would continue to be done if we were to cut back slightly on the term of exclusivity for just the blockbuster drugs that are realizing profits many times over the cost of doing pediatric studies. The Senate did this in its bill and I regret that the compromise agreement we are considering today did not reflect anything from the Senate approach on this issue. 
   In my view, there simply is no justification for rewarding companies with incentives that are far in excess of the actual costs of the studies themselves--often hundreds of times over. 
   I also am deeply disturbed that this legislation fails to remove what is an unprecedented sunset on FDA's statutory authority to require pediatric studies under the Pediatric Research and Equity Act. There is no reason Congress needs to keep revisiting this common sense measure that allows FDA to get critical information about whether new therapies are safe and effective for children--FDA quite obviously needs to have the ability to require that new treatments be tested in children. And there need not be any further discussion about that. 
   So, although I am pleased that we will provide FDA with critical new authorities and resources in this bill today, I must express my deep regret that we failed to take this opportunity to help individuals, businesses, State governments, and insurers who pay the bill for the higher prices that result when generic competition is delayed for these expensive, blockbuster drugs.

We have begun the process of adopting energy policies that recognize the science of global warming and the threat to our Nation's energy security. 
   This legislation will finally give Americans the fuel-efficient automobiles they want, saving families $700 to $1,000 a year. That is money we won't be sending to dangerous regimes in the Middle East. 
   This legislation will finally give Americans more power from clean, affordable, renewable energy sources, using wind, solar and biomass. We can produce energy here and at home and fight global warming. 
   The legislation will give Americans more efficient appliances and consumer  goods, saving us hundreds of billions of dollars on electricity bills over the next few decades. 
   And there are some things this legislation will not do. It won't diminish the EPA's authority to address global warming, which the Supreme Court has recognized. It won't seize authority from the States to act on global warming. 
   President Bush has threatened to veto this bill because it takes away taxpayer subsidies to oil companies and supports new renewable energy technologies. It is time for the President to do what the American people want, not what the oil companies want.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you very much for yielding to me. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is noncontroversial. It relates to a situation in Los Angeles where prohibition was put in place to prevent tunneling in an area that has been designated as a high risk for methane gas explosions. The bill before us would repeal that prohibition about tunneling, because, at the request of Mayor Villaraigosa, we agreed to convene a panel of experts to assure us that it is technically feasible to handle the tunneling in a very safe manner, that the technology is there and that we need not fear the tunneling as we might have, appropriately so, in the mid-1980s. 
   In 2004, the L.A. City Council passed a motion urging reversal of this 1985 law, and in February of 2005, the LAMTA board renewed discussions of the subway expansion in this area. 
   I strongly support this legislation. There is no opposition to it. I appreciate the committee having reported out unanimously, and I would urge my colleagues in the House to agree with the proposal coming from the committee.  
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 238 is noncontroversial legislation. In the last Congress, it was reported unanimously by the House Transportation Committee and passed the House by voice vote. 
   H.R. 238 would repeal a law enacted in 1985 that prohibits subway tunneling in a part of Los Angeles I represent. I authored the 1985 legislation after a methane gas explosion demolished a Ross Dress-for-Less store in the Third and Fairfax area of Los Angeles. 
   After the explosion, serious safety concerns were raised about the city's plans to extend the subway in this area due to underground pockets of methane gas. In recent years, experts have indicated that technologies have been developed that could make tunneling in the area safe. 
   In 2004, the Los Angeles City Council passed a motion urging a reversal of the 1985 law, and in February 2005 the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority's board voted to renew discussions of the subway's expansion in this area. 
   As a result, I worked with Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa to select a panel of scientific experts to conduct an independent safety review. These experts made a unanimous determination in a November 2005 report that tunneling in the methane gas area can be done safely if proper procedures and appropriate technologies are used. 
   H.R. 238 simply lifts the Federal tunneling prohibition that has been in place since 1985. I urge my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for yielding to me and the fine work he and his subcommittee have done with this legislation. I also want to commend the gentleman from Ohio, the ranking member of that subcommittee. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill also builds on a bipartisan proposal that came to light in the last Congress, and I think it fits well within the theme of many of the bills that we are pursuing this week, openness in government. 
   The bill has a straightforward goal. It ensures that future historians have access to Presidential records as the Presidential Records Act intended. 
   This law was adopted after the Watergate scandals to underscore the fact that Presidential records belong to the American people, not to the President, not to his family, but to the American people. It has been a bipartisan proposal from the very beginning. In fact, this bill had bipartisan support not only from Mr. Clay and others, but Mr. Platts and Mr. Burton. 
   The act said that these records would be available to researchers and the general public in a timely manner. This was the rule for over two decades, but in 2001, President George W. Bush issued an executive order that turned the Presidential Records Act on its head and gave Presidents the authority to keep their records out of the public eye. 
   The Bush order gives both current and former Presidents nearly unlimited authority to withhold Presidential records from public view or to delay their release indefinitely. It allows a designee of former Presidents to assert executive privilege after the President's death, and for the first time, it gives former Vice Presidents the authority to assert privilege over their own documents. In short, this gives former Presidents and their heirs the ability to control their legacy and determine what information will be available to history. 
   That undermines the entire purpose of the Presidential Records Act. Historians and scholars need access to Presidential records so that there is an accurate record of a President's term in office and not an alleged version based on what the President chooses to share. 
   During Sunshine Week this bill fits in so well, because it would make sure that information about government and government activities is open to public scrutiny. It is an essential component of this open government agenda. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, protect historical research, and vote for this bill.

   Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you very much for yielding to me. 
   Mr. Speaker, history is important because it informs us of events of the past, so we can learn from those events, not to make the same mistakes or to follow good examples that turned out to be successful. History always is an ongoing process. It is a process of looking at facts and reinterpreting those facts, often in light of current events and matters that are before the researchers at the present time. 
   But there are those who would like to rewrite history for their own purposes, and to the extent that we can keep that from happening, I think this bill goes a long way. It would allow the records, the raw information, to be available, let those who want to interpret those events do so as they see fit; and in doing so, by making these records available to scholars and the public, we can find out the information that we didn't know at the time the events were taking place: what motivated certain decisions, what other factors were being considered, what was going on that led to certain conclusions. 
   There are books now being written about the present day, how we got into Iraq, what we had hoped to do, what we still hope we can accomplish, what the thinking was of those who led us into the adventure. Many of the books have been praiseworthy, and most of them have been quite critical. But it won't be until the judgment of history that we will be able to fill in many of the gaps that remain. 
   So, at some point, Presidential records help scholars fill in those gaps. That is why I think it is so worthwhile to have this information available, at least at a time when there is some historical perspective. Many times it is after the President has passed on, but certainly long after the President's administration. 
   During the Nixon period, President Nixon thought that the records belonged to him, and he sought, as I recall, a tax break for donating his records to a nonprofit organization. He felt he could control those records. 
   Well, I think the American people looked at that and said, wait a minute, some things are his, the President's, to do with as he sees fit, but some things don't really belong to him.     
   They belong to the American people. They belong to scholars. They belong to history. And the Presidential Records Act was adopted because of that concern. It has worked well for several decades, and it is only when we saw the executive order presented by President George W. Bush that some of the concerns have been raised because that Presidential order overturned the one that was put into effect by President Reagan implementing the post-Watergate legislation. 
   So I wanted to use this additional time to give some historical background to this matter. We heard from many scholars, as the chairman of the subcommittee indicated, who set out the reasons why they thought it was important to be able to get this information, the Archivist, Mr. Weinstein, Presidential scholars like Mr. Dallek and Mr. Reeves, particularly, who have written about recent Presidents, urged us to adopt this legislation. And I am pleased that now we are considering it. And it is important, it is a good government bill, and we are doing it in the appropriate way, in a bipartisan spirit where we vote together on the committee. And I commend all those involved. And I know now, because I have just been informed, that the next bill is ready for consideration of the House.

   Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Clay, the chairman of the subcommittee, and I thank the gentleman from Ohio, the ranking member of the subcommittee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I first of all have to express my regret in response to the complaint that, while we have openness in government, we had an amendment to this bill suddenly presented to the minority.     
   And let me explain why that happened. The legislation before us was completely bipartisan in committee. I don't think anybody voted against the bill passing out of our committee, for all the reasons that both the Chair of the subcommittee and the ranking member described, and I would like to get into those substantive issues as well, because this is the best known and most important of the freedom of information that people look to when they want to be able to find out what government is doing. It is called the Freedom of Information Act for that reason. 
   But we did not have presented to us in committee any objection to the fact that there is a score on this bill of $7 million. But because there is a score, we found out last night that there might be an objection to the bill; and we didn't want to have an objection to the bill, possibly cause people to come to the floor and vote against something as important as the Freedom of Information Act. So we added an amendment to the bill that simply provided that the $7 million, which, by the way, is only expended if the government is sued and loses and has to pay the penalty owed to people for withholding the information. But because there is a $7 million score, we added to this bill that there would be nothing paid unless there is an appropriation of that money. So the bill would not be scored as costing any money at all. 
   I wish we had more time to bring this to everyone's attention, but no one brought to our attention in the committee that there was concern about this score. 
   Nevertheless, this bill goes to the heart of the public's access to find out information about what its government is doing. And as we look at what we have designated ``Sunshine Week,'' we are considering this legislation to improve and strengthen this vital law. 
   H.R. 1309 has been in effect for 40 years, but yet we have a dozen provisions that will increase public access to information under FOIA. These provisions will help FOIA requesters obtain timely responses to their requests, reduce the backlogs at agencies, increase transparency in agency compliance, and provide an alternative to litigation for requesters who are facing delays or denials. 
   In addition, this bill will restore an important element of the Freedom of Information Act, the presumption of disclosure. Through memoranda issued in 2001 and 2002, the Bush administration discouraged agencies from releasing any document if they could find a technical reason for withholding it. This bill before us today reverses this policy by codifying the presumption of disclosure. Under this bill, agencies will revert to their former policies that emphasized public disclosure and supported the withholding of information only when the agency could foresee a harm from disclosure. This is an important change that will ensure continued public access to government information. 
   The bill is a bipartisan bill, it is an important bill for openness in government, and I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAXMAN. (PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY DONATION REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Connecticut for yielding to me and for managing this  legislation. It will be the first of a number of bills that we think are important for openness, transparency, accountability and sunshine in government. 
   This particular legislation has strong bipartisan support. The gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan) introduced it originally several years ago, and we are building on his proposal. It is a wise proposal because it would provide for disclosure of contributions that are made for Presidential libraries. 
   There is nothing wrong with contributing to Presidential libraries, but at the present time contributions to Presidential libraries can be of any amount, from my source, and they need not be disclosed. This is a loophole that calls for abuse. Whether it is real or perceived, we should not have special interest groups making contributions to a Presidential library with the expectation that they may receive something in return. We should not allow foreign governments even to contribute to Presidential libraries. 
   This legislation would require disclosure of contributions that are made to Presidential libraries and their affiliates. 
   It is interesting to see that in recent years Presidential libraries and their affiliated institutions have grown and become increasingly expensive. It cost more than $80 million, although I even think that is a lot of money, but that was what it cost to build the George H.W. Bush Library. President Clinton went and doubled that amount, and it took $165 million to build his library. There are recent reports suggesting that the projected fund-raising target for this President Bush's target library is $500 million. 
   I think that we ought to have disclosure, as do my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. It is time for openness and sunshine in the area of these contributions, and I strongly support it. 
   I want to commend all of the people who have been involved in this legislation, the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Clay; the ranking member, Mr. Turner, and all of those involved.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAXMAN. (WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. I thank the gentleman from Iowa for yielding me the time and for managing this bill. He has played a very important role in the committee in the formulation of this legislation and is far more knowledgeable than many of us because he has had experience in bringing whistleblower lawsuits as an attorney. 
   Mr. Chairman, this bill that we are considering at this time would  strengthen one of our most important weapons against waste, fraud and abuse, and that is Federal whistleblower protections. Protecting whistleblowers is a key component of government accountability. 
   Federal employees are on the inside. They can see where there is waste going on or if there is corruption going on. They can see the signals of incompetent management, and what we want is to enable them to let us know, those of us in Congress, about these kinds of problems. So this bill would give them the protections to come forward and, in effect, blow the whistle on what they know is going on and is not right to be continued. 
   But I want to emphasize that one of the most important provisions of H.R. 985 protects national security whistleblowers.     
   It is impossible to overstate how essential this provision will be. Now, there may be an attempt to try to strike this provision, and I want to make clear to my colleagues why they should not be misled into voting for such a motion. 
   There are a lot of Federal officials who knew the intelligence on Iraq was wrong. Officials in the CIA and the State Department knew that Iraq did not try to import uranium from Niger. Officials in the Energy Department knew the aluminum tubes were not suitable for nuclear centrifuges. Other officials knew the information from ``Curveball,'' the so-called informant that turned out to be inaccurate, but the information that he was spreading about so-called mobile weapons labs were completely bogus. 
   But none of these officials would come forward. In fact, none of them could come forward to Congress and share their doubts. If they did, they could have been stripped of their security clearances, or they could have been fired. 
   And we all know what the result has been. Nobody blew the whistle on the phony intelligence that got us into the Iraq war. 
   It is imperative that national security employees be protected against retribution so they will not be afraid to report national security abuses to Members of Congress. When the intelligence is wrong, the consequences for our Nation can be immense. 
   H.R. 985 also extends whistleblower protections to employees of Federal contractors. Every year, Federal contractors do more and more of the government's work. In 2005, nearly 40 cents of every Federal dollar, outside of the entitlements, went to private companies. We need to encourage the employees of these private companies to report wasteful spending. 
   We heard testimony in our Oversight Committee about a Halliburton truck driver, not just one but many of them, who were told, if they had a flat tire or some mechanical problem, not to worry about it, torch the truck. They will just go and buy another one. After all, these were cost-plus contracts. 
   Well, this abuse was so wanton that one of the truck drivers finally blew the whistle. But rather than being protected for speaking out for the American taxpayer, he was fired. 
   Finally, passage of this bill would stop this kind of intimidation. This legislation includes an important provision that will help check the growing problem of political interference with science. It gives explicit provisions to protect the Federal employee who reports instances where Federal scientific research is suppressed or distorted for political reasons. 
   Don't buy the argument that this should be struck. We ought to protect scientists from those that would try to suppress or distort their scientific work. 
   The bill is bipartisan. It was cosponsored by Ranking Member and former Chairman TOM DAVIS of the Oversight Committee and former subcommittee Chair TODD PLATTS. It passed unanimously last month by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. 
   It is carefully crafted legislation that protects both our national security and the interests of the American taxpayer, and I urge its adoption.  
   Mr. Chairman, I am including with my statement copies of letters between my Committee, Oversight and Government Reform, and the Committee on Homeland Security regarding jurisdiction.

   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, today we have an opportunity to begin the end of American military involvement in Iraq. 
   I am so troubled by the war that I'm tempted to vote no on the supplemental spending bill (H.R. 1591) and claim a moral victory. 
   But our actions have consequences. If the war's opponents side with its proponents to defeat this bill, we will have won a moral victory at an unacceptable cost. It will give the President and our Republican colleagues the result they're hoping for. They know if the bill fails, the House will pass legislation to give the President a blank check to do whatever he wants in Iraq. 
   H.R. 1591 contains legally binding language that will force the President to begin redeploying troops by March 2008 and to completely withdraw them by September 2008. It is the only legislation with a realistic chance of passing that will extract us from the war. 
   H.R. 1591 makes sure that we give our troops and veterans support they desperately need. It includes significant increases in funding for healthcare services, troop readiness and protection, and military housing. It will fix the scandalous situation at Walter Reed Hospital. And, it requires overdue reforms in Iraq contracting. 
   The Bush Administration is pursuing a failed, delusional policy. We cannot stabilize Iraq alone and we cannot do so militarily. We must find a diplomatic solution with Iraq's neighbors and the international community. H.R. 1591 puts us on that path, and I urge Members to vote for it.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAXMAN. (OPEN GOVERNMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me and I want to congratulate him on this accomplishment. This is a very good bill. Many people have played an important role in getting this bill to us today, and none any less than the chairman of the subcommittee who has shepherded it through to this point. 
   I rise in support of the OPEN Government Act. The bill contains important provisions to improve public access to government records. This year the House of Representatives passed a series of good government bills to improve openness and accountability in the executive branch. These bills include legislation to increase access to Presidential records, improve contractor accountability, strengthen whistleblower protections, disclose information about donors to Presidential libraries, and enhance the independence of agency inspectors general. 
   This bill, S. 2488, is the first part of this reform agenda that Congress will enact into law. 
   The Senate bill is not as strong as the House-passed bill. It does not include a provision which I thought was a key one establishing a presumption that government records should be released to the public unless there is a good reason to keep them secret. But the legislation does include important reforms to the Freedom of Information Act, our Nation's best-known and most widely used open government law. 
   The provisions in this bill will help FOIA requesters obtain responses to their requests, reduce backlog at all agencies, and increase transparency in agency compliance, improve access to attorneys' fees for requesters who are improperly denied information, and provide an alternative to litigation for requesters who are facing delay or denials. 
   The Bush administration has an obsession with secrecy. Over the last 7 years, it has systematically undermined our open government laws, while radically expanding its powers to operate in secret. Government today has more power than ever to peer into the private lives of American citizens; yet American citizens know less and less about what their government is actually doing. 
   It will take a concerted effort over many years to peel back this curtain of secrecy. We need to restore the presumption that government records belong to the taxpayer. We need more certain deadlines and stronger penalties if this legislation makes little headway in reducing FOIA delays. And we still need to enact the other good government reforms that this body has already passed but that remain stalled in the Senate. 
   But this bill is a good first step. I am proud that this Congress is fighting for the public's right to know and urge adoption of this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. It's a good bill as far as it goes. It's not the best bill. I know we always hear statements extolling legislation as if it were the best thing since sliced bread. The bill has some very positive features. It will give Americans more fuel-efficient automobiles. That could save families $700 to $1,000 a year, money that won't be going to the Middle East. 
   The legislation will give Americans more efficient appliances and consumer goods, saving us hundreds of billions of dollars on electricity bills over the next few decades. In the House Oversight Committee, we reported out a provision in this bill that will dramatically improve the efficiency of new and renovated Federal buildings and reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy use. 
   But this bill did not keep the provision adopted in the House for renewable energy, renewable energy that would have moved us away from burning fossil fuels like natural gas and coal for our electricity. That was taken out of the House bill, and then the Senate put in a provision that would have enormous loan guarantees for nuclear power and the coal industry. So when you look at the balance of what we are doing for renewables, it is minuscule compared to what we are putting in for loan guarantees for nuclear and coal. Now, that is not in this bill, but it is in the omnibus bill, and I am very disappointed in that provision. 
   I am disappointed that we didn't go further in a lot of other areas, but we are going to have to fight for those in the next year. At this point, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I guess it is the best we could do, and it has got some good features in it. On that basis, I will vote for the legislation and urge my colleagues to vote for it as well.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAXMAN. (ELECTRONIC MESSAGE PRESERVATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5811, the Electronic Message Preservation Act of 2008, and I want to thank Representatives Clay and Hodes for their commitment to oversight and accountability and for their hard work on this bill. 
   The Electronic Message Preservation Act amends both the Federal Records Act and the Presidential Records Act to ensure the preservation of e-mail records. 
   In recent years, e-mail has become an essential form of communication and a key source of information about Federal decision-making. Despite the importance of these records, serious deficiencies exist in the way e-mails are preserved both by the White House and Federal agencies. The preservation of these records must be improved if historians are to have access to a complete record of government decision-making and if Congress is to perform needed oversight. 
   Under President Bush, the White House has allowed senior officials to use nongovernmental e-mail accounts maintained by the Republican National Committee for official business. An investigation by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform found that many of these e-mails have been destroyed. Other e-mails have been lost because the White House relied for 5 years on an e-mail archiving system described as ``primitive'' by a former White House information technology officer. 
   While the problems have been particularly acute under the Bush administration, other administrations, including President Clinton, have also encountered problems preserving e-mail records. 
   To ensure that these Presidential records are appropriately preserved, H.R. 5811 directs the Archivist to establish standards for the capture, maintenance and preservation of e-mail records and to certify that the White House is meeting these standards. 
   Committee investigations have also revealed that Federal agencies are inconsistent in the management of e-mail records. Most agencies still rely on an unreliable ``print and file'' process to preserve e-mail records rather than preserving them electronically. 
   GAO, in a report released yesterday, found that senior agency officials are not compliant with key e-mail preservation requirements. GAO reviewed the practices of senior agency officials and determined that the e-mails were not retained in adequate record keeping systems, making the e-mail records easier to lose or delete and harder to find and use. 
   This bill would modernize agency record keeping. The bill directs the Archivist to issue regulations mandating that within 4 years of the enactment of this legislation, all Federal agencies manage and preserve their e-mail records electronically. 
   Mr. Speaker, some have said that this bill is about preserving history. And it is. But it also is about our constitutional responsibility for oversight and for holding this and any administration accountable. Access to Presidential and Federal records helps us do our job. I urge all Members to support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Thank you very much for yielding. 
   The issue of energy is very much related to this question of e-mails and the preservation of the records. Now, why do we have our energy problems in this country? Suddenly Republicans are saying, notwithstanding the fact that they have run this government for 7 1/2 years, the Democrats, the Democrats are at fault. 
   Well, let me point out that as soon as President Bush came into office, he asked Vice President Cheney to chair an energy task force, and they operated in secrecy. We don't know exactly who they heard from or what they were asked to do, but we know that the legislation that the administration requested from the Congress was for billions of dollars to be given to the oil, gas, coal, and nuclear industries, industries that are making record profits. 
   Now, at that same time, those of us from California were having a very difficult situation because energy wholesalers, including Enron, were holding back supplies in order to drive up the price, and we all met with Vice President Cheney. And you know what he said to us, The reason you're having high prices of electricity is because of environmental laws. And we said, No, it's because we're being taken to the cleaners by Enron and other energy wholesalers. And he said, No, it's not true. Well, when we did our investigations on Enron, we found out it was exactly what was happening. 
   Now, the point I want to make is we don't know what went on with this administration's deliberations for energy policy. We know that they've all failed. We wouldn't have the high price of gas today if they had done their job of getting us off our reliance on oil because we're so dependent now on bringing in oil from overseas. Even if we drill every possibility in the United States, we'd still be importing oil from places that are very vulnerable and are very hostile to us. 
   But this energy task force, and this administration, proposed benefits for the oil companies and no policies to help us get out of that dependence on foreign oil and domestic oil, to look for alternatives, to look for conservation, to do something other than drill, drill, drill, and make the oil companies more profitable. 
   And when we tried to find out what went on, we couldn't get the e-mails. We couldn't look at the e-mails. And why? Well, do you know why? Because they weren't using e-mails from the government of the United States while they were doing government business.  They were using the e-mails of the Republican National Committee. Are they doing Party business or are they doing government business? 
   That's one of the reasons we need this bill, and we need to get away from this partisanship on the question of high oil prices.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, I want to point out to everyone who is listening to this debate that fundamentally this bill is about accountability and preventing cover-up. On the Oversight Committee, we have seen firsthand how destruction of e-mails frustrates accountability and allows officials to hide wrongdoing. 
   We investigated Jack Abramoff's contacts with the White House. We saw  that Abramoff told his colleagues that he used the Republican National Committee e-mail accounts when he was dealing with White House officials so that his communications would remain secret. This bill shuts down that loophole. It says Jack Abramoff can't send secret e-mails to White House officials. 
   We tried to investigate the false intelligence that led to the war in Iraq, but this investigation did not have access to Karl Rove's e-mails because they were destroyed. This bill says that Karl Rove's e-mails have to be preserved and not destroyed. 
   We tried to investigate the Cheney Energy Task Force, which gave us the energy policy this Nation has followed under President Bush for the last 7 1/2 years, which I believe has led to these incredible high prices for energy. But once again we needed access to the e-mails to understand what deals were cut with the special interests, including at that time Enron, which played a very active role on Vice President Cheney's Energy Task Force. 
   A vote for this bill will make sure that the White House cannot hide its abuses. What we need is for this bill to pass so we can have honest and open and accountable government. That's why this legislation is before us today. 
   Of course, we don't know what the motion to recommit is until the very last minute; so we have to prepare for whatever may come. This is not a motion to recommit that would destroy the bill, and I appreciate that fact. It's a motion to recommit that, by and large, I think makes sense, and why it wasn't offered as an amendment leaves me perplexed. I do have some minor concerns about the motion to recommit, but that can be worked out in conference. This should have been brought up as an amendment to the bill. But, in effect, a motion to recommit is a motion to amend the bill. And since I do not oppose, in effect, the amendment that's being offered, I will join in support of this motion to recommit because this bill is too important. I know it was minimized a lot in the debate where people said why are we talking about e-mail preservation when we should be talking about drilling in Alaska and off the coast of the United States? Well, they are related because had we been able to have the Energy Task Force, chaired by Cheney, Vice President Cheney, we could have found out how we had this policy decided, and now that we're saddled with it, we could have done something about it 7 1/2 years ago. 
   I will join in support of this motion to recommit, and I will urge my colleagues to vote for it so we can get the bill passed with this amendment that's being offered to it. I urge a vote for the motion. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAXMAN. (CLOSE THE CONTRACTOR FRAUD LOOPHOLE ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5712, the Close the Contractor Fraud Loophole Act. This bill would create a mandatory requirement for Federal contractors to disclose violations of Federal criminal law or significant overcharges discovered with relationship to a Federal contract. It would replace our current system of voluntary disclosure. 
   Moving to mandatory disclosure has been recommended by the Justice Department for good reason, the voluntary disclosure system is simply not working. In fiscal year 2007, only three contractors participated in the Defense Department's voluntary disclosure program.     
   Congressman Welch introduced this bill after the administration exempted contracts performed in Iraq and Afghanistan from a proposal to make fraud reporting mandatory. This exemption made no sense. As this committee's oversight has shown, fraud and over-billing are widespread in Iraq. 
   The administration testified at a hearing before the Government Management Subcommittee that these exemptions were included inadvertently, and they said they made a mistake. This is a mistake that needs to be corrected, and that's why I commend Congressman Welch for pressing this issue and introducing this legislation. If we pass this bill, the real winners will be the Federal taxpayers. 
   Prior to our committee markup on the bill, we worked with Ranking Member Davis to address certain concerns he raised with the way the bill was originally drafted. And I want to thank Mr. Davis for working with us in a constructive manner to ensure passage of this bill. 
   The bill before us, H.R. 5712, as amended, would preserve Representative Welch's original intent while at the same time preserving the legitimate role of the regulatory process. The bill requires that the Federal Acquisition Regulation be amended within 180 days to require disclosure of fraud for both domestic and overseas contracts, and for commercial item contracts. 
   I urge Members to support H.R. 5712, as amended. It has been approved by a bipartisan vote in our committee, and it ought to be overwhelmingly approved in the House as well.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, this is the third of the three bills we had before us out of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee dealing with contracting issues. And I rise in strong support of this bill, H.R. 3928, the Government Funding Transparency Act. This bill requires contractors and other entities that are dependent on taxpayers funds for more than 80 percent of their annual gross revenue to disclose the names and salaries of their most highly compensated officials. 
   This requirement is similar to requirements that already apply to publicly traded companies under the rules of the Security and Exchange Commission and to nonprofit organizations through the Tax Code. It is based on a very simple principle. If you receive the vast amount of your revenue from the public, then the public has a right to know how that money is being spent. 
   The need for this bill became evident when the head of Blackwater, the private security military company, refused to tell Congress how much it earns, how much he earns. Blackwater gets almost all of its revenue from contracts with the Federal Government, yet Eric Prince, the head of the company, refused to answer Congressman Murphy when Mr. Murphy asked how much he earned. 
   As originally introduced by Representative Murphy last October, H.R. 3928 would have applied only to government contractors. Some felt that this approach unfairly singled out those entities, and we worked with the ranking member of the committee, Representative TOM DAVIS, to address this concern. And I believe that the result is a much stronger bill. 
   The measure before us today applies to any entity that receives government funding, whether through a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, subsidy or any other form of Federal funding. The measure will bring much needed sunshine to how tax dollars are spent, including on contracts. Under the bill, companies that are privately held that receive the vast majority of their revenues from taxpayers' dollars would be required to disclose the salaries of their top officers. 
   I want to congratulate and express my appreciation to Congressman Murphy for introducing this commonsense bill. American taxpayers have a right to know where their hard earned dollars are going. 
   I commend the sponsor and those who have worked on this bill on both sides of the aisle. And I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan piece of legislation.

   Mr. WAXMAN. I thank the gentleman from the great State of New York, the able chairman of the subcommittee, for yielding to me. 
   H.R. 3033, as amended, would create a centralized governmentwide database of information to more effectively monitor the award of Federal tax dollars. It would include not only information on companies and grantees that have been debarred by the Federal Government, but also information on civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings that have been concluded against contractors and grant recipients. 
   No such comprehensive database currently exists, and creating one would allow more efficient monitoring of Federal procurement and assistance programs.  
   This is a commonsense initiative that would allow the Federal Government to track fraudulent contractors and grantees and stop them from moving from agency to agency if they are debarred. 
   The bill was introduced by Representative Maloney, and it is modeled on legislation that she passed for the city of New York when she was a city council member. That law has been very effective for the city. 
   The ranking member of the Oversight Committee, Representative TOM DAVIS, raised a number of concerns with the bill as originally drafted, and we worked with Representative Davis and his staff to try to address these concerns, and I thank him for his willingness to work with us on this matter. 
   We have also made changes reflected in the bill before us today to address concerns raised by other committees with certain provisions in the bill. As I understand it, some letters have been sent out in opposition to the bill without knowing that those changes have been made to address the concerns that were raised. The result that we have before us today is a measure that enjoys bipartisan support. I urge Members to support H.R. 3033, as amended.

   Mr. WAXMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 814, a commonsense bill that will protect children from severe harm. 
   The Children's Gasoline Burn Prevention Act will resolve a long-standing loophole in Federal law. For more than 30 years, we have required that household hazardous materials be sold in child resistant containers. Gasoline cans were exempt from this requirement for one simple reason. They are sold empty. They do not hold any hazardous material when they are purchased. 
   This is a meaningless distinction--the sole purpose of these cans is to hold gasoline, a highly flammable and dangerous material. This bill will require that companies sell cans that children can't open. 
   I worked with my colleague Dennis Moore to introduce a similar bill last Congress, after I learned about young children who were killed or permanently injured in fires that began when the children accidentally opened a gas can. Stephen Diaz, a California boy, is just one example. He opened a gas can in his family garage and knocked it over. The fumes ignited, and he was burned over half of his body. This fire, and many others, could and should have been prevented. 
   I am pleased that the bill has been reintroduced this Congress and is on the floor today. The Children's Gasoline Burn Prevention Act is a simple but important piece of legislation that I urge my colleagues to support.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAXMAN. (PERMITTING USE OF ROTUNDA FOR A CEREMONY COMMEMORATING THE DAYS OF REMEMBRANCE OF VICTIMS OF THE HOLOCAUST -- (House of Representatives - March 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to be the sponsor of this resolution to authorize the use of the Capitol rotunda on April 19, 2007 for the annual congressional ceremony to commemorate the Holocaust. 
   The United States was one of the first countries to adopt a national day for Holocaust commemoration. It is one of the only nations in the world to observe Yom Hashoah, Holocaust Heroes and Remembrance Day, on the same day chosen by the State of Israel--the Hebrew anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. 
   Each year, on Yom Hashoah communities around the United States come together to memorialize the millions who perished. We remember the heroism of those who fought back and pay tribute to the survivors and the tremendous courage and strength it took for them to rebuild their lives. We stand against the anti-Semitism and intolerance that fed the Nazi machine and sadly continues to resurface today. 
   While this resolution may be routine by nature, it is a testament to the commitment of Congress to make sure that the history of the Holocaust is never forgotten or repeated. 
   I would like to thank the House administration for its work on this legislation. I encourage all of my colleagues to participate in the ceremony in the rotunda.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAXMAN. (EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, or ENDA. This legislation is long overdue. Prejudice has no place in the workplace. 
   Nearly 10 years ago, the Federal Government set a bold example when President Clinton issued an executive order specifically outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal government. Today, 22 States, the District of Columbia and more than 180 cities and counties nationwide have enacted laws prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace. I am proud that my home State of California and my congressional district in Los Angeles have played a leading role in the effort to promote understanding, acceptance, tolerance, and equality for gay Americans. 
   But congressional leadership is sorely needed to set a national standard for this fundamental civil rights protection. The health of our democracy requires that all Americans be entitled to justice. Civil rights and human rights should not stop at State boundaries. 
   Like many civil rights battles before it, the fight for gay rights has been long, arduous, and frustrating. In recent years, we have faced many setbacks with anti-gay initiatives by President Bush and Republicans in Congress that serve only to fan the flames of intolerance and bigotry. 
   The tide is turning. Earlier this year the Democratic leadership in the House and Senate achieved victories with hate crimes legislation that would criminalize attacks against individuals based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. With the passage of ENDA, we will push further by making it illegal to fire, refuse to hire, or deny a promotion to an individual on the basis of sexual orientation. 
   As an original cosponsor of H.R. 2015, a more comprehensive version of this legislation, I am disappointed that H.R. 3685 does not protect against discrimination based on gender identity. I strongly support the amendment Representative Baldwin will offer to include gender identity in H.R. 3685 and if that amendment is not adopted, I pledge to work for an ENDA that includes gender identity. 
   I look forward to passing this landmark legislation, which is a great leap forward for equal rights.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAXMAN. (UNITED STATES-PERU TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement. This has not been an easy decision. This is not an ideal agreement. But it contains significant improvements negotiated by the Democratic leadership. And because of these changes the agreement represents a critical step toward a more progressive trade policy that raises standards for labor, the environment, and public health. 
   Under the Bush Administration, U.S. trade policy has gone from bad to worse. Instead of using trade agreements to raise standards of living, the U.S. Trade Representative has approached negotiations putting corporations ahead of consumers and profits ahead of people. 
   In recent agreements with Central America, Morocco, and others, labor standards an environmental rules have been made expendable and unenforceable on paper and in practice. Trade provisions aggressively pursued on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry have sought to delay generic competition in developing countries where the absence of affordable medicine can mean the difference between life and death. 
   Initially, the Peru FTA was no different. However, this spring the Democratic congressional leadership successfully negotiated substantial improvements to the agreement. 
   On the medicines issue, specifically, the revised FTA restores much of the flexibility needed to safeguard generic competition and protect public health. For example, patent extensions are no longer mandatory in the event of regulatory delays. The agreement directs patent disputes to be resolved through the court system, instead of forcing regulatory agencies to link marketing approval to the status of a drug's patent. Language was also added to make clear that the FTA does not and should not prevent Peru from taking measures to protect public health. 
   The Peru FTA is not perfect. There is a provision that delays the availability of generics for up to 5 years after a new drug is approved, even in the absence of a patent. USTR maintains that this ``data exclusivity'' provision is supposed to mirror a provision in U.S. law intended to incentivize research by allowing drug companies to recoup the costs associated with producing the clinical test data necessary for drug approval. But Peru is not a mirror image of the United States. It is a small developing market where the profitability for drug makers is minimal and the impact on a large population of poor and uninsured patients could be severe. 
   The revised Peru FTA does make clear that Peru can override this five-year restriction if public health needs demand it. Additionally, the new FTA has a mechanism for generic medicines to become available in Peru no later than they are available in the United States. However even with these key exceptions, I believe data exclusivity is a clear example of how further changes are necessary in our negotiations with developing countries. 
   Another area that needs reevaluation is the ``investor-state'' provisions that permit private investors to use trade tribunals to bypass regular legal channels in challenging government actions and regulations. While there have been some improvements to make the tribunals more transparent, greater reform is necessary to prevent abusive and unfair efforts by investors to undermine environment, health, safety and other laws and regulations. I would also like to see further progress to use trade agreements to strengthen adherence to core labor standards. 
   The bottom line is that overall the improvements to the Peru FTA are a real achievement. Today, we can finally put a stop to the Bush Administration's ``one size fits all'' approach to trade negotiations. While it will take more than a revised Peru FTA to overhaul our trade policy in broader ways, this trade agreement is an important first step in the right direction. For that reason I will support it today.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAXMAN. (FEDERAL REAL PROPERTY DISPOSAL ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5787, the Federal Real Property Disposal Enhancement Act. This is a bipartisan solution to address some on the deficiencies that exist in Federal real property management. I want to commend Representatives Moore and Duncan for introducing this bill, and Ranking Member DAVIS for working with me over many years on property issues. 
   As GAO has indicated by placing Federal real property on its ``high risk'' list, problems abound. One such problem is that unneeded buildings are in the Federal inventory. The magnitude of the problem with excess Federal real property means that agencies are spending billions of dollars maintaining properties no longer relevant to agencies' missions. 
   The Federal Real Property Disposal Enhancement Act seeks to address some of the hurdles that agencies are facing regarding disposal of their unneeded property. 
   One key provision allows the General Services Administration to use its funds to prepare properties to be declared excess by other agencies. Agencies and GAO have testified that the cost of preparing a property for transfer or sale serves as a disincentive to disposal because, in the short term, it can be more beneficial economically to maintain a property that is not being used than to dispose of it. Basically, it is cheaper to pay to mow the grass and have a security guard than to do appraisals, surveys, and environmental studies. 
   Another key provision allows all agencies to retain 100 percent of the proceeds from sale. Most large landholding agencies already have this benefit. However, smaller ones, such as the Federal Communications Commission, which owns vacant towers, do not. After GSA obtained the authority to retain proceeds in 2005, its disposals increased. 
   In addition, the bill clarifies that when a piece of property has been given to a nonprofit or State or local government for a public purpose and that public purpose ceases to exist, the federal government must revert the property and dispose of it. The bill also calls on GSA to issue guidance on disposing of excess properties and requires agencies to develop and implement plans to dispose of their excess property. 
   This is a commonsense measure and I am hopeful all members will be able to support it.

Nobel Prize economists have recommended alternative approaches, but almost all of them have said, ``Don't leave without passing something.'' This is a Republican bill which must pass with bipartisan votes. Many Democrats don't like it. Many Republicans are choking on it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in reluctant support of H.R. 3997, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. 
   This is an easy bill to vote against. It was presented to us by a Republican President and Republican Administration so blinded by their ideology of deregulation that it kept them from preventing this crisis. This is a Republican bill which must pass with bipartisan votes. Many Democrats don't like it. Many Republicans are choking on it. 
   But for now, it would be irresponsible to do nothing and I will vote for this bill. 
   Our economy has been imperiled by a combination of runaway greed on Wall Street and stunning indifference to oversight and regulation from Washington. It is fundamentally unfair that the taxpayers are being asked to pay $700 billion to bail out Wall Street, while the executives who made the reckless investments can walk away with millions. Yet that is what the Administration asked us to do. 
   Because of the masterful work of Chairman Barney Frank and others, this bill is much improved. Some of the worst elements of the Administration's plan have been modified. But at its core, what we are voting on is the Bush bailout plan. 
   In essence, the Administration has forced us to choose between adopting their plan or doing nothing. This is a Hobson's choice. 
   I would have preferred that we take a different approach. Nobel Prize economists have recommended alternative approaches. A broad range of economists have urged the Administration and Congress to take more time and to consider alternatives that would put less burden on the taxpayers. 
   But the Bush Administration has been adamant that Congress adopt its approach. They have steadfastly resisted considering other options to protect the taxpayer. 
   I have reluctantly decided to vote for the plan, but I do so only because the alternative of doing nothing is worse. Even the economists who question the structure and effectiveness of the Administration's proposal say that doing nothing would imperil our economy. That is a risk we should not take. 
   We urgently need to enact comprehensive reform of our financial markets. That is why the Oversight Committee will be conducting a series of hearings starting next week to examine what went wrong and who should be held accountable. These hearings will help provide all members with a roadmap to the reforms we will need to place into law under the next Administration. 
   I want to comment specifically on the provisions in the bill which ensure that the Government Accountability Office will have adequate access to documents and persons involved in the Troubled Asset Relief Program. As the chair of the committee with jurisdiction over GAO, I was involved in writing this important language. 
   GAO oversight is a critical component in ensuring the $700 billion is spent wisely and responsibly. To do its important job, GAO will need broad access to information. The legislative language reflects this by providing GAO with access to ``any information, data, schedules, books, accounts, financial records, reports, files, electronic communication, or other papers, things, or property belonging to or in use by the TARP, or any vehicles established by the Secretary under this Act, and to the officers, directors, employees, independent public accountants, financial advisors, and other agents and representatives of the TARP ..... or any such vehicle at such reasonable time as the Comptroller may request.'' 
   This right of access covers both papers and people. GAO has a right to review any documents and communications that relate to the financial rescue program, regardless of whether they are federal records or the records of contractors hired to help run the program. Equally important, the language gives GAO the right to interview the federal officials and the private accountants, advisors, and others who are involved in administering the program. The transactions envisioned by the Act are going to be complex by their very nature. To understand these complex transactions, GAO will need direct access to the individuals most knowledgeable about the program, and this legislation gives them this right. 
   The legislation provides that GAO's access is provided ``to the extent otherwise consistent with law.'' This phrase ensures that where the rights of access provided by this legislation overlap with existing rights of access, they should be applied consistently. A good example involves GAO's right to enforce its right of access to federal records. Another provision of law, 31 U.S.C. 716, spells out in detail the steps GAO must take to enforce its right to documents. In the event of a conflict with the Treasury Department over access to documents, GAO should use its existing authority under section 716 to enforce its right of access. 
   In some important respects, the GAO language in this bill goes beyond existing law. For example, it gives GAO rights to interview federal officials that GAO does not have under other laws. These new rights are being extended to GAO because of the importance of GAO oversight to the success of this unprecedented intervention in the markets. 
   This is not an easy vote for any member, and it is not an easy vote for me. But in the end, we cannot let our anger at the excesses on Wall Street lead us to reject a bill that could avoid a calamity for Main Street. That is why I am going to support this legislation.

   Mr. WAXMAN. Madam Speaker, I stand in support of H.R. 7217, the Federal Real Property Disposal Enhancement Act. H.R. 7217 is the byproduct of bipartisan bicameral collaboration and I want to congratulate Representatives MOORE and DUNCAN for their commitment to federal real property reform. I also want to acknowledge Senators CARPER and COBURN for their dedication also. I must also recognize the hard work and efforts of Ranking Member DAVIS. 
   What we have before us is a sensible bill which will help move surplus real property out of the federal inventory. The bill allows the General Services Administration (GSA) to help pay the costs of other agencies' disposal activities. In particular, GSA will be able to help agencies pay costs with regard to properties that have yet to be declared excess. These costs include environmental cleanup, demolition, surveying, and life cycle costing. 
   In addition, this bill modifies existing law to make clear that when a property has been transferred to a nonprofit organization or a state or local government for a public purpose, and that public purpose is no longer being met, the property must revert to the Federal Government, which must dispose of it. 
   The bill also allows all agencies to retain the proceeds from the sale of federal surplus properties. These proceeds will be used for disposal activities and also may be used for maintenance and repairs. 
   Moreover, the bill includes a pilot program, under which agencies can, for certain properties scheduled for demolition, avoid the quarterly suitability canvas performed by Housing and Urban Development (HUD), allowing agencies to try and dispose of such properties on an accelerated timeframe. 
   Furthermore, this bill ensures strong data collection and reporting so the Federal Government can keep track of the real property in its inventory. Madam Speaker, passage of this bill, a work in progress for over six years, will make federal real property reform a reality. I urge passage. 
   Attached is an exchange of letters regarding jurisdiction.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Senate amendments to H.R. 928, the Improving Government Accountability Act. This bill, introduced by Representative Cooper, was favorably reported by the Oversight Committee on August 2, 2007, with strong support from members across the political spectrum. 
   There is a simple reason why this bill has so much support: it strengthens the Inspectors General, who are the first line of defense against waste, fraud, and abuse in federal programs. 
   The last six years have given us examples of Inspectors General at their best and at their worst. 
   Stuart Bowen, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, has uncovered fraud and saved American taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. Clark Kent Erving and Richard Skinner, the former and current IGs for the Department of Homeland Security, have identified billions in wasteful spending in the new Department. Glenn Fine at the Department of Justice; Earl Delvaney at Interior; and Brian Miller at the General Services Administration have all reported courageously on abuses within the agencies they oversee. 
   These and other IGs have fought waste, fraud, and abuse and saved the taxpayers billions of dollars. 
   Yet there are also IGs who seem more intent on protecting their departments from political embarrassment than on doing their job. The Oversight Committee is investigating allegations that the State Department IG has blocked investigations into contract fraud in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Energy and Commerce Committee documented serious abuses by the former IG in the Commerce Department. And the Science Committee has identified serious questions raised about the close relationship of the NASA IG to agency management. 
   This bill strengthens the good IGs by giving them greater independence. Under this legislation, they will have new budgetary independence, and the President or agency head will have to inform Congress 30 days before any IG is removed. 
   At the same time, the legislation enacts in statute new mechanisms for holding bad IGs to account. The legislation establishes an ``Integrity Committee'' that will investigate allegations that IGs have abused the public trust. 
   There have been several key champions of the legislation. Representative Cooper has worked tirelessly on this issue for years and deserves our thanks for his efforts. I would also like to acknowledge Subcommittee Chairman Towns for his tremendous leadership in moving this legislation forward and Ranking Member Tom Davis for his commitment to strong IGs and his many helpful contributions. 
   H.R. 928 would make needed improvements to the IG Act and I urge members to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Chairman, the bill that is before us is a very simple bill. It directs the District of Columbia to comply with the recent Supreme Court decision in the Heller case which held that the second amendment gives individuals the right to have a handgun at home for personal protection. The Heller decision is now the law of the land, and the District of Columbia, just like every other State or local government in this country, has a legal obligation to follow it. 
   Our committee, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has jurisdiction over the District of Columbia and so our committee reported this measure last week to underline the District's legal obligations. The bill tells the city government in very clear, unequivocal terms that it has to conform its law to comply with the Heller decision. It even sets a deadline for the District to complete this effort in 180 days. 
   This measure, sponsored by Ms. Norton and myself and others, was adopted by the committee of jurisdiction by a vote of 21-1. An amendment could have been offered like the amendment that is being offered today. It was not offered in committee. The committee recommended on a vote of 21-1 on a bipartisan basis that we support this legislation. 
   Now I know there is going to be an amendment proposed to this bill, but that amendment would trample on the principle of home rule for the District. If the District of Columbia adopts legislation that complies with the Supreme Court, it is no business of any Representative from other areas in this country to override the decision of the District of Columbia. 
   D.C. residents are the only Americans who pay Federal taxes but are denied a vote in Congress. That is fundamentally wrong, and when Congress overrules the City Council and the mayor, we compound that wrong. The District I believe is acting responsibly, and I think we ought to let them pursue their legislation to comply with the Supreme Court decision. 
   I ask my colleagues to imagine how you would feel if the Congress of the United States tried to dictate the gun laws or any other laws for your district. I think you would be outraged. Yet that is exactly what some Members want to do today. 
   Now we are going to have a substitute amendment that will be offered to Congresswoman Norton's bill that does more than trample on home rule. It is also an exceptionally dangerous  proposal. It repeals key safeguards the District has established to protect our Nation's capital and the many officials who live and work here. Even basic commonsense measures like gun registration which tells law enforcement who possesses a weapon and enables background checks would be repealed. 
   I urge support of the underlying bill and rejection of the substitute.

   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Chairman and my colleagues, the Supreme Court ruled in the Heller case that the District of Columbia could not ban handguns. They said that would violate the second amendment. The Supreme Court said every individual has a right to own a handgun. That's now the law of the land. The District of Columbia has finalized its revision of its laws just today, and I defy any Member of this body to say that the District of Columbia has failed to comply with the second amendment to the Constitution under the Heller decision. I think that the District of Columbia has complied with that law. I know we've heard from Members of Congress that D.C. is unwilling to comply and that they're unwilling to live by the law of the land. Well, let us examine that D.C. law more carefully. Since it only was finally enacted today, I would suggest that when this bill goes to the other body that they hold this bill up and review that D.C. law. 
   The District of Columbia is not obligated to do all of the things that are in this substitute. In fact, not one single provision of H.R. 6691 is required by the second amendment or by the Supreme Court decision in the Heller case. Let me just walk through it. 
   One provision removes the District's longstanding ban on semiautomatic assault rifles and pistols. Well, there is nothing in the second amendment that guarantees an individual's right to high-powered military assault rifles capable of firing more than 30 rounds without reloading. There is certainly nothing in the Heller case that says that. Evidently, the people who are offering this substitute don't like the fact that the D.C. Government agreed with that provision, but they said that they would limit it to 10 rounds. Well, there is nothing in the Constitution that says it has to be 30 or more. 
   One provision of this substitute removes the District's longstanding provision for a registration system, which includes D.C.'s required background checks before someone can buy a gun. Well, there is nothing in the second amendment that says individuals have a right not to register their guns. Yet the substitute would wipe out that D.C. law. 
   Now, it was said by one of the advocates of this substitute that this is a burdensome requirement for registration that was put malevolently in place by the District of Columbia. Well, I want you all to know that it was also put in place by California, Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, Michigan, Chicago, Cleveland, New York City, and Omaha, and I don't think that any of those jurisdictions are violating the second amendment to the Constitution. 
   Another provision in this substitute would take away the ability of the District of Columbia's law enforcement authorities, through their registration system, to trace guns used in crimes. It helps them figure out who bought the guns, who transferred them, how they got into the hands of the criminal or terrorist. That's not in violation of the second amendment, and yet this substitute would repeal it. 
   This amendment would allow people to obtain firearms without criminal background checks. I don't know why they think the second amendment requires that, because it does not. 
   This amendment goes far beyond the Heller case. It goes far beyond the second amendment to the Constitution. It is gratuitously rewriting the law of the District of Columbia. It is not our job to rewrite a law passed by the people elected in the District of Columbia if that law complies with the Constitution of the United States. 
   I urge that we reject the substitute amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Madam Chairman, I write today in opposition to the Weldon amendment to the Labor/HHS appropriations bill. This amendment would prohibit appropriated funds from being used to administer thimerosal-containing flu vaccine in the 2008-2009 flu season to children under 3. 
   This legislation is strongly opposed by a number of public health groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Public Health Association, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, the National Association of County and City Health Officials, the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). According to public health officials, this language would pose real risks to public health, particularly to the youngest children who are most susceptible to the serious complications from flu, including death. 
   The American Academy of Pediatrics, in their letter opposing this amendment, assures us that there is scientific evidence that ``the thimerosal in influenza vaccine is not a danger to health.'' The Institute of Medicine examined all of the available evidence on the association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. In 2004 the I0M issued a report that concluded that the evidence was sufficient to say that thimerosal-containing vaccines do not cause autism. 
   Since that time there has been no new compelling evidence that would change the I0M's conclusion. In fact, because thimerosal has been removed from all other pediatric vaccines, children in the last 5 years have received much less thimerosal than they had in the 1990s, and yet autism rates continue to go up, not down. 
   The practical impact of the bill would be that the demand for thimerosal-free vaccine would exceed current production capacity. While technically the bill would prohibit only the youngest children who get Vaccines for Children vaccine from getting thimerosal-containing vaccine, the reality is that the message Congress would be sending to all parents is that the thimerosal-containing vaccine is less safe than the thimerosal-free vaccine. It is likely that most, if not all, parents would demand thimerosal-free vaccine for all of their children. 
   There are simply not enough doses of thimerosal-free vaccine to meet that kind of demand and it is unlikely that there would be for at least several years. Vaccine companies are moving to increase the production of thimerosal-free vaccines, but doing so requires building new facilities, or expanding existing facilities, and then going through a new FDA approval process. 
   Furthermore, there is currently only one company with a licensed thimerosal-free product for children under 3. If that company experienced production problems or delays in its thimerosal-free product, this would leave us without any vaccine for this population. 
   Even if there were sufficient vaccine to immunize all children under 3 with thimerosal-free vaccine, we have a private vaccine distribution system and there would be no way to ensure that each dose of thimerosal-free vaccine would be matched up with a child under 3. In recent years there have been shortages of flu vaccine. In order to make sure that those most susceptible to the flu get vaccinated, CDC has asked that vaccine be given first to priority groups, including very young children, the elderly, health care workers, and people with certain illnesses. Unfortunately, we have seen that this has not worked very well. There is no reason to believe that the system would work any better to make sure that the thimerosal-free vaccine goes first to children under 3. 
   In fact, there is nothing that would prevent one state from buying up all of the thimerosal-free vaccine for its population leaving the rest of the country without vaccine for the youngest children. That could cost lives. These are the children who are most susceptible to the serious complications from flu. 
   I urge Members to consider that this language could harm those very children the authors are trying to help. By restricting their access to flu vaccine, they will not prevent a single child from getting autism, but they may expose children to the very serious risks posed by influenza.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. It is becoming increasingly clear that FDA needs more of two things; it needs more resources and more authority. This is particularly true in the area of post-market drug safety. We are all familiar with the series of high profile drug safety problems with drugs like Vioxx and Avandia. It is no secret that FDA's ability to protect the safety of our drugs is in serious jeopardy. H.R. 2900 makes significant strides in getting FDA both the authorities and resources to improve its oversight of drug safety. 
   I am pleased this bill incorporates many of the provisions in a bill that I introduced with Representative Markey called the Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act of 2007. Our bill incorporates many of the recommendations of a high-profile study by the Institute of Medicine. For example, it will give the FDA the ability to require post-market studies and labeling changes, as well as the ability to impose significant civil monetary penalties to ensure that these things get done in an appropriate and timely way. 
   Another section of the bill would establish mandatory clinical trial registry and results databases. This would bring much-needed transparency to the clinical trials conducted on our fellow citizens and will prevent drug and device companies from hiding negative trial results that cast their products in a negative light. 
   I do regret that one of the most important recommendations made by the IOM was stripped from the committee-reported bill: that Congress give FDA the authority to restrict direct-to-consumer advertising of new drugs with unknown safety risks. If a new drug is heavily marketed as a result of direct-to-consumer ads and a serious risk does emerge, many people will have been unnecessarily exposed to that risk. 
   Similarly, I regret H.R. 2900 does not contain a provision to appropriately tailor the period of exclusivity that blockbuster drugs receive in exchange for conducting pediatric trials under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act. We all share the goal of ensuring that our children get the same benefit from FDA approved drugs and all medical devices, as do adults. But we must make sure that the American consumers are not paying an unjustified price tag for those tests. 
   Nevertheless, the bill as a whole makes significant contributions to the work of the FDA and deserves our support. I do want to emphasize that the FDA will need a significant influx of resources to do what we are asking them to do in this bill. Although H.R. 2900 gives FDA the enhanced ability to dedicate user fee dollars to these activities, it will be critical for Congress to come forward with additional appropriated dollars. We simply have got to get FDA the funds it needs to do their job well. 
   Every day, Americans rely on FDA to protect them from dangerous medicines and devices. Today, we have the opportunity to take a critically important step toward ensuring that FDA can fulfill this mission. 
   Mr. Speaker, I encourage Members to support the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAXMAN. (CONDEMNING THE DECISION BY THE UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE UNION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM TO SUPPORT A BOYCOTT OF ISRAELI ACADEMIA -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Madam Speaker, Anti-Israel propaganda has reached a new low, with a renewed campaign by a group of British academics to boycott Israeli academics and universities. 
   Spearheaded by the British University and College Union, the initiative calls on British academics to refrain from collaborating on research with Israeli counterparts or working with journals published by Israeli companies. 
   It is incumbent upon the United States to oppose this assault on academic freedom and stand against efforts to isolate Israeli institutions. While I am encouraged that there is little support for this initiative beyond a vocal and extreme minority, it appears that similar undertakings have been attempted by British unions representing journalists and government workers. 
   I welcome the bold statements by the UK Education Minister and university presidents across the United States condemning this misguided crusade. Those who sincerely believe in the cause of peace should encourage dialogue, cooperation, and the free exchange of ideas. It is disappointing that the Palestinian trade unions promoting these kinds of boycotts are more interested in promoting prejudice than in building a future of coexistence. 
   With this resolution, let us raise our voices in solidarity with Israel and reaffirm the fundamental values of academic freedom.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAXMAN. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Chairman, this Congress, the House and Senate, have passed important Federal contracting reforms, but neither body has assembled them into a comprehensive package. My ``clean contracting'' amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act consolidates these provisions into a single reform measure. 
   I want to particularly thank Chairman Skelton for working with me to help bring this amendment before the House today. He has been a tremendous partner in the fight to root out waste, fraud and abuse. 
   The clean contracting amendment would require agencies to enhance competition in contracting, limit the use of abuse-prone contracts, rebuild the Federal acquisition workforce, strengthen antifraud measures, and increase transparency in Federal contracting. 
   The provisions of the amendment are based on provisions that have already passed the House or Senate, or are government-wide versions of Defense provisions that passed in last year's DOD authorization. They respond to procurement abuses that the Oversight Committee, the Armed Services Committees, and other committees have identified in hearings and investigative reports. 
   The egregious procurement practices that have occurred in Iraq and in response to Hurricane Katrina and at the  Department of Homeland Security need to be halted. They may enrich companies like Halliburton and Blackwater, but have squandered billions of dollars that belong to the taxpayer. 
   This amendment says that Congress is serious about stopping waste, fraud and abuse. One important provision deals directly with no-bid contracts and requires agencies to develop plans to promote competition. This provision is needed because the value of contracts awarded without full and open competition has more than tripled since 2000, rising from $67 billion in 2000 to almost $207 billion in 2006. Full and open competition provides the government with its best guarantee that tax dollars are being spent economically and efficiently. 
   Another important measure would limit the length of no-bid contracts awarded in emergencies to 9 months. This provision would end the abuses that occurred after Hurricane Katrina when many ``emergency'' contracts were allowed to continue for years. 
   The amendment would also curb the use of cost-plus contracts, which provide contractors with little incentive to control costs. Spending under this kind of contract grew over 75 percent between 2000 and 2005. 
   Another important provision would prohibit contractors from charging excessive mark-up charges for work done by subcontractors. This would prevent the infamous ``blue roof'' scandal following Hurricane Katrina where taxpayers paid almost $2,500 for something that actually cost $300. 
   Other vital provisions of this amendment would provide whistleblower protections to civilian contractor employees, fund increases in the acquisition workforce, and prevent the abuse of interagency contracts, as was the case at Abu Ghraib, where interrogators were hired using an Interior Department contract for information technology. 
   The amendment also includes three provisions which have recently passed the House under suspension of the rules. One, authored by Representative Welch, requires mandatory reporting of fraud by contractors. Another, based on the bill by Representative Murphy, requires the disclosure of CEO salaries if a company makes most of its money from government funds. The third, based on a bill authored by Representative Maloney, requires the development of a database of suspension and debarment information. I want to commend these Members for their hard work on these issues. 
   I also want to particularly thank Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez of the Small Business Committee for working with us to perfect some of the language in this bill. 
   I urge Members to support the Clean Contracting amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding to me. 
   Today, we are considering a bill that will bring democracy to the District of Columbia. This bill will grant the District of Columbia a full vote in the House of Representatives. They have been denied full representation in Congress for over 200 years, and this will help right this long-standing injustice. 
   But I want to use my time to point out that there have been two champions of this legislation who deserve recognition. One is Congresswoman Norton who has been working tirelessly on behalf of her constituents to forge a compromise that has bipartisan support; and the second is the ranking member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and its former Chair, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Tom Davis). 
   Last year as chairman of our committee, he led the charge for voting rights for the District. It was his inspiration that brought this compromise to the point now where I expect this bill will pass the House of Representatives and go on its way to the other body. This is a bill that is long overdue. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this bill.  
   H.R. 1433, the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007, will grant the District of Columbia a full vote in the House of Representatives. 
   District of Columbia residents have been denied full representation in Congress for over 200 years. District residents pay billions of dollars in federal taxes yet get no vote in Congress. This bill will help right this longstanding injustice. 
   There have been two champions of this legislation who deserve recognition. One is Congresswoman Norton, who has worked tirelessly on behalf of her constituents to forge a compromise that has bipartisan support. The second is the Ranking Minority Member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Representative Davis. Last year, as Chairman of the Committee, he led the charge for voting rights for the District. 
   The District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act includes a number of important provisions. 
   This bill will increase the size of the House by two seats. One of those seats will go to the District of Columbia and the other seat will go Utah, the next state in line to get a congressional seat. The bill prevents partisan gerrymandering by creating the new seat for Utah as an at-large seat and by ensuring that Utah does not redistrict its other congressional seats until apportionment is conducted following the 2010 census. 
   H.R. 1433 also contains a nonseverability clause providing that if a court holds one section of this bill invalid or unenforceable, all other sections will be invalid or unenforceable. This is an important safeguard because it means that no section of this legislation can have legal effect unless the entire bill has legal effect. Under this legislation, Utah cannot be granted a seat in the House without the District also being granted a seat or vice versa. 
   H.R. 1433 is a step in the right direction toward providing the residents of the District fair representation in Congress. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.

   Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment to section 6201 of the bill, which is part of the contribution of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee which is a bipartisan one. 
   Section 6201 requires Federal agencies to purchase only low-greenhouse-gas-emitting vehicles for Federal fleets. This provision addresses the Government's contribution to global warming from vehicles which are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. Mr. Cleaver's amendment proposes to extend this requirement to cover Congress, as well. 
   This amendment makes sense. It will further reduce greenhouse gas emissions by expanding the use of low-emitting vehicles. It holds Congress to the same standard we are applying to the executive branch. With this amendment, Congress will be taking another step to fight global warming. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume in discussion of this bill. 
   I rise in support of the bill and to discuss title VI, the Carbon Neutral Government Act. This title would make our government the world leader in addressing global warming, and it would make government operations dramatically more energy efficient. 
   The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform passed this act on a bipartisan voice vote. To make a difference on global warming, we must be bold and realistic at the same time.     
   The Carbon Neutral Government Act strikes this balance. It sets the ambitious goals that we know are necessary to avoid dangerous global warming. Scientists say we need to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050. This legislation asks the Federal Government to lead the way by reducing emissions to meet annual targets and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. 
   The Act also has energy efficiency measures to help agencies achieve these goals, drive technology, and save taxpayers dollars. It requires government vehicles to be low-greenhouse-gas-emitting vehicles. It sets ambitious but achievable goals to increase the energy efficiency of Federal buildings, and it strengthens the requirement for agencies to procure energy efficient products. 
   With this Act, the government will use its leadership and its purchasing power to promote a more vibrant and cleaner economy. 
   I urge support for the legislation.

   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Sarbanes-Wolf amendment to H.R. 3221, the New Direction for Energy Independence, National Security, and Consumer Protection Act. 
   The Sarbanes-Wolf amendment requires Federal agencies to improve their telework programs to allow more employees to participate in telework. This amendment is a positive addition to the bill we are considering today. Telework plays an important role in reducing energy consumption, air pollution, and traffic congestion. 
   Telework has a number of benefits beyond energy savings, including cost savings for agencies and better scheduling flexibility for employees. 
   Greater use of telework can also allow the Federal Government to function in the event of an emergency, whether it is a natural disaster or a terrorist attack. During Hurricane Katrina, a number of Federal workers were displaced and had to scramble to find alternate worksites. Last year, the IRS headquarters building was closed due to flooding and IRS employees had to work from home or from other offices. Effective telework programs can help agencies better respond to these situations. Yet, despite these benefits, some agencies continue to underutilize telework. 
   In 2000, Congress mandated that each executive agency ``establish a policy under which eligible employees of the agency may participate in telecommuting to the maximum extent possible without diminished employee performance.'' 
   According to the most recent survey by the Office of Personnel Management, only about 119,000 of the approximately 2 million Federal employees participated in telework in 2005. That is even with OPM counting employees who only teleworked once per month. 
   This amendment ensures that every Federal employee is eligible to telework unless they have a job that cannot be done from home or from an alternate worksite. 
   This amendment is needed because although some agencies have successful telework programs, there are agencies that do not appear to be doing all they can to make telework available to employees. For example, according to the Department of Transportation, of the over 43,000 employees that work at the Federal Aviation Administration, only about 13,000 are eligible to telework. That is just 30 percent of FAA employees. There are also agencies that are not doing enough to inform management and employees about telework programs. 
   This amendment addresses one of the biggest challenges to telework identified by agencies, resistance from management. Under this amendment, agencies are required to provide telework training to managers and new employees. This amendment also requires agencies to directly notify employees in writing of their eligibility for telework programs. 
   This amendment will provide needed improvements to Federal telework. This amendment is an important step in reducing the Federal Government's energy use. I urge my colleagues to support the Sarbanes-Wolf amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Madam Speaker, I am deeply disappointed that this bill increases the amount of money going to abstinence-only programs. 
   In 2004 I asked my staff to look at the curricula most popular among federally funded grantees in this abstinence-only program. We found that most contained significant scientific and medical errors. Kids were being taught that HIV can be spread through tears and sweat. They were taught that condoms didn't help prevent STD transmission. And they were taught that pregnancy occurs one in every seven times a couple uses condoms. 
   But these findings didn't lead to change--instead the administration and other defenders of this kind of program dug in their heels. They insisted there was no problem, without taking seriously the fact that flawed public health information was being provided to American teens with taxpayer dollars. In 2006, GAO found that HHS still wasn't reviewing the medical accuracy of curricula used in the biggest Federal abstinence-only programs. 
   It would be one thing if these programs actually worked. If they helped kids make healthier decisions, then maybe it would make sense to go in and try to deal with some of the accuracy issues. But abstinence-only programs don't work. In 2007, HHS released the results of an independent study it had requested on the effectiveness of federally funded abstinence-only programs. This was a randomized, controlled study--the gold standard of research. The researchers found that compared to the control group, abstinence-only  programs had no impact at all on whether participants had sex. They had no impact on the age of first sex. They had no impact on the number of partners. And they had no impact on rates of pregnancy or sexually transmitted disease. 
   There is no evidence to support these programs, and they should get no Federal funding. It is an outrage that instead they are receiving an increase. 
   Defenders of abstinence-only like to claim that parents support abstinence education. It's true that surveys show parents want programs to promote abstinence as the healthiest choice for young people. We all want that. But the surveys also show that parents overwhelmingly want a full range of age-appropriate information taught, so that youth are best prepared to stay healthy. 
   Parents care more about the health of their children than about politics or ideology. I think that's probably why they understand that the abstinence-only programs we've been funding are a mistake. They contain serious misinformation and, most importantly, are not effective in improving adolescent health. After putting more than a billion Federal dollars into these programs, we have seen no results. 
   I know it's critical that we pass this appropriations bill. But it's wrong to spend scarce dollars on programs that we know don't work. It's wrong to put our children at risk of health problems and unwanted pregnancies because we've withheld essential health information. And it's indefensible to use adolescents as political pawns instead of taking an honest, evidence-based look at their health and well-being.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Chairman, funding for the Food and Drug Administration is incredibly important--FDA oversees products that make up one quarter of all consumer spending in the U.S. and it is vital to protecting the public health. 
   But for all that we ask of this agency, I am concerned that we do not give FDA what it needs to do its job. For years, FDA has been underfunded--its costs have risen dramatically while its appropriations have barely increased. In fact, the number of staff at FDA has actually dropped since 2003, despite rapidly expanding burdens. 
   I know that the chairwoman is a staunch defender of food safety, and I share her concerns. I have my own doubts about whether  this administration is doing all that it can to protect our food supply. But I also know that FDA cannot keep our food safe if it doesn't have the people to make decisions or conduct inspections. Because FDA's food programs do not involve user fees, unlike the drug and device programs, food safety is one of the most neglected functions at the agency. Partly as a result of this shortage, FDA's ability to ensure a safe food supply is severely limited. The effect of this is simple: Less money for food safety means fewer staff working to protect the food supply; fewer inspections; a diminished ability to respond to outbreaks, and--most important--a limited ability to develop policies that can prevent future catastrophes. 
   FDA is facing a shortfall of crisis proportions, and I believe that greater funding is imperative. We ask a great deal of FDA, and we need to support it with the funds necessary to do its job. I know that the chairwoman has taken the first step in this bill to reverse the trend of shortchanging FDA. But I think we can do more to begin restoring FDA to its proper role. That will require a multi-year commitment to greater funding. 
   I recognize that Chairwoman DeLauro is concerned about existing problems at FDA and I share her concerns. My committee's investigations of FDA have identified significant problems at FDA, some of which have nothing to do with funding. For example, we've seen political interference in scientific decisionmaking and a failure to conduct vigorous enforcement of the law. Both of these interfere with FDA's ability to protect the public health, and they cannot be fixed with money alone. But these issues are matched with problems that are purely a matter of resources. 
   I think we need to provide greater resources for FDA at the same time that we provide greater oversight. 
   Currently, the Senate bill appropriates $1.75 billion to FDA, with $522 million for food safety. The House bill appropriates roughly $57 million less than that overall, and $48 million less for foods. I think the Senate level of funding is a good start to restoring FDA to its proper level of funding. I urge the chairwoman to seek the highest level of funding that is feasible in conference. 
   As I said, I think this will be a multi-year effort, and I would like to work with the chairwoman on restoring FDA in the years ahead with even greater funding.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAXMAN. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3 
   Since President Bush announced his stem cell funding restrictions, we've learned a number of things that, in my opinion, make the policy even less ethical than it was in 2001. 
   We learned that the President was wrong about how many stem cell lines would be available to researchers under his ban. The President said there were more than 60 available lines, and soon after it was claimed that there were 78. We learned later that year that only 24 or 25 of those lines were ready for research. In 2003, the administration was conceded that only 11 lines were available to researchers. Today only about 20 lines are available, and all of them were grown on substances that might make them unfit for future use in therapies. 
   We've also learned that since the President's announcement, the proportion of stem cell research conducted in the United States has shrunk. There's a recent analysis that looked at all scientific papers on human embryonic stem cell research published over the last several years. The White House has cited this study to point out that almost half of the labs producing papers on the topic from 1998 through 2004 were in the U.S. But in pulling out this overall statistic, the White House seems to have ignored the study's title: ``An international gap in human embryonic stem  cell research.'' The authors found that after the restrictions, the U.S. contribution to embryonic stem cell research dropped. In 2001, about one-third of all stem cell research papers were produced here. But by 2004--just three years later--that proportion had dropped to about one-quarter. 
   The study's authors wrote that the U.S. is ``falling behind'' in embryonic stem cell research. They wrote that this growing gap could put U.S. patients at a disadvantage if therapies are discovered. In fact, they concluded that ``U.S. congressional delays and the Bush administration's resistance to an expansion of Federal funding suggest a real danger for U.S. biomedicine.'' 
   Scientists are saying that the administration's ban stymies their research. Many U.S. scientists are getting offers to work overseas because funding is available there and policies are clear. The most discouraging news is that young scientists are reportedly hesitating to even enter this field because it's not being funded in proportion to its potential. 
   The White House is pushing other distorted interpretations of the issue. In a report released yesterday, the White House pointed out that there are many clinical trials related to adult stem cells, but none related to embryonic stem cells. This is truly an Alice-in-Wonderland style argument. The administration sharply restricts researchers' ability to work with embryonic stem cells and pushes researchers to work with adult stem cells. Then, it turns around several years later and notes, to no one's surprise, that most of the clinical trials are being done with adult stem cells. One can only wonder where we'd be if America's top researchers were free to work with the most powerful tools. 
   Some of you may have noticed last week's news reports on amniotic stem cells. These cells appear to hold some potential for research because they can develop into multiple cell types. We all want to understand what this research means for this debate. And I think we can probably agree that the lead researcher, Dr. Anthony Atala, is a good interpreter. 
   What he has said, consistently, is that amniotic stem cells do not substitute for embryonic stem cells. He has said that the cells have different qualities, may have different potentials for growing into different cell types, and may have different applications down the road. 
   I think we should listen to the scientist behind this study, and not those who want to distort this promising news to suppress other potentially life-saving research. 
   Dr. Atala's explanation makes one thing very clear. The most important reason amniotic stem cells can't replace embryonic stem cells is that we do not know enough about either type. A growing body of research has made clear that stem cells of all kinds have much to teach us about the human body and disease. Hopefully this knowledge will lead to treatments and cures. But if we're going to get there, we need a serious Federal commitment to funding all promising and ethical stem cell research. 
   That is what this bill will do. I respect the beliefs of those who are concerned about protecting human life. But it is my opinion--widely shared by most Americans--that the use of cells from embryos that will otherwise be discarded is well within ethical boundaries. 
   Like many of my colleagues here, what I consider unethical is telling people suffering from diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's that their suffering doesn't justify the strongest possible federal commitment to finding a cure. 
   What I consider unethical is turning to the generations following us and telling them that we didn't make as much progress, and we won't be passing on as much scientific understanding, as we could have. 
   We have already squandered valuable time, but it is not too late. It's time to recover lost ground--and reclaim the leadership role our country has earned in biomedical science--by supporting this ethical and important research.

   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Chairman, over the past week, the country did a collective double-take, as one commentator said, when they heard that Vice President CHENEY does not believe he is part of the executive branch. That's why Representative EMANUEL has proposed his amendment today. 
   This issue first came to the public's attention last week when I wrote to the Vice President asking why he blocked efforts by the National Archives to conduct security inspections of his office, as required by the President's own executive order. The response was that the Vice President's office was not an entity within the executive branch. 
   Legal experts ridiculed this argument, and late-night comics got some good new material. But the Vice President's extreme aversion to any oversight whatsoever, by Congress or even by his own Administration, is not a laughing matter. 
   The Vice President has claimed special privileges that even the President doesn't have. The Vice President has unilaterally claimed an absolute exemption from inspections, while other White House offices comply with the executive order. Take the National Security Council, which is an entity within the White House. It had the wisdom to allow an inspection. 
   The fact is, until the Vice President took this unprecedented stance, nobody at the White House had ever blocked any security inspections by the Archives. 
   And this is not the only time the Vice President has acted to prevent oversight. He went to court to stop GAO from examining the actions of his energy task force. He blocked the Secret Service from disclosing visitors to his residence. In fact, he even refused to provide information to Congress about his employees for the annual Plum Book. 
   His argument is--and I quote--``The Vice Presidency is a unique office that is neither a part of the executive branch nor a part of the legislative branch, but is attached by the Constitution to the latter.'' Even school children know this is preposterous. 
   The reality is that since 2002, there's been no oversight, no monitoring, and no reporting in the Vice President's office. That's an invitation to exactly the kind of leaks and criminal violations that have occurred in Mr. CHENEY's office. We are a government of laws and rules, not arbitrary decrees. 
   The Vice President can't unilaterally decide he is his own branch of government and exempt himself from important, commonsense safeguards for protecting classified information. And he can't insist he has the powers of both the executive and the legislature branches, but the responsibilities of neither. The Vice President is not above the law.

   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, for goodwill, I would see it a wise course of action to give additional time, since the minority requests it, but I wouldn't be prepared to give them that time now. 
   The reason we are starting so late today on this bill is because we have been interrupted with procedural votes to delay us from debating this issue. In our own committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee, the gentleman from Texas said he had a lot of people from our committee who wanted to speak on the issue. They wouldn't let us debate any single issue of merit. They made us read the bill, to frustrate the committee from meeting at all. 
   Let's renew this request for additional time later as a reward for good behavior, if we can see some good behavior. But right now, to this point, I haven't seen a lot of good behavior from the other side.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4881, introduced by Representative Ellsworth, is a very important bill. It's a simple one. It's a commonsense bill. It would prohibit the award of Federal contracts to companies that don't pay their Federal taxes. It accomplishes this by requiring contractors to certify they do not have a serious delinquent debt, and to authorize the Treasury Department to disclose such information to contracting agencies. 
   The Federal Government should not be granting Federal contracts to companies that won't pay their taxes. Companies that cheat on their taxes have an unfair competitive advantage when bidding for Federal contracts because their costs are lowered. This bill will level the playing field and restore fairness to the Federal procurement system. 
   Representative Towns, who is the chairman of the subcommittee, along with Mr. Ellsworth, have put a lot of time and effort into addressing these concerns and in crafting a very good bill, and I want to thank them for all their hard work. 
   The minority also raised some concerns about previous versions of this legislation, and I also want to thank Representative TOM DAVIS for working constructively with us to address those issues. 
   The end product before us today is solid legislation which should have bipartisan support, and which I hope will address this issue once and for all.  
   I thank Representative Ellsworth for his excellent recommendations in offering this bill and seeing it through to the point where we are now on the House floor. I hope this bill will soon become law. 
   I urge all my colleagues to vote for H.R. 4881.

   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Towns for yielding to me. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 928, the Improving Government Accountability Act. It is a bipartisan bill. It was favorably reported by the Oversight Committee on August 2, 2007, with strong support from Members across the political spectrum. 
   There is a simple reason why this bill has so much support. It strengthens the Inspectors General, who are the first line of defense against waste, fraud and abuse in Federal programs. 
   The last 6 years have given us examples of Inspectors General at their best and at their worst. Stuart Bowen, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, has uncovered fraud and saved American taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. Clark Kent Erving and Richard Skinner, the former and current IGs for the Department of Homeland Security, have identified billions in wasteful spending in the new Department. Glenn Fine at the Department of Justice, Earl Delvaney at Interior, and Brian Miller at the General Services Administration have all reported courageously on abuses within the agencies they oversee. These and other IGs have fought waste, fraud and abuse and saved the taxpayers cumulatively billions of dollars. 
   Yet there are also IGs who seem more intent on protecting their departments from political embarrassment than on doing their jobs. Our Oversight Committee is investigating allegations that the State Department IG has blocked investigations into contract fraud in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Energy and Commerce Committee documented serious abuses by the former IG in the Commerce Department. And the Science Committee has identified serious questions raised about the close relationship of the NASA IG to agency management. 
   This bill strengthens the good IGs by giving them greater independence. Under this legislation, they can only be removed for cause, not for doing their job. And they will now have new budgetary independence. 
   At the same time, the legislation enacts in statute new mechanisms for holding bad IGs to account. The legislation establishes an ``Integrity Committee'' that will investigate allegations that IGs have abused the public trust. 
   There have been several key champions of this bill. Representative Cooper has worked tirelessly on this issue for years and deserves our thanks for his efforts. I would also like to acknowledge Subcommittee Chairman Towns for his tremendous leadership in moving this legislation forward and Ranking Member Tom Davis for his commitment to strong IGs and his many helpful contributions. 
   H.R. 928 would make needed improvements to the IG Act, and I urge all Members to support it.

   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, I share the goals expressed by my friend and colleague, Mr. Davis, the gentleman from Virginia, but I oppose it as a motion to recommit, because this bill is about Inspectors General, and their job is to weed out waste, fraud and abuse. 
   But if this motion to recommit would identify that their primary job, if this motion passes, would be to identify programs that aren't working and then to recommend changes in them. Well, that's a worthwhile thing for them to do, but that should not be and is not their primary job.     
   The principal duty of the IGs is to do the work of an independent watchdog, to find out if there's waste, fraud and abuse. This would turn it into their principal duty to do an annual report on abolishing and reorganizing programs in agencies. They would have to do an annual report on reorganization. Well, that is going to be a lot of busywork. 
   If you like government bureaucracy, then vote for the motion to recommit. But if you like the idea of independent Inspectors General looking out for waste, fraud and abuse as their prime job, then I would urge Members to vote ``no.'' 
   But I want to indicate to my colleagues that whether this motion to recommit passes or is defeated, I want to work with the sponsor of this motion to recommit to achieve our shared objectives. Oftentimes, we have waste, fraud and abuse because the objectives of the agency need to be changed. And we want those recommendations to come before us. 
   I'd like to yield whatever time he may consume to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cooper).

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. I thank Chairman Oberstar for yielding to me. 
   I am rising out of concern about a serious safety problem at the Santa Monica General Aviation Airport in my congressional district. 
   The Santa Monica Airport is a unique facility. It was built in 1922 and has no runway safety areas which are now required by the FAA to enable a safe landing in the event that an aircraft overshoots the runway or fails to lift off. 
   The airport's single runway is bordered by steep hills, public streets, and densely populated neighborhoods, with homes as close as 250 feet from the runway. As traffic has increased, so have concerns that any plane overshooting the runway would be at great risk of landing in the neighborhood. 
   For more than 7 years, I have worked with the City of Santa Monica and the Airport Administration to push the FAA to address this serious safety problem. Regrettably, the FAA has been unwilling to take meaningful action. The FAA recently issued a final decision to permit only minor runway changes that are far below FAA standards and would do little to change the status quo. 
   I want to ask Chairman Oberstar to work with me and the FAA to find a solution that is consistent with FAA design guidelines for the Santa Monica Airport and adequately addresses the safety needs of all aircraft categories that use the airport.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume of the time that has been reserved to us. 
   The bill before us, H.R. 1362, the Accountability in Contracting Act, would increase transparency and accountability in Federal contracting, limit the use of certain types of abuse-prone contracts and promote integrity in the acquisition workforce. 
   Under the Bush administration, spending on Federal contracts has exploded in size. The Federal Government spent $175 billion more in Federal contracts in 2005 than it did in 2000, making Federal contracts the fastest growing component of the Federal budget. 
   The Federal Government now spends nearly 40 percent of discretionary spending on contracts with private companies, a record level. This surge in contract spending has enriched private contractors like Halliburton, but it has come at a steep cost to taxpayers through rising waste, fraud, abuse and mismanagement. 
   Spending on sole source and other noncompetitive contracts has more than doubled in the last 5 years. The administration has justified the awarding of these lucrative sole source contracts by citing urgent and compelling needs, but then they allow these contracts to continue years after the emergency has passed. 
   Cost reimbursement type contracts leave the taxpayers vulnerable to wasteful spending by providing contractors with little or no incentive to control costs. But between 2000 and 2005, the use of this type of contract has risen by 75 percent. 
   The administration has also hidden contractor overcharges from Congress, international auditors and the public, impeding oversight and diminishing accountability. Too often, the independence of procurement of officials has been compromised by illegal relationships with government contractors. 
   Darleen Druyun, the former chief acquisition official for the Air Force, negotiated a lucrative deal to lease aircraft from Boeing in exchange for future employment. All of these problems have been compounded by an insufficient acquisition workforce to properly award and adequately oversee Federal contracts. 
   H.R. 1362 contains important provisions to rein in out-of-control Federal contracting. It would require Federal agencies to develop plans to minimize the use of the sole source contracts, and it would limit the duration of no-bid contracts issued in emergencies. 
   The bill would also require agencies to encourage the use of fixed-price contracts, which are not as prone to abuse as cost-plus contracts. This provision will allow the growth of contracts to give companies a financial incentive to increase their costs to the taxpayers. 
   When a sole source contract is awarded, agencies are required to prepare a justification and approval document to explain why full and open competition was not used to award the contract. The bill would require those documents to be made public. 
   The bill also promotes transparency in the acquisition process by requiring agencies to report to Congress when auditors identify over $10 million in questioned or unsupported costs. A big and growing problem with the Federal acquisition system is that it has a workforce that is too small and undertrained. The bill requires the administration to develop a comprehensive definition of the acquisition workforce and ensures that funds for training will continue to be available. 
   Finally, the bill includes revolving door provisions that close loopholes in the law, prohibiting contracting officials from negotiating employment for their relatives and establish a cooling off period before procurement officials can award or oversee contracts involving a former employer. 
   All of this is important legislation. This legislation alone will not do the job. We need, however, to continue our oversight, and Congress has already begun many oversight hearings in our committee and in other committees as well. 
   Members are starting to ask what went wrong and to insist on accountability. But this legislation is an important reform in the contracting area. I want to thank my ranking member, Tom Davis, and the chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee for their hard work and efforts in reaching a bipartisan consensus on the bill before us.     
   The Accountability in Contracting Act makes sound commonsense reforms which will improve the transparency and accountability of the Federal acquisition system, and I urge Members to support the bill. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   I want to acknowledge the fact that Chairman Tom Davis did more as the chairman of our committee in doing oversight than any other Chair in the House. We did do a lot, but the other committees did not. They didn't want to do oversight. It was as if the Republican leadership of the House decided that if they did too much oversight, they might find embarrassment to this administration. 
   Well, it looks like this administration would now like to keep us from getting embarrassing information about them because they don't like this bill. Oh, we have to give too many reports to Congress; there has to be too much transparency; it is burdensome to have to be open about these contracts. But the fact of the matter is we are spending an incredible amount of money on these outside contracts. And from what we have seen, our taxpayers are not being protected from waste, fraud, abuse and corruption. Just look at what went on in Iraq. Halliburton had contracts for logistical purposes, to restore oil. We were told we needed them to get a contract without any competition because they are the only ones, this is what we were told in the very beginning when we asked why did we get this contract in Iraq with no other competition.     
   We were told, Well, they are the only ones who know how to put out the oil well fires when we go to war. And so they got a contract without competition on a cost-plus basis even though they had a history of overcharging the taxpayers. And then later we found out that they didn't do anything about putting out oil well fires in the first Gulf war; it was Bechtel, not Halliburton. We were told it was civil servants who had done it in giving this award to the contractor. But then we found out it was the political people who did it. 
   Halliburton was given special treatment. Other contractors were given special treatment by not having healthy competition. Competition benefits the consumer. When the government is the payor, the consumer, we are deprived of what market forces can bring. So these contractors got no-bid contracts. 
   I made a proposal on the House floor when we had one of these appropriations bills to say that if any contractor overcharges us $100 million or more, they ought to be barred from future contracts. The chairman at that time of the Armed Services Committee stood up and said, We can't have an amendment like this; we haven't even held hearings on anybody who has charged us over $100 million. 
   Well, why hadn't they held hearings? Why didn't the Armed Services Committee hold hearings? 
   The fact of the matter is in recent years, we have had an enormous outpouring of money spent in Iraq, in homeland security, in dealing with Hurricane Katrina, and we have seen the same mistakes over and over again: No-competition contracts; cost-plus contracts. 
   We have seen what the result has been: Wasted taxpayer dollars. That is why this legislation has been put together. It is a bill to require that if there is an emergency to give a contract, give it. But then have bidding within a year. 
   Gasoline prices charged by Halliburton were considered highway robbery. Parsons built just a handful, 20 of the 142 health clinics they were paid to build. Human sewage leaked out of the roof of a police academy. 
   In Hurricane Katrina, they subcontracted and subcontracted and subcontracted, and finally they paid a guy with a truck to come and take away debris. Every markup of every one of those subcontractors was passed on to the taxpayers. 
   We have had a contract to build a border for our homeland security that cost us billions of dollars that didn't work. We had a contract to help the Coast Guard get state-of-the-art ships, and they didn't meet standards. We need reform in this area. 
   If that is called micromanaging when we want transparency, this is the type of reform we need. We need something we didn't have before: A lot more oversight. We have got to keep people honest. 
   I am shocked when I hear conservatives say they care about taxpayers' dollars, and then don't want competition. I am shocked when they say taxpayers' money is being used wisely, and then we find it is being thrown away. 
   I urge support for this bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

We understand there are times that there are emergencies, but we ask that after a year that the contract be put out to bid, that there be competition at least after a year. I see nothing wrong with that. It makes a lot of common sense to me, and you are arguing that we are not responding to the emergency situation when we do.

   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Chairman, I thank you very much for yielding to me. 
   I just want to point out that I think my good friend from my same State, former chairman of the Armed Services Committee, now the ranking member, protesteth too much. 
   He complained that they have to award a contract right away and that this bill would prevent it. Well, we  have already pointed out that that is not the case at all. A contract can be awarded on an emergency basis; but after a year, there ought to be competition. He thought that sounded good once we explained it to him on the floor. 
   Then he said, well, there is another provision that he dislikes and that is the fact that somebody who awards a contract cannot go to work for the contractor. Well, that provision was narrowed, and it was narrowed to say it had to be a senior person, and it also had to be someone who was personally and substantially involved in awarding the contract. 
   Now, a lot of these contracts are determined by political appointees. For example, we learned that the Halliburton no-bid contract to restore oil in Iraq was signed by the contracting civil servant, but the decision was made by a political appointee. The gentleman's name is Michael Mobbs. He decided that Halliburton ought to get that contract and that there should not be competition. He even went before a committee of principals, including Scooter Libby representing the Vice President, and suggested to them this is the way the contract ought to be awarded, and the contract was awarded. He argued that it needed to be awarded at that time to that contractor, they would do the job. 
   Should he be allowed to go within a year and go sign up as an employee for Halliburton? I do not think he should be permitted. All we say is there ought to be a cooling-off period. We do not say he never could go work for Halliburton, but I think it is unseemly to have him go right from that position to go work for Halliburton. 
   Now, I must say from those who tell us everything is going great in Iraq, they are also telling us today on the House floor everything has gone well with contractors in Iraq. I must submit that things have not gone well, unless you do not mind hundreds of billions of dollars in questioned costs, in overcharging by a contractor to bring in gasoline from Kuwait, having a contractor charge for $45 for Cokes or $50 for laundry, obscene kind of expenditures. Things have not gone well. That is why we need more oversight, and that is why we need this important reform legislation.

   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Chairman, I understand that my colleague, Representative CARDOZA has concerns about the use of the confidential business information exemption within the Freedom of Information Act to withhold information about Federal contracts from the public. I understand Mr. CARDOZA's concern and want to work with him to ensure that the public has access to this type of information under FOIA. Yesterday, the House approved legislation that will strengthen FOIA and ensure that agencies apply a presumption of disclosure when considering requests. I believe that yesterday's bill, along with the bill we are considering today, are steps in the right direction. But, neither bill directly addresses my colleague's concerns related to overuse of FOIA's exemption four. 
   I have an ongoing interest in strengthening the Freedom of Information Act and certainly want to work together with Mr. CARDOZA to accomplish his important goal of ensuring public access to information about federal contractor performance. 
   I have agreed to work with Mr. CARDOZA to request that GAO conduct an examination of agency use of exemption four. A report from GAO could clarify what is currently being withheld from the public under this exemption, and how much of that information is actually a trade secret or is truly confidential.

   Mr. Chairman, as I understand the gentleman from Utah's amendment, it would require a Federal agency that expects to award a sole source contract to a foreign company based in a country known to sponsor terrorist activity to notify Congress 30 days prior to the award of that contract. This seems to me to be a good idea. 
   Congress should know if no-bid contracts are going to countries that sponsor terrorism. So I support the amendment. I think it makes a lot of sense. What Congress does after they get this information will remain to be seen. 
   There may be some justification for it, but I would certainly want to know, as this Member of Congress, speaking on my own behalf, and I think others would feel the same way if such a sole source contract was going to be awarded.

   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Castle amendment. There are currently no Federal ethics laws that apply to contractor employees. This is particularly problematic because contractors are providing more and more services that used to be performed by Federal service personnel. 
   In many agencies today, one can tell the difference between a Federal employee and a contractor only by the color of his or her badge. One area where this can cause real problems is in the contracting workforce. A company providing contract oversight services to the government may be overseeing a company and working as a subcontractor to that same company in the private sector. Clearly such a situation would cause conflicts of interest. 
   The amendment offered by Mr. Castle would require the Office of Government Ethics to report to Congress with recommendations on requiring contract employees to be covered by Federal financial and conflict of interest laws. 
   I support this amendment and urge all of my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. WAXMAN. Members could have different views about the underlying question, and that is whether universities should be able to exclude military recruiters. It is not a new issue to be considered on this floor. We have voted on this many, many times. Some universities have taken the position that they don't want military recruiters on their campus because the military is not an equal opportunity employer based on the ``don't ask, don't  tell'' policy. I happen to think that universities that take this position are right. 
   But that is not the reason I oppose this motion to recommit. I oppose it because I have heard the arguments made by my colleagues many, many, times that we shouldn't exclude somebody from competing from a contract on extraneous bases. 
   Why should we exclude a university from being able to compete in a government contract when they might be the ones who can save the lives of our troops? After all, the bioshield program has given money, Federal dollars to universities to try to develop ways to get us vaccines that will stop the impact of anthrax or smallpox. Are we going to say that a university that develops such a vaccine will not be able to compete for a contract to sell that vaccine because they don't want recruiters on their campus because they object to the don't ask, don't tell policy? That doesn't make any sense. People ought to be able to compete for contracts based on what they can do if they are selected to perform that contract. Are we going to exclude people for extraneous reasons? I don't think that makes sense. 
   So I think if you look at it carefully, when you recognize that the work being done at universities can be so important in so many different ways, that we should just arbitrarily exclude them. I think we have all said over and over again in the debate on this bill, we don't like sole-source contracts. We want competition. We want market forces. Well, sometimes you need a sole-source contract in an emergency. Well, then we say at least a year later, let's have competition. 
   But if we adopt this amendment, from the very beginning we will not allow competition if it involves competition from a university unless they have a longstanding position of being pacifists, and then we will let them compete. But if they have a different position, but they also have the ability to compete and to provide a service that can save our country from terrorism, save our military from disease, save the American people the consequences for which we need them to perform in that contract, we are going to exclude them. 
   I urge opposition. I know Members will feel a lot of pressure on this because it can be used in a 30-second ad, that Congressman So-and-So voted to allow universities to exclude military recruiters. Well, I don't think that is really what this amendment is doing. It is excluding universities from competing for contracts, even if they can, in awarding that contract, provide vital services and that maybe no one else can provide. So I urge opposition to the motion to recommit.

   Mr. WAXMAN. I thank my good friend for yielding to me. 
   Mr. Speaker, this administration has mishandled the situation in Iraq from the very beginning. 
   It misled the country into a war based on false and misleading statements about the threat from Iraq. 
   It failed to plan for the aftermath of the military victory. 
   It assumed that we would be greeted as liberators, the occupation would be brief, and that Iraq would pay for its own reconstruction. 
   It sent our troops to battle with dangerous shortages in body armor and devices needed to defuse remote-controlled bombs. 
   It sent in too few troops to Iraq to provide security, leaving the Iraqi people to rely on their sectarian militias to give them some protection from the chaos. 
   It disbanded the Iraqi army and, through an anti-Baathists campaign, gave the Sunnis a sense that the U.S. was aiding the Shiites against them. 
   It refused to take on war profiteering, even as auditors, investigators and inspector generals unearthed massive graft, fraud and abuse by reconstruction contractors. 
   It alienated the Iraqi people with the shameful and criminal acts of Abu Ghraib prison. 
   What we now have in Iraq is a defeat. We cannot achieve the illusions of the Bush administration that we will be able to create a stable, unified, liberal democracy in Iraq that is pro-American. Instead, we have sectarian fighting, death squads and a destabilized Middle East that threatens to be engulfed by the nightmare that we have unleashed. 
   The administration's mistakes have weakened our fight against al Qaeda. In fact, the war has enhanced the group's terrorist recruitment. The planned escalation in Iraq will divert more troops, resources and attention from the pursuit of Osama bin Laden's operation in Afghanistan; and we have enhanced the influence of Iran, not just in Iraq but throughout the region. 
   The President proposes an escalation of a failed policy. The fighting now only prolongs our losses and blocks the way to a new strategy. We are trying now to mediate a civil war, which is impossible. Instead, we are being drawn into that civil war by trying to prop up  a government that, in the final analysis, cannot unite the country. 
   Politically, this administration has tied the faith of American soldiers to a Shi'a-dominated government that lacks the authority, the will and the manpower to stop the roving gangs and insurgent militias that have shattered Iraqi society. Instead of acknowledging these failures and embarking on a new course of action, the President gives us more of the same: Send more troops to Iraq. 
   We need to redefine our mission and our hopes for ``success.'' Our goal should be to try to stabilize the situation, stop the killing, contain the violence. 
   We cannot do it alone, and we cannot do it militarily. We must seek a diplomatic strategy with Iraq's neighbors and the international community. 
   Certainly, it will take more action than just the resolution before us to bring about the policy changes that we need. The Congress must stand ready to use the checks and balances necessary to extract ourselves from the morass we face in Iraq. We can do that through more oversight, but it is also time for Congress to use the appropriations process to end this war. 
   We should pass this resolution and make it clear to the President that we will not stand for more of the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAXMAN. (FEDERAL EMPLOYEES PAID PARENTAL LEAVE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5781, the Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act, gives dedicated civil servants a long-overdue benefit: parental leave on the birth or adoption of a child. 
   Under this bill, Federal employees will, for the first time, be offered 4 weeks of paid parental leave on the birth or adoption of a child. If needed, employees will also be allowed to use their accrued sick leave for additional paid leave. 
   I was taken aback by the arguments from my colleague from California (Mr. Issa) that we run the risk of people becoming foster parents each year presumably to get this extra 4 weeks of paid leave. I think that foster parents do an enormous good in providing a home to children who otherwise would not have a place to live. And they, by the way, under existing Federal law, can have paid Federal leave under their sick pay. But if a parent has a natural-born child, they may not use their sick leave nor do they get paid leave for that period of time to bond with the newborn. 
   Federal employees are entitled to those 12 weeks of unpaid leave under the existing Family and Medical Leave Act. What this bill does is say for the first 4 weeks, this leave will be paid. 
   The Federal Government is a model employer in many areas. Federal health benefits are often lauded as a model for the rest of the country. Many people say all Americans ought to have the same health care benefits as Federal employees. We have the Federal Thrift Savings Plan which is often cited as a model of what a 401(k) plan ought to be. 
   But one area where the Federal Government has lagged behind for years is in providing parental leave to its employees. If this becomes law, and I sure hope it will be, we will be able to attract and retain the best employees for the Federal workforce. It means when a Federal agency recruits new employees, they won't have to have one hand tied behind their back because they can't offer leave for the birth of a child, as many private sector companies do. 
   I think this is a pro-family measure, and I was pleased to hear that our colleague, Congressman Hyde, had always supported this family leave to be paid for Federal employees. 
   When you look at the civilian workforce for the Department of Defense, they don't get this ability to be at home with the child for the first 4 weeks and have it paid for, but a military family will be allowed under existing law to stay home under paid leave for maternity or adoption. It is unfair to have in one case an employee working next to another employee, both for the same government, and one is allowed to take the leave and have it paid for, and the other has to take the leave and not have it paid for. The loss of income is important to many of these families and they don't want to have that loss of income. We shouldn't put them in that kind of position where we force them to perhaps cut it short and get back to work. 
   I want to commend Representatives DANNY DAVIS and CAROLYN MALONEY for their efforts on this bill, the Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act of 2008. Without their leadership it wouldn't be on the floor today. I also want to thank Ranking Member TOM DAVIS for his support for this legislation and his constructive work in offering an amendment that we agreed to in committee to reduce the cost to the taxpayer. He has been a steadfast champion of the rights of Federal employees, especially those that support families. 
   I urge my colleagues, support this bill. We don't know yet what the motion to recommit will be, but if it is one of these motions to kill the bill or to come in with something that is not sustainable, I would hope that my colleagues would vote against it and vote for final passage of this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. If we are going to pay in a straightforward way, let's provide  parental leave and not require people to take it out of their sick leave which they cannot do now, and have that leave paid for. This ought to be for newborn and adopted children and their parents, and we ought to provide this. 
   I can imagine there might have been a time when people would have said, ``Why should we allow people to be able to take off 2 weeks of vacation a year? Some employers do it, others don't. This is just too radical.'' 
   Well, now no one thinks it is radical to have 2 weeks of vacation a year at least, and I don't think it is radical, I think it is pro-family, in fact, to allow parents to bond with their children and be able to have 4 weeks paid. That is straightforward; 4 weeks paid leave for maternity or paternity and not to hide it in the sick leave, which they may need at some future time if they have an illness. Having a baby is not an illness.

   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, there they go again, coming up with a gimmick because they don't want the underlying bill. If they don't want the underlying bill, let them vote no. But what they have offered instead is a motion to recommit promptly, which kills the bill. So I would urge all of my colleagues who believe that parents ought to be able to bond with their children and have a paid family leave on the birth of a child or the adoption of a newborn, that they vote against this motion to recommit. 
   Federal law is very clear. If you are behind in your child support payments, you can get your wages garnished. That means there is an automatic reduction in your paycheck to pay for the support of your children. The fact is that no one who is behind in childcare can get paid parental leave. The reason is their wages will already be garnished. That is why this amendment is a gimmick. 
   No amendment like this was offered in our committee. This was never brought up in our deliberations. In fact, the gentleman was very clear in his arguments for the motion to recommit. He is against the bill. He was against the bill in committee, and he is against the bill now. 
   Now, I think we ought to understand that if this were a serious amendment, it would have been a ``forthwith'' motion. But it is not. It is a ``promptly'' motion to kill the bill. 
   There are 400,000 civilian DOD employees around the Nation. They have been working overtime to protect our Nation, often serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. But what this motion says to them, and to all other hard-working Federal employees, is you won't get any paid leave, and if you are sick and have used up your leave, you can't take the time to bond with your family. 
   It is wrong, it is anti-family, and I believe this motion to recommit should be defeated. It is like so many other motions to recommit that we have seen on this floor. When it is designed ``promptly,'' it sends the bill back to the committee, and those who didn't like it in committee will fight it some more. But if you are for this bill, vote against the motion to recommit and vote ``yes'' on final passage. 
   I would like to yield the balance of the time to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), our majority leader.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAXMAN. (EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING WITHHOLDING OF INFORMATION RELATING TO CORRUPTION IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Today we mark an ominous anniversary. It was 5 years ago today that President Bush signed the congressional authorization to use military force in Iraq. As we have learned since, that authorization was based on fatally flawed information. Congress and the American people were told that we needed to go to war against Saddam Hussein because he had weapons of mass destruction. But there were no nuclear bombs or biological weapons. 
   Now, 5 years later, more than 3,800 U.S. servicemembers have been killed, more than 28,000 have been injured, and the U.S. taxpayers have spent more than $450 billion; and Iraq is in shambles. 
   Today we are considering a different resolution. The purpose of today's resolution is simple: to end the abuse of the classification process and to demand the truth about corruption in Iraq. 
   We must stop the pattern of dissembling and the misuse of classified information. President Bush is now asking taxpayers for an additional $150 billion to support the war and to support Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. But ..... is not being honest about the level of corruption in the Maliki government. 
   Just as it did 5 years ago, the Bush administration is hiding the truth while seeking hundreds of billions of dollars and placing our troops in danger. We cannot allow this to happen.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, the Bush administration is hiding the truth while seeking hundreds of billions of dollars and placing our troops in danger, and we cannot allow this to happen. 
   We need answers to some very important questions: How corrupt is the Maliki government? Are top officials in Iraq stealing billions of dollars to fund insurgents who are attacking and killing our troops? Is corruption undermining the chances for political reconciliation? 
   Secretary of State Rice says she will answer these questions only on one condition: every Member of Congress who hears the answers has to keep the answers secret. Well, that's an outrageous abuse of the classification system. 
   Earlier this month, the former head of the Iraqi Commission on Public Integrity, Judge Radhi, testified before the Oversight Committee. He told us that corrupt Iraqi officials had stolen a staggering $18 billion and used part of that money to fund terrorists. He told us that when he tried to track down who was responsible, well, 31 of his investigators were brutally assassinated, and his own family living in the Green Zone was targeted twice with rocket attacks. And he gave us copies of secret orders that Prime Minister Maliki personally issued to protect his allies, including his own cousin, from corruption investigations and prosecutions. 
   Judge Radhi, Special Inspector General Stuart Bowen and Comptroller General David Walker all told us that  corruption is so entrenched in Iraq that it is jeopardizing our troops and our mission. But when we asked the State Department for unclassified documents about the extent of corruption in the Maliki government, Secretary Rice retroactively classified them. And when we asked the embassy officials when they knew about corruption, she ordered them not to respond. 
   Secretary Rice has made public statements praising the anticorruption efforts of the Maliki government, and he, himself, she praised; and she even praised the corrupt Interior Ministry. But when we asked embassy officials in Iraq whether her public statements were accurate, they said they were not allowed to respond unless we agreed to keep their answers secret. 
   Mr. Speaker, 5 years ago, abusive classified information got us into this war. It's time for these abuses to end, and that's why we ask all Members to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, I wish we had everyone sign off on every word in this resolution, but I think the Members ought to understand what this resolution does. It says to the State Department: don't go with a double standard. You can say publicly positive things about the Iraqi Government, but you can't say things that are honest that may be negative about them, and we are not talking about specific statements, but general statements as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are in a war in Iraq. Not everybody in this country is making a sacrifice for that war. But those who are being called to make a sacrifice are called to make the maximum sacrifice. They are giving up their lives potentially. The rest of us are paying through deficit spending billions and hundreds of billions of dollars. 
   But if we are going to ask people to give up their lives in this war, what we owe them is to know the truth, not propaganda, but the truth about what this Iraqi Government is doing that may enable them to accomplish the goal that we have said we wanted to accomplish in Iraq, and that is to reach out, to bring about reconciliation in Iraq and a government that has credibility for its own people. 
   If this Government in Iraq is so corrupt that our State Department won't even tell us about it, I have to wonder whether we can ask our brave men and women to risk and to give their lives to support that Iraqi Government. 
   I urge passage of this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAXMAN. (RECOGNIZING ANNIVERSARIES OF MASS MOVEMENT FOR SOVIET JEWISH FREEDOM AND FREEDOM SUNDAY RALLY FOR SOVIET JEWRY -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, 20 years ago, on December 7, 1987, there were 250,000 people gathered in Washington, D.C., to rally for the plight of Soviet Jews. I vividly remember participating in that rally, which took place on the eve of the Reagan-Gorbachev summit. It was a major turning point that helped compel the Soviet Union to open its doors for the millions of Soviet Jewish emigres who had been held as virtual prisoners within their own country. 
   I think back to congressional delegations to the Soviet Union where I met with Jewish refusniks who were suffering under communist repression. These brave dissidents were blacklisted from their jobs, socially ostracized and, in some cases, jailed, only because of their desire to practice their religion and live in freedom. 
   I remember meeting with young couples in and around Moscow who called us their lifeline. They were so desperate about their circumstances. They said our visits gave them hope that they were not forgotten, that they would one day be free. 
   When the Iron Curtain fell, many of these families came to the United States to live the American Dream of religious liberty and personal freedom. Over 1 million more resettled in Israel. The historic human rights campaign to free Soviet Jewry was built on decades of activism. Launched in the 1960s by groups like the American Jewish Conference on Soviet Jewry and the Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry, it galvanized human rights leaders around the United States and the world. The movement helped build the momentum for the adoption of the Helsinki Accords and the passage of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which, for the first time, linked trade policy and human rights. 
   Here in Congress, we founded the Congressional Coalition for Soviet Jews, and my wife Janet helped organize and found the Congressional Wives for Soviet Jewry. Other organizations, like the National Conference on Soviet Jewry and the Union of Councils for Soviet Jewry are still at work today fighting anti-Semitism and safeguarding the religious freedom of Jews in Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union. 
   Today, we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Freedom Rally with pride in the history and accomplishments of the effort to free Soviet Jews. Let it serve as a lasting reminder that we have an obligation to sustain the fight against political and religious repression wherever it exists. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Dingell-Murphy bill, H.R. 5613, which would delay seven Medicaid regulations that would shift billions of dollars in costs from the Federal Government to States, counties, school districts, hospitals, and other medical providers. There is absolutely no justification for such a cost shift, especially at a time when many States are struggling to avoid budget cuts as their economies slow and revenues decline. The bill would delay the implementation of these regulations until April 1, 2009. 
   The Oversight Committee held hearings on this matter. We heard testimony from public and teaching hospital administrators, an emergency room physician, a child welfare worker and a school nurse. They explained how the regulations would shift costs to States and localities and what that cost would mean for access to services for beneficiaries. We also heard from a representative from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which issued these regulations. 
   And since Medicaid is a Federal-State program, one would think that when the Federal Government changes the rules, as these regulations would do, it would first try to determine what the impact of these changes would be on the different States. Well, we followed up with the head of the CMS for Medicaid, and he told us that he had not done a State-by-State specific analysis of the impact and he had no plans to do such an analysis. So our committee made our own analysis. We did a survey of Medicaid directors for 43 States and the District of Columbia, and they told us that if CMS were allowed to implement all seven Medicaid regulations, their States would lose nearly $50 billion in Federal funds over the next 5 years. The result of these cost shifts would not be greater efficiency, it would not be a savings of money, it would simply come out of the reimbursements, and fewer eligible populations. They would disrupt the existing systems for care of fragile populations, such as adults with severe mental illness or children with special health care needs. They would undercut the financial stability of hospitals and emergency rooms that treat Americans without health insurance. They would impose large, new administrative burdens and costs on State Medicaid programs without any offsetting policy benefit. 
   In short, the best professional judgment was that the regulations would have harmful fiscal and programmatic consequences for their States and the people that look to the Medicaid program as the safety net for health care.     
   The bill before us gives the department and the Congress the time to look into these issues in the detail they deserve without making fundamental changes in Federal Medicaid policy. 
   I urge support for this bipartisan legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, next month the State of Israel will celebrate its 60th anniversary. Indeed there are many reasons to be proud. 
   Despite a backdrop of conflicts, boycotts, and constant regional turmoil, Israel has managed to generate a vigorous economy, a vibrant democracy, and a robust military. It has emerged as the closest and strongest ally the United States has in the Middle East and perhaps in the entire world. 
   Some say Israel's success is a miracle. Maybe that comes as an easy explanation for a land steeped in Biblical history. The reality of course is that the Israeli people don't sit around waiting for miracles--they create them. 
   From the battlefield of hard-fought wars to the produce fields of flowering kibbutzim, Israelis have accomplished feats many deemed impossible. They built up strong democratic institutions in a region hostile to their values. They turned a chaotic influx of Jews from Europe, Africa, the Americas and the Middle East into a prospering Jewish homeland that reflects the most varied traditions and trajectories of Jewish history. Time and time again, with the support of the United States, Israelis have taken great risks to seek peaceful coexistence with their Arab neighbors. 
   One of the issues closest to my heart is Israeli ingenuity in environmental conservation. While Israel's commitment to the environment has moral and economic dimensions, it has also been a security imperative. 
   For much of its existence, Israel has been subjected to Arab oil embargoes. Today, soaring oil prices are enriching adversaries like Iran that are bent on its destruction. With the price of oil now reaching $100 a barrel, Iran is reaping more than $90 billion in revenue a year. Those profits are being passed on to a dangerous nuclear program and terrorist cells in Lebanon, Syria, Gaza and beyond. 
   The United States and Israel have built strong security ties to address these threats. But we need to explore energy-oriented solutions to help us overcome an addiction to oil that is driving prices even higher. I think Americans can learn a lot from Israel about water and energy conservation, and the use of solar power and other energy alternatives. Working together we can do even more to reduce carbon emissions and reverse climate changes that threaten our national interests. 
   For many, including my own parents and relatives, the idea of a Jewish state was a dream. Its creation was indeed a miracle. Since then, the U.S.-Israel alliance has only grown stronger. Today, we can look forward to many more decades of peaceful and prosperous partnership. 
   Congratulations to the Israeli government and the Israeli people on the 60th anniversary.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 74. This resolution will encourage research into Hydrocephalus, a chronic and often devastating neurological condition. 
   Hydrocephalus affects an estimated one million Americans--which classifies it as a rare disease. And, unfortunately, like so many other rare diseases, insufficient resources have been directed toward it. Individuals with this disease are forced to undergo ``shunting,'' a highly invasive surgical procedure that carries with it serious safety risks. This procedure also takes a heavy toll on our entire health-care system, costing an average of $35,000 per procedure. 
   We can avoid paying this price. With more research and focus on this disease, better treatment--and perhaps even a cure--is within our reach. Patients can be spared the trauma of brain surgery and American citizens can avoid paying more than a billion dollars each year for this treatment. 
   The NIH has already taken some positive steps toward this goal. By initiating a collaborative effort among 7 NIH institutes and sponsoring a major national conference, the NIH has begun the work that must be done. Now we need to send a strong statement that we want this work to continue. 
   Cures for rare diseases like Hydrocephalus will never be found unless we increase our effort and follow the scientific promise. We can start with this vote today.

   Mr. WAXMAN. Madam Speaker, today the House will take up legislation that, in the great tradition of the Energy and Commerce Committee, was reported out of the committee unanimously. I would have voted for it as well had I not been on the House floor presenting another piece of legislation. I want to commend Chairman Dingell, Subcommittee Chairman RUSH, and Ranking Members BARTON and STEARNS for their great accomplishment. 
   This bill will develop a standard that will protect children from the dangers associated with lead exposure. It will create a national standard that is one of the strongest in the world and ensure that our toys are as safe as possible. This is an accomplishment that we all can be proud of. But let me point out that no one piece of legislation can make all the changes that we need at the Consumer Product Safety Commission. What we need to continue to look for are ways to further improve the CPSC. 
   We must ensure that the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the public get, and can appropriately use, information from manufacturers about the safety of their products. We must also ensure that the States have all the tools they need to permit them to fully assist the CPSC in its task because they will continue to be vitally important partners in enforcing the law. 
   Every day, Americans rely on the Consumer Product Safety Commission to protect them from dangerous products. To date, frankly, it has not done its job. This bill is the first step in changing direction and in making the CPSC the effective agency the American people expect and deserve. I know this will be a continuing effort on the part of the committee, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on that committee in a bipartisan way, I hope, to ensure that we achieve this goal.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6575, the Over-Classification Reduction Act, is aimed at reducing over-classification by the Federal Government. I introduced this bill with the Ranking Member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Tom Davis. 
   I want to thank Ranking Member Davis for working with me to move this bill. I also want to thank Chairman Reyes and Representative Harman for their cooperation on this bill and for their leadership on this issue. In addition, I want to recognize Representative Clay for his work on this issue. 
   The 9/11 Commission recommended providing incentives for information sharing, ``to restore a better balance between security and shared knowledge.'' But unfortunately, that advice has not been heeded. We continue to see the Federal Government fostering secrecy using the tool of over-classification. 
   As the 9/11 Commission pointed out in its report, ``[c]urrent security requirements nurture overclassification and excessive compartmentalization of information among agencies. Each agency's incentive structure opposes sharing, with risks ..... but few rewards for sharing information. No one has to pay the long-term costs of overclassifying information, though these costs--even in literal financial terms--are substantial.'' 
   H.R. 6575 would require the Archivist to promulgate regulations to prevent the over-classification of information. This bill would increase accountability by allowing individuals to challenge decisions to classify information and requiring that successful challenges be rewarded. The bill improves oversight of classification decisions by requiring the Inspector General of each affected agency to randomly audit classified information to determine whether the appropriate procedures were followed and to provide recommendations for improvements. It also requires training for employees to proactively prevent over-classification. 
   The problem of over-classification is governmentwide and it demands a governmentwide solution. In order to improve information sharing, every agency that has employees with the authority to classify documents must be held accountable. This bill does that. I urge support for H.R. 6575.

   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4081 because of the important difference it will make in reducing young people's access to cigarettes. 
   The tobacco industry has long targeted the nation's youth. As this Committee learned in 1998 when I released documents from inside the board room of RJR, tobacco executives had an explicit strategy of hooking our children to create lifelong, addicted consumers. 
   Recently, states have begun to fight back with stronger laws to prevent teenagers from buying tobacco products. These laws require photo IDs to be shown at the point of purchase. 
   But these efforts haven't been successful in addressing the traffic of cigarettes through our newest, and least controlled, market: the internet. 
   Today, a young person anywhere in the country can go online and find a site that sells cigarettes. He or she can find a site that doesn't require any kind of meaningful age verification. And then the teenager can order cigarettes and have them delivered right to his or her home. 
   Despite the efforts of public health advocates, the flow of cigarettes to minors--and the evasion of state and local taxes--continues. 
   The majority of online cigarettes are shipped through the U.S. mails. So I am particularly supportive of this bill's inclusion of a provision to make cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and roll-your-own tobacco nonmailable products. 
   The bill has incorporated important provisions from H.R. 2932, a bill on tobacco nonmailability introduced by Congressman McHugh. 
   I thank Congressman McHugh and Congressman Weiner for their leadership on this  important issue, and look forward to ongoing collaboration in reducing smoking among America's youth.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAXMAN. (NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. I urge my colleagues to oppose this motion to recommit. For the last 8 years, our Nation's energy policies have been a fiasco. Gasoline prices are skyrocketing, our dependence on foreign oil is growing, and we are fueling dangerous global warming. 
   Yet when the Democrats passed even modest reforms that say we need to invest in cleaner fuels, not dirtier ones, the Republican leadership brings forth a motion to repeal them. 
   This motion would repeal a provision in the energy bill, the Energy Independence and Security Act, that Congress passed last year. In that bill we included a provision that said tax dollars should not be used to purchase new  types of fuels that would cause more global warming than conventional gasoline and diesel fuels. This provision was not controversial. It had broad support, and it would be foolhardy to invest our tax dollars in new fuels that would make us face a greater global warming problem. 
   Now there have been misconceptions about all of this, and that is why I was pleased the House just adopted overwhelmingly the Lampson amendment. Some of the misconceptions about section 526 say that it would affect the oil companies. But, in fact, the oil companies and other energy companies can do what they want with their own money. If they want to invest in dirtier fuels, they can. This just says the taxpayers are not going to be used to subsidize them. 
   Some people say section 526 would prevent NASA and other agencies from buying generally available fuel that contains small amount of fuel from tar sands. Well that's not accurate, and the Lampson amendment makes it clear that we could continue to import fuel from Canada. And in all of the acres that are not being drilled on now throughout the west, they can be drilled and this section is not keeping them from drilling. They could be drilled if the oil companies wanted to do it. 
   Section 526 does not prohibit investments in coal-based fuels so long as the fuels would be as clean as conventional gasoline and diesel fuel. 
   Global warming is real and it is dangerous and threatens our health, our environment, our economy and our national security. We have to stop making things worse before they will get better. That is a philosophy that makes no sense. And what's worse is this motion to recommit would be a motion that says ``promptly'' and that means that it would kill the legislation by sending the bill back to committee. The bill gives NASA the resources it needs to ensure that those investments are effective. It will enhance NASA's work, and we should not vote for this motion to recommit that would kill the legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAXMAN. (FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5687, the Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 2008, makes needed improvements to one of our core open government laws. I want to thank Chairman CLAY for introducing this bill and for his continued leadership in support of open government. 
   Advisory committees play a critical role in giving the President and agencies advice on complex issues. The Federal Advisory Committee Act, FACA, is intended to make the advisory committee process open and accountable to protect the independence and integrity of these committees. But in recent years, FACA has been undermined by the practices of the Bush administration. This bill is our response to these abuses: 
   One of my concerns over the last 8 years has been the growth of secrecy. This bill says that White House task forces can no longer operate in total secrecy. They must disclose whom they meet with and what recommendations they receive from special interests. 
   After President Bush was elected, he put Vice President CHENEY in charge of a task force to develop the administration's energy policy. Vice President CHENEY and his staff met secretly with oil, gas, nuclear, and coal executives. They developed a policy that has enriched the energy companies and their executives at the expense of American consumers, our energy security, and our environment. 
   This bill says that task forces like the Vice President's energy task force must come out from the shadows. 
   Another issue the bill addresses is the growing politicization of science. As documented in a Committee staff report in August 2003, the administration manipulated scientific advisory committees by employing political litmus tests and filling advisory committees with members with conflicts of interest. H.R. 5687 says that advisory panels must be independent and requires agencies to obtain conflict of interest disclosures from all prospective committee members. The bill prohibits an agency from appointing an individual with a relevant conflict of interest unless the head of the agency determines that the need for the individual's services outweighs the potential impacts of the conflict. The bill requires agencies to publicly disclose the conflicts of advisory committee members on their Web sites. 
   H.R. 5687 also prohibits using political loyalty as a basis for making appointments to advisory committees. 
   H.R. 5687 addresses other loopholes that have emerged in FACA over the years. It says that FACA panels cannot avoid public disclosure by operating through subcommittees. This was the tactic used by the President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security. The legislation also closes the ``de facto member'' loophole by clarifying that agencies cannot avoid FACA by giving Federal employees the right to vote on an advisory committee but then having private sector individuals participate in the committee as if they were members. 
   A number of improvements have been made to the bill based on comments from the Office of Government Ethics, OGE, and others. For example, the amendment clarifies that nothing in the bill is intended to weaken existing ethics requirements for special government employees. Under the amendment, a committee member appointed as a special government employee will be required to disclose any conflict of interest, as OGE defines that term, beyond what is disclosed in the member's financial disclosure report. This is intended to prevent special government employees from having to disclose the same conflict twice if they would already be required to disclose it through a financial disclosure report. 
   The bill leaves it to OGE to determine what disclosures are required beyond what has to be reported in a financial disclosure report. OGE should consider what interests a committee member may have that would not be uncovered in a financial disclosure report but that still may compromise the member's objectivity. For example, a committee member who held a position 2 years ago with an entity that would be affected by a decision of the committee could be considered to have a conflict even though the member's previous position would not be reported in a financial disclosure report. 
   Last year, we enacted reforms to another important open government law, the Freedom of Information Act. I hope this year we will continue our efforts to improve the transparency and accountability of government by enacting this bill. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5687.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAXMAN. (REDUCING INFORMATION CONTROL DESIGNATIONS ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. 
   Representative TOM DAVIS and I introduced H.R. 6576, the Reducing Information Control Designations Act to address the growing number of information controlled designations used by the Federal Government. The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has held numerous hearings on this issue. Committee investigations have found that there has been a proliferation of pseudo-classification designation such as ``sensitive but unclassified'' or ``for official use only.'' These often vague and undefined markings can be used to prevent or delay information sharing with interested stakeholders or public release of information. 
   The National Archives and Records Administration reports that currently there are more than 100 information controlled designations applied across the Federal Government. New categories of information controlled designations are being created by the agencies, yet these designations lack a statutory basis, and there is no Federal entity monitoring their use. 
   This bill addresses all types of information use across the government. Its goal is to promote open government by reducing the number and use of restrictive designations used on government information. 
   Specifically, this bill calls on the archivists to promulgate regulations to reduce and minimize the use of information controlled designations and to maximize public access to information. The bill allows individuals to challenge designations, requires that agencies' inspectors general conduct random audits to determine whether information controls are being used properly, and requires personal identifiers to be placed on information with an information designation control so agencies identify the individual who made the designation. 
   This bill also clarifies that agencies may not use information controlled designations in considering whether to release information under the Freedom of Information Act. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ranking Member Davis for working with us to improve this bill and to move it quickly to the House floor. The legislation before us includes changes that have been made since the bill passed out of full committee. These changes were made to address concerns raised by the administration and several interested Members of the Congress.     
   These changes include ensuring that the Archivist's training responds to lessons learned about improper application of control designations and deleting language requiring the regulations to address the duration of a control designation. 
   Secret government is rarely good government. This bill is an important step in restoring openness to the executive branch.

   This bill, H.R. 6388, the Government Accountability Office Improvement Act, is crucial legislation for protecting the taxpayers from waste, fraud, and abuse, and it is a cornerstone of Congress' efforts to improve oversight of the executive branch.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAXMAN. (DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOUSE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, today we are considering a bill that will help bring democracy to the District of Columbia. H.R. 1905, the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007, will grant the District of Columbia a full vote in the House of Representatives. 
   District of Columbia residents have been denied full representation in Congress for over 200 years. District residents pay billions of dollars in federal taxes yet get no vote in Congress. District residents have fought in every war our Nation has faced yet get no vote in the House of Representatives. This bill will help right this longstanding injustice. 
   There have been two champions of this legislation who deserve recognition. Congresswoman Norton has worked tirelessly on behalf of her constituents to forge a compromise that has bipartisan support. Representative Tom Davis, the Ranking Minority Member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has led the charge for voting rights for the District. 
   The District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act includes a number of important provisions. It will increase the size of the House by two seats. One seat will go to the District of Columbia and the other to Utah, the next state in line to get a congressional seat. The bill also prevents partisan gerrymandering by creating the new seat for Utah as an at-large seat and by ensuring that Utah does not redistrict its other congressional seats until after the apportionment following the 2010 census.  
   H.R. 1905 also contains a nonseverability clause providing that if a court holds one section of this bill invalid or unenforceable, all other sections will be invalid or unenforceable. This is an important safeguard because it means that no part of this bill can have legal effect unless the entire bill does. Under this legislation, Utah cannot be granted a seat in the House without the District also being granted a seat or vice versa. 
   H.R. 1905 is a step in the right direction toward providing the residents of the District fair representation in Congress. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAXMAN. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Madam Chairman, as one of the original cosponsors of this bill, I am proud of what it represents, and I strongly urge my colleagues to support it. This five-year reauthorization tells the world that the United States is truly committed to a sustainable global response to HIV, TB, and malaria. 
   The bill raises our financial commitment. It authorizes the strengthening of local health systems and the training of workers, including the doctors and nurses on whom the sustainability of this program will rely. 
   The bill also eliminates the onerous abstinence-only spending requirement. It replaces it with a provision directing country teams to tell Congress if they spend less than half of their funds for sexual transmission on behavior change programs. This is merely a reporting requirement, and should not be understood as a restriction on country spending. 
   I do want to acknowledge some concerns about the bill. Many would have liked to see stronger and more inclusive language encouraging linkages to reproductive health services. I would have liked to see such language too. 
   There is also concern about the current requirement that recipients sign an ``anti-prostitution pledge.'' People involved in sex work are very vulnerable to HIV infection, along with many other health and social risks. But what we hear from the field is that the pledge has had the unintended consequence of making groups shy away from effective outreach programs for sex workers. They are scared of running afoul of this broad oath requirement. I'm disappointed that we weren't able to eliminate it. 
   While I think we've got more work to do in certain areas, I'd like to take this opportunity to comment on several elements of the bill which I believe are vitally important. 
   First, despite the prostitution pledge, it is unambiguous that the intent of Congress is to direct close attention to the needs of sex workers and other marginalized groups. The bill specifically directs the provision of care, treatment, and prevention services to sex workers, injection drug users, and men who have sex with men. And it requires the development of strategies for providing evidence-based prevention services to each of these populations. 
   This bill also makes some important refinements to the treatment program. The expansion of antiretroviral services has been a huge success. But many people still lack needed treatment. Others require more expensive second-line therapy. And while significant progress has been made in the utilization of generic drugs, some U.S. dollars are still being used to buy brand-name drugs when lower-cost generics are available.  
   In light of these challenges, this bill instructs the AIDS coordinator to develop mechanisms for encouraging and facilitating the purchase of safe and effective drugs at the lowest possible price. The bill also requires the coordinator to report annually on the amounts paid for generic and branded antiretroviral drugs. And it requires that information on drug pricing be shared and updated routinely, so our partners can make purchases based on the best available information. 
   Finally, I'd like to note that this bill puts an important new emphasis on research. While we've learned much through this program, we haven't seen a coordinated research agenda to address questions about what works and what doesn't, especially in the area of prevention. This bill mandates a detailed strategic plan for program monitoring, operational research and impact evaluation research. It also requires a strategy for maximizing the capacity of host countries to conduct their own research. 
   But we should not let these developments make us complacent. The most basic, but often most pressing, health needs of the world's poor aren't being met. Children are still dying for lack of clean drinking water. Women face staggering rates of morbidity and death related to pregnancy and childbirth. And people across the world succumb to disability and death from treatable, and often preventable, illnesses. 
   As we pass this bill today, let's not forget these other pressing health problems. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on H.R. 5501. And I hope that the lessons and successes of our global AIDS program inspire us to reinvigorate our commitment to a broader global health agenda.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1873, the Small Business Fairness in Contracting Act, would make a number of improvements to the preferences given small businesses in Federal contracts. 
   The bill is the product of much hard work by both the Small Business Committee and the Oversight Committee and reflects our consensus view on many important issues, and I would like to thank Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez and the Small Business Committee for working with us to address their legitimate concerns and to reach the correct balance in this bill. 
   I would also like to commend Congressman Braley, a member of both the Small Business and Oversight Committees, for his leadership on this issue. I also thank the ranking member of the Oversight Committee, Congressman Tom Davis. 
   The bill represents a delicate balance between appropriate assistance for small businesses through the Federal acquisition system and the overriding purpose of the system, which must always be to ensure that taxpayers get the best value for their money. 
   The bill also starts us on the path of addressing the current contracting preference enjoyed by Alaska Native Corporations. These groups can be awarded Federal contracts of any size without competition. 
   To address these concerns about ANC contracts and promote competition in contracting, the bill includes a provision which would give Congress until the end of the year to adopt legislation addressing sole-source contracting by Alaska Native Corporations and economically disadvantaged Indian tribes. If we fail to act during this ``placeholder'' period, the bill would then require the administration to consult with Alaska Natives and Indian tribes to establish an appropriate limit on the size of the sole-source awards to these groups. 
   In crafting this provision, I have worked closely with the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee), who is Democratic Chair of the Congressional Native American Caucus; and at this time I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee) for the purpose of engaging in a colloquy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, my friend and colleague, Representative DAN BURTON, who just spoke, I think captured the essence of this issue. 
   The question is whether the U.S. Government can get a better price negotiating with the drug companies using the millions of seniors as leverage or whether individuals can get a better price if they could negotiate on their own or whether drug plans can get a better price if they can negotiate on their own. Medicare and government overall negotiates, and when the Medicare negotiates for physician fees, they negotiate what the fee will be and then they say this is the fee we will pay. That should be the same for the Medicare drug benefit. We can save billions of dollars. 
   Now, I know that we hear about the drug companies saying this won't work and, in fact, the market is working. Well, the market is not working. There is no market there. But it is not working. People can go to Canada right now and get a lower price for their drugs than they can in the Medicare drug plan as it exists today. People can go to Costco and get a better price. They can search around and get a better price. But when government negotiates, we get the best price. And we have seen it when the government negotiates the prices for the veterans, and we saw it when the government negotiated the prices for the Medicaid population. They used that buying clout and got deep discounts. 
   The drug companies raise all sorts of scare tactics. They say if we have the government negotiating prices, people will be denied drugs because there will be a formulary. And then the bill prohibits that from happening. Then they  turn around and say, well, to confuse the issue, if there isn't a formulary, there won't be savings. Most of the opposition to this is coming from the drug companies, and whose interests are they looking after? Not the seniors and not the taxpayers. 
   I urge support for the legislation.

   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, one year ago today, Hezbollah militants executed a brazen cross-border attack on an Israeli patrol that killed three and kidnapped Israeli reservists Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev. Weeks before, on June 25, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel from Gaza, killing two and abducting Corporal Gilad Shalit. 
   Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to travel to the region with Speaker NANCY PELOSI. With each Arab leader our delegation pressed the plight of these soldiers. The Speaker personally handed their dog tags to Syrian President Assad and urged him to act on a humanitarian basis to achieve their swift and unconditional return. 
   Sadly, these three brave soldiers join a longer list of MIAs that includes Zachary Baumel, Yehuda Katz, Zvi Feldman, taken hostage in 1982, and Ron Arad, an Israeli military pilot taken captive in 1986. As long as they are missing, their families, the people of Israel, and supporters of Israel around the world hold a constant vigil praying for their return. I want to recognize the dedicated work of the United Jewish Communities, the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, and a multitude of synagogues, camps and schools around the  country for their efforts to make sure these soldiers are not forgotten. 
   ``Leave no soldier behind,'' is the mantra of many armies. In a nation as small as Israel, where military service is mandatory, the commitment to rescue POWs and MIAs is a national imperative. It is our responsibility as a fellow democracy and steadfast ally to do all we can to help win their freedom.

<DOCNO>Mr. WAXMAN. (CONSOLIDATED SECURITY, DISASTER ASSISTANCE, AND CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, this Congress, the House and Senate have passed important Federal contracting reforms, but neither body has assembled them into a comprehensive package. The ``Clean Contracting Act'' in title 8 of the National Defense Authorization Act consolidates these provisions into a single, comprehensive reform measure. 
   I want to particularly thank Chairman Skelton for working with me to help bring these provisions to the House floor today. He has been a tremendous partner in the fight to root out waste, fraud, and abuse. 
   The Clean Contracting Act requires agencies to enhance competition in contracting, limit the use of abuse-prone contracts, start the effort to rebuild the federal acquisition workforce, strengthen important anti-fraud measures, and increase transparency in federal contracting. 
   The provisions in the act respond to procurement abuses that the Oversight Committee, the Armed Services Committee, and other committees have identified in hearings and investigative reports. These egregious procurement practices have occurred in Iraq, in the response to Hurricane Katrina, and at the Department of Homeland Security--and they need to be halted. They may enrich companies like Halliburton and Blackwater, but have squandered billions of dollars that belong to the taxpayer. 
   This legislation says that Congress is serious about stopping waste, fraud, and abuse. 
   One important provision would limit the length of no-bid contracts awarded in emergencies to one year. This provision would end the abuses that occurred after Hurricane Katrina, when many ``emergency'' contracts were allowed to continue for many years. 
   Another provision would require regulations and reporting on the use of cost-plus contracts, which provide contractors with little incentive to control costs. Spending under this type of contract grew over 75 percent between 2000 and 2005. 
   Another important provision would prohibit contractors from charging excessive mark-up charges for work done by subcontractors. This would prevent the infamous ``blue roof'' scandal following Hurricane Katrina, where taxpayers were charged almost $2500 dollars apiece for something that actually cost $300. 
   Other vital provisions in this bill would prevent the abuse of interagency contracts, as was the case at Abu Ghraib, where interrogators were hired using an Interior Department contract for information technology. 
   The bill also includes a modified version of a provision which recently passed the House under suspension of the rules. It is based on a bill authored by Rep. MALONEY and requires the development of a database of suspension and debarment information. 
   My only regret is that some of the other key reforms passed by the House were not included in the final version of the legislation. I am disappointed that the House and Senate compromise does not include a ban on private interrogators in U.S. military detention facilities or mandate congressional approval for any security pact with Iraq that is negotiated by the President. I am also greatly disappointed the bill, which authorizes some additional funding for the war in Iraq, fails to set a timeline for the withdrawal of our troops. 
   Still, I urge members to support this bill because the Clean Contracting Act provisions will make a fundamental difference in the way our government operates and begin to restore taxpayer confidence.
