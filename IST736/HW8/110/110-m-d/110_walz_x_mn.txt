<DOCNO>Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. (MIDDLE CLASS TAX FAIRNESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, the gentleman on our side of the aisle who just spoke from Illinois laid out the exact situation that's happening in our economy. That's why today I'm proud to introduce the Middle Class Tax Fairness Act, which will allow the average taxpayer to keep more of their hard-earned dollars. 
   In this slow economy, it's unfair to put the load of taxation right on the backs of the middle class. Middle class Americans are being squeezed by high gas prices, high cost of groceries, high health care costs, high tuition costs, and their paychecks, as you heard, are not keeping up with the rising costs. And in fact, the speaker was right; they're actually $1,000 less than they were 5 years ago. 
   Meanwhile, our tax code is full of government waste and unnecessary giveaways to the richest 1 percent. 
   Today, I am introducing legislation that will restore balance to our tax code and do something unusual: help reduce the national debt. My bill will be a jump-start to this slumping economy. It will double the standard deduction for the next 2 years, providing an annual savings of $750 to 61 million Americans. It will expand access to the child tax credit and provide relief on property tax. 
   My legislation allows the middle class to keep their income and does so in a fiscally responsible manner, by fully being paid for. 
   Madam Speaker, it is easy to offer a tax cut. It's harder to pay for it. Join me.

   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Graves for joining us today. On August 18 and 19, torrential rains devastated communities all across the Midwest. In less than a 24-hour period, more than 18 inches of rain fell in some areas of southeast Minnesota causing severe flooding, mud slides, loss of property and loss of life. In my district in southeast Minnesota, seven people lost their lives as a result of these sudden and violent storms. Countless more were injured. Thousands of homes and businesses were damaged and destroyed. In community after community, people returned to their homes to discover that priceless family memories, literally all they owned, had been washed away in a matter of minutes. Roads and bridges had been swept away and must be rebuilt. 
   I went to many of these towns countless times. I saw the challenges that these people face. Let me give you one example. Rushford, Minnesota, sits in the beautiful Driftless area, the rolling hills and rich farmland of southeast Minnesota. It is a town of 1,700 people, with a vibrant Main Street, a great civic pride, and they are also defending State football champions from last year. This town was almost completely under water. I entered the town on the morning of the rains by boat. There was one small island, a dry bit of land that had a church, part of a local school and a city building. That was the only part of the town that was above water. People had to take boats to get to this island in which they were having meetings, receiving help, and even getting started on that very morning of the task of rebuilding.     
   Even during the flood itself, Minnesotans were reaching out to their neighbor. In Minnesota City, during the worst of the flash floods, authorities ran out of all rescue equipment and rescue boats. Residents used their own boats to go from house to house, literally plucking people off the rooftops and bringing them to safety. 
   The response to this disaster has been inspiring. People from all across Minnesota and across the Nation have stepped forward to help. There have been blood drives, canned food drives, and waves and waves of volunteers who have come into the area to offer their help, open their hearts and homes. 
   This disaster was not limited to Minnesota. Similar storms pounded all across my neighboring district, and my good friend from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind) experienced devastating damage, as well as Iowa, Illinois and Ohio also. All told, 14 people died as a result of these storms and the flash floods that it caused. 
   This resolution that the House considers today is one very, very small, but important way, to recognize the challenging times that these individuals have faced and will face. It expresses sympathy for their loss and gratitude to the State and Federal officials who responded swiftly. This resolution recognizes the generous support given by so many and reaffirms the support of this Congress for the flood victims and the immediate and heartfelt and serious disaster declaration help that came from FEMA and the Federal Government. President Bush was in Minnesota within days of this, reaffirming his support. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and to stand with Minnesota and those throughout the Midwest who have come through the flood waters and are now working to rebuild their lives. I am sorry to say, the same area received between 6 and 12 inches of rain in some areas last night and is experiencing heavy rains again today. 
   We have work to do, but the response so far has been truly inspiring. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, at this time I want to yield as much time as he may consume to my colleague, my neighbor and my friend from Wisconsin whose district was greatly affected by this flooding. We have worked closely on this. It's through Mr. Kind's leadership, experience and forcefulness that we were able to secure, I believe probably in unprecedented fashion, the support we needed from the Federal Government. 
   With that, I yield to my friend from Wisconsin.

I think it is very important as Americans watch, and watch the proceedings on this floor, to understand the solidarity that is in this body and to hear my friends from Missouri and across the Nation stand with us in time of tragedy and understand that we will work together, we will solve these problems. I think it is encouraging to understand that we are making progress, we are making changes. I applaud that.

   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman for that. It absolutely is a team effort in this. I think the greatness that is this country is that when in times of tragedy and times of need, we can put many, many things aside and come together. 
   As Mr. Kind pointed out so clearly, to have Director Paulison from FEMA on the ground within a matter of about 72 hours of this tragedy and Secretary Chertoff from Homeland Security personally be on the ground to assess this, and to have President Bush in Minnesota and guarantee that we would get this declaration and then follow through, I think the American public should feel very, very good about that. 
   We have a lot of work to do, but the word coming out of our district and the word going to our staffs as they are working with people is that in this tragedy, they felt there was a face on a faceless bureaucracy. They felt America was there for them. They felt they could count on this body doing everything they could. For that, I thank everyone in here. I encourage my colleagues to adopt the resolution to show that continued solidarity.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. I thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and my neighbor over in Wisconsin for all of his work and, of course, Chairman Murtha for his unending and tireless support of our veterans.     
   I rise today in strong support of the long overdue modernizations to the GI Bill. The original bill, that you have heard so many talk about, was one of the best pieces of legislation that ever left this floor. It allowed millions to attend college that wouldn't normally have been able to do so. I am, like my father before me is, one of those that stands before you because of that. 
   I also stand before you in a humble position of being the highest ranking enlisted soldier ever to serve in this body, and the understanding of what these soldiers sacrifice and what our responsibility is should be known by everyone here. 
   At times of war, we are asking so much, and as Senator Dole told our committee not more than a year ago, you spent billions putting them in harm's way, you spend the billions getting them out. 
   We have a moral obligation to provide these veterans benefits when they return. It is also a national security issue to keep faith with our young people to know that, if they choose to sign up to defend their Nation, we will stand with them. 
   Now I can tell you this. I'm not an attorney like many of my colleagues here. I'm a high school teacher and a 24-year veteran of our military, but I hear people stand here talking about process, talking about legalese, talking about everything like that. Your process when you were in charge, you had 5 years, Mr. Speaker, 5 years to do something about the GI Bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, our colleagues on the Republican side had those 5 years. They chose to do nothing. They spent their time in enacting tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. They tell us today this is a tax on small business. They must be doing well in Louisiana and Texas compared to Minnesota because $1 million a year for a family of two is an awful lot of money. 
   The time to do this is now. We hear all the talk. We hear there's soul searching being done by my Republican colleagues. The only thing you need to do is look in the eyes of those veterans and tell them that you are unwilling to provide the necessary benefit for them to come back and make their lives whole. 
   This provides for our warriors in the field. It provides for our veterans, and it does it by paying for it, and for that, I encourage all of our colleagues to vote with this.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. (SUPPORT THE METHAMPHETAMINE REMEDIATION RESEARCH ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 365, the Methamphetamine Remediation Research Act of 2007. In Minnesota, methamphetamine usage has increased dramatically over the past decade. With that being said, legislators, law  enforcement and concerned citizens are all taking the necessary steps to protect our communities from the threat of methamphetamine usage and production. 
   This legislation addresses the difficult problem of meth lab remediation. Meth production, which occurs most often in residential homes, leaves behind dangerous toxic waste. In fact, according to the Minnesota Department of Health, meth production leaves behind up to 7 pounds of dangerous chemical waste for every pound of meth produced. This waste presents a health risk to future residents and an environmental risk to the surrounding area. 
   In 2005, in Minnesota, 88 major meth labs were discovered, each of which presented significant risk. Although Minnesota has strong local and State guidelines for dealing with meth lab remediation, the Federal Government can still play an important role in making our communities safer. 
   H.R. 365 will direct the EPA to research and establish important voluntary guidelines for meth lab remediation. Furthermore, the bill will bring together local and State agencies, organizations and individuals to share their best strategies for cleaning up meth labs and determining when they are inhabitable. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a necessary step toward improving the meth lab remediation process nationwide. It will help local, State and Federal law enforcement safely move forward after discovering a meth lab, and it will make local communities dealing with the methamphetamine problem cleaner and healthier. I encourage its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. (THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, in coming today on the first day back in this new session, the second session of the 110th Congress, I wanted to take a little bit of time to reflect on some of the changes that happened in this Congress but also more importantly to look towards the future and look at the priorities that this new Congress is bringing. 
   It's very apparent that myself and my 43 Democratic colleagues were brought to this House, the reason we were sent here was to change the way business has been done. It wasn't about maintaining a status quo. It wasn't about talking about issues that weren't relevant to their lives. It was very apparent that at least in my district of southern Minnesota that they chose to send a schoolteacher without political experience to Congress to speak about those issues that were most on their minds, to talk about the issues of economic equality, to talk about the issues of true national security, to talk about the issues that were going to impact their children for generations to come. 
   And in doing so, they sent several loud and clear messages to us. And I think first and foremost, as I'm joined with some of my other freshman Democratic colleagues, it was very apparent to many of us that we were sent here to talk about those issues in a manner that was about effectiveness. It was not about ideology. It was not about espousing to have a firm belief or the firm understanding that we had all the answers. The belief was to work together, to work with the experts, to work with local elected officials and come up with some of the most pressing solutions. 
   And I think many of us understood during our campaigns and the time that we've been here in Congress, it's not surprising to anyone, and my colleagues tonight will talk about these things, they didn't need to see a poll to understand that Americans were becoming very nervous with the state of the economy. 
   They were told over and over and over again by this administration that they were living in the best economy America had ever seen, and they would quote facts and figures like the gross domestic product and things like that. And when I would talk to my constituents in southern Minnesota, they would come up with something that was very insightful. They would say, I don't know. It's very possible that the GDP is growing, but that's not filling my gas tank; and, I don't know about you, but college is becoming more expensive; and, I'm concerned about heating oil prices this fall; and, I'm concerned that what's happening with the economy is not moving any closer to addressing those issues that I care most about. 
   They were concerned about the loss of their jobs. They were continuously told that this global economy and these trade agreements that we were working on would grow these wonderful jobs, wonderful prosperity, and what they continued to hear in the news was global corporations making record profits as we saw real wages for working Americans sink. 
   They were told that this great awakening of the global economy would be so helpful to them, and then they would open up their gas bills for heating and find out that they were having trouble making ends meet. They were told that this great global economy would bring a lasting prosperity to them, and they were receiving lay-off notices or many of the other ills that had come with it. 
   I think many of us understood, and not denying that there is a global economy, there is a need for an interconnectedness, but it needs to be based on some solid principles that benefit those vast majority of Americans. 
   So I think as we get ready to talk about some of those priorities we get ready to talk about what this Congress can do and what this Nation should do to make sure that our economic prosperity is not limited to a small slice of the population, and in fact, it's limited to the slice of the population that quite honestly isn't producing that well. 
   Americans over the last 5 years have got a record that I think they can be very proud of. Their productivity levels are as high as any Nation in the world. The thing that becomes a disconnect on that is, as that productivity levels went up, their real wages went down. At the same time, they watched CEO salaries and corporate profits reach an all-time high. And that disconnect is breeding that sense of anxiety amongst the public, and I think there's some things that this Congress can do and will do to address those needs and to put policies forward. 
   I have a couple of interesting statistics that I think Americans should know. First and foremost, on December 21, President Bush, giving a speech on the economy, was clear to stress how strong this economy is. And in fact, his outgoing economic policy adviser said, We just don't see the reason the economy won't continue to expand. Had I been a reporter in that room or a Congressman there, I might have asked, For who will it expand? And the issue or the answer to that is not for the working middle class. 
   We see 47 million Americans without health care. I think a more telling statistic is this. I came to this Congress as a high school teacher. I was lucky to have years of experience and advanced degrees that put me a little further on the pay scale. Had I been a first year teacher teaching high school in southern Minnesota, I would have started at just around $32,000 a year. My share of the premium for family health care coverage would have been $7,200 a year right off the top of that. And this is an issue that would expand that 47 million into another possibly 50 million that are on the verge of being unable to pay for it. 
   So we have issues of health care costs. We have issues of energy costs. We have issues of tuition and those types of things. And as this Congress came to session, those are the issues we were talking about, making college more affordable, addressing the issue of moving into renewable energies and passing CAFE standards to make our automobiles reach that level of efficiency that will help working class families.  
   So, as I'm joined here tonight by my colleagues from across this great Nation, and I might add, a very optimistic group at that and a very visionary group that understand, and the last statistic I will give before letting some of my colleagues join in on this, we had a piece of research that was done by the independent, nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. And they did a study asking what had added to our national deficit, and their conclusion was that 98 percent of that was added by legislative choices, the biggest being tax cuts for a very small percentage that, quite honestly, we were told on theory would generate wealth back into the economy. 
   The fact of the matter is the tax cuts were not targeted at our great entrepreneurial class. They were not targeted at those people who were going to create jobs and reinvest. They were targeted to people that would continue to build trust funds to pass on to future generations of that very, very thin privileged class. 
   And because of that, this Congress has got work to do. This Congress and these Members that were sent to this Congress that will speak tonight were sent by their constituents not to talk ideology, not to argue with the other side, but to look at the issues and not come with facts and figures, but to say, Hey, I'm a schoolteacher sitting in southern Minnesota and I'm having trouble making ends meet and I actually could qualify for food stamps. What's wrong with an economy that does that and what can be done to bring back a sense of fairness to it? 
   I think the good news in this is, if 98 percent of the Federal deficit was caused directly as a consequence of legislation, we've got the opportunity to reverse that. And I'm proud to be standing with three Members that I know have that as a priority, and I'd like to first of all yield to my colleague south of the border in Iowa, Mr. Braley.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Absolutely. And as I said, it's very encouraging, and I think it should be, Mr. Speaker, to the American people to see the dedication and the commitment. I know my colleague from Minneapolis has taken a lead role on this issue of foreclosures. And as my colleague from down in Iowa has said, this is an area that no one is escaping being touched by this. Mr. Ellison may represent a very urban area in Minneapolis, but Mr. Braley and I and the rest of us here have areas that are somewhat rural, and we are feeling that pinch. We're feeling it. 
   One thing I would say is it reminds me, in thinking of the story that you just recalled about President Roosevelt's knowing us, I'd like to give  you a quote from our current President when he was out meeting constituents. And this was out in Omaha, Nebraska, a little while back, and it was with a woman named Mary Mornin. And Mary was explaining, she was a woman in her fifties, a divorced mother of three, including a special needs child. And she was explaining to the President at that time, just several years ago already, of the growing anxiety she had about what was happening. And she mentioned to the President that to make ends meet, she was working three jobs. And the President said, ``You work three jobs?'' 
   Ms. Mornin said, ``Yes, sir, three jobs.'' 
   And the President said, ``Wow, that's uniquely American, isn't it? I mean, that's fantastic that you're doing that.'' And then he laughed and said, ``laughter'' in parentheses here, ``Do you get any sleep?'' 
   And Ms. Mornin said, ``No, not much.'' 
   This President has been so out of touch with the reality that affects most Americans that he can stand in front of them and tell us this is the greatest economy ever. He can stand there and watch as the housing market imploded and the indicators were there and people were asking him to do things about that. He can stand there and talk about this being the greatest economy under his watch full well knowing that the facts indicate he took office with a $126 billion surplus and he has continuously driven us into debt. 
   We are at a point in this great Nation now that last year alone we spent $406 billion servicing the interest on the debt, not the principle.

   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Gus is 14 months. His is $30,000, not counting the interest. 
   I would just make this point that the President, in the theatrics of the appropriation bills to run this country, held up funding across the spectrum from veterans to health care research to our soldiers' pay increase that he pocket vetoed, all of these things, over $22 billion. And I want you to put this into perspective. What this President has done in his fiscal irresponsibility, which should not surprise a single person in this country given his track record on the private sector and given that he was practicing, as my colleagues have said, a very tenuous principle of trickle down, that took the complexity of the entire economy and shook it down into one mantra. Today as this economy and this Democratic Congress is looking for real solutions for working Americans, the President is concerned about making tax cuts permanent in the year 2011 when they expire. All of the money that we spent last year on higher education, on our veterans, on conservation, and on medical research does not equal the amount we spent servicing the debt. Think what this great Nation can do. 
   And with that, I yield to the doctor from Wisconsin.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. I think it's interesting, and the changes that this  Congress has meant to bring, this stimulus package has meant, as all my colleagues have talked about, is of being that short-term, targeted, temporary reform that will put money right into the economy. That is in exact opposition to, I guess, the plan this President has espoused for the past 6 years that has drained money from not only the Federal coffers, but has drained jobs and siphoned them overseas. 
   I think it's really critical. A couple of points. I think my colleague from Louisville was exactly right when he was talking about the pendulum has swung. The only thing I wished on that is, and I think people need to be very clear about is, there is no natural order to things where that pendulum will come back on its own. The change to make that pendulum come back was the votes that were cast last year for Members, just like this, standing here. Sometimes you have got to reach up and grab that pendulum and get your hands a little bit bloody, pulling it back to where it needs to be. 
   That is exactly what we are trying to do. But as we are doing this today, some of the leadership on the Republican side of the aisle held a news conference and put forward a piece of legislation that they would do, that they would target to help this situation, to take away the anxiety of working class Americans, to make them feel like they can feed their family, heat their homes, and keep their good job. And their solution? Corporate tax breaks. The only thing in their package, reducing the corporate tax rate. 
   We all understand the theory that that will allow for corporate America to reinvest in infrastructure, to reinvest in jobs. In theory, it sounds brilliant. In practice, it's going to mean higher CEO salaries and more imports coming from China where they put the factories to save the money on the labor, to save the money on the environmental standards. 
   So those are the type of things that I think need to be clear, and I hear my colleague from Colorado saying very clear that we were not sent here to bicker, we were not sent here to espouse ideology, but we were sent here with a very clear mandate: Force change. The status quo would say, Continue on with President Bush's tax cuts, give corporate tax breaks. But everyone in this room knows that your constituents, the vast majority of Americans know that is not going to work. 
   So I am quite intrigued that our colleagues on the other side are going to stick with that. And I don't know if they need to poke their heads outside a little bit more, but that wind of change is blowing very hard 
   and it will sweep this place clean. It will sweep this place clean and put people here who understand those needs, who don't need to go and find talking points to understand how hard it is to send your kids to college, to understand paying a gas bill becomes a major family issue. And it needs to understand that what President Bush failed to realize with Ms. Mornin is, this wasn't a sense of she wanted to be away from her child, working three jobs. She had to be. 
   And the idea that you should be proud, and we are going to hear more about this, this idea of productivity is a great thing, but in many cases, Americans will work as hard as they possibly can. But the problem with this economy is the return is not coming. 
   Before I yield to my colleagues, I think this is one thing that we were sent here to reinspire, to get Americans to change their view on this, because I think this is one of the most disturbing statistics that I have ever heard. Now, for the first time since they have been asking this question, since President Bush's Presidency, and during this time period, when asked if their children will be better off than they were, the majority of Americans respond no. They do not believe that the leadership out of this administration or the previous years of Republican-led Congresses have done anything to set a vision for America. 
   So I don't know if we should be surprised that the solution would be more of the same coming from the other side. The solution that the American people want is not more of the same. It's a change that reflects their values. 
   So with that, I would yield to my friend from Wisconsin for a few closing words from him.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. First of all, I thank the gentlewoman. I thank you for your leadership. I thank you for your optimism. I thank you for your service to our country and all of our colleagues here. 
   Every time we come and stand on this floor, it is an overwhelming feeling. It is an overwhelming sense of the greatness of this Nation, as well as the responsibility that goes with standing here. Each and every one of us represents over 600,000 Americans. Their hopes and dreams rest on what we do in this building. This is the most serious task we can ever undertake. 
   As we talk about restoring accountability and restoring trust, nothing is more important. Nothing shapes this Nation more than what we do here. And as we reflect the great values that have made America the country that it is, we need to make sure that it is being done in the way that the Americans want it to be done. They don't care about the partisan ideology. What they care about is results. 
   I hear a lot of talk that actions are what matter. I watched for the last hour as our friends talked about a very important subject across the aisle before we came on. They talked about fiscal responsibility. They are absolutely right, that is something that must be restored. This Nation's hopes and dreams and the investments we make in our children and grandchildren are going to be largely determined by how we handle the fiscal responsibility put on us. 
   The only thing I find curious about the discussion is that our friends are so convinced that nothing works in here they seem to have forgotten to mention that they have been the majority party for 12 years. They seem to have forgotten to mention that they had the executive branch for the last 6 years and both branches of Congress. 
   During that time, we saw record surpluses turn into record deficits. We now have a $9 trillion national debt. We have seen the largest growth in government in a generation. And we have seen services provided to the people shrink and fees increase. 
   So I guess, coming from a high school classroom, sometimes I said it is always very important, those actions matter. Everyone wants to do well and everybody wants to talk about it, but what happens in here truly matters. 
   We have seen the culture of corruption. What I call it is the permanent vacation that Congress was on. Most people realize that the past Congress worked the fewest number of days since the do-nothing Congress of 1948. While we were passing the 100-hour agenda and the things you heard from our friend from Minnesota, all of the things that we accomplished, the previous Congress met for one day in January of 2006. 
   There is a stark contrast here. You are absolutely right. We were sent to this floor to do the people's bidding, not in a partisan manner but in a way that was open, accountable, transparent and actually got the results that we were looking for. 
   I wanted the opportunity tonight to come here and illustrate a couple of things how we are doing business differently, how things have changed in Congress and how these things are tangible, and I am going to bring a couple of these that are very near and dear to my heart. 
   One is about a project back in my district, if I could, Congresswoman, illustrate this just for the people. I will give a little background on it. Because this project had the potential to be the single largest taxpayer loan to a private entity in the history of this Nation, and most people, even in my district, until it was brought to light, knew almost nothing about it. 
   There was a railroad that came from outside the State of Minnesota that was planning on doing that was very important, building rail infrastructure. All of us agree in southern Minnesota that it is needed. We need to move our commodities to market, we have a burgeoning ethanol industry that needs to move our product, and we also have the need to move coal and other commodities on this railroad. 
   Well, this railroad tried for nearly a decade to try and secure private financing for this project. It failed to do so. Late in 2005, a program to give loans to railroads all of a sudden found an extra $32 billion in this program. It was written in by a Senator in the middle of the night in conference committee with specific parameters that would only apply to this railroad to get this loan. 
   This was done in the dark of night. The finances were kept private and out of the public eye, and the decision was going to be made after that conference committee by a set of appointed officials at the Department of Transportation. 
   Now, that in itself is bad enough in the culture of corruption. But it gets worse. Nine months prior to that Senator writing that in there, that Senator was a paid lobbyist, and as hard as it is to believe, for that very railroad. He is elected to the Senate and he puts this in here. 
   No one is doubting that we need rail. What this situation did and what it illustrated perfectly was when government is done badly, no matter what the intention was, it starts a domino effect of distrust and bad decisions. 
   This railroad was going to increase rail traffic up to 36 coal trains a day possibly, one mile long, and it was going to run by the single largest private employer already in my district, 210 feet away. That private employer was the world famous Mayo Clinic. Decisions were not allowed for mitigation, decisions were not allowed to make sure the impact and the safety of the thousands of patients that traveled were addressed. This was a case of special interest and their lobbying friends allowing something to happen that the people of the district had very little say in. 
   I was told all along, it is the railroad and it is the way it is. There is nothing you can do. They are going to be approved for the loan and they are going to start building. 
   My question was that I refused to believe that this body would allow that to happen. I refused to believe that the public's elected official for their district would not have the opportunity to see the financial situation of the railroad, as well as the safety, which, by the way, ranked 43 out of 44 in safety, with one being the best. 
   So upon coming to Congress in January, working bipartisanly across the aisle with our friends, I put forward a bill that would ask that this be evaluated for credit, that this be looked at and see what the finances were, and see if the American people's money was being put at risk. 
   To put this into context, when Chrysler needed to receive a government loan to stay afloat in the early 1980s, this loan was over twice as big than that. That loan for Chrysler was debated for 3 weeks on the floor openly before it was finally voted on and strict requirements for its payback put into place. 
   Well, I am happy to say that the Federal Railroad Administration and the Department of Transportation looked at those finances again and determined that this was not creditworthy and was not worthy of a risk to the American taxpayers. 
   Now, to ensure that this never happens again, we have taken it one step further and passed a bill that Congress must cosign. If we ever try and do this again with $1 billion or more of taxpayer money on a Department of Transportation loan, it is going to come in front of this body and we are going to get a vote and we are going to ask the questions. Is there a need for public investment into our infrastructure? Absolutely. Is there a need for expanded rail travel? Absolutely. Is there a right of private business to come to the government looking for some help so that they can build that infrastructure and profit? Absolutely. But it must be done in the light of day. It must be done with the approval of the American people's elected representative so that they can have the ability to decide if it was right or if it was wrong, and they will decide that in the way they vote in 2 years. 
   So, within 2 months, this Congress is starting to take those responsibilities. They are starting to ask those questions and we are starting to see progress. I can absolutely assure you, and I may never be able to prove this,  but I had to think had there not been a change to Congress, had there not been a new focus on trust and accountability and a new way of doing business, we maybe would have never seen the light of day on this. 
   So the people are served well, we have the people's interests at heart, and now we can move forward with a much more responsible plan. 
   So I applaud the Congresswoman for bringing us together. I know we each have several more opportunities to illustrate these. But I hope this one shows the American people, this is not a partisan issue. This is common sense. This is right and wrong. And I applaud those Members on the other side of the aisle that came to us and said, you are absolutely right, this is the way it should be done. 
   I yield back to the gentlewoman.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. (OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN GOVERNMENT -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to illustrate to the American people exactly what we are talking about when accountability and oversight fail. There are ramifications. Some may go unnoticed; others are absolutely horrific. 
   In the past several weeks, we have seen one of those examples. And the sad part is most people were not surprised. Most people have looked at this issue. 
   I want to talk about accountability and oversight. This Congress and our leadership are making sure we get our job done here. They are working us 5 days a week most weeks. My constituents back home, they don't have a lot of sympathy when they hear we are working Monday through Friday in the Capitol. That is what we were elected to do. That is what we were hired to do in their name. 
   I hear my friends on the other side of the aisle talk about, what do we have to do the whole time we are here? We are not voting the whole time, and the answer is, do our job providing oversight and accountability. Keep in mind, the entire last Congress had 30 oversight hearings. In the first 8 weeks, we have had 100. 
   Getting the job done for the American people means acting as a coequal branch in the responsibility of being fiscally responsible with their money, putting policy forward that benefits everyone, and making sure that the follow through is done on that. 
   I want to mention something as it pertains to our veterans and let people understand where this starts exactly. Make no mistake about budgets, budgets are far more than accounting. We hear our friends on the other side of the aisle talk about accounting and putting money in Americans' pockets. They talk about they have never met anyone who did their own taxes. 
   Well, I came to this Congress straight from the public school classroom, never having run for elected office before. I was teaching high school geography a few months ago. I can tell them on a high school teacher's salary, I was doing my own taxes. 
   And when they talk about a budget in terms of only being what is left in the pocket, they forget that budgets are moral documents. They are a reflection of our national values. How we prioritize those values is an absolute reflection of what we believe is most important in this Nation. 
   Now, I also come to you not just as a teacher but as a 24-year veteran of our armed services and our Army National Guard. I think the highest distinction that I could ever claim--at this time, I am the highest ranking enlisted soldier or servicemember that has ever served in this exalted body; it is something that I am very proud of. 
   Those people who know something about the military, I retired as a command sergeant major. The command sergeant major has one responsibility: Take care of the troops. Nothing else. That means feed them, clothe them, pay them, make sure their health is taken care of, and train them to complete their mission. That's what you need to do. 
   Well, I am now a member of the Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation, and what has happened at Walter Reed and what is going to happen again is not an anomaly. It was a decision. It was a decision that resulted from a failure in leadership and a bigger failure in accountability and oversight. And the saddest part about this is, the saddest, most tragic part about this was, it was totally avoidable. 
   Our veterans' service organizations, from the DAV to the Paralyzed American Veterans, to the Blind Veterans of America, to the Legion, all of these organizations understood what was coming.     
   I would like to just talk a little bit about, and illustrate, how the budget impacted what happened and how the lack of leadership and the lack of accountability led to that. 
   The chart I have up here is showing this is the VA treating many more Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans. Every soldier who serves in these wars will, one day, be a veteran. Now, it does not come as a surprise to most Americans, since 2003, when the war started in Iraq, we have seen a steady increase in the number of soldiers that are going to be treated. Seems pretty logical. Most people anticipated that was going to come. 
   The number of VA health care patients in general continued to rise. We have an aging generation from our World War II veterans to our Korean War veterans to our Vietnam veterans. They are continuing to rise at a steady rate. Every single veteran service organization predicted this. Every single person involved with this predicted this. 
   Now, we are finding out we have not had enough money. We have not correctly planned ahead to take care of the warrior after the war. When you choose to fight a war, and make no mistake about it, Iraq was a choice, you understand you accept full responsibility for those warriors, not for the time that they are there, not for the time they are treated in a facility like Walter Reed, but for the rest of their life. 
   In falling short on this, here is how we are going to make up for it. If you will look at our copy here, enrollment fees, pharmacy copayments and third party copayments. This says up here, the President's budget increases fees on veterans. Make no mistake about the language. This is the President's tax on warriors, period. 
   So we saw a situation, increasing number of veterans coming back, budgets that were grossly underestimating the number, that we would need to try and spend the money elsewhere or  maybe put the money back in somebody's pocket. When I go to my district, and I ask them the question, do you want a few more dollars in your pocket or do you want to make sure that warrior has a room that shows the dignity that this Nation should provide, and every single one of them will go with the veteran. 
   We must have an open debate in this Congress about accountability, where is this money going to go, where is this money going to come from, and I want Members who agree with this, that this is the way we should do it, to stand in front of the mother from Saginaw, Michigan, who was at the VA hospital in Minneapolis, treating her son with a traumatic brain injury, and tell her she better get the checkbook out and write it out and pay for this because that is exactly what has happened here. 
   When this Congress chose to not hold hearings, to not hold oversight, and to not ask the hard questions, they created the situation at Walter Reed. They created the coming situation on our VA system, and this new Congress has accepted the responsibility and I, as a command sergeant major, retired, stand here and say my responsibility was to take care of those soldiers in my unit. My responsibility now is to take care of all of them. 
   I have absolute confidence in my colleagues that they will provide exactly that. That is what accountability means. That is what oversight means. It is not a gimmick to get reelected. It is not cute words, and for those that say it is hogwash and pay-as-you-go does not matter, I tell them this is what matters. Decide how we take care of our veterans and let us do it the way this Nation knows it should. 
   I know we have a few more things to go over, but this illustration is one that impassions all of us. It is one that did not need to happen, but it is one that I am optimistic holds the silver lining of uniting this Nation over an issue we all care about and getting real results.

   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio, and so eloquently put. It is a new opportunity in America. It is one of optimism. We have got a lot of work to do, but Americans always rise to the challenge in the time of the greatest challenge. 
   I think it is important to realize that this place we are standing, this sacred hall, this is the people's House. This is the first branch of government in the Constitution. This branch is coequal to the other two branches, and our duty of providing oversight and accountability is not something that we get to pick and choose on. It is our constitutional responsibility. 
   When I hear people entrust me, you will hear people in this very chamber start using the term ``micromanage.'' It seems to me there is a place where they dream up these words that they just keep repeating and repeating. Well, I can tell you what, micromanage, call it what you may, could be oversight and accountability also, and I ask my constituents, would you like a little oversight and accountability at Walter Reed? Would you like a little accountability on the situation in Iraq? Would you like a little accountability on what you hear on some of the things that are happening? And the answer is yes. 
   Sunshine truly is the best antiseptic. This new Congress has been here for 2 months, and there is a new way of doing business. It is the way that this country was laid out under the Constitution. It is the one that has served us best for over 230 years, and it is the one that we will continue to use that will provide the American people with the best government possible.     
   I thank the gentlelady, I thank my good colleague from Wisconsin for the opportunity to be here with you, and I look forward to many more opportunities to do the Nation's bidding the way it should be.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. (KOSOVO -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to express my deep concern over the recent Department of Defense proposal to remove combat status from American soldiers serving in Kosovo. This summer, roughly 400 Minnesota National Guard soldiers who serve in my district will once again answer the call to duty in Kosovo. Almost every one of these 400 soldiers from my district will be going for the second or third time since September 11. In addition to the financial hardship these soldiers and their families will endure, the Department of Defense is asking them to suffer further by reclassifying this mission. Reclassification will cost American soldiers more than  just the $225 a month in hazardous duty pay, the payroll tax exemption and the flights home to see their families. We will all pay for this with the loss of morale. 
   Kosovo suffers from ethnic unrest. The country has unexploded ordnance and American soldiers work to defuse these daily. Mr. Speaker, Kosovo is still a dangerous place. It's revealing that the State Department's assessment is different than the Department of Defense. Foreign service officers receive hazardous duty pay. 
   Ensuring that this mission remains classified as a combat mission is more than about $225 a month to soldiers. It's about doing right for those who risk their lives in defense of this Nation.

   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Filner for his strong support of this piece of legislation and to all members of the committee. Mr. Boozman has been a strong supporter of our veterans, and I appreciate the support for this piece of legislation. 
   Mr. Boswell so clearly illustrated the need for this piece of legislation. I urge my colleagues to stand in support of this compromise that has come back from the Senate, and thank Senator Harkin for moving it towards us. 
   As I spoke on this piece of legislation in March, the numbers show that veterans' suicide and mental health issues are urgent issues that require Congress' immediate attention. Although veterans make up 10 percent of our population, one in five people who commits suicide in the United States is a veteran. 
   A full 35 percent of our veterans returning from Iraq are seeking counseling for mental health issues within the first year. PTSD is fast becoming a signature injury of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Veterans' Affairs Committee has seen in countless hearings that the need to expand care is there. 
   H.R. 327 will meet this need. By directing the Department of Veterans Affairs to offer mental health screening to veterans, providing education to VA staff, contractors and medical personnel, and making available 24-hour mental health care for veterans who are at risk, we will alleviate some of these hardships. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation because of the critical service it will provide. Although we often have bitter debates in this House and are deeply divided over issues like the war in Iraq, there is one issue that we all agree on and has the potential to unite us and this Nation, and that is the care for our veterans. No one in this body questions the incredible sacrifice each of the veterans has made on behalf of the United States. And no one questions the responsibility that we have in Congress to provide them with the resources and the help necessary to live healthy and prosperous lives. 
   With this legislation, the 110th Congress will again demonstrate its commitment on behalf of our veterans.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. (ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF I-35 BRIDGE TRAGEDY -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, it was one year ago today, at 6:05 p.m. this evening, that an eight-lane steel truss span bridge collapsed into the Mississippi River in Minneapolis. I'm sure we all remember that strange and surreal sight of a bridge laying in the very river it used to span and the images of vehicles that were crushed in the debris. 
   As a school teacher, for me the most poignant and terrifying image was that of a school bus balanced over the abyss as it was about to plunge into the steel and concrete below, but whose occupants were thankfully all unharmed. 
   Unfortunately, not everyone on that bridge made it home safely; 13 people were killed in the tragedy. That those numbers weren't higher was due in no small part to the hundreds of firefighters, police, emergency personnel and ordinary citizens who rushed to the aid of their fellow Americans. Their direct actions immediately following this tragedy saved lives and eased suffering. 
   Ordinary residents of Minneapolis displayed extraordinary courage on August 1. We are here today to note this sad occasion and to remember those who were lost. 
   Construction on a new bridge is underway. It will be wider, longer, more reliable and safer. And I thank my colleague who spoke earlier, Mr. Ellison, for his leadership on that, but it won't bring back those who tragically died. 
   Let us learn from this disaster and ensure it never happens again.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, today House committees will hear from General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker about the supposed progress being made in Iraq and the need to keep 140,000 U.S. troops there indefinitely. As we listen to this testimony, it is important to remember what our Nation's true goals are and what true, lasting security actually means. 
   A new report out this week from the same experts who advised the nonpartisan Independent Iraq Study Group concludes that political progress in Iraq is at best ``slow, halting and superficial,'' and political fragmentation is ``so pronounced'' that we are no closer to leaving Iraq than we were a year ago. The experts predict that it could take at least 5 to 10 years to produce any real, measurable political reconciliation. 
   Madam Speaker, I would hope that President Bush would read this new report so that he could see how people outside his administration are viewing the situation in Iraq. Such sobering and nonpartisan assessment should serve as a wake-up call that we should not leave 140,000 troops in Iraq indefinitely while the Iraqis are doing virtually nothing to live up to their promises.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H. CON. RES. 63, IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, today we will begin a long overdue debate about the President's troop escalation plan, and the Iraq war in general. I spoke earlier this morning, and I had the opportunity to address some of the conflict between the testimony of experts and this administration's wishful thinking in regard to this escalation. 
   What is said here on the floor of Congress, what is said by our experts and what is said by the administration matters. It matters because our troops will be asked to fulfill the mission that comes out of these discussions. Our debate on this resolution is about far more than expressing our disapproval for the President. We offer this debate in the hopes that it will shape the mission that our soldiers are asked to carry out, one that is based on facts and reality, not blind ideology. 
   I retired from the Army National Guard in the spring of 2005, and the unit I served with is now in Iraq. Many of these soldiers were kids that I taught in my high school classroom, that I coached on our football team. They joined my Guard unit, and I trained them. We deployed together in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, and now they are deployed again to Iraq. 
   As a 24-year veteran of the Army National Guard, I know that our soldiers are trained to fulfill the mission they are given, but having a mission that is achievable is the key to any military success. 
   The previous Republican Congress failed to hold the administration accountable for providing a mission that could succeed; and in so doing, they failed to support our troops. 
   Last week, I had the opportunity to speak with a field commander from the Minnesota National Guard serving in Iraq. He told me that our soldiers are performing magnificently, every minute of every hour of every day. That is not the issue at hand here. The issue at hand is providing a mission that can succeed. 
   Mr. Speaker, when we recess for our district work period next week, I will go home and look into the eyes of the families of these soldiers. These are the same families and the men and women who learned on cable television that they would be extended in their tour of duty. These are the same men and women who will face financial loss because many of them had the plan to return to their jobs after an 18-month deployment to work in agriculture and construction businesses, and now they will be delayed in their return. They will miss the critical season. They have been deployed for 2 1/2 of the last 4 years. 
   Mr. Speaker, we can and must do better by our soldiers. The resolution we will debate today and that I am in support of is meant as a first step to giving them an achievable mission and a chance to return. Our soldiers are trained to fulfill their mission without question. We as civilian leaders have a duty to question it on their behalf. 
   For the past 4 years, this Republican-led Congress has failed in their duty. This resolution is about this Congress standing up and saying we will achieve our duty to the same level of excellence that our soldiers have.

Madam Speaker, this week the House will have an opportunity to truly support our troops by having a substantial debate here on the House floor about the President's latest proposal for a troop escalation in Iraq. Some of my Republican colleagues will say that such a debate undermines our troops' efforts in Iraq. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
   How can this Congress stand on the sidelines when the President has been told by his generals, by an independent commission created by the old Republican Congress, by the American people, and by both Democrats and Republicans in the new Congress that this plan will not work? How can this Congress stand on the sidelines while our troops continue to serve as referees in a situation that even our own intelligence agencies say is worse than a civil war? 
   Madam Speaker, the resolution we will begin to debate today has the well-being of our troops first. First and foremost, we support them. We support them by saying enough is enough with the bad planning. The President should not send more troops to Iraq for the simple reason that it will not make any difference on a deteriorating situation on the ground.

   Madam Speaker, I rise in enthusiastic support of House Concurrent Resolution 5 on Hire a Veteran Week. This resolution will recognize the importance of our service men and women by designating an appropriate week as Hire a Veteran Week and will encourage the President to make a proclamation encouraging all employers to hire veterans. 
   I spent 24 years in the Army National Guard and did retire as a command sergeant major. Having recruited, trained, deployed with, and returned home with soldiers of many different ages, I know how difficult it can be to reintegrate into everyday civilian life. These veterans, who have sacrificed so much and asked for so little, deserve to return home to a solid job market and solid finances for their family. We owe it to them to use the power of this body to recognize those sacrifices and encourage our employers nationwide to hire veterans whenever possible. 
   These soldiers are truly the hardest working, noblest Americans we have, and any employer should be fortunate to call these veterans employees. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask the support, the unanimous support, of the entire House in creating a Hire a Veteran Week and encouraging this great Nation to work to employ its veterans. It is the very least we can do for them when they have given so much to us.

   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, it is time we restore fiscal sanity to Washington. In 6 short years, Republican policies turned a $5.6 trillion surplus into a $3 trillion deficit. That is an $8 trillion reversal of fortune. 
   And last year, congressional Republicans never came to an agreement on the budget and refused to pass nine of the 11 must-pass appropriations bills before adjourning in December. This isn't how the appropriations process is supposed to work, and the American people know it. 
   Democrats vow we are going to get things done and done on time. This year, Democrats brought much-needed reform to Congress by passing a rules package that require Democrats to pay-as-we-go. This isn't a new idea. From 1990 to 2002, Congresses and administrations of both parties abided by commonsense rules that stated you couldn't cut taxes and increase spending unless you paid for it. Pay-as-you-go was one of the main reasons Washington balanced the books in the 1990s. 
   This week, since Republicans were unable to do their job last year, Democrats will bring a final bill to the floor that will fund key priorities. This bill will allow us to move forward with fiscal sanity.

   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2179, the Traumatic Brain Injury Centers Act. 
   I introduced this bill because traumatic brain injury, or TBI, has become the signature injury of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and it needs our Nation's full attention. 
   While new forms of military technology are routinely saving soldiers' lives from deadly explosive attacks, these survivors often return home suffering from TBI. Veterans suffering from TBI may have trouble relearning simple skills or might be left permanently unable to perform daily functions. 
   H.R. 2179 would help veterans and their families cope with TBI by creating five traumatic brain injury centers. These centers would conduct TBI research, develop improved models for TBI care, and provide education and training on TBI for VA staff. While the VA has built an impressive medical system that includes polytrauma centers, H.R. 2179 would ensure that the VA system includes centers solely focussed on TBI. These centers will be the focal point for research and education dealing with this injury. 
   As American servicemembers return home, many of them suffering from TBI, we owe them nothing less than the highest quality care this Nation can provide.

   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, President Bush recently released his seventh budget, and it is more of the same. The Bush administration's 2008 budget continues the same fiscal irresponsibility of the past 6 years, sending us spiraling ever further into debt while failing to address this Nation's critical issues. 
   During this administration and past Republican-led Congresses, they took a 10-year surplus of $5.6 trillion left over from the Clinton administration and turned it into a $8.2 trillion deficit that mortgages our children's future. Despite the President's continuous promise to balance the budget by 2012, the current budget gets us no closer. 
   Mr. Speaker, this budget is not only fiscally irresponsible, it is morally irresponsible. We should not be piling mounds of debt owed to foreign nations onto the backs of America's children, while giving massive tax cuts to the wealthiest few.

   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, it's hard for this Congress to get President Bush to prioritize the needs of the middle-class families when he refuses to face reality and chooses to govern by veto rather than vision. 
   Yesterday, the President surprised a lot of us when he said the economy is perfectly strong. That's news to them. You don't need the polls to tell you that the American people are deeply concerned about this economy. Who can blame them? With home values and wages dropping, and health care costs, home heating costs, gasoline costs, college tuition costs and food costs all rising, the hardworking American middle class is trying to make ends meet. 
   This Congress is not satisfied with the economic status quo that serves a very few at the very top. We've made progress over the last year easing the economic crunch. We passed legislation to address the subprime mortgage crisis, increased the minimum wage, passed legislation that cut taxes on middle-class families and made college more affordable by investing in our children. 
   We're proud of these accomplishments, but we know the American middle class is still struggling. And we look forward to working on creative solutions that actually address the problem instead of simply vetoing with no leadership.

President Bush's energy plan was literally written by the oil companies, giving more public resources and billions in subsidies to the same companies that are raking in record billions in profits while Americans are reeling. That was the plan then; that's the plan now. 
   Every day, we hear our friends on the other side of the aisle demanding that we need to drill more holes. What we don't hear is anyone demanding that they drill on the 68 million acres they have. Legislation on the floor today will force those companies to produce oil and gas diligently on the 68 million acres of the public land, your land, that they already have. Experts say there are 4.8 million barrels of oil which would nearly double total U.S. production. 
   Madam Speaker, drilling has been the Republican slogan for years, and it will be so today. Today is finally their chance to put that slogan to the test, to tell Big Oil to drill now and to use it, or lose it.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. (REASONS FOR ENERGY AND FOOD CRISES FACING AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Thank you for this opportunity to speak on the floor and to give this Chamber a demonstration of what is so great about this country. The previous gentleman's district actually borders mine, but you may not find a more diametrically opposed view of what is happening in this country than you may get in the next 28 minutes. 
   You hear a lot of statistics and you hear a lot things thrown out. You hear a lot of economists talking about different things. The one thing I have found, and I think maybe it comes from being new to this business of politics, coming from a high school classroom, coming out of what most middle class Americans are experiencing is, is that many of those things do not matter to people. 
   What matters to them is the reality in their everyday lives. And that reality doesn't take a whole lot of background from them. It doesn't take a whole lot of statistics. It doesn't take a whole lot of anything, other than for them to make some simple judgments. 
   One of those judgments that the American public is going to ask themselves, and they are going to get to ask themselves in November, after 12 straight years of Republican control of the House of Representatives, after 6 years of total control of both branches of the legislative procession, the American people got a chance to see by the fall of 2006 the direction that those policies had taken us in. 
   In watching that, they made a decision come November. They chose about 45 new Members of this body, many of them without elected office experience, but many of them who came from the ranks of middle class working people, many of them like myself that never had a salary over $50,000. Teaching for 18 years, my salary when I left my teaching position was $48,000 a year. My insurance costs coming off the top of that were $7,200 a year, and then the taxes that came after that. 
   One of the things the American public will ask is, were they better off before that time when President Bush and the Republican-controlled Congress took over, or were things going in the wrong direction? Were decisions made that were affecting their lives negatively, and what were those decisions doing to them? 
   What was happening, as you saw the previous speaker talk about, what was happening to the price of fuel? Why was gas going up and who was benefiting from it? Why was the cost of their produce, why was the cost of groceries going up, and who was benefiting from that? What was happening to the cost of tuition? What was happening to their paycheck? What was happening to insurance costs? 
   Those were questions that they don't get to stand here and theoretically talk about and come up with some cute alliteration that I always hear. My colleagues are wonderful at the alliteration, and somewhat weak on the policy that impacts people's lives. 
   So as I listened this week and I watched a concerted effort, and one of the magazines on Capitol Hill wrote about that our friends in the minority have decided they are going to try and pin the energy policies on the new majority, understanding that President Bush will veto any attempt we make to change policy. 
   The policies that we are operating under in this economy are the ones that were put into place by the minority and put into law by the President.  The changes that have been attempted and those that have been made, such as CAFE standards, the fuel efficiency standards and improving them for the first time in 35 years, are so overwhelmingly accepted by the American public, those could not be ignored. 
   The ideology being expressed by the previous speaker I think is reflected in some. You don't need the polls when you go out and talk to people, but if you want to get to the data you are hearing them talking about, 72 percent of the American people disagree. Twenty-eight percent of the American people agree that President Bush's economic policies are the right direction for this country. 
   So when I hear talk about supply and demand, as if it is gravity, as if there have not been decisions made to influence either the supply chain or the demand by interests, by the growth, the astronomical growth of lobbyists, especially energy lobbyists at this place, it is bordering on the ridiculous. And when I hear about Adam Smith being talked about, the only ``invisible hand'' that is operating in our energy markets is that invisible handshake that happened in the White House between the oil company executives when they created this current energy policy. 
   I would like to take a chance here to illustrate what has happened on energy as it impacts the economy. 
   Now, again, speaking to the American people, when they are going and filling up, they are rightfully disturbed. They are rightfully concerned, and many of those people are understanding a larger portion of their disposable income is being eaten up in fuel costs, transportation costs. 
   The policy that was put into place that has driven this upward climb and that was so conveniently taken out here, about right in here and shown, has been a steady upward trajectory. And they are right. Several things are happening here. 
   There is no doubt that supply, world supply for fuels, especially with the rise of China and India, is having an impact in this. The only question I would ask on that is, who didn't know that back here? Who couldn't anticipate those changes and start planning ahead, instead of being reactive to everything that has happened? 
   This administration has been wrong on almost every single indicator economically around the world, socially, and they have not gotten any of it correct since they have come to office. So the trajectory is pretty steady, almost exactly what could have been expected on that. 
   But there are several other things at work here. One of the things is about this energy policy. I would love to show you and read from that energy policy to tell the Speaker, my colleagues and anyone in America that would like to know what that energy policy is. But the problem is, the White House claimed executive privilege, and in 2004 the Supreme Court upheld that executive privilege. 
   So that meeting that took place, we do have some reports on who was there, by the way. One of the first visitors on February 14, 2001, just 2 weeks after the inauguration and the President took office, was James Rouse, the vice president of ExxonMobil. He was also the major donor to all of the festivities that happened here with the inauguration of President Bush. 
   A week later was a long-time friend of President Bush and a supporter, Kenneth Lay, then, of course, head of Enron. They had two meetings. By March 5, the country's biggest utilities, Duke Energy and Constellation Energy, were in the White House. Then British Petroleum came on March 22. And that was followed by 20 oil and drilling companies to get meetings. At this point, to this day, none of that documentation is public. None of it has been out there. None of it has shown what happened. And what we saw was a steady increase and a policy that put this entire Nation's energy needs in the hands of oil company executives. 
   Now, I could almost get lucky in my district out in southern Minnesota. There is somebody who was in the room, somebody who knows. That somebody now lives in my district--well, temporarily. That someone is the vice president of Enron, Jeff Skilling. He is in the Federal Penitentiary in Waseca, Minnesota, in my district. He was with Enron. He understood what happened here, and he ended up, after going to court, in Federal prison for 24 years. 
   The policies here have nothing to do with supply and demand. They have everything to do with special interests and corporate interests over the national interests of this country. 
   So as you hear the previous speakers speak, and they talk about us trying to take energy off the market, the fact of the matter is, as I said, the previous speaker's district borders mine, I am very proud that in southern Minnesota my district is one of the Nation's top four producers of wind energy. We have beautiful wind generators going up and down the district. We have small towns, like Minnesota Lake, that are taking their town's energy and deriving over 75 percent of the energy for the town through the use of clean, renewable wind generation. 
   We are also one of the leading producers of alternative fuels and biofuels. And let me be very clear about this. As people talk about, well, biofuels are driving up the cost of food products, of commodities, there is a definite moral argument to be made of the idea of taking food, such as corn or soybeans, and turning it into fuel. The fact of the matter is, most economists agree that the impact on that is negligible, compared to the impact of the price of oil. 
   There is something I would like to quote here, and I would like you to see a couple of things here. When President Bush was asked prior to the election during the campaign back in 2000, he was asked what he would do to help control energy costs, he said, ``What I think the President ought to do when gas prices spike is he ought to get on the phone with the OPEC cartel and say I expect you to open your spigots, and the President of the United States starts jawboning with OPEC members to lower the price.'' 
   Well, in April 2005 there is a pretty famous picture here of the President holding hands with that. That is about the point where oil went up. This is from an ally who has promised to help us pay for the war in Iraq and has yet to pay 7 percent of their total cost. 
   Now, if they can't make it on $118 a barrel, it makes it pretty difficult for me to understand when they are ever going to get jawboned into doing something about this. 
   The next thing that I think is a bit of a fallacy here in this whole free market thing and this supply and demand, as if it is going to come down and drop upon us and be in perfect order, is why in the world did my colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to vote for $18.6 billion in subsidies to the oil companies? At $40 billion in profits for one oil company alone last year, over $100 billion in profits for the three major oil companies, they haven't got it figured out how to run their business to make a profit without the subsidies? 
   And what is at stake here is this isn't about class warfare. This isn't about, as the previous speaker from Michigan talked about, not being a friend of the oil companies or being their enemies. The fact of the matter is they have an unfair advantage on a unlevel playing field. If my wind generation and my cellulosic ethanol producers could get the same amount of subsidies driven back into research and development that we are putting into oil and natural gas exploration, I guarantee you we would compete on that. 
   I guarantee you we would have renewable energy sources that would take several things away. One is the dependence on foreign oil. That driver or that magnet of conflict around the world would be taken out of the equation. We would also start to create rural jobs and rural green collar jobs that would respur the economy. 
   This President and this energy policy that has created these prices that have been on a steady upward climb also took an economy that went from a manufacturing base and a base of middle class workers, who could figure it out. And this is all they are asking for. They go to work, they work hard at their job, they make the right decisions, they work 40 hours a week, maybe a little overtime. 
   Here is what they are asking for. All they want in return is the ability to have a home, the ability to have transportation to get to and from their job and maybe partake in their recreational activities. They would like to have health care for themselves and their children that is affordable and they can go when it is needed. And they would like to get to the point  where perhaps they could save enough money to send their children to college to ensure their future.     
   The American people aren't demanding a lot. They are not asking for a lot. But let me give you a couple statistics. 
   Since President Bush has come to office, guess what has happened. We have lost 1.4 million jobs. We need to be creating jobs. We need to be creating about 180,000 jobs a month to keep pace with population growth. Manufacturing jobs have increased by 3.4 million. 
   Income is down on an average, so the person going to work 40 hours a week, the person making the right decisions, the person trying to fulfill the American dream is getting further behind no matter how hard they are working. 
   The number without health care insurance has increased 8.6 percent. We now have 50 million American people without health care insurance. 
   And I guess the debate can be supply and demand: There is a big supply, there is big demand for it, not quite enough to pay for it, so your child doesn't get to go to the doctor. 
   If that is the type of country we are choosing to live in, then go ahead and follow the policies that have been put in place the last 8 years. If we think there is a better way to do this, perhaps we can start having a vision that extends to the next generation, not the next election. 
   Of course, we hear about gas prices doubling. College costs have gone up 36 percent. Foreclosure rates have hit an all-time high. 
   This President created an economy totally predicated on consumer spending. He drove that spending by the only way people could do it under the economy that was dropping their wages, by borrowing on their homes. And then they were given risky loans, and those risky loans--here is the thing in my district. I trust the bankers in my district; I trust those people to make loans. And do you know what? There used to be a contract in this country. As a borrower, you were expected to repay. I still believe that is true. But there is another part of that equation: As a lender, you actually used to want to get repaid. We have people now who are speculating, who are giving loans with no intention of ever caring what happened to the loan, selling it off into speculation, put in some exotic investment vehicle outside of any regulation, because we can have no regulation. 
   This economy predicated itself on consumer spending, on consumer borrowing. And the driver here was, if we regulate companies, how could they make money? If we ask them to take lead out of toys for children, that would cut into profit. And how dare we think we would do that. If we actually asked that our food be safe before we fed it to our children, we were overregulating and messing with that invisible hand. 
   Well, that is not the way the world works. It is not the way the people of America want things to work. What they want is a sense of fairness. They want that chance to be able to work hard, save a little money, get a house, take care of their family, and let their children have an attempt at living a life equal to or better than their own. 
   There are statistics out there now, for the first time in American history after 7 1/2 years of this Presidency, that the majority of Americans do not believe their children will live the type of life that they had, that they themselves had a chance to live. That is absolutely criminal. It is absolutely immoral. It is absolutely not the principles this country was founded on. And those that would say by us asking for alternative energy sources, by us asking to try and improve the ability of efficiencies in our automobiles and our building designs, that those of us who are asking oil companies to not be able to take $18 billion, and to think that you are going to drill your way out of this--they just tell us world demand is up. How in the world is drilling going to be a long-term solution? It is beyond me. With those things happening, though, the American people can be glad to know that is the minority opinion. 
   The majority in this House of Representatives is representative of the majority of the American people. Fully 72 percent disagree with the past policies we are on. Only 28 percent of the American people would espouse to believe that the policies you heard from the previous speakers are the direction that we should go in. 
   We should have a civil debate on this House Floor, we should talk about the implications of our policies, but we should also realize what we are talking about is the livelihood and the quality of life of the American public, and we have got work to do in that regard. 
   I wanted to just talk about a couple of things here, too. One of the things that is most striking to me is, is the President's and the rhetoric that happens on this House floor, that disconnect again with the American public, that disconnect of what a person is going through. And you can tell them all of these facts, all of these figures, all of the things that are out there, and they will still come back to the reality as it affects their life. 
   And I want to talk to you, as many of us saw, just for a minute, Mr. Speaker, as many of us were predicting for several years, they felt the fragileness in this economy, they felt they were saving less, they felt costs were going up, they saw that the ability to get their children to college getting further and further out of their reach. We saw policies that when those people of my generation had the opportunity to go to college, fully 80 percent was on the idea of Pell Grants and different types of grants, 20 percent in the forms of loans. We have almost exactly reversed that. And then we took those loans from being low-interest government guaranteed loans to being government guaranteed loans to private lenders with high interest rates. We have absolutely not made an investment in the future a priority. 
   And when you hear people talk about the so-called tax cuts, I ask everyone out there to see if, since 2001 and President Bush's tax cuts, are you better off? Have they fulfilled their promise? Have they filled your pockets with wealth? Have your streets gotten better? Have your schools become more productive? Has everything gone exactly the way they told you they would do? Because the bottom line in this country is, we have seen the single largest shift of wealth to the smallest percentage at the top than we have seen since the 1920s. We have the greatest disparity from those in the middle class and those in the top 1 percent than we have seen in the past 100 years. 
   The policies that were put into place did exactly what they were supposed to do: They shifted that wealth. And in the ideology, and I don't deny that my friends across the aisle believe this, those people in their benevolence were going to reinvest it all, creating great jobs here, and spurring the American dream. 
   The problem was this: They found out that they could invest in manufacturing jobs in places that didn't have worker standards, that didn't have environmental standards, that didn't care if there was lead in the toys. And, as they invested in those countries, their profits rose, and the jobs in America, according to I guess Adam Smith, the invisible hand pulled them and grabbed them to China. And when they couldn't do it in China anymore, they pulled them and grabbed them to Vietnam. And when they couldn't do it in Vietnam, they pulled them to Bangladesh. 
   I am unsure where they will go next, but I can tell you this, there is a lot of people sitting throughout the Midwest through Ohio and Michigan that sure wish some of those jobs were here. And they are not asking for a fortune, they are asking for a living wage. Well, that living wage, and every time we ask for it: That is going to hurt business, that is going to hurt the profits. 
   The bottom line on this is, this country was founded and predicated and was so successful because the middle class was successful. We are the most productive people in the world. Our productivity of workers in America is at an all-time high. 
   Now, the question I ask is, how can that be and real wages are decreasing? How that can be when their buying power has decreased? Unless something is fundamentally wrong with the economy? But if you ask President Bush, all is peachy clean. There are a couple quotes here, I don't know if it would be fair, but it sounds an awful lot like Hoover in the 1930s. 
   But here he was on October 17. Here was the economic news: The Commerce Department reports that housing starts  in September fell to the lowest levels in over a decade and a half. 
   Here are President Bush's words: When you got more houses than you got more buyers, the prices tend to go down and we are just going to have to work through the issue. I am not a forecaster, but I can tell people that I feel good about many of the economic indicators here in the United States. 
   The subprime crisis was right on top of our heads, and yet we are hearing this type of rhetoric. It is not based in reality, it is not based on the people who were already behind in their mortgage payments. It is not based and behind some of those exotic investment vehicles that were going to come crashing down. It is not that we didn't see that the Bear Stearns thing was on the horizon. Most people did, including his former Fed Secretary in Alan Greenspan. But, nope, it didn't bother the President. It doesn't matter the people here who for 6 years rubber-stamped every single piece of legislation written by K Street by the lobbyists and sent down here. Everything that was done behind closed door by Ken Lay, by Jeff Skilling, by the rest of them, sent down here, voted on against the objection by the minority party, our party at that time, that, you are heading for disaster, do not do this. Oh, no, no. We will create jobs, we will create wealth, we will create energy. 
   Now, all of a sudden, we have a slim majority in the House, we are equal over in the Senate, and the President vetoes anything that we utter over here. Now all of a sudden all of this is the responsibility here. 
   Well, I have one thing to say. The American people, come November, don't care what side of the aisle you are on, they care about, what are you going to do about it? 
   Here are a couple more from the President. 
   December 17, former Fed Chairman Greenspan, as I was just saying, suggested a tax break or other government help for home owners facing the mortgage crunch. 
   Here is what the President said: This economy is pretty good. There are definitely some storm clouds and concerns, but the underpinnings are good, just fine. 
   February 28, reports show that new home sales in January fell to the lowest level in 13 years, and orders for big ticket items such as cars and refrigerators slumped dramatically. 
   Well, I don't think we are headed into a recession, but no question we are in a slowdown. 
   And then, just yesterday: No recession. No recession. 
   The bottom line on this is, you have got your head stuck in the sand for so long, you tell yourself for so long that these policies are going to work. The American public again, as I said, doesn't care what the economists say. The American public and the average person that is out there, middle-class worker, doesn't care what the exact number of foreclosed homes are. They don't care about the derivatives in these exotic vehicles that were created on the subprime. They don't necessarily care where the oil is coming from or where the energy is coming from. What they know is they have got to get to work in the morning, and that takes gas. And that job is not paying any more. It might not be there tomorrow. They are not saving enough. 
   And I heard the person before me speaking on this floor talking about how great this oil investment is in the 401(K). Well, I should probably get some of his advice, because mine like many others in this country showed a downturn last year because of all of the other drops in stocks and investment vehicles. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, we have opportunities, there is no doubt. This country does, as the President said, have the underpinnings to perform better than any economy in the world. But the one thing the President fails to realize is the most important underpinning of that economy is middle-class American workers, the ones who for 12 years of Republican rule, 6 years of total rule by this ideology have suffered and seen their quality of life decrease dramatically. 
   The good news is, it is starting to change. College is becoming more affordable under the new Democratic Congress, gas prices will start to be adjusted as we start to put research dollars in to moving towards cellulosic ethanol, fast growing poplar trees, switch grass, things that are out there that we can get to. These are the types of things that are going to happen. Our manufacturers in Detroit have already caught on. We are seeing hybrid vehicles now that you can actually buy. We are starting to see Detroit want to compete again. And, guess what? Where was that invisible hand? Where was that market when we were creating cars that got 15 miles to the gallon? When they start competing with everybody else in the world, we will start being able to get to where we need to go. 
   This is an economy that can come back from this, but it will not come back with special interest policies that care nothing about what happens to the middle class, care nothing about the everyday things that people are going through. 
   And the last thing I would say on this is, when I listen to what President Bush says, it reminds me of the time, and I think about this, when his father went to the supermarket about 2 decades ago. And I remember this very clearly, I was in high school, and it was a big story on the news because the first President Bush was fascinated that they had scanners to scan the price. Now, every American in the country had seen that since the early 1970s. They had seen them in their local supermarkets for a long time. But the President was flabbergasted that that would happen. 
   My suggestion would be, there is a Safeway not far, the one I shop at down here, that the President get out there. He can take some security down there and he can go through there, and he can start to see what people are going through. On the way back, he needs to fill up. And then he might want to swing by and check the tuition costs at a university, even a State-run school. And then he would start to understand, saying things like: This economy is fine and that it is a little bit bumpy. 
   Losing your home is not bumpy. Not being able to go to college is not bumpy. Not having a retirement account that you can retire with dignity is not bumpy. That is a fundamental failure of leadership. It is a fundamental failure to have a national economic policy that benefits the vast majority. And, as Justice Brandeis so clearly told us at one point is, you can have a wonderfully strong democracy or you can have the concentration of wealth in the hands of few, but you cannot have both. Well, we tried their way. I would like to go back to having the wonderful democracy. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to speak on this great floor. I thank you to give a different interpretation of what is happening in America.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. (JOSHUA OMVIG VETERANS SUICIDE PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and a special thank you to my colleague, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Boswell) for introducing this important piece of legislation in honor of Joshua Omvig and his family and the heroics and sacrifice they made for our country, and for bringing it to the attention of this body and this Nation, this painful problem of suicide amongst our veterans. 
   Mr. Speaker, you have heard a lot of statistics today already. Ten percent of the population in America are veterans, yet one in five people who commit suicide is a veteran. Since May of 2003, 93 of our brave soldiers and warriors from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have taken their own lives. Beyond that, 35 percent of returning Iraqi veterans are seeking counseling within 1 year. Over 73,000 have been diagnosed as a risk factor, and 39,000 have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Despite all of this, 100 local VA clinics offered no mental health care as recently as last year. 
   But these are far more than numbers. These affect individuals. These are our children. These are our soldiers. These are our marines. These are the patriots that answered the call of duty for this Nation. And when they return home, we need to provide them with everything this Nation can provide. 
   Suicide amongst veterans, and mental health issues as a whole, require our urgent and immediate attention. H.R. 327 will direct the Department of Veterans Affairs to start screening and monitoring for the exact problems, provide education to all staff, contractors, and medical personnel, and make available 24-hour mental health care for veterans found to be at risk. 
   Just last week, I saw a unique teleconferencing technology at the Rochester, Minnesota, VA clinic. It allowed veterans in remote rural locations to speak with mental health professionals any time of the day. This technology is innovative and unique. H.R. 327 is a crucial step to ensure that this type of technology is not unique but it is available at any time for our veterans. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation. America's servicemembers make a profound sacrifice when they go to war. We owe them nothing less. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, we must not stop here. In Minnesota, 2,600 National Guard soldiers have had their deployment extended, probably until late 2007. They will come back facing these same issues. We must prepare for them.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. (ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, thank you to the chairman and the ranking member of this committee as we debate a very important piece of legislation in the Energy and Water appropriations bill. 
   I would like to talk specifically about an issue that is vitally important to literally hundreds of thousands of people in Minnesota, South Dakota, and Iowa. The Lewis and Clark Rural Water System is a unique water project that I am hopeful will receive the appropriate funding as the Energy and Water appropriations bill moves forward. 
   This Lewis and Clark water project, when completed, will provide safe, reliable drinking water to over 300,000 people in roughly 5,000 square miles of South Dakota, Iowa, and Minnesota. The project will move water from the Missouri River into those areas to provide safe drinking water and the ability of those communities to grow economically. 
   Minnesota is called the Land of 10,000 lakes. Unfortunately, they are not equally distributed. For example, in Rock County there is not a single natural lake. The lack of water has a profound impact on economic development. Businesses are reluctant to locate or expand because of the lack of reliable water. 
   I literally have communities that I represent that cannot permit a single new home to be built until someone moves out because their water shortages are that severe. Seventeen of the 20 local municipalities that are participating in this project, and I repeat on this and say it very carefully, have prepaid $87 million of their local share of the expenses in order to keep inflationary costs at a minimum. Additionally, all three States involved, Minnesota, South Dakota and Iowa, have committed to prepay on the project as well. 
   Unfortunately, the Federal Government is the partner that's lacking. My constituents, the people of South Dakota and Iowa, clearly understand expenditures of Federal dollars for investments are not necessarily wasteful. If the Lewis and Clark Rural Water System receives its full $35 million in requests this year, this project will be completed by 2018. However, if we are funded at the level President Bush has requested in his 2008 budget, we will not see completion until past 2051. 
   The 300,000 people of Minnesota, South Dakota, and Iowa can't wait that long. Previous Congresses have created a significant budget crisis. I hear my colleagues mentioning that, and they're absolutely right. We spent at deficit records. We created a national debt that is staggering, but we cannot be penny-wise and pound-foolish. 
   The longer we take to provide appropriate Federal funds, the more this project is going to cost, and it is already being built. It is already being prepaid, and it will produce significant economic gains for us. 
   I look forward to working with the chairman and ranking member to make sure this project is appropriately funded.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act. 
   I'd like to thank and recognize my two colleagues and friends who have led this fight with tenaciousness and with integrity for so many years, Congressman Kennedy, and my friend and fellow Minnesotan, Congressman Ramstad. The two of you represent the best that this institution has to offer, and I thank you. You carried on the fight that was started so many years ago by our late Senator from Minnesota, Paul Wellstone, and you've done so in such an admirable fashion. I can't tell you how proud I am to see this come to the floor. 
   One of Senator Wellstone's qualities was one that you've exemplified. He  stood up and he fought for what he believed in. It didn't matter what the political implications were. It didn't matter what others said. He steadfastly believed that discrimination against people because of mental illness or addiction was absolutely wrong and the antithesis of what America stood for. 
   Senator Wellstone represented our State of Minnesota, and due to his work, Congressman Ramstad's work, Congressman Kennedy's work, Minnesota has one of the strongest parity acts in the Nation, and it works. If we can do it there, we can do it in this Congress. 
   I would urge my colleagues to vote for this bill, not accept anything less, not the Senate version, not something from the White House, not a motion to recommit, not a smokescreen. This is the time to get this right the first time. Do the right thing. Pass this piece of legislation. This country will be better for it.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. (FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman of the committee and the ranking member for offering this incredibly important piece of legislation modernizing the National Flood Insurance Program. 
   On the evening of August 18 into the morning of August 19, devastating storms swept across the Midwest. Seven of the 22 counties in my congressional district are now Federal disaster areas as up to 18 inches of rain fell in a 24-hour period. Seven individuals in my district lost their lives, and countless others were injured. Thousands of homes were destroyed. Millions of dollars in damage to roads and bridges which were washed away literally overnight. 
   Subsequently, many Minnesotans found out how quickly they needed to become experts in the National Flood Insurance Program, so I congratulate the committee for taking up this legislation. 
   One of the improvements that you are hearing about is the improvements to the mapping of the 100-year and 500-year floodplains. 
   What my amendment does, we are getting the 500-year floodplains, and they are dealing with areas that could be flooded if a levee or dam fails. But they do not require FEMA at this time to map areas in the 100-year floodplain that, if not for a flood-control measure other than a dam or levee, could flood, and my amendment simply asks for those areas to be mapped. 
   When a flood-control measure fails, it is obvious that it is catastrophic. Whether it be a flood wall or a levee in New Orleans, or as we found out in Minnesota, a culvert in St. Charles, Minnesota, or a storm sewer in Hokah, Minnesota, the impact is devastating. 
   This amendment is very simple. It adds one sentence to this bill requiring FEMA to map ``areas in the 100-year floodplain, including any area that would be in the floodplain if not protected by a dam, levee, or other man-made structure.'' 
   This does not put any new requirements on residents living in those  areas, or put any additional burden on residents who live near dams or levees. The amendment simply requires FEMA to make information available about the risk of flooding that might occur if a flood control measure other than a dam or levee would fail. Some of the structures we are talking about: culverts, storm sewers, certain bridges and certain elevated rural roadways. 
   The recent floods in Minnesota showed the need for communities to have a comprehensive information plan on the risks that they face. This amendment would help do exactly that, and I urge my colleagues to adopt this small change that could make a big difference in how people adjust to the circumstances based on the potential of flooding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz). 
   The amendment was agreed to.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, today marks the eighth month since my colleagues and I were given the privilege to enter this sacred institution to represent our respective districts across the country. The Democratic freshman class, one of the largest in recent history, also came at an historic time in changing control of both houses of Congress and leading America in a new direction. 
   Much has changed in eight months. Much has changed personally for each and every one of us. Eight months ago I stood in this very spot with my 2-month-old son, Gus, as we were sworn into this esteemed body. My 5-year-old was a kindergartner at the time. 
   Well, now, 8 months later, Gus is 10 months old, on the verge of walking; and that kindergartner is now an experienced first grader. 
   Much has changed for us professionally. I had the opportunity last week to go back and address the school where I taught. Many of us came to this institution from many different walks of life. We were teachers. We were newspapermen. We were law enforcement officers. We were physicians. We were farmers. We were many different things. But each and every one of us came to this institution with a very sacred duty: to change the direction that America was going; to listen to the American public; and to make sure that this institution was once again judged on effectiveness, not ideology. And this Congress has done just that. 
   This Congress has changed the priorities that have permeated Washington for the past 12 years. This new Congress has changed things from some of the most historic funding for veterans to the most sweeping ethics reform, described as some of the biggest changes since the Watergate era. 
   We have much to be proud of and much work yet to do. The Democratic freshman class was given an opportunity to change the course and to change the debate. 
   I had the opportunity to speak with some reporters asking what will the legacy be? What will this class have accomplished when all is said and done? And I think, in looking at this group of people and having the sense of pride that I have in serving with them, that the answer will not be known for many years. This class has thrown themselves into their work with such due diligence that I think the American people would be proud. We passed legislation not just on a Democratic agenda but on a bipartisan agenda. 
   We knew, each and every one of us that got here, that we did not come to this institution with an ideological mandate. We knew that the American people, when they were speaking last November, were not saying that they were enamored with just Democratic ideology. They were enamored with the speaking about changing the direction of the country, providing a new direction, providing ethics that actually work. Providing funding for our veterans, funding for our children, and taking this country in a new direction in the war on terror and what was happening in Iraq. 
   And I am proud to stand here today with my colleagues, and we are going to spend a little bit of time highlighting those achievements, and it is one that all American people should be proud of. 
   This Congress can do nothing with just one party. This Congress can do nothing with just ideology. When this Congress works together, things get done that would amaze the American people. 
   I, coming from Minnesota, have witnessed two of the biggest disasters that my State has ever witnessed. Back on August 1, the collapse of the I-35W bridge, to see a major interstate, eight-lane highway, crash into the Mississippi River. We lost seven people with a hundred injured. That tragedy and the response to it illustrates what can be the best in America. 
   Within 60 hours, the House of Representatives and the Senate had passed  legislation to rebuild that bridge. It went to the President's desk within 72 hours, was passed, and the money is already flowing to the State of Minnesota to correct that. 
   Last week on August 19, we saw some of the most massive flooding in my district that had ever been witnessed, 17-plus inches of rain in a 24-hour period. We had seven deaths and thousands of homes washed out. The response was quick. It was bipartisan. It was professional. And it is one that the American people should expect, not hope for. 
   While the rains were still falling, I toured the area in the first few hours with the Republican Governor of Minnesota. The following day I toured with the Republican Senator and a Democratic Senator, and we held a news conference together with the Republican Governor. On Tuesday, President Bush was in Minnesota saying he would do everything he could to support us. On Wednesday, the Governor asked for a declaration, a disaster declaration, and on Thursday the President approved it. By the weekend FEMA was on the ground and people were rebuilding their lives. 
   That is what the American people should expect out of government: it is effectiveness; not its ideology; its bipartisanship, and it can be judged on what we do for the American public. 
   Those things have happened. They have happened across the board. They have happened in great numbers. And it is a message that I think the American people should be proud of. 
   As I said, much has changed. Much has changed for me personally. This is the first year I didn't start a school year teaching in a classroom. But I said many of those years, those 20 years in the classroom, taught me something about the next generation of Americans. They are optimistic. They believe that the best days are yet to come. They have a vision that can extend beyond the next election into the next generation. Our young people understand this. The American people understand this. 
   My colleagues are here not out of anything great that they personally did, but they are here and this change is happening because of the greatness of the American public. The American public and the system knew it needed to self-correct itself. It needed to bring change to this institution, and that change is happening. 
   So for the next few minutes, we are going to discuss some of those. I am privileged to be joined by my colleague from Kentucky, another one of the freshmen that came here that sprung up from this greatness of the American public and brought a message of change, of optimism, of prosperity that all of us can benefit from. 
   With that, I yield to my colleague from Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth).

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky. And he sums it up well. One of the things that the American public is most frustrated with is the idea of nothing happening or obstructionism. And I think some know that there is a difference between legislation and politics. But most people in America don't want to deal with the political side of it. They want to see the effectiveness. 
   And I should note 8 months ago on this day a couple of major changes were made that we were able to make. We have three branches of government, but the business that happened in this House for both sides of the aisle can be changed with rule changes. And on that first day we made some major rule changes that affect the American public, to understand that rhetoric is not good enough, that action is what is demanded. 
   The first thing that we did is we enacted PAYGO budgeting. No more blank checks. No more recklessly spending our children's rightful inheritance to this country by putting in fiscal policies that are short-term, feel-good tax breaks for very few Americans. PAYGO budgeting is exactly what the American people live by. It is how every middle-class American has to get by in their own life. And this House of Representatives finally put that in. By doing so, we will do something that the American people should expect to happen: We will balance the Federal budget by 2012.     
   But that's not good enough. We have a $9 trillion deficit. The idea that this Congress has been able to tell people you can have something for nothing, you can give tax cuts to the wealthiest and underfund programs, what's happened is this country is using the equity in our own country that belongs rightfully to our children and spending it now. Those days are over. PAYGO is a rule of this House and it will continue to be so as long as the Democratic Congress stays as it is. 
   The other major change was one that the American people simply don't understand. Many of us who came here didn't understand it, and many of us were incredibly frustrated by it, how this sacred institution, the most important, deliberative legislative body, democratic institution the world has ever seen has an image problem when it comes to ethics. Every single Member who walks through this door should be very, very cognizant of what this means to the American people. 
   So the ethics changes that were taken up 8 months ago, I think the American public would probably be hard-pressed to even believe that it didn't happen. The difference between 8 months ago and today is simply this: Lobbyists will no longer be able to provide one penny in food, not one penny in gifts, and not one penny in travel to any Member of this body. Now, that's a far sight from golf trips to Scotland and special interests that we had seen before. Those who think that the election of last November made no difference, look no further than K Street to understand the changes that happened here. Ethics changes have been sweeping. 
   Now, one of the things in standing here and talking about these things, I think there is a sense of frustration amongst many of us, the game seems to be coming from the other side of the aisle, is to delay and slow everything down and to drive the approval rating of this Congress as low as it can possibly go. None of us should be happy with the fact that when a Presidential approval rating is as low as this President's is and a congressional approval rating is as low as this body is right now, that's nothing to be proud of. And it's nothing to point one finger at each side of the aisle. What we're doing is we're undermining the basic tenet of this great democracy. And for those who think that this is someplace else, it's full of your neighbors, it's full of the people you work with, it's full of the teachers, the newspapermen, the law enforcement officers that you sent here. It is incumbent upon this institution to get the ethics changes right. 
   So we have passed some of the most sweeping ethics changes. And soon, maybe by the end of today, we will see the President sign in more of that; tightening up of not only the bans on gifts, but also making sure that bundled contributions to campaigns are being shown, that we know who's giving money, that we understand who is trying to look at and who is trying to influence decisions that are made in this House. 
   Now, one of the things I would like to say is that, speaking of your own accomplishments, there is a saying in Minnesota, ``Act and let others do the speaking for you.'' I want to quote a few things that have come out of newspapers basically over the last 30 days of all things that are happening here. We have a couple of things here. ``Democrats who control Congress headed into a summer recess having passed several high-profile bills, raising the minimum wage, bolstering U.S. security, expanding children's health care. Their top priority, ending the Iraq war, remains frustratingly unfulfilled. But the Democrats who took over in January were able to go home last month for a month-long break having won more support in the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives for bringing combat troops home by next year than any time before, marking a significant turnaround from last year.'' Reuters of August 5 of this year. 
   ``Some non-partisan observers agree, Democrats have reason to boast. Democrats have had a good run legislatively over the past few weeks, and that does help them going into the recess,'' said Larry Sabato, Director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. 
   ``Congressional Democrat majority made major strides towards implementing its domestic agenda before going home. It will face hurdles when lawmakers return at summer's end, President Bush being the main one. Farm bills, lobbying reform, energy, education, children's health insurance, all advanced in the final 10 days, establishing House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi as a major legislative player.'' Wall Street Journal. 
   ``Besides their success on increasing the minimum wage, ethics and lobbying, September 11 Commission recommendations, Democrats have moved forward with initiatives to expand health insurance for all of America's children through the SCHIP program, a shift in U.S. energy policy away from reliance on foreign fossil fuels. They have helped focus the war debate on the question of when, not if, U.S. forces will be pulling 
   out.'' The Los Angeles Times. 
   ``I have long been and continue to be an advocate of congressional oversight as a fundamental element of our system of government. I also have publicly expressed my belief that congressional debate on Iraq has been constructive, appropriate and necessary.'' That last one coming from Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates. 
   This Congress is making changes. This Congress is listening to the American public. This Congress is taking what it can control in its own hands, like rules, and strengthening them, making sure that ethics reform is a top priority, making sure that people can once again walk in this building, see this American flag, understand the history that's been written here, and trust the Members that have been here to do the duty of the American public. And in doing so, we have passed some of the most sweeping legislation. 
   The first one I want to talk a little bit about is veterans issues. Now, in serving on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, it's something that, of course, is very near and dear to my heart, something that I can't say that it's a personal sense of pride, but it's one of a personal sense of responsibility. The House historian notified me, after a week or two here in Congress, that as a retired command sergeant major in the Army National Guard, that I was the top ranking enlisted soldier to ever serve in Congress. Now, those Members familiar with the military understand that being an enlisted soldier brings a sense of responsibility of making sure troops are taken care of. 
   So to sit on the Veterans' Affairs Committee and watch the historic progress that has been made on veterans issues, I think it's interesting to keep a couple of facts in mind. In the 77-year history that we've had a Veterans Administration or the Veterans Affairs, in that 77-year history there has never been the infusion of resources given to that administration as  we've seen in the last 8 months. There is a group of veteran service organizations led by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, the Paralyzed American Veterans, the American Legion, that each and every year for the last 22 years have put together what they call the independent budget. And this independent budget does something very simple. It takes a look at the needs of all American veterans. It determines how many veterans are going to need services, whether it be veterans health care, re-employment, educational benefits, and the gamut of resources that we provide our veterans for the service they do this country. They take that number and then they figure out the real dollar cost of providing exactly those services, services that were promised, services that were guaranteed to our veterans when they signed up or were drafted to serve this Nation at times of peace and times of war. They take those two numbers and they put it in a budget and they send it to Congress. They say, you have X number of veterans at X number of cost; therefore, you should budget X number of dollars. And for the past 21 years, Congress has failed to meet that. 
   Congress has so blatantly understated the need that the current administration stated 3 years ago, when they made their budget, that their determination was that we would see fewer veterans and the cost of veterans health care would go down. Most of us will take the bet that the sun will not rise tomorrow before that would happen. And guess what? It did not happen. So we were left, 2 years ago, with a nearly $2 billion shortfall in taking care of our veterans. And the decision came then, who doesn't get care? Who do we turn away? And the answer was simply, turn away Priority 8 veterans. We will prioritize these veterans. 
   Now, Priority 8 veterans, to the American public, that may not seem like too much, but a Priority 8 veteran is this. It's someone in my district making $27,701 or more can be thrown off as a Priority 8. That can be a combat veteran. That can be a veteran of our conflicts, our current conflicts, Vietnam, or World War II, determined mostly on the economic scale, not the need, the accessibility, not what was promised to them, not what the right thing to do was. But lo and behold, you knock off several million veterans, and look, we had a balanced budget. That's not the way this Congress is going to deal with it. That is not the way this Congress is going to keep their responsibilities. And in this budget, we increased $3.6 million in veterans funding over the President's request. 
   When we passed that piece of legislation by, I believe, and I believe this is correct, I may be off by one or two, 409-2 was when this passed, and that piece of legislation was being threatened to be vetoed in that appropriations by this President. One of the 12 appropriations bills which, by the way, for the first time in a decade, all 12 were done on time, all were done by the August recess. That, in addition to passing nine earlier this year that were not done from last year's work. 
   So for any American who listens to the rhetoric, who listens to people talk about nothing being done, the question would be, can they back that up with fact? We can back it up with fact. 
   We've made some major changes on dealing with the current situation in Iraq and Afghanistan. The signature injuries of this war is the traumatic brain injuries and the concussive injuries caused by improvised explosive devices. They have become more sophisticated over time in the damage that they're doing. 
   The care our soldiers are receiving on the battlefield is second to none. It is the best care that has ever been given in the history of warfare on this planet. One of the problems with that is we are sending soldiers home with horrible injuries, injuries that are going to be with them for a lifetime, that is going to take a lifetime of care. And what this Congress has done is we passed legislation introducing new research dollars, new research centers, five of them, to be placed around the country in conjunction with our VA hospitals that have our polytrauma centers, the ones that are dealing with these concussive injuries. And we're going to put the funding there, we're going to put the research there, and it's going to do something. It's going to provide care not only to the soldiers, but it's going to provide the necessary resources to the families that are going to have to adjust their entire lives to deal with the damage that has been done by these injuries. This is not something that these veterans and their families should feel lucky to have. It's not something that they should have to come here, even though that's exactly what happens, and lobby this Congress to do that. It's what is the morally right thing to do. It is also the best way to show future generations of our young people who want to serve this country, who want to defend this country, that if they do so, we will be there every step of the way. 
   What we're seeing coming out of this conflict is post-traumatic stress disorder and suicide prevention. We passed H.R. 327, Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act. That is starting to get centers up and running. It's starting to do more identification. We are now screening every single soldier who returns from this conflict for traumatic brain injury and for post-traumatic stress disorder. 
   We are changing the way that we welcome our soldiers home. We are changing the way that we treat them and we screen them and we bring they and their families into the process of making them whole again. 
   We have the Rural Veterans Healthcare Improvement Act. One of the things we have a problem with, and this is one the American people should be incredibly frustrated with that I, as a veteran, was, our veterans who have to travel to VA centers to get health care are reimbursed at the 1978 rate of 11 cents a mile. And I have a veteran, a first sergeant no less, who saw combat duty in Korea. When he brought this up about a year ago to an official, he was simply told to get a more fuel-efficient automobile. Now, this Congress has found fit to reimburse itself at 48 1/2 cents a mile. At some point, the American public should ask where is the hypocrisy in who we're treating and who should receive the benefit. But those have changed. 
   We also introduced legislation that changed the GI Bill. We have soldiers, in the units that I served with, in the 34th Division who served the longest tour of duty in the war of Iraq of any unit in the U.S. military, 22 months. These are the same soldiers that, 14 months previously, served a tour of duty in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, the war in Afghanistan. And the way the GI Bill is written, these soldiers have been gone for 4 years. Many of them signed up for a 6-year commitment. Their commitment is coming to an end, and at the same time, their benefits. They would have been able to use their GI Bill had they not been out fighting a war to defend America, had they not been doing what they were asked to do, and because of that they were losing their benefit. Previous Congresses took no action to correct that. This Congress did. That's taking care of our veterans. That's not only standing in front of them for photo opportunities, it's standing behind them. 
   I am proud to say this new Congress puts its money where its mouth is. It truly supports our veterans. It understands that it's bipartisan. And this is a great accomplishment. 
   At this point, I would like to yield a little time to my colleague from Kentucky to talk about a few more initiatives.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. (THE NEW DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS -- (House of Representatives - September 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. The gentleman's point, one of the things that is very well taken is that the genius of our system lies in the system of checks and balances, the oversight that should have been provided. Now, those of us who were expressing grave misgivings about the President's plan to basically simply trust him that he had a plan for Iraq, to trust him that he had a plan on this, and any of us who spoke out and said, the responsibility for enacting foreign policy lies between the Congress and the President, carrying out the military side of it will always be done with great professionalism. 
   But as we ask the questions, what is the step beyond the military? What is the step for political gain in Iraq? What is the bigger picture, the geopolitical picture, of the Middle East? When we started asking those questions for 3 years prior to this Congress coming, we were told we were unpatriotic, that we were somehow undermining the troops. Forget that we funded them in terms of the VA and everything else at a historic level once we got here. We were told that. This oversight and this ability to check the executive branch is exactly what the American people are looking at. 
   I stress it and say it again. I do not believe that the American public were enamored strictly with Democratic ideology. But I can tell you what they were disgusted with; the belief of the sense of righteousness that was coming that there could be no room for debate, there was no room to compromise, there was no room to listen to the experts, and there was no reason to back off and say, ``Perhaps we were wrong.'' That's what we heard. That's what we heard for 6 years from this administration. That's what we heard with a Congress that provided this President no reason to veto. None. Zero. Why should he? They were writing the legislation. The President has been using the word ``veto'' in almost every sentence since we came here. That tells me the system is working beautifully. That tells me that the system is providing those checks and balances. 
   In this idea of oversight, there are a couple of important pieces of legislation that I would like to bring up and  then talk about how bills are now being written here, how laws are being enacted, and how the rhetoric that gets to the American people is all based on spin and politics. It is not based on reality. 
   The first of these is the Rail Safety Act. We had a sense in this country over time, and it was fought for by our grandparents and by our great-grandparents, it was fought for by every generation, to provide safe working conditions for our workers, to provide child labor laws, to provide good, safe ability of our people to make a living and return home to their families at the end of a hard day. The Rail Safety Act was to be authorized by Congress to oversee the operations of our railroads. Well, for the last 12 years, Congress has basically said, ``We should just let the rail industry determine their own safety''. That is pretty much how we did it with airlines prior to September 11. ``They'll provide it.'' No thought that maybe the purpose of business is to provide returns to their investors. No thought that maybe they would try and save a little money by cutting off safety at the expense of what might happen. So for 12 years, we have sat around and we have done nothing to reenact the Rail Safety Act. 
   This year we have already held three hearings. There will be a reauthorization of this. I have sat in those hearings in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and watched rail workers come up and talk about how many long hours they are being forced to work, how their grievance process is held up and never listened to, how we are simply running on borrowed time before we are going to see a major accident, and how we have seen the data that has shown we are no safer. I have listened to people from the railroads testify in front of our committee and tell me how safe it was and how the numbers are comparable to previous years. And I have to note, ``but your numbers only went to October of last year. We had 3 more months that you didn't include.'' 
   ``Oh, yeah, sorry about that.'' 
   That's the type of thing that went on. The American public doesn't expect us to take one side or another. They expect us to stand here, look at data, be fair, work with our colleagues across the aisle, hold firm to our convictions, disagree on issues, but do it agreeably, and come to a consensus that works. Don't try to figure out what the talking point is. Don't try and figure out how you can make the other side look bad. I spend a lot of time down here watching how much time goes in watching my colleagues make sure they say ``Democrat'' instead of ``Democratic.'' If it weren't so sad, it would be funny. But the problem is that's one small area that is a much bigger problem, that it's about the message, not about the effectiveness. 
   The second one I want to talk about is a very important one. Maybe many Americans don't know about it, but we have been waiting 8 years to get a reauthorization of the Water Resources Development Act, the WRDA bill. The WRDA bill deals with everything from transportation, clean water, everything in this country dealing with how we work with one of our most precious natural resources, our lakes and rivers. In my State of Minnesota, one of the most important assets economically, environmentally and culturally is the Mississippi River. It is something that is so inherently ingrained in who we are as Americans and those States that are on that river that how we treat it and how we deal with it is critically important. Well, the locks and dams that make Minnesota a major shipper of our grain in the breadbasket of America are over 70 years old. They're in decay. We need to invest in the upkeep of these. That can only be done, the locks and dams on the upper Mississippi, through the Water Resources Development Act. We need to pass that. We need to move it forward so that our economic vision will extend to our children. 
   For 8 years, nothing was done. Nothing was invested in. And now, today, taking it one step further, I sat in a hearing in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee dealing with the state of the bridges in our country. Now, it's obviously very timely. It has obviously been driven by the catastrophic and horrific collapse of the I-35W bridge in Minnesota. But when you see a map highlighting the thousands of structurally deficient bridges across this country, and I watch the administration's representatives say, ``We've got plenty of money to take care of this. We don't need to find a new revenue source,'' the aversion to speaking together and taking something off the table before we've had a chance to debate it is absolutely something the American people will no longer tolerate. This Congress has said, ``We need to figure out how to get these bridges funded.'' If it is through a Federal gas tax, then let's talk about it. And if it is through public-private partnerships, let's talk about them. If it is through reprioritizing how we use the resources we have, let's talk about them. 
   But we don't get that. What we get is slogans and radio ads talking about Democrats want to tax. Democrats don't want to tax. Democrats just want a country that works. This new Congress wants to have that discussion. We have sat here and watched bill after bill after bill go through subcommittees, committees, the full House, and minutes before we are to vote on it, the other side brings up a motion to recommit, which means a new piece of legislation. Most of the time, I have already got it down pretty well, is this one immigration or is this one felons? Which one are they going to bring up? They bring these up so they can go to the American people and tell them, ``They didn't vote against giving benefits to illegal immigrants.'' Well, one of the reasons we didn't do that was because they're not telling you the whole story. First is, it's already illegal and it doesn't happen. Secondly, the little part of the line that they don't say is, it would totally gut the funding of the piece of legislation we put out there. 
   That type of politics has the American public frustrated beyond all belief. Those two pieces of legislation, Rail Safety Act and the WRDA bill, should be absolutely nonpartisan. They should have maybe some philosophical differences on how you administer that or possibly how you pay for it. But here was the solution we had: ``Let's not regulate it. Let's not provide oversight. Let's let the corporations themselves do so. That's the best way to do that.'' 
   Well, the American public has rejected that. The American public has said, no. The American public says, We're not against regulation. We're against excessive regulation.     
   We are against regulation that doesn't make sense in terms of safety and the ability of our railroads to profit. But somehow because we are asking for these pieces of legislation to go through, that we are not supportive of economic growth, is ludicrous, especially on the WRDA bill. 
   Everybody agrees that the WRDA bill will be a major economic driver. It will put billions of dollars into the economy in terms of rebuilding and rehabilitating the locks and dams and other resources, as well as speeding up the transportation time. The Mississippi River has such a bottleneck near St. Louis that we can barely move cargo through that. We have an aging infrastructure, bridges that are unsafe, roads that are clogged. 
   The solution from the administration, they are talking about congestion pricing. That means we will charge a higher toll on roads that are busy in order to force people off them. I guess they assume that some of us are just driving around in the mornings, not taking our kids to school, not going to work; that we just like driving and clogging the roads. So the best thing is those of us who can't afford us, get us off the roads so those lanes will be nice and wide open for the people who can afford to pay to go down them. 
   The American public said that is not a solution. Get something else and debate it. That is what we are trying to do. 
   Now I would like to take a minute to explain to you how I believe and what I have seen and what I was hoping when I left that high school classroom, when I came to this building, when I came to this sacred floor, how I was hoping legislation would work. I live in southern Minnesota. It is one of the most productive agricultural lands in the Nation; in the world, I should say. 
   The county I live in is called Blue Earth County. People on the prairie are pretty literal. When they call towns Plainview, that is because that is what you see. When they called that  county Blue Earth, that is because the soil there is so black and so rich that when the sun shines on it on the summer days, it literally looks blue. This is land that can produce 200 bushels an acre of corn. This is land that feeds the world. 
   The farm bill is an important piece of legislation to that district but also across the country. The farm bill is a big piece of legislation that has historically been very, very bipartisan. That is because 66 or so percent of the farm bill deals with nutrition programs; how we feed our children in schools, how we feed our seniors, how we feed those who are not fortunate enough or need to use food stamps or other programs. That is 66 percent of it. 
   About 12 percent deals with the safety net that keeps our farmers in business, that provides this country the cheapest, most abundant, safest form of food at the least expensive disposable income of any nation in the world. That farm bill does that. It also provides things like rural development. It also provides conservation measures. 
   Well, here is how the farm bill was written. When I got here to Congress and was placed on that committee, we were given the instructions by the chairman of that committee in January to spend the next 2 months going out and listening to everybody, holding sessions, holding hearings, soliciting information, doing whatever you could to let people start writing that farm bill, because here was the directive. The farm bill would be written by the people through the subcommittee, to the full committee, to the House of Representatives, and then we would get a piece of legislation that we could be truly proud of. 
   So we did it. I went out and held 14 listening sessions throughout my district. It varied in attendance from maybe 50 to 150 people. It varied from teachers to social workers, of course farmers, agribusiness people. And as they came there, they came with a lifetime of ideas. They came with a vision of what agriculture should look like in America, and they wanted to be part of the process. 
   So they came and told me this: Congressman Walz, the average farmer in the first district is 58 years old. We are getting old and our children are leaving. It is very difficult to get into farming. 
   So groups as diverse as the American Farm Bureau and the Land Stewardship Project and the Farmer's Union got together, and each of them had proposed different ideas on beginning farmer and rancher legislation. Their members came to these meetings and explained the need for this. 
   We, myself, my staff, the ag committee staff, got together and helped write legislation. That legislation was taken into and offered up in the subcommittees as amendments to the farm bill. My colleagues on both sides of the aisle debated both for and against this piece of legislation and offered secondary amendments to change it, which we debated, accepted some, rejected some. When we were done, we had a piece of legislation that was heralded by most farm groups as a major step forward in making agriculture accessible to future generations. 
   That piece of legislation got added in. It was not written by special interest; it was written by people who care about this. Did special interest have their say? Of course they did. Our job was to sort that out. 
   Well, that piece of legislation in the farm bill happened in all the subcommittees, and that piece of legislation was debated in the full committee and that piece of legislation passed out of the full committee and came to the House floor. My colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I can guarantee you this, many of them, especially those in farm country, said this is a good piece of legislation. 
   Bipartisan groups, groups that were on the spectrum of politics about as far apart as you could get from one another, from environmental groups to production ag groups, were saying: You know what, I think they got it right. And then as we brought it to the floor, one of the things that we had to do was figure out how this thing is going to be paid through the whole process. Because commodity processes have been high in past years, we did not pay about $60 billion in subsidy payments, whether it be direct payments, contra-cyclical payments. 
   So what happened was when we budgeted under PAYGO, our budget for this year's farm bill was $60 billion less. So when we got to the end it became apparent, because Democrats wanted do make sure we did something as simple as this, we let the Food Stamp Program, senior feeding programs and some of our nutrition programs that had been underfunded for years, we wanted to do something as simple as boost them up to a level that people could get the caloric intake they needed to have a healthy diet, and then we wanted to peg it to inflation to make sure that what we put in the bill this year isn't eaten up by inflation next year. Doing any budgeting without considering inflation, to me, seems disingenuous. 
   So we did that. The way we came up paying for it was a suggestion given to us by President Bush and his budget director. They had identified several years ago approximately $7 1/2 billion in uncollected taxes from companies, in the President's own words, that were inappropriately using the U.S. Tax Code to shift their tax burden by shifting profits to offshore entities, mainly in the Caribbean, Bermuda being the one, meaning foreign corporations doing business in America, making a profit here, shifting that profit to Bermuda and 
   reporting zero in tax liability. 
   The President said it was inappropriate, as did his budget director. We agreed with him. We closed that loophole, asking them to do the thing that is most American of all, pay your fair share and take that money, put it in to enhance our nutrition programs. 
   Well, that was unacceptable because now that is considered a tax. That was the rhetoric that was coming. So now a decision has to be made. Are the American public, when they listen to this farm bill that needs to pass, and, by the way, we told them in January that we would have it done by the end of July, and there wasn't a single person that thought that was possible. Well, it was done. It was done by the end of July. We took it home. 
   I went to Farmfest, Redwood Falls, Minnesota to wide acclaim for this piece of legislation. It is not perfect. Nothing here is. It is a compromise. But it is a good one. It is good for rural America. It is good for our nutrition programs. It is good for our economy. 
   Well, that thing is now under a veto threat by the President. So the President has a decision. He can stand in front of the American public and say ``I am going to veto a really nice piece of legislation that was worked on from the grassroots level,'' exactly how you would hope the American democratic system works, ``and I am going to veto that because I believe that those foreign corporations have the right to avoid paying their taxes,'' or he can tell the American public, ``You know what? This was worked on bipartisanly, this was done correctly, and we should vote together on this.'' 
   We should tell the American public, this isn't about politics. This isn't about trying to get a campaign ad that says the Democrats are trying to raise taxes. This is about doing the right thing that we can all take credit for. That needs to happen. Now I would say the ball is in the President's court. The ball is in his court when it comes from the Senate to do exactly that. This Congress will continue to do that. 
   The last thing I would like to talk a little bit about is this new direction. One of the things that I think Democrats are rightfully proud of, it is the first piece of legislation many of us got to cosponsor, that was the small business tax relief and the raising of the minimum wage. 
   This piece of legislation, we know it has been over a decade since we saw a raising of the minimum wage. Some of my colleagues say, what's the big deal? I have got many names and many stories I could tell them why it is a big deal to raise the minimum wage, why the 3 million children living in families with parents with minimum wage, it is probably a pretty big deal to them. 
   But part of the story is focusing on the small business tax relief. The rhetoric that will come out is always one or the other, either/or, the false dichotomies. ``Well, Democrats are for raising the minimum wage, but they are not for helping business.'' Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, we passed this and it was signed into law.  
   Here are a couple things that it did, just to let you know. It was endorsed, by the way, by the Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Businesses. I don't hear my colleagues on the other side talking a whole lot about this. I think they should. It would be a good one for them to talk to their constituents about. 
   It extends a tax provision that lets small business owners write off more equipment each year for use in their trade or business, understanding that small businesses have a need for the infusion of capital purchases and things that they need to get started with their business, making sure they are able to write those off. Absolutely appropriate, absolutely the right use of the Tax Code, and absolutely a sense of investment in the future. 
   If we give these tax cuts, and some of them are pretty substantive, about $4.84 billion total, it ensures married couples who jointly own a small business both receive credit for paying Social Security and medicare taxes. 
   I am at a loss to understand why over the last 12 years of Republican control that was never fixed. This is a pretty important fix, and it is one that small businesses understand is important. It includes enhanced tip credit to ensure employers don't lose current tax benefits when the minimum wage goes up; S Corp provisions to keep tax benefits of being a small business even as they grow and expand; and extends the Work Opportunity Tax Credit through August of 2011. 
   These are things that are going to impact positively on small businesses. Seventy percent of our jobs are created in small businesses, employers with 50 or less employees. Those are the things that we have taken to do. 
   So those who would say nothing positive is being done, this Congress is not moving anything forward, would be remiss to look at the facts, what the facts have been. The most significant increase in veterans care that we have seen in the 77-year history, probably I think it is safe to say in this Nation's history; an ending of a 10-year period without a raise to the minimum wage for millions of American workers; a small business tax package that is going to enhance their ability to compete in the world; an ethics reform package that independently has been hailed as one of the most significant since Watergate, to bring back the dignity, to bring back the trust of the American people in this institution. 
   You heard some of the things about energy, focusing on energy independence. We have got a farm bill that is going to be one of the best we have seen. And when the President decides he is going to choose our farmers over foreign companies that avoid paying taxes, we are going to get a great farm bill. 
   We have got a Water Resources Development Act that is going to enhance our ability to compete in the world while adding billions of dollars in investments to our infrastructure. 
   We are going to clean up the Rail Safety Act. We have seen packages to education to make college more affordable, the most significant increase to Pell Grants. We have cleaned up what has been an absolute debacle in private lending, moving away from government-subsidized, low-interest loans to get our children through college by saying, gee, we have this vast pool of American kids who need to go to college to compete. Why shouldn't we profit from that? Why shouldn't we let private lenders make a whole bunch of money of them? That would be a good thing to do. 
   Now, that is quite a difference from what she said when I went to school, when future generations invested in me and said we are going to keep college as affordable as possible. We are going to make sure we use grants as much as we can, and we are going to make sure that the GI Bill can be used by these young people who are willing to sign up and they are able to get their education. That was wisdom. That was vision. That was nonpartisan. 
   Many of those accomplishments can be attributed to ideas coming from the Republican side of the aisle. Unfortunately, for the last few years, that hasn't been the case. But we have got a new direction. We have got a new optimism. 
   As I started speaking today, I talked about the changes each one of us have seen. We have been here for 8 months. In my home State of Minnesota, I am happy to tell you that I think I have witnessed change that all us want to know. 
   On August 19, as we talked a little bit about it, my district saw some the worst flooding that they have ever seen; 17 inches of rain in a 24-hour period. We had entire towns wiped out, towns of 2,500 to 3,000 people. I went into that town riding on a boat as people were leaving their second story windows as people were picking them up. We have seen catastrophic displacement of large numbers of people. 
   As I said, on Sunday, the rains were falling, and I was there with a Republican Governor. On Monday, a Republican Senator and a Democratic Senator, a Republican Governor and a Democratic Congressman toured together and promised to do everything that was possible. On Tuesday, a Republican President was in Minnesota pledging to the help of the U.S. Government. On Wednesday, a Republican Governor requested that help. And on Thursday, the administration delivered on that. By Sunday, FEMA was in the district caring for our people, taking care of the needs, and showing that, you know what? When we work together, there is nothing this Nation can't accomplish. 
   I am proud to be a member of this new class. It has been 8 months of change. The new direction we are going in is one that the American public wants.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I strongly support House Resolution 606, introduced by my colleague Congressman Ellison, my friend and fellow Minnesotan. Congressman Ellison represents the Fifth Congressional District of Minnesota, which includes the city of Minneapolis. I am grateful to Congressman Ellison for his work in introducing this resolution and getting it to the floor in a quick manner.  
   On August 1, the Interstate 35W bridge collapsed over the Mississippi River. The images of that disaster are now etched in our collective memories in this country. We can all recall the strange and surreal sight of a bridge lying crumpled and broken, laying in that great river. And we can all recall the images of vehicles that were crushed by the debris as well as those like the school bus that was full of children that sat amongst all that disaster and carnage and its occupants, and thankfully, escaped unharmed. 
   Unfortunately, not everyone on the I-35 bridge that Wednesday made it home safely. Thirteen of our fellow Minnesotans, husbands, wives, sons, daughters, grandchildren, grandparents, were killed in the tragedy. That those numbers were not higher was due in no small part to the hundreds of firefighters, police, emergency personnel, and ordinary citizens who rushed to the aid of their fellow citizens. The direct action of these civil servants and citizens immediately following this tragedy undoubtedly saved countless lives and eased suffering. Ordinary residents of the city of Minneapolis displayed extraordinary courage and compassion on August 1. 
   This resolution recognizes the outstanding work and effort of the first responders, the city officials, and the residents of Minnesota for their quick and compassionate response. I am pleased to join Congressman Ellison and all of the Minnesota delegation in this effort, and I extend my gratitude to those whose dedication and duty was so evident on August 1. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, first of all, to my colleague from Missouri, I thank him so much for helping manage on this. The poignant comments made by my fellow Minnesotans was heartfelt and I think put best maybe by Representative Bachmann that this issue truly brought us together. I want to send a special thank-you to this entire body for the response that was given to the people of Minnesota in light of this tragedy. 
   As we speak, the dean of our delegation, Chairman Oberstar, is holding hearings on this very issue of bridges across America to make sure we don't have a repeat of this incident and understand everything that we can do to hopefully prevent this type of tragedy. He is meeting with Secretary of Transportation Peters and the mayor of Minneapolis, Mayor Rybak, is in town talking on this very issue. 
   So it is appropriate that we honor those that sacrificed and gave so much in light of this tragedy and it is appropriate that we move forward to prevent it in the future. 
   I also thank my colleague and friend from Minnesota (Mr. Kline) for his kind words. He is very familiar with my district. His family has roots there. He has a farm there. He knows firsthand the devastation that was wrought on those counties. We lost seven of our fellow Minnesotans. We had seven counties that are national disasters. The response has been fantastic from both State, local and Federal officials. When you get 17 inches of rain in 24 hours, it brings great tragedy. 
   President Bush was kind enough and showed leadership in coming to Minnesota, promising a quick response and delivered. He also made a comment and made sure that one of our towns that was virtually destroyed, Rushford, Minnesota, needed to get back defending their State football championship. I am glad to report that they won Friday night, quite convincingly. 
   This disaster and the response from it, the silver lining of this is the great human qualities of compassion, courage, selfless service were shown by our first responders and everyone involved. It is a pleasure for me to put my name to a piece of legislation like this. 
   I thank and urge my colleagues to vote unanimously for H. Res. 606.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. (VETERANS BENEFITS AWARENESS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Thank you to the chairman for his outstanding and tireless work for our veterans. A special thank you also to Mr. Boozman, who has been an unending friend and supporter and effective leader in helping our veterans. I thank you. This is just one more example of your continued work. 
   I stand in strong support of H.R. 3681, the Veterans Benefits Awareness Act. This just simply, as you have heard the speakers talk about, ensures the ability of the VA to reach out and gather our veterans back in, making sure that those veterans understand all the benefits that are available to them, from suicide prevention to health care benefits, training, education, pension benefits, vocational rehabilitation, assistance for homeless veterans, veterans owning small businesses. 
   This Nation and this past Congress in the 110th Congress has done much to care for our veterans. One of the problems is that when our veterans return home, only about 36 percent of them enter into the VA system or apply for benefits, and what this does is take advantage of what all 435 Members of this body know well, is you need to advertise well to get that message out. The Department of Defense has done a great job of advertising for recruitment. It's time for the VA to put that money into making sure our veterans get their care. 
   The Rand Corporation said the capacity of the DOD and the VA to provide mental health services has increased substantially, but significant gaps in access and quality remain. There is a large gap between the need for mental health services and the use of those services. 
   Last year, this Congress put in a hotline for veterans seeking help with possible suicide and suicide prevention, and that hotline has received over 9,000 calls. Those may have been calls that would have never been received. So this 24-hour national hotline is working. I am pleased that the amendment that I put in to address this with the veterans suicide issue has been addressed. I would also like to thank the ranking member, Representative Buyer from Indiana, for his perfecting amendment on this bill. 
   This piece of legislation is a great example of bipartisan support that rises above and transcends politics to care for our Nation's veterans. This will be a good piece of legislation. It will get our veterans in. It will fulfill our moral obligation to care for our veterans and it will ensure that future generations of our young Americans understand that if they raise their hands, take an oath, and service this Nation, we will be there to serve them. 
   With that, I again thank Mr. Boozman. I thank the ranking member and I thank the chairman for continuously moving information and moving legislation forward that helps our veterans.  
   This bill will ensure that the Department of Veterans Affairs is able to use the power of modern advertising to reach out in as wide-ranging and an effective way as possible to our veterans. 
   The bill authorizes the Secretary of the VA to purchase advertising in the national media about the benefits VA makes available to veterans. VA offers health care and mental health care benefits, including for the prevention of suicide, an issue that we have been vigorously addressing on the House Veterans Committee; education, training, compensation, and pension benefits; vocational rehabilitation; assistance for homeless veterans, opportunities for veteran-owned small businesses; and direct opportunities for employment in the Department itself, among other things. 
   But if veterans don't know about these benefits, they're not in a position to take full advantage of them. 
   There is more than enough evidence that advertising works to promote awareness of whatever the advertising is about. Study after study has shown that advertising through the major media works. In fact, the Department of Defense itself knows that. That's why it devotes a lot of time and energy to advertising, including on television, as a means of recruitment. 
   We advertise to recruit our servicemembers, many of whom will put themselves in harm's way; that same means should be used to tell them what benefits they have earned when they return. In effect, we are saying to VA, ``If our veterans aren't coming to you, use the modern media to go to them!'' 
   This bill is also a perfect illustration of how we on the House Veterans Affairs Committee strive to work on a bipartisan basis to serve our veterans. This bill was introduced by Congressman BOOZMAN on behalf of himself and Congresswoman HERSETH SANDLIN. I offered an amendment to the bill, and then one of my Republican colleagues offered a perfecting amendment, which I was happy to accept. In that way, we worked together to produce a bill that is good for our veterans. 
   My amendment specified that the advertising VA would do could and should include a focus on suicide prevention, which has been an issue of much concern and some controversy lately. There have been several recent reports about VA's sometimes halting efforts to address what appears to be a series of major emerging mental health problems among our veterans. I have a great deal of confidence in the new Secretary of VA, whom I have been working with on a number of issues, and his commitment to resolve the problems that exist at VA and better serve our veterans. 
   An excellent and disturbing new report from the think tank the Rand Corp. observed that ``The capacity of DoD and the VA to provide mental health services has increased substantially, but significant gaps in access and quality remain,'' and went on to say in particular, ``There is a large gap between the need for mental health services and the use of those services.'' My amendment was meant to encourage VA to bridge that gap. 
   On July 25, 2007, the VA began operation of a 24-hour national suicide prevention hotline for veterans. The hotline reported greater than 9,000 calls. Callers included veterans who previously would have called a non-VA suicide hotline, veterans who would not have utilized a non-VA hotline, family members and friends of veterans, and other distressed non-veterans. Bottom line--veterans are calling the hotline. It is common sense that with more outreach, more veterans are likely to call the VA hotline. And advertising in the national media is one form of that outreach. 
   I am pleased that my amendment to this legislation was adopted, and perfected with the help of the Ranking Member on the VA Committee, Representative BUYER. 
   I strongly urge the passage of H.R. 3681.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Thank you to the distinguished colleague and gentleman from Texas. 
   Mr. Chairman, having been a member of our armed services for over 20 years and a member of many of our veterans service organizations for a long time and now as a representative of tens of thousands of veterans, I can assure you that no one has been a bigger supporter and fought harder for veterans than the gentleman from Texas. 
   It is an honor to stand here as we have crafted, I believe, under his leadership, one of the best pieces of legislation that has ever come through the House. I thank you for that, Mr. Chairman. 
   Having represented the district of southern Minnesota that includes the Mayo Clinic, the efficiency and quality of care in health care services is of deep concern to me. 
   One of the areas that I am concerned with, and one that I look forward to working with the chairman and his committee on, is how we figure out how to make sure that VA and the Department of Defense are fully cooperating in the efficient use of their health care resources. 
   In the past, the VA and the DOD have been encouraged by Congress to do the best they can to make sure they share those resources effectively. Some great examples of successes come out of that. Joint purchasing of pharmaceuticals has been one of those where we have seen great savings for our Nation, great savings for our veterans. 
   A year ago, the Government Accountability Office found that the VA and DOD are, indeed, making progress. But they also made some suggestions where they said standards must be developed to measure that performance in order to determine whether they are doing an adequate job of sharing their health care resources. 
   A year later yet we haven't seen, even though DOD and VA have agreed, we haven't seen them implement some of those recommendations. 
   Once, again, I applaud the chairman for a great piece of legislation, very thoughtful. I applaud my friends on other side of the aisle for great cooperation, thoughtful care, and an absolute commitment, a moral commitment to taking care of our veterans. 
   I look forward to working with you on this issue in the future to make sure that we are not only taking care of our veterans at the highest quality standard; we are also safeguarding those precious resources of the American taxpayers to make sure we are not duplicating services when we don't have to and to make sure that we are maximizing our effect.

   The colocation at the polytrauma centers is the right thing to do. The research that's being done there is world class. And I think an example of how we can enhance that comes from, and you just heard one of my colleagues speaking about this injury. 
   I visit the VA centers every Veterans Day for the last quite some time. And several years ago there was a young man from Michigan there, and he had suffered a traumatic brain injury. He had survived a shrapnel wound, but his brain had literally been turned inside of his head. And because of the great care he was receiving there, he was stabilized, and he was starting to rehabilitate. This bill will allow us to enhance his recovery, starting to reintegrate him back to the life that he knows and that he should be able to live. 
   On this floor we're going to continue to debate the wars. We're going to continue to see the debates divide us on the war in Iraq. This Congress, and I thank the ranking member, and the chairman for allowing the care of our veterans to bring us back together. Regardless of how we feel on this war, this Congress and this committee is proving that the 110th Congress can and will advance crucial legislation like H.R. 2199. So I thank you both. I thank my colleagues.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. (ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE 110TH CONGRESS -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to be here tonight with these great legislators to do several things. One is to reiterate the responsibilities of the first branch, article I of the Constitution, the House of Representatives and the Senate as coequal branches of our government, and also to highlight by the use of finally reinstating after 6 years of capitulation to the administration, finally illustrating to the American people what can be done when there is a coequal branch of government. 
   As my colleague from Florida was speaking about Halloween, our children are home celebrating Halloween. And the President was very clever today when he talked about a bill that he saw disguised as a trick. This bill he talked about is the SCHIP legislation which has 43 of our Nation's Governors supporting it, 273 Members of the House of Representatives, 68 Senators, and 81 percent of the American public. 
   What the President does not realize any more is there is a coequal branch of government functioning here. The President also said we have been wasting time. This perception of Congress failing is not something that is done by chance. It is done on message. Many Members know that a former Speaker of this House, Newt Gingrich, when he talked about how to take control of this House, talked about the only way to do so was to destroy the credibility of this institution and to pull Congress down. 
   Make no mistake, there is very much an idea here of obstructionism, but I want to be very clear: What the President talks about wasting time is things like ensuring the richest, most prosperous nation on Earth provides health care for its most vulnerable citizens, its children. The measure of this society, if it cannot be by what we are willing to do for our children, I am not sure there is another measure. And as we consider ourselves a great Nation, of which we are, the idea that this President would use the idea of fiscal conservativeness, after spending trillions and trillions into debt, and wasting, as you heard one of our previous colleagues speak about, money that disappeared, the money that has disappeared in Iraq and the waste on the contractors alone would pay for this bill. And this President asked us not to ask those questions. 
   Well, if he thinks that looking for fraud, waste and abuse is wasting time, I guess his definition is correct. I would say it is our constitutional authority. 
   Making college more affordable for middle-class Americans, making homeownership a reality based on fair lending practices, not predatory lending practices. And making sure we care for our veterans and for our soldiers. Those are the things that this Democratic Congress came here to do. We face massive opposition from a President who never even uttered the word ``veto'' in his first 6 years, but now utters it every single day on legislation that will improve this country. So I am proud to be part of this new class and I am proud to be part of this movement to once again reassert our authority on this. 
   The President's definition of wasting time is this country's business that we are doing. He simply dislikes it because, as we all here agree, the President has a very different reality of what makes a great Nation. We would argue a great Nation is one that is founded on those principles that were so critically important to the founding of article I of our Constitution which my colleague is shortly going to discuss. I yield back, and I look forward to a lively conversation here about the real progress that is being made.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. I appreciate it, and I appreciate the passion from my friend from Colorado. And he's exactly right. When we came to this Congress with a debt that was skyrocketed, no accountability, a President who said he was the decider and a Congress here that thought that their job was to just be an echo chamber for this President, much has changed. Unfortunately, the President doesn't realize that yet, and that's why we get a lot of gridlock that's happened. 
   But the gentleman brought up some very interesting points considering SCHIP and this idea of funding. I think that one of the issues that many of us agree on here is fiscal responsibility is an absolute priority because, unlike the previous Congresses, we understand that there will be a day of reckoning, and it will come for our children and our grandchildren. And it's putting this country in a position where I read an article here out of the Hong Kong Standard talking about where places around the world, when you would travel, and many of us have, where taxi drivers and store owners would take the U.S. dollars, they're no longer taking that. They're saying no because our currency is now seen as something that's not as stable, a nation that's in debt, a nation that's seen as a rogue nation to people. Those are the types of things that this administration did mainly because of what Mr. Yarmuth and the other members of this class have said, we did not exercise our right. 
   And as far as SCHIP goes, when we create a budget, and we want to balance this budget and we will, we understand it's far more than a fiscal document. It's also a reflection of this Nation's values and morals. And this issue of trying to cover our children, and I've heard my Republican colleagues say this is an attempt to expand coverage, to make it socialized or nationalized medicine. 
   Well, my colleagues have no real plan how to deal with this. They continue to pull this up. The bottom line here is the richest, most prosperous, greatest Nation this Earth has ever seen is leaving children uncovered. But it gets worse than that.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. (RECOGNIZING THE STATE OF MINNESOTA'S 150TH ANNIVERSARY. -- (House of Representatives - June 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Thank you, Mr. Davis, for managing the bill. A special thank you to my colleague from a little further upstate in Minnesota, Mrs. Bachmann. Thank you for your kind words. Your pride and enthusiasm for our State is evident, and I think all of us who live there understand why. 
   I, too, rise to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the great State of Minnesota, the 32nd State. It is our sesquicentennial, 150 years. From the natural beauty of the Mississippi River, across to the plains near South Dakota, this is a State that amongst the stark beauty has planted the seeds, as you heard my previous colleague talk about, of innovation, from health care to computer technology to agriculture. 
   I am especially proud to represent the southern area of the State, the First District, those many towns, like Winona along the Mississippi River, which were the stopping points near the upper end of the paddle boats that brought our forebearers to Minnesota. The courthouses and the city halls still represent that long heritage, that rich tradition and that sense of community that had people staking out a new life in the ``big woods,'' in the Land of 10,000 Lakes. 
   I am proud to have the City of New Ulm in my district. New Ulm is, as you might expect, a very, very German town. It boasts the ``Herman the German'' statue that is the second largest brass statue behind only the Statue of Liberty in the United States. There is the proud tradition of the Minnesota Music Hall of Fame that captures the tradition of the many musicians and folk artists that have come through and lived in Minnesota. Both Winona and New Ulm were capitals of a day, and I am very proud of them during the sesquicentennial celebration. 
   The City of Rochester, as you heard my colleague mention, the small town on the prairie that the Mayo brothers opened the door to a hospital and have established the most advanced critical hospital in probably the world. The Mayo Clinic is a destination. You must fly there to get there. There is not a large city to draw you there, but there is the absolute guarantee of the most quality care that you can receive anywhere in the world. They are leading the way not only in innovations in medical research, they are leading the way in how we deliver health care to all Americans. 
   Also the City of Austin, known for many, many things, and one also you heard my colleague mention, the invention of SPAM and the SPAM Museum. Mr. Speaker, I invite you and anyone to please visit this wonderful place. You will find out how SPAM is made, first and foremost, but it also is something about the Hormel Institute and this other great company. They have a research lab that is there that is called the Hormel Institute. By most accounts the Hormel Institute will feature the international conference on carcinogens and in cancer research, especially melanomas, and the Hormel Institute, when the story of how cancer is solved, it will probably start in Austin, Minnesota. It is something we are very proud of, a public-private partnership. 
   Minnesotans have always prided themselves on their education, of investing in their children. Garrison Keillor talks about all of our children are above average. We know that we have a ways to go, but we do take pride in that, from our many, many public schools and institutions of higher learning, producing one of the highest graduation rates in the country, and usually in the very top three of all SAT and ACT scores. So there is a great pride in this. 
   It is those residents of Southern Minnesota that I am here today to congratulate, people who have chosen to live in a somewhat harsh climate, to take the opportunity to settle this land, to move into the Upper Midwest and to settle and create not just places to live, but communities that were vibrant and growing, and that understood that the investments we put  back in them would benefit this country. 
   So, I am proud of our State. I am proud of what our State contributes to this Nation, just like our other 49 States and territories do. This Nation is strongest when we are altogether, and admission of Minnesota as the 32nd State strengthened this great Union. Today I say congratulations to all Minnesotans, and we are looking forward to the next 150 years.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. (PROVIDING HEALTH CARE FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICAN CHILDREN -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, last week 10 million children were denied health insurance because some of my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle chose to stand with President Bush over the children. 
   It is disappointing that some of our colleagues stood with the President and stood with the smoke-and-mirrors campaign to distort what the SCHIP legislation was. But this is not the end; it is only the beginning of the effort of this Congress to stand with American families to protect health care for our children. 
   Democrats in this body, along with 68 Members of the Senate and 43 of our Nation's Governors and over 80 percent of the American public want this piece of legislation to move. We are committed to ensuring that States have the resources and flexibility necessary to enroll these children. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people, Governors and many Members of Congress, both Democrat and Republican,  were disappointed that more of our colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle didn't vote to override the veto. However, we will give them the opportunity soon and often to change that vote, stand with America's children, and reject the President's veto.

It's something that the American people should be excited about talking about.

   With that, I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth).

<DOCNO>Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. (CONSTITUTIONAL CHECKS AND BALANCES -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Well, I thank the gentleman. And I thank the gentleman from New York for his clear testimony and for fulfilling his obligation, not only as a Congressman, but as a citizen, to ask the hard questions. When we send our soldiers and our warriors into harm's way, it's all of our responsibility to ask, is this the right mission? Are they being provided for with the right equipment? Are we doing everything necessary to ensure that that's happening? 
   And quite honestly, the problem around here up until January of this year was that people were being told that it was unpatriotic, it wasn't right to question those things because the President, under his administration, was determining that he was the unitary executive, he was the decider. Now, that's the President's right, that's this President's right or any right, I guess, to determine how they're going to look at that. 
   The foundational principles, though, of this country don't let us just get to pick and choose. We go back to the document that the gentleman from Kentucky keeps referring to. The Constitution of the United States clearly lays out for us, and I think it's kind of interesting and maybe even critical for us, it might be the teacher in me that goes back to this, I have been rereading a book on the Constitutional Convention by two professors from Georgia that take James Madison's notes about what was happening at that time and that summer when they were thinking how they were going to form this government.     
   When the President talks about he doesn't need 435 commanders in the field or whatever, what he does need to understand is that these 435 Members were the very first piece of decision-making that went into that convention. 
   I would like to quote a little bit if I could from this, to my colleagues and to you, Mr. Speaker, about what was going through their minds as they were formulating this and what our responsibilities as article 1 is. Keep in mind that they met on May 30, and on June 1, the first piece of legislation once they got a quorum and they decided they were going to go with a Federal or national government, here are some of the notes that were compiled. Here is Mr. Mason. 
   Mr. Mason argued strongly for an election of the larger branch by the people. It was going to be the grand depository of the democratic principles of the people. It was, so to speak, to be our House of Commons. It ought to know and sympathize with every part of the people. It ought to therefore not only be taken from different parts of the whole, but also from different districts of the larger members, which had several instances, particularly in Virginia, different interests of views arising from differences of produce, differences of habit, all kinds of differences. 
   Mr. Madison considered the popular election of one branch of the national legislature as essential to a free government. He thought, too, that the great fabric to be raised would be more stable and durable if it should rest on the solid foundation of the people themselves and their elected representatives as the pillars. They went on to formulate how they were going to do that and have the debate of who should elect the Senate and how those things should happen. But there was no doubt in anyone's mind by the framers of this government about where the pillar and where that foundation should lay. 
   I think it is interesting, then, to take a look at this of when they talked about the next branch, when they started talking about the executive branch. On June 1, the delegates began considering the structure of the executive. They were not sure yet what duties would fall to the executive or even whether a single person would hold that position. The major issue that faced them was one of balance. If the executive branch was too strong and independent, many delegates feared it might result in another monarchy like the ones they had recently revolted from. But if the executive was too weak and depended solely on the legislature, it might be ineffective. Thus, checks and balances were key to this. 
   In going through and looking at these, the different issues that are coming up or the clauses that went into this, it was apparent from the very beginning that the Founders of this Nation clearly understood that. As we said earlier, and my colleagues each said, this isn't about a piece of legislation. This is a platform or a framework to get back to where this country came from. This isn't about President Bush. This is about all subsequent Presidents. And so be it, be that Democratic, Republican or whatever it would be, that those individuals still must fall within this framework. 
   I believe, and I think my colleagues that are here tonight believe, that that was one of the motivating factors for sending many of us here almost a year ago to the day. It wasn't just ideology. It was about the framework of the genius that went into the Constitution  and the thought processes that formed that. 
   So in listening to this and listening to Mr. Hall describe his trip to Iraq, he is fulfilling his constitutional duties as an elected official and fulfilling the things that we know are necessary. I would go back to talking about this MRAP. If you remember, without the oversight, it was the administration that sent our soldiers with the army that we had, not the one that we would want. No one asked about body armor. No one asked about up-armored Humvees. Those were the questions that should have been asked in this chamber. But they were told, no, go along with the executive. 
   Well, article I is about saying, we will never just go along because that is not our duty. I am pleased to see each of my colleagues here. I know the passion that each of them feel for this issue is a passion for this great Nation. It is a passion for the founding principles. It is not a revisionist history. It is not a power grab. It is functional government that delivers for its people. That is what we need to get back to. 
   With that, I would like to, if I could, yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio.

   I am just reminded, remember how the Constitutional Convention ended? All of us remember this story from school, where Benjamin Franklin was asked what he was thinking about, and he said, I remember looking at that sun sitting behind General Washington and thinking during the time that this was crafted, is that a rising or a setting sun? And he said when they had ended, I could say with happiness, it is a rising sun. 
   This country's democracy is still healthy, it is still moving forward, the checks and balances are still here, and this country knows that it is the true secret credit of where our greatness lies.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, you've heard previous speakers this morning talk about the incredible profits of oil companies. The number is $40 billion last year. That is the largest corporate profit in the history of this Nation. And meanwhile, as these profits are flowing and high energy prices continue to squeeze working-class Americans since President Bush took office, gas prices are up 109 percent, and home heating prices are up 222 percent. And over that same period of time, profits at the oil companies are up 313 percent. 
   Now, to add insult to injury, in addition to these profits, the oil companies are currently receiving tax subsidies from the taxpayers of America. House Democrats do not believe that's right. 
   In the coming weeks, we are going to consider legislation that will end those subsidies and transfer it to renewable energy sources. Renewable energy jobs and investment across America depend on Washington to act on this. 
   Mr. Speaker, by passing this energy bill, congressional Democrats will lower energy costs, improve national security by making us more energy independent, and end taxpayer finance subsidies to the oil companies.

   It's time for a new direction in our energy policy. This week, House Democrats are bringing up that legislation. I was proud to work with a bipartisan group of Democrats and Republicans to craft a piece of legislation. Many of those ideas are incorporated into this plan. It invests in renewable energy, responsibly increases domestic supply by opening up the Outer Continental Shelf for drilling and releases oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
   One thing it does that is very good, it eliminates unnecessary tax breaks and subsidies to Big Oil and asks them to pay their fair share of royalties so we can invest in renewables. 
   All Americans, Republicans and Democrats, who believe it is time for our country to move in a new direction towards energy independence should join us and move this ball forward. This legislation will create millions of good-paying American jobs in the renewable energy industry, and it will begin to break the stranglehold of foreign oil over this Nation.

   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1677, the Taxpayer Protection Act of 2007. 
   Every year thousands of taxpayers receive smaller refunds than they are entitled to. Our Tax Code is so inaccessible and complicated that many families do not claim all of the credits they so sorely need. The Taxpayer Protection Act of 2007 will improve communication between taxpayers and the IRS. By encouraging the Internal Revenue Service to reach out to those that may qualify for the earned income tax credit, we will save struggling families many thousands of dollars 
   Tax preparation is a multibillion-dollar business in America. It is useful to those who can afford it, but no one should be forced to hire an accountant or a preparer just to ensure that they can enjoy the benefits that many of us take for granted. Nor should the industry be able to prey on taxpayers with unfair refund anticipation loans. 
   This piece of legislation will improve the safeguards against fraud. By increasing reporting requirements on the IRS, the agency will become a vital component in the important fight against identity theft. 
   As many Americans rush to file their taxes on time this week, we all want to feel secure that the refund we receive is no more or less than we deserve.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for her kind words, and I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for his many years of leadership and his service also and to the whole Armed Services Committee for this important legislation. 
   I am urging my colleagues, and I am sure it will not take a lot of urging. This House of Representatives understands. This resolution, House Concurrent Resolution 185, has recognized the incredible contributions, courage, and sacrifice of the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the National Guard that they have given to our Nation. 
   In July of 2005, members of the 1/34th Brigade Combat Team of the famed Red Bull Division were notified of their deployment. Twenty-two months later, in July of 2007, they began returning home, after a 22-month deployment. As my colleague from Minnesota said, they had no intention or no knowledge that they would be setting a record. They simply said yes when they were called upon. 
   As you have heard from each of my colleagues, the statistics are amazing on what this unit did: 5,200 combat logistic patrols covering 2.4 million convoy miles. You heard Mr. Kline talk about the number of IEDs that were found. A full 37 percent of the total IED incidents during their time there were attributed to the diligent work of this unit. 
   They helped start the Iraqi newspapers that you heard about, and they also helped produce documentaries on the positive work that our units are doing in Iraq. They completed 137 reconstruction projects; and during this deployment, as you heard, they reenlisted 1,400 of these brave citizen soldiers. And I think a really special thing is 21 of them became citizens during their time in service to this country. 
   Although they were originally slated to come home, they endured a 125-day extension, and their families and employers endured that with them. This record of the longest continuous deployment of any U.S. military operation in Iraqi Freedom is something to be incredibly proud of. Being there is one thing. Contributing positively the way they did is quite another. 
   The soldiers sacrificed 2 years of their lives in service to their country. I know how much they have given, as I was a former member of this Red Bull Division myself; and I know many of these men and women personally. 
   They have added to the long and impressive list of the Red Bull. Their lineage goes back to the 1st Minnesota Volunteers, the first unit to volunteer for the Civil War. The Red Bulls had 517 days of actual combat in World War II, that is more than any other U.S. division during the war, and captured more enemy hills and territory than any other division in World War II. 
   I, along with the rest of the Minnesota delegation in both the House and the Senate, introduced this resolution to honor their service and to recognize not just the soldiers, but their families and employers who patiently supported, loved and cared for them and waited for them until they returned to the Midwest. 
   I want to thank my colleagues from Minnesota for their work in support of this resolution, especially my colleague Mr. Kline from Minnesota. My colleague from Minnesota himself is a lieutenant colonel, a lifelong and career Marine Corps officer and one that served with distinction. He understands and he too knows the sacrifice that they have given. 
   I want to thank the 30 other Members of Congress who cosponsored this resolution to show their support of the 1st Brigade Combat Team. But most of all, I want to thank the 2,447 soldiers of the 1st Brigade Combat Team from Minnesota. The other soldiers that augmented this unit came from Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Wisconsin, New Jersey, Kentucky, Idaho, and Washington. 
   The Red Bulls have truly lived up to their long and heroic tradition and have contributed bravely to the war in Iraq and this Nation's security. Regardless of what any American feels about the war in Iraq, it is clear that America's servicemembers, like those from the 1st Brigade Combat Team, have performed brilliantly and magnificently; and they deserve our full support. 
   Now Congress must do its part to recognize their service and provide them the benefits and the health care that they need. The Minnesota National Guard has a world-class reintegration program, the Beyond the Yellow Ribbon program, which helps soldiers readjust to civilian life. 
   I want to thank my friend and colleague and fellow Minnesotan, Congressman Kline, for working to expand this program nationwide for all soldiers. His leadership in this is appreciated by soldiers and families across this Nation.     
   Their needs will go far beyond reintegration. Long after the initial fanfare fades, Congress and the Department of Veterans Affairs must stand ready to assist these brave warriors throughout the rest of their lives. They have more than earned our support, and we must be certain they always have it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to show their support for the Red Bulls by adopting this resolution.

   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5, the College Student Relief Act. 
   This legislation will benefit 5 1/2 million students. These students are predominantly from middle class, hardworking American families. Without this act they may not otherwise be able to attend our public institutions. 
   The generation that came before mine understood the investment in the future. At age 17, when I joined the military to be able to, one, support this country in its defense and, two, further my own career, I was given the GI bill, Pell Grants and the ability to use low interest student loans. Because of that I was able to achieve my dream of becoming a public school teacher. 
   However, unfortunately, this next generation does not have that same investment, a generation that has never seen the kind of investment that I saw. 
   The good people of the First District of Minnesota sent me here to change the priorities of this government. They sent me here to look out for the next generation of Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, with this legislation the American Dream will be a little more in grasp of this next generation. This is not a theoretical discussion on interest rates. These are the students that were in my classroom, on my football team and in my Guard unit.

   This Congress is working to change that, having already passed a bipartisan economic stimulus package that will help jump-start the economy and create up to half a million new American jobs. Later this spring, recovery rebate checks of hundreds of dollars will be in the hands of 130 million  Americans. Most will use it to pay bills, but hopefully some will help to spend it on the economy. Late last month we passed an energy bill that will help create hundreds of thousands of high-paying green collar jobs, lower energy prices, and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. And to address the housing crisis, we expanded affordable mortgage loan opportunities, strengthened consumer protection against risky loans, and raised loan limits to increase liquidity in the mortgage market. 
   Madam Speaker, this Democratic Congress is working to create more jobs, jump-start our economy that has clearly stalled. We are committed to addressing those issues that affect America's working class, not just the top 1 percent.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, as this Nation prepares to honor our veterans on Veterans Day, this new Democratic Congress has shown an unwavering commitment to those who have served this Nation so bravely. 
   We have passed a Wounded Warrior Assistance Act that takes the first steps to address the problems brought to light in the Walter Reed scandal by improving outpatient medical care and restoring efficiency by cutting bureaucratic red tape. 
   We have passed legislation that focuses on posttraumatic stress disorder by requiring a program to reduce suicide among veterans with suicide prevention counselors at all medical facilities. 
   And we have passed a veterans appropriation bill that provides the largest investment in veterans health care in the 77-year history of the VA. We plan on sending that funding bill to the President's desk this week after a vote on this floor today. 
   Madam Speaker, a budget is far more than a fiscal document. It is a reflection of this Nation's values. America's veterans bravely served this Nation and were promised health care to meet the needs to take care of them once they returned home. This new Democratic Congress is committed to fulfilling that pledge.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. (THE BUDGET AND NATIONAL DEBT -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I had an opportunity to be at home and watch some of our colleagues speaking on this earlier. I think last night I saw in my State of Minnesota where we had caucuses, and we had four times the record number of people turning out. The American people are starting to listen. They start to understand the consequences of what we have been living under, and I think all of what has been highlighted has been spectacular. 
   I will also say that each of us who have read this budget have no problem being up here late at night because it is hard to sleep after you see it. Each of you have highlighted critical issues and the things that we are getting done and prioritizing. 
   The idea of government is the collective will that we can do together, and our job is to prioritize the things that this country needs to do. I think Mr. Yarmuth's chart that he just showed shows that this Nation under this President has not prioritized. This President has set out an agenda that told us we could have something for nothing. He told us we can give tax cuts, and I appreciate you clearly illustrating the President's creative use of facts and statistics which he quite often does to theatrical effect but to huge detriment to this Nation. 
   I want to talk about this for a couple of minutes. We have done a wonderful job of highlighting the overall principles. I want to talk about how this impacts individuals. I want to talk about the idea of fiscal discipline and the incredibly shortsightedness of this administration, even in cases where they may be able to cut something to save a little bit, the incredible cost not just in the suffering and what it is doing to the Nation, that aside, what it is doing in terms of just plain poor financial decisions. 
   In my southern Minnesota district, which stretches from the plains of South Dakota over to the Mississippi River, and Minnesota as the Land of 10,000 Lakes is very diverse. The southwest corner of my State that borders Iowa and South Dakota was the place where the glaciers never reached, and it is one of the few places where you don't find a lot of the prairie potholes and lakes, and the shortage of water is important and on people's minds. This is the area of Laura Ingalls Wilder's ``Little House on the Prairie.'' This is the land where people want to raise their children. We have prosperous communities that are incredibly diverse that are leading the Nation in things like biofuel production. We are the fifth leading district in wind production. These are innovative people, but the one thing that they are missing and what makes life so difficult is the lack of drinking water. 
   We have places where people are living in 2008 where they have cisterns to collect water in order to drink good water. Well, these communities got together in Iowa, South Dakota, and Minnesota and they came together with a creative solution. They were going to use, where the abundance of water was along the Missouri River in South Dakota, they were going to use the engineering skill of this Nation to provide drinking water and the lifeblood of communities for 300,000 people in a bipartisan manner.     
   They got together and they started doing this. It is incredibly important. In fact, it was so important that in 2001, on White House stationery that I might have, President Bush himself went to South Dakota and said, a priority is to work with States on important development projects, and the Lewis and Clark rural water project is a project that will be in my budget, and something that we can work on together. 
   Well, it sounded good, especially in South Dakota. The reality has been we have fought tooth and nail every step of the way. The good news on this is, whether it be Republican or Democrat, the bipartisan commitment to this has been absolutely unbreakable. The local communities have even done something that I think our constituents are asking us. We always hear when we're spending money, oh, you tax and spenders and all that. I think something that's important for people to know, Mr. Speaker, is that those of us who are here have paid taxes before, too. I'm a school teacher, and 2005 was the first year in my life that I filed taxes right at the $50,000 a year range. I'm the person who takes pencils when they're available to make sure I can use them in my classroom. I use both sides of every sheet of paper. I want to see us get our money's worth, too. This project did that. Seventeen of these communities and municipalities and States decided what they would do is they would pay ahead to cut down on the inflationary value of this project. The project was scheduled to last approximately 15 years. It's a major reconstruction project, a major thing that's happening. 
   Well, the project got off and going, started running. People are very excited about it. Everything is going great, until we started running into the last 7 years of the Bush presidency. Last year in President Bush's budget he cut the funding for this project down to $15 million a year. To give you an idea of what that would do, instead of the completion date of 2016 that was scheduled, and remember, States, municipalities have paid ahead. They have asked their taxpayers to pay taxes ahead to save money in the long run, and overwhelmingly they said that. And President Bush promised them that he would be there every step of the way. By the way, this is when he was sending off South Dakota's soldiers to go fight the war in Afghanistan. He promised them that he would be there for their families. By his budgeting cutting back to $15 million last year, it meant that the project would not be finished until 2051, and the cost would go from about $527 million to nearly $900 million. 
   Now, this was the President that came to us with an M.B.A. He was the CEO president. And what he's saying is that he is not going to be able to make the same fiscally responsible decisions to keep these communities alive.  
   Well, what we did, as a joint delegation, between Iowa, South Dakota and Minnesota, Republican and Democrat, said that is wrong. And we went and asked, guess what, one of those awful earmarks appropriations to put the Federal Government's responsibility back to where it was supposed to be or near where it was supposed to be at $27 million. 
   So now we're approximately 5 years from completion of this, and this wonderful document that the President sent out this week set his budget for the Lewis and Clark rural water project, zero dollars. He shut the project down. So I guess what he's telling us is, the $300 million we've spent, the 300,000 people, communities, where, in my district, they cannot issue another building permit in their cities because they don't have enough water. He is telling them, leave the pipes half finished. Let the people move elsewhere. And you know what I said in 2001, I didn't really mean it because I've got other priorities. 
   Now, remember, this is the same President that told us that our fiscal crisis now is simply being caused by our inability to make permanent the tax cuts on 1 percent of Americans that actually aren't expiring until 2011. 
   Now I stand here in front of the people, Mr. Speaker, and with my colleagues to ask in a totally bipartisan manner, what sense does this make? What sense is this about prioritizing? What do these mayors tell their people when they made this decision based on what good government is? And if this President is going to think you're going to do this alone, who's going to dig the 400-mile long trench from the Missouri River to feed these areas of Iowa and Minnesota and South Dakota? 
   I guess the President's message has been what it's been all along, whether it's been SCHIP, whether it's been our veterans, whether it's been anything. I'll be there until it comes time to make some prioritizing decisions. At that point you're on your own. He's given us his ownership society which truly does mean you're on your own, and now we have a situation where we're going to go as a delegation and have to fight for every dollar of something as basic as infrastructure to deliver water. 
   So I will have to tell you on the sacredness of this House floor, it's been an overwhelming challenge to keep my tongue on some of this, and I applaud my colleagues in the same way. 
   But I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, and tell my colleagues, I will not rest for 1 minute until this budget starts to reflect the priorities of this Nation. There is nothing in this budget that reflects the priorities of this Nation. There is nothing in the people of my district, and I don't care what political party they belong to, that reflects their values. And there is absolutely no vision in this. I don't know if maybe this is just a cruel joke on the way out, leaving the White House; we'll see what can happen if we do this. But I can tell you this: The people of Iowa and South Dakota and Minnesota aren't laughing about it. And I can darn sure guarantee you that each of us is going to fight to make it right. 
   I thank you for indulging me on this, Mr. Yarmuth. You've done a fantastic job. You always lead a very important discussion. And I thank you and my colleagues for their open-mindedness. 
   I agree with you. I'll have this discussion. I will debate with any member of this administration or this House of Representatives on why, after the investments that we've made, the importance of this project and the agreement of constituents and the promise that was made by the President, why I'm just supposed to accept this, and why people say, can't you all just get along and get something done? 
   If there was some sanity coming from the administration, I would say yes. But right now at this point I think the answer is no because this is going to be fought tooth and nail until this wrong is corrected.

   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. I so enjoy listening to the eloquence and thoughtfulness of this. The gentleman did sum it up about the priorities, and both gentlemen from Kentucky, Florida, and New York focusing on education and seeing it as an investment. 
   Of course, being a high school teacher, every chance I get to get into a classroom, I jump at it. And Monday I had the chance to teach a government class in a small town actually in the area served by the Lewis and Clark Rural Water Project. And I will just leave you this, and you can decide, again, what sense does this make. 
   The teacher was very excited about their first-year teaching job. They started out making $28,500 a year. Because of the decisions that have been made here and the decisions that have been made in St. Paul, the insurance for that family for him to provide for his wife and children was $14,100. So before taxes, our schoolteachers are making $14,400. If you take taxes out of this, we probably have a violation of minimum wage that's happening. That's the decisions that have been made. 
   But I go back to, once again, the President is not talking about that. The President is asking for how can we make tax cuts permanent for millionaires, and this Nation needs to decide what is our next generation going to do if we're not willing to invest.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, after a brief reprieve, the politics of fear is back in full force. The White House and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are saying that the expiration of the Protect America Act has made this Nation more vulnerable. That is simply false. The Washington Post did a nice job of refuting this claim in saying Mr. Bush's pass-it-now-or-the-terrorists-will-win rhetoric is overheated fearmongering. 
   Before the Presidents Day recess, I encouraged my colleagues to stay in Washington and forge a bipartisan long-term solution. I regret that we didn't do that, but I'm not afraid of the expiration of the Protect America Act. I voted for that piece of legislation. 
   As a 24-year veteran of the Army National Guard, I know the importance of having the tools to fight the terrorists. However, I'm committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find a long-term bipartisan solution that strengthens national security, protects our civil liberties, and does so without providing blanket immunity to companies that may have broken our laws. 
   I hope that we can end the fearmongering and the political rhetoric that have characterized this debate and get down to America's business. And I think it needs to be pointed very clearly to this Nation's enemies, t his Nation is protected, this Nation stands united on the issue of protecting us, and no amount of rhetoric will change that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, this week Democrats are trying to honor our Nation's veterans and servicemembers by fulfilling our sacred obligation to provide for their care. 
   We would like to bring a bill on the floor today that includes the largest increase in veterans' health care funding in the 77-year history of the Veterans Administration. It is enthusiastically endorsed in its current form by the American Legion, the Disabled American Veterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and countless other veterans' service organizations. It should have been on the floor yesterday, but House Republicans continue to obstruct the process. 
   I ask my colleagues across the aisle to join us in supporting bills that will secure America by better providing for our veterans. Forcing meaningless procedural motions does nothing. Think of all the great things we can accomplish on the House floor for our veterans if we just simply work for the greater good. 
   Last week, every single member, Republican and Democrat, of the House Appropriations Committee supported the Military Construction and veterans funding bill. They all supported it because it provides for our veterans, as we promised. 
   I would hope today that Republicans would stop obstructing the process so that we can produce real results. Our veterans deserve nothing less, and they are watching.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, 4 years ago today, President Bush landed for a photo opportunity on an aircraft carrier in front of a banner that said ``Mission Accomplished'' and declared an end to major combat in Iraq. Four years later this President refuses to even discuss the reality of a military mission that has entered its fifth year. 
   Yesterday the President vetoed only the second bill that has ever come to his desk. He called it a ``prescription for chaos and confusion.'' I ask, how is that different from what we have now? He refuses to even hold the Iraqis accountable for making political, economic or diplomatic reforms that he promised and they promised to make. He's holding up funding for our troops and for our veterans. 
   But what exactly is the President waiting for? Now that the President has rejected our legislation, he has the responsibility to tell the American people how many more years does he expect us to stay. Do you think it will be 5? Maybe 10? And what exactly do the ground conditions look like in order to have us beginning to withdraw? Wishful thinking, political talking points and rigid ideology do not make good foreign policy. 
   This President was wrong when he declared an end of combat operations, and he has been consistently wrong about every single thing in Iraq. It's time that this President works with the new Congress, elected by the majority of the American people, so that we can bring about a change to this war and truly secure America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1315. I applaud my colleague, Congresswoman HERSETH SANDLIN, for her tireless work as Chair of the Economic Opportunity Subcommittee of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. She has put together an impressive package of benefits in this bill and as a veteran myself, I have to say I am incredibly proud to serve with the Congresswoman and am grateful for her unwavering support of veterans. 
   I am also proud that this bill includes the language from H.R. 1632, the Improving Veterans' Reemployment Act. Congressman DAVE REICHERT and I introduced this legislation to enact a small, technical fix that will improve the way the Federal Government deals with National Guard and Reserve reemployment complaints. 
   This legislation acts on the GAO's recommendations by requiring the federal agencies and departments that are involved with veterans' reemployment complaints to fully share their data. The bill also mandates that Congress receive all of this data in an aggregate report. This legislation offers a simple fix to a problem that has a negative effect on thousands of veterans returning home to their civilian jobs. 
   As a retired Command Sergeant Major in the Army National Guard, I have an intimate understanding of the veterans' reemployment issue. I deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom from 2003 to 2004 and was fortunate to have my job as a high school teacher waiting for me when I returned home. Unfortunately, the process was not as simple for every member of my unit and I have heard plenty of horror stories from both Guard members and Reservists who came home to a radically different job situation. Local businesses back home in Minnesota have done a tremendous job supporting the Guard and Reserves and bearing the financial burden of long deployments, but service members can still face problems when they return. Our bill goes a long way to improving the way the Federal Government deals with reemployment problems. 
   I urge my colleagues to support our legislation and the larger bill, H.R. 1315. Aside from the provisions of the legislation Congressman REICHERT and I authored, the Improving Veterans' Reemployment Act, H.R. 1315 includes many important provisions that improve benefits for veterans nationwide.

   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce a new bill, the Veterans Travel Program Reform Act of 2008. I'm proud to be joined by my colleague from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney) in introducing this legislation. 
   Many of our veterans incur significant costs traveling to and from VA facilities to receive their health care treatment. This is especially true because of skyrocketing gas prices, and it's a big problem in rural areas like southern Minnesota. 
   While some veterans are reimbursed for their travel, the rate they receive is way below what Members of this body receive when we travel in our cars. That is simply wrong. What's more, current law requires the VA Secretary to raise the deductible that veterans have to pay when the mileage reimbursement goes up. 
   Many of our veterans travel--and travel long distances--and end up paying for it out of their own pocket. This bill would fix these problems by making it more generous and fair in the reimbursement. It would set the mileage rate at the same rate that other Members of Congress and other Federal employees receive. It would eliminate the deductible, and it would eliminate the restrictions on eligibility so more of our veterans would be able to receive that. 
   Mr. Speaker, our veterans served us, now it's time we serve them. I urge my colleagues to join me.

   This critical bill restores our military readiness by authorizing $1 billion for the Strategic Readiness Fund that will require an in-depth status of our forces, especially our National Guard, and requires a plan to reconstitute that force. 
   This legislation offers assistance to our most precious and important resource: our warriors and their families who sacrifice so much. It provides a 3.5 percent pay increase for servicemembers and prohibits increased health care fees while improving the health care system. The bill addresses the growing needs of our troops that require care in traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, other mental health conditions, tuition assistance programs, and also authorizes a unique program that was started in my State of Minnesota called Beyond the Yellow Ribbon to reintegrate our forces back to civilian life. 
   Madam Speaker, I am proud that this Congress will pass legislation this week to provide our troops with the resources and health care benefits they deserve and protect our Nation's readiness.

   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter for bringing this good piece of legislation to the floor. 
   This bill, H.R. 1585, fulfills our basic duty in this Congress to provide for the national defense. There are several important pieces of this legislation that are particularly meaningful to me as a 24-year veteran of our Army National Guard. There is an amendment in here to address the issue of the Federal tuition assistance program that too many of our returning servicemembers are unable to use. It also includes an important provision that we worked on in the VA Committee on making sure the electronic medical records between DOD and VA truly do become seamless. Finally, there is a very important repeal of changes that were made to a 200-year-old piece of legislation, the Insurrection Act, that Mr. Davis from Virginia and I worked on with our Nation's Governors that will restore individual State control over their National Guard units. 
   These provisions are only a small part of this bill. There's a needed pay raise and expanded care and research into TBI for our returning warriors. This legislation is packed with provisions to make good on this Congress' promise that we will keep every single promise to our veterans and make them a priority. 
   Our most precious resource in our national defense are those service-members who are willing to risk everything to defend this Nation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this.

Only now we need to get the support of President Bush and our friends on the Republican side of the aisle who seem content on pursuing the same failed policies that got us here in the first place. 
   Over the last couple of months, this House has passed 9 bills that would lower gas prices. While we received a little bit of bipartisan support, the majority of our friends on the Republican side have opposed those 8 bills. 
   House Republicans said ``no'' to legislation that would enable the Justice Department to take legal action against foreign nations manipulating the price of oil. House Republicans said ``no'' to legislation that would give the Federal Trade Commission the authority to investigate and punish those who are artificially inflating the price of gas.

The Iraqi Government will also be held accountable for the first time for meeting political, economic, and security benchmarks that the administration itself has set. 
   This Congress must pass this legislation, because our troops have performed magnificently. The administration has failed. They have failed to hold the Iraqis accountable. 
   President Bush criticizes our time lines, while both Secretary Gates and General Petraeus admit there is no military solution, and Secretary Gates even called the time lines in the bill ``constructive'' and ``helpful'' in pushing the Iraqis to a solution. 
   Madam Speaker, this Congress has a constitutional responsibility to be accountable for war to the American public.

   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Madam Chairman, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their outstanding work on this incredibly important piece of legislation. 
   I offer a simple amendment, and I rise in support, encouraging my colleagues to support the amendment. 
   After spending 24 years in the Army National Guard, I know that members of our Armed Forces don't join the military simply for the benefits that are there. But I also know that benefits can help improve retention and aid servicemembers when they return to civilian life. 
   One benefit that has given our servicemembers a problem over the years is the Federal Tuition Assistance program. This program is based on a first-come, first-serve benefit. Servicemembers join up thinking this is a guaranteed benefit only to find out that the funding has run out. While serving in the National Guard and now as a Member of Congress, I have heard numerous complaints weekly about this program. 
   My amendment would direct DOD to report relevant information on this program by telling us how many servicemembers are eligible for this and how many receive the benefit. The study would examine the program's effect on retention as well as how it interacts with State tuition assistance programs. 
   We owe our servicemembers the benefits they are promised. This amendment would give us the necessary information to improve the program, to maximize the use of our dollars, and get it directed at our soldiers who need it. 
   I urge my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, today I rise because I am introducing the Veterans Pain Care Act of 2008. This bill will require the Secretary of the VA to develop and implement a comprehensive policy on pain management for veterans enrolled in the VA health care system and to carry out a program of research, training and education on acute and chronic pain. 
   Modern warfare leads to serious, but survivable, injuries. While advances in medical technology have saved lives, many of our wounded soldiers have been afflicted by acute and chronic pain. Pain is a leading cause of disability among veterans. As a result, providing adequate pain management is a crucial component to improving veterans' welfare. 
   The Department of Veteran Affairs has pain care programs, but a comprehensive plan isn't consistently enforced across the system. My legislation will give the VA the necessary tools to serve the needs of our veterans. 
   This bill has the support of a wide range of organizations. I would like to enter into the Record a letter of support from 50 organizations in the Pain Care Coalition. 
   The Senate companion to this bill has the support of both the chairman and the ranking member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. I am hopeful that this will garner bipartisan support for this legislation in the House and be passed to support our veterans.

Winona State University is in the town of Winona, Minnesota. That's on the western bank of the Mississippi River. 
   Winona State University was founded at the same time as the State of Minnesota was founded. We're celebrating our sesquicentennial in the North Star State this year. And Winona State University was the first teachers college  west of the Mississippi River. That institution, that public institution of higher learning has fulfilled its calling and its mission for the last 150 years, at the highest quality of achievement that we could ask for. I congratulate President Judith Ramaley for her work. I also congratulate Vice President Jim Schmidt. He's the Vice President of Advancement. 
   There are some things going on at Winona State University, like the National Child Protection Training Center, the work they're doing educating our teachers, nurses, law enforcement officials that I think are equally as important. 
   But I think it's important to understand that in a well-balanced education like our student athletes are getting at Winona State University, stressing the extra-curriculars and the teamwork that goes to that, and the striving for excellence is important, so I'd like to talk just a bit about this time. 
   A little over a month ago, during our own March Madness in Minnesota, Winona State defeated Augusta State 87-76. This was the second national championship in the last 3 years, and three straight trips to the national championship. We're really proud of this dynasty that's being developed amongst these student athletes. 
   In addition to their national championship, they've won nine conference titles in a row. They've also won three straight Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference titles. 
   In 2006 and 2007 they broke the Division II record of 57 straight victories. In 2008 the Warriors finished with a record of 38-1, an NCAA Division II record. Over the past 3 years, their record is 105-6. 
   Five seniors have been together throughout this entire run, and they should be congratulated. They'll all be graduating this year, and I'd like to congratulate each one of them individually. John Smith, Jonte Flowers, Quincy Henderson, Shane Neiss and Brent Riese. Together, those five individuals compiled a 129-17 record in 4 years. 
   Of course all of this wouldn't be possible without the leadership of coach Mike Leaf, who's done an outstanding job of working with the character as well as the accomplishments of these fine young athletes. I'm extremely proud to have Winona State University in the district that I represent; extremely proud of the student athletes that represent Southern Minnesota so well. 
   I ask today for, hopefully, unanimous consent from my colleagues to recognize them on this great achievement. 
   I would also make, as a side note, Winona State boasts some famous alumnas. One of them is my colleague on the minority side, Mrs. BACHMANN, and we're very proud to have her here, and Winona State for producing our Congresswoman from up in the Sixth District. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. (PRESIDENT BUSH UNDERESTIMATES NUMBER OF TROOPS AND AMOUNT OF MONEY NEEDED FOR TROOP ESCALATION PLAN -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, last week, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a report saying that President Bush is understating the number of troops and the amount of money needed to move forward with his troop escalation plan. 
   While the President claims he plans to send 21,500 troops to Iraq, the Congressional Budget Office says the number will be as high as 48,000. As any soldier like myself knows, that to put a  combat unit on the ground you need substantial support forces, including personnel to staff headquarters, serve as military police, provide communications, provide mess facilities, engineering and other services. 
   The Congressional Budget Office also said that the President has seriously underestimated the cost of troop escalation. While President Bush claims it should not cost any more than $5.6 billion, the Congressional Budget Office says a 4-month deployment will cost between $9 and $13 billion, 12 months between $20 and $27 billion. This is a 400 percent underestimate. 
   Madam Speaker, this is a serious report that cannot and will not be ignored. President Bush cannot expect Members of Congress to support his troop escalation plan when he is not telling us the whole story on the number of troops and the funds involved to make it happen.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. (PRESIDENT'S DEFENSE BILL VETO -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. I thank the gentleman from Iowa for yielding. 
   And, Madam Speaker, I think it's critical to point out that the gentleman from Iowa has been a passionate voice for civil liberties, has been a passionate voice of making sure this country adheres to that great tradition that so embodies each and every one of us. And I think it's important to understand that Mr. Braley from Iowa comes from a family that has served this Nation proudly. He's got a grandfather that fought on the sands of Iwo Jima. And in bringing this fight and understanding what needs to be done to protect our soldiers in this conflict and future conflicts, he's brought a very, very important point out about the President's disregard in vetoing the Department of Defense authorization bill. And I would have to say his voice has been somewhat lone in the wilderness on this. I don't hear the outrage that should be there. So I thank the gentleman for giving me the opportunity to stand with him tonight to bring this important issue forward. 
   I spent the last 9 days prior to this week traveling throughout Iraq and Afghanistan, talking to our soldiers, talking to our airmen, talking to our Marines, talking to our sailors, and getting a feel for how things were going as far as how their medical care was going and those types of things. And without fail every single one of these individuals with high morale and a pride in what they are doing for their Nation did bring up the question and asked me, Why is our raise being held up? Why can't Congress get the simplest thing done to move forward a raise? And I ask this and in talking to them and talking to other Americans, Madam Speaker, the question comes, and we hear it time and time again, why can't Congress get along? Why can't Congress get things done? And I think Mr. Braley from Iowa has highlighted exactly what it is and exactly what we are up against. 
   This President chose to hold our warriors hostage their pay raise. And the President may not think 3 1/2 percent is much. I'm sure it's nothing to him. What I can tell you is that it's a lot to a family back home. It's a lot when the mother and father are deployed down range or in a war zone. It's a lot to have that 3 1/2 percent given. But the President didn't concern himself with that, all the good things that Mr. Braley talked about that was in the Department of Defense Authorization Act, a very important one was the ability of our POWs, those that fought so bravely to make claims and make amends according to law, according to international law, to amend what had been done to them. 
   Now, the President tells us we'll get frivolous lawsuits out of this. We will hamper Iraq's fledgling government's ability to rebuild itself. 
   Now, there are several big fallacies in that statement. The first is the assumption that the fledgling government is doing anything to get itself back and rebuilding. And I offer the fact that Iraq said last year they would put in $10 billion of their own money to put into reconstruction. An audit at the end of last year indicated they spent 4.4 percent of that. Spent it. It doesn't necessarily mean that it went to reconstruction, which basically says 95.6 percent never made it out of the bureaucracy, never made it to the Iraqi people, never did any of that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Absolutely. And the point that the gentleman from Iowa has brought up is exactly this: When you dig into this and you start peeling back the onion of what's happening here, you start to see a pattern. And the issue here is this administration, as much as they want to talk  about the rule of law, as much as they want to talk about giving people recourse on this, they have slammed the door into 17 brave warriors, slammed the door in their face, of saying they should have the ability to recoup some of what they gave up for this Nation. And it wasn't our Nation paying for it. It was the Iraqis who were responsible for that torture, for that mistreatment. 
   And I think many of us ask the question, what message does this send to the people who are fighting around the world? What message does this send to them? You can torture the Americans and if you cut a good enough deal, there will be no recourse. There will be no recourse against the people who carried it out. There will be no recourse to allow for those people to receive compensation. I think it sets an incredibly poor precedent. It disrespects the service of these brave warriors, and it sets us up for failure in the future of these things starting to happen. So when we see this and when the American people ask us, why didn't anything get done? I'll have to tell you today's a pretty sad day. The President did sign the DOD authorization when this provision was taken out. And I think many of us who voted on this in the first place put together a good 
   compromise bill. We find out that when any legislation goes up the street to Pennsylvania Avenue, the people's will in this House matters nothing, the people's will to make sure that this was righted. The 17 families that have asked for recourse on the damages that were done in the name of this Nation were wiped away with a single signature by the President, and this House is left at the horrible choice of do we continue to hold up the research funding for warriors' injuries? Do we continue to hold up the funding for weapons systems to protect them? Do we continue to hold up the pay raise to these soldiers and to their families who are fighting, or do we make the compromise to move that forward and fight another day? 
   And I quite honestly have to commend my colleague from Iowa. He will fight every day for what's right. This is a question of justice. This goes at the heart and soul of our rule of law and our justice system and a citizen's right to recourse, to petition, to be able to go to a court of law to hear their discussion in a public court of law, to have their peers make a decision. But as we know, this administration, given the opportunity, would shut those same doors to justice to many of us here. 
   We hear about clever arguments on tort reform, and I know my colleague from Iowa is very familiar with this, but it's pretty much the same thing; that if you are injured in a reckless manner, if you're injured or something is done to you, your ability to go and tell your story in front of a jury of your peers and to trust in your peers to make the right decision, they want to limit that, and they say it's all in the name of frivolous lawsuits, as if we could trust the corporate entities over our neighbors, over our fellow citizens. And in this case we told our fellow citizens, 17 of them that are warriors, well, Iraq needs to rebuild and needs to keep that money, which, by the way, as I think the gentleman noted, upwards of several billion dollars that have gone missing. 
   I will note that payment to Iraqi legislators has come on time every single month. The lifestyle of Iraqi legislators as they took off a month in the heat of August during some of the most fierce fighting that our soldiers were fighting and dying for as they left to their villas is something that I think Americans should take great notice of. So, once again, I think that this was a huge mistake. I think the President put a very narrow special interest ahead of the needs of our fighting soldiers and has set a precedent that I'm afraid we're going to have to deal with in a much bigger manner down the road.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. (PRESIDENT'S DEFENSE BILL VETO -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Well, anyone who listens tonight, Madam Speaker, to the gentleman's accounts is horrified. And I think to put it into context, make no mistake about it, what happened today in the signing of the Department of Defense authorization bill with these provisions taken out to allow recourse on this is, it is pretty difficult for me to see any way that a decision was made to side with the monsters who carried out this torture and not with those brave Americans who went at this country's call, did our bidding, and then came home to the so-called open arms. And as the gentleman said, having spent 24 years in the National Guard, having trained countless soldiers, many, as you said, served in my unit. I taught them in school. I coached them on the football field. One of the things that was very clear in part of our training, because, of course, it held to those core values of being an American, was the respect for the Geneva Convention. 
   The Geneva Convention did several very important things. As I said, it upheld those principles of, even in a conflict situation, that the humanity and the humane treatment of other individuals was absolutely paramount 
   to keeping with the ideals of this Nation. There was also something else very, very important with the Geneva Convention that many of us as soldiers always came to rely upon is knowing that if you adhere to these things, that if other combatants, the enemy you were fighting understood that, one of the things you could do was you could convince people that it might be better to give up the fight. It might be better because you know you will be treated humanely. And there was always great comfort, because it is not the fear of injury, it is not the fear of battle which is there amongst all these soldiers, it is the fear of capture and torture and saying something that may hurt your fellow soldiers that has everyone terrified. 
   So the idea is that the Geneva Convention was held in the highest esteem. The principles that it was set by were there to make sure that even at the base emotions of war amongst human beings that there was a respect for basic human life. There was a respect when someone was unarmed and unable to fight, that when someone was captured, they would be treated as humanely as possible. And with that being pulled back, I have to tell you, it terrifies me. 
   And these forgotten warriors are forgotten because they happen to be an inconvenience now. They happen to be an inconvenience to a political ideology. They happen to be an inconvenience because this administration doesn't want to follow the Geneva Convention. This administration, I believe, and members of this administration have called it a quaint, outdated notion that is no longer there. I would argue that soldiers don't see it that way. Soldiers see it as a necessity. 
   And for many of us, as my colleague has pointed out, it is hard to fathom that an administration that has talked so much about our soldiers would so callously brush aside 17, in this society, 17 warriors held in the highest esteem as a prisoner of war for their Nation and to cast them aside and cut their rights off to any type of recourse. And I can't help but see a pattern here of where the administration's loyalties lie. As Americans are struggling, and we hear about it every day, the economic crisis, they are struggling to make ends meet, and they see $102 a barrel oil. But I don't know where that is able to be rectified in their mind when they see the President walking hand in hand with the Saudi Prince and knowing that every bit of that $102 is going into the pockets of the Saudi Princes, going into nations and going into, in this case, a regime that committed the grievous atrocities against our soldiers and was totally absolved down on Pennsylvania Avenue against the wishes of the 100 elected Senators, against the wishes of the 435 elected Members of this body. And yet tonight, several of us stand here. And I think the outrage and the passion that my colleague from Iowa has shown should be reassuring to the American public that there is a voice there. There is a voice in the wilderness. There is a voice that says this is wrong. This is a wrong that should not be allowed to stand. This is a wrong that I think they want to see, my colleague from Iowa, myself and our colleagues here, stand and speak for what is right. 
   So again, I can only come to the conclusion, and I ask my colleague if he can find another way of seeing this, what was the benefit of the administration's decision to side with the Hussein regime over U.S. POWs who were tortured? I am still trying to find where there is justification. It doesn't go back to ``we can't hamper the Iraqi from rebuilding,'' because they are not doing that as it is. It can't go back to any precedence. It is in violation of the Geneva Convention, and it flies in the face, as my colleague said, of our basic principles of our Constitution. So I am trying to figure how we would be able to sell this to the American public.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. It's interesting on the day that reports are coming out about the 900-plus misstatements leading into the war that were made by this administration that the idea that this had been known for 5 years, that it had been very clear. And I would quote former Republican Senator Allen and current Republican  Senator Collins when he said, Protection of American POWs is a vital national security interest, and the goal of rebuilding Iraq should not be viewed as inconsistent with that goal. 
   Now, what the gentleman from Iowa has so clearly pointed out and the gentlewoman from New Hampshire alluded to is in this idea of this global war on terror, the winning the hearts and minds of the rest of the world, one of the things is what those core beliefs and core values of the United States stand for. 
   And the gentleman mentioned and talked about on the floor of this sacred ground of democracy, Members of this body have clearly articulated in the exact words that waterboarding is a useful tool; turning someone upside down, stuffing a rag in their mouth and pouring water in their mouth under a circumstance where they believe they are going to drown is acceptable. 
   Now the idea of me being a history teacher coming to this body out of the classroom that I would ever stand here and speak of things seemed incredible. 
   But to think that I would stand here and have to define what torture is to other Members of this body is incomprehensible to me. And I tell a story about why this is so important and why we understood Geneva Convention, why we understood that by adhering to these things, it pushed our values forward. 
   I was teaching a ninth grade history class, and one of the assignments was to go back and interview a family member who had had some type of context in the Second World War, if they could find a grandparent or great uncle or someone. And the ninth graders came back and reported. And I remember a young man named Bill Wilbrand came forward, and he was telling an incredible story of battle, of heroism, of incredible terror and talking to his grandfather, telling him the story where he was captured by the enemy and he was taken away and he was shipped a long distance and put into a POW camp. 
   And the other ninth graders are like, Wow. That was your grampa? What happened? Well, it was kind of cold and the food was not great but not too bad and, you know, things were okay. And they said, Well, what happened afterwards? Well, he stayed here. He was a German and he was a prisoner of the Americans, and they brought him to Western Nebraska to a prisoner-of-war camp. And he was treated so well, he said, I will stay here and bring my family here, and his family, of course, is American. 
   The idea was he saw the values. He saw the dignity. He understood what those American soldiers were. They disagreed with the tyranny of the Nazi regime. They disagreed with what was happening, and they would fight and give their lives to stop that. But when an individual came under their care, they were treated with dignity. 
   And there was a sense of, that word swept through. That's why you had entire units say this is what is happening. The rest of the world saw America as righteous in fighting for the right causes. 
   Now we are in a situation where we have absolved a stated terrorist state, the regime of Saddam Hussein, and those people who took and tortured American soldiers and said, You know what? It's okay. We will just brush it under the carpet and hope it goes away. 
   And those 17 families, well, you know, we can't repay up. We will say thank you a lot. We'll stand in front of flags, and we'll pat them on the back. But we won't let them go through the recourse of the courts. We won't let them adhere to the basic values that the gentleman from Iowa said that predated this country, the idea of being heard by a jury of your peers, by getting recourse no matter where you stand in the hierarchy, no matter where you are economically. 
   But not these 17. They volunteered. They fought to defend this Nation. They served honorably. And they endured some of the most excruciating things that have been described here. And in one easy stroke today, they have been let down. 
   I don't know what to say when I hear the story of Colonel Berryman. And I think of his family, Madam Speaker. I don't know what words can come off this House floor to tell them the wrong that has been done to them. And it's all going to be done in the name of supporting the troops. It's all going to be done in the typical fashion that it is just us not able to get anything done. 
   When we made that horrible decision to fund veterans health care, to fund the vehicles that will protect them in combat and to give them a pay raise, to maybe hope that that mother sitting at home can take kids out to the movie on Saturday while Dad is in Iraq fighting for the Nation, we weren't going to hold that up so that was the choice we were given. So I can tell the Berrymans and others like him, Madam Speaker, that I'm sure not proud of that decision, but that's what we are dealing with coming down from Pennsylvania Avenue.

   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, over the last couple months, House Democrats have been working with real solutions to lower pump prices for the American people, smart legislation that invests in renewable energy and temporarily halted the sending of oil to the Strategic Petroleum Oil Reserve. 
   This week, we will continue with real solutions to give relief to people across this country. We will consider legislation today to prevent price gouging by unscrupulous companies. Later in the week, we plan to take up a bill that will tighten the Enron loophole that allows speculators in the dark markets in places like Dubai to drive up oil prices without having any oversight. Rampant speculation is estimated by most economists to be driving up oil $30 a barrel. 
   And on Thursday, the House will consider legislation that tells Big Oil to either use it or lose it. This bill would bar oil companies from this fictionist red herring of saying they need more land. They have 68 million acres of the public land that they are choosing not to drill on even though oil is under it. These bills deserve and need to have bipartisan support to truly help the American people.

   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. I thank the chairman and my good friend for the work he's done, and I thank the distinguished gentleman from Virginia, the ranking member for making the experience in the Ag Committee as rewarding as it's been. 
   I rise in opposition to my good friend from Wisconsin's piece of legislation. It's well meaning, but I believe it does not address the needs of my district. The people of the First District of Minnesota, I think, can probably lay claim to one of the richest agricultural pieces of land in the entire world. We lead in production of soybeans, near the top in corn production, turkeys and pork. 
   This is a bill that is supported. I had 14 hearings throughout my district with universal acceptance of making sure the safety net is maintained, improving our conservation programs and strengthening rural America. 
   When I hear about record high prices, the people of this Chamber and the people of America need to know the price of corn has dropped 25 percent in the last month. Farmers know it won't always remain that way. 
   When I need advice on the farm bill, I go to a couple of good farmers in my district, Kevin Papp, president of the Minnesota Farm Bureau, and Doug Peterson, president of Minnesota's Farmers Union. I don't need to go to the ideologues at the Cato Institute or Club for Growth to know what's good for rural America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Thank you to the chairman, the gentleman from California (Mr. Filner) and thank you to Ranking Member Moran who is here today. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 6445, but I rise proudly amongst this committee of what the American people I think would be proud to know, this is one committee where both Republican and Democrats are here for a single purpose, and that is to serve our veterans in the best way possible. So I thank the ranking member and the chairman for doing exactly that. 
   I rise to speak on the portion of this bill that I introduced as the Veterans Pain Care Act of 2008. I was moved to introduce this bill after listening to countless stories, as many Members have, of problems of chronic and acute pain among our veterans. 
   The single largest cause of disability claims among veterans is acute pain. It erodes the quality of life, it makes work very difficult, and it does not allow our veterans to get back to the point in their life where their quality of life is as high as it possibly could be. 
   This bill requires the Secretary of the VA to develop and implement a comprehensive policy of pain management for veterans who are enrolled in the VA health care system, and more importantly, or equally important, is to carry out a program of research, training and education on chronic pain. 
   By directing the VA to update its pain management policies and in light of experience, research and evolving practices, this bill will lay a foundation for ongoing improvements in pain care management for our veterans. In that way, we can work to fulfill what I believe is an absolute moral obligation to care for these veterans with the most innovative, best practices and pain management possible. 
   This bill has broad support from a large number of pain care organizations that include patients, providers and numerous veterans service organizations. I thank all of them for their indispensable support and hard work in moving this bipartisan piece of legislation. 
   I would also like to express deep appreciation for the Veterans' Affairs Committee staff on both the majority side and the minority side for working out this piece of legislation. It truly is a compromise. It truly is a piece of legislation, the entire bill, H.R. 6445, that transcends politics and gets at the heart of what the public wants us to do, come together as Americans to pass good legislation that prioritizes this Nation's veterans at the top and cares for them in a fiscally responsible manner that allows them to return to their daily lives after they have served us. It is the very least our country can do, and I am proud to be associated with it.

If there's anyone that comes close, it's the distinguished ranking member from Florida, a gentleman that as sitting on the Transportation Committee, I've come to see the wisdom of his words and the commitment to this country's infrastructure. So I think the Speaker of the House is right, two gentlemen that are showing incredible leadership on this and that our Nation should feel incredibly proud to have you there. I thank you both. 
   A special thank you to all my colleagues in this House. The citizens of Minnesota in responding to this have witnessed something that I think most of us here should be incredibly proud of. In less than 48 hours of this tragedy, this body came together, crafted a piece of legislation to provide relief,  and is prepared tonight to deliver that forward to them. To the people who are out there, those citizens, those first responders, our elected officials, from Governor Pawlenty to Mayor Rybak and right down the line have been there working together, showing that this great Nation when we put our mind to it and come together to relieve the suffering of one another can get exactly that done. 
   It's with a heavy heart that all of us are here, but it's one of optimism and forward-looking that we will address the needs of Minnesota, and, as the distinguished gentleman from Alaska so aptly put, we're prepared to make sure that this never happens again and another family never has to find out that a bridge collapsed as their family members were coming home.

   It is a piece of legislation that many of us believe, as you just heard our colleague from Hawaii so clearly illustrate, is critically important to the health of our Nation's children.

Budgets are financial documents, but they are also much more. They are a reflection of the values that we as a Nation share. 
   Tomorrow we will have the opportunity to show as a people that we value our children. We value their health. We value our future. The greatest asset we have is these children. 
   At my house this weekend was a very special occasion and one I felt very blessed to be able to attend. My son, Gus, celebrated his first birthday on Saturday. He was surrounded by grandparents, cousins, aunts, uncles and friends. A good time was had by all. 
   I came back to Washington and on Tuesday morning my wife said Gus was feeling a little bad, and she took him to see our doctor. Gus had an earache and he was put on some antibiotics and he was given a little bit of Motrin. He had one rough night, but was feeling better the next day. 
   The thought of this little guy going through any type of pain or suffering over something so treatable and so easy to take care of as an earache would be unimaginable to me. And yet, that is what happens to 9 million children across this country. That is what their parents go through. 
   The President has made it clear, those types of issues, and if Gus happened to be someone without health insurance, he would have suffered through an earache. Or maybe Gus would have a parent who couldn't suffer through it and would have taken him to the emergency room where it would cost far more. 
   So my colleagues and I are committed to making sure that no parent has to make the choice whether to take their child to get their care. That no parent has to have the gut-wrenching experience of deciding if they are going to pay bills, or if they are going to try to pay out of pocket to get their child covered. 
   This government and we as a people can do far better. Tonight, we are going to take you through the process of this legislation. We are going to take our colleagues through everything that is involved and the myths that have been perpetuated. This is something that is difficult for myself and my colleagues to deal with. We are going to hear from people like Dr. Kagen, who has seen what happens if children cannot get health care or are suffering with asthma, and he will talk about the implications of what it takes to get a child covered. 
   I think each of my colleagues here tonight will put a face on this for you. My colleagues have an opportunity to cast a vote tomorrow to override the veto and provide this Nation's children with the health care they deserve. It is not a privilege for them, it is a right as an American citizen, and we are here to guarantee that. We are here to make an investment in our future and do the fiscally responsible thing. 
   This program is 10 years old now. It has been highly successful. No matter what the President said, it is clear, and people need to know this, this is a cap block grant program. This is State administered. This is private physicians and private insurance. Any words to the contrary is muddying the waters on this. We have seen this President try this before. He tried to sell this Nation on privatized Social Security, and this body said no. This President sold us, and many of us feel very strongly about this, sold us on the necessity to go to war in Iraq, and here we sit 5 years later understanding the implications of that. 
   We have an administration that is trying to sell this body a bill of goods. We are ready to override this veto tomorrow, and my colleagues here tonight are ready to illustrate to this body why they should cast their vote tomorrow in favor of overriding this veto. 
   It is a great pleasure to turn over to my good friend from neighboring Wisconsin and also one of the very few physicians in this body, someone who has worked on these issues his entire life who is dedicated to the treatment and making sure our children are healthy, and that is my good colleague, Dr. Kagen from Wisconsin.

   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin, and I would like to talk a little bit about this. 
   This issue we are discussing is a program which has proven to be highly successful. It was put in to understand and address the issue that if you do not treat children with preventive medical care, you will treat them with chronic care down the road. Or you will treat them in a setting that is much more expensive, like in the emergency room. 
   This President is mischaracterizing what is going on here. The President is talking about some of the myths that he is putting out there to make this appear like this is some type of government-run health care program. Now I find it a bit ironic and a little bit disingenuous that there are Members who sit in this body tonight who would vote against SCHIP, yet receive government-paid-for health care coverage. These are children who do not have the choice. 
   President Bush, using the $83,000 level, is simply doing it, and these are not my words. Take a look at this. This was USA Today talking about what they call the $83,000 question. ``Bush's claim is misleading at best; simply wrong at worst. The House would do well to look past the President's deceptive rhetoric and override this veto.'' The President is misleading the public on exactly what this does. 
   This is not the way to have this debate. This Nation needs to have an open, honest debate. Do we value our children to the point that we are willing to invest in basic preventive health care? And it is a question that stretches from Minnesota to Iowa to Wisconsin and across to our good friend out in California. I am glad to be joined tonight by Mr. McNerney who, coming from the most populous State, understands the issues that face this, and understands that when a program is administered in coordination with the State at a local level, that invests in preventive care, that is a very conservative notion, and it is one that this Nation would be well served to, as our friends at USA Today said, look past the rhetoric. 
   I yield to the gentleman from California.

   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Well, no, absolutely. But I think it goes back to this about the open, honest discussion. 
   This Nation I think overwhelmingly, and we know that in each of our districts, whether it's California, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, no matter where we're at, we hear this, Madam Speaker. 
   I would like to just for a minute before I send this back over to my good friend from California, I think it's important to understand that all of us received a letter today, an impassioned letter, one that I feel very strongly illustrates where we're at. And this came from our colleagues over in the other Chamber, over in the Senate. It came from Senator Baucus, the Democrat from Montana. It came from Senator Grassley, your Senator from Iowa. It came from Senator Rockefeller in West Virginia, and it came from Senator Hatch out in Utah. And what they told us was this. They sent us this letter dated today as we get ready to cast this vote. 
   ``Dear Colleague: 
   ``As you prepare to cast your vote tomorrow on the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act, those of us who took lead roles in writing the bill in the Senate would like to provide you with detailed information about the legislation. The material below responds directly to the great amount of misinformation that has been spread about this bill. We hope that you will take time to review these facts before you vote. The four of us  worked together on a bipartisan basis for most of this year to craft'' this piece of legislation ``that will do just what we all want to do: serve low-income children who currently lack health coverage. The following information separates fact from fiction.'' And let me read you their first line. 
   ``Fiction: The compromise bill would expand coverage for children in families with incomes of up to $83,000 a year. 
   ``Fact: The bill does not raise the eligibility level for CHIP. While the State of New York did ask the Department of Health and Human Services for approval to raise eligibility'' of the poverty level to 400 percent, ``the Secretary rejected New York's request.'' 
   Many of us in here understand why New York City would ask to raise it in this case. It was not accepted, but the issue is the cost of living and the cost of delivery in New York City, but it was rejected. It never happened. It never went through. 
   The President of the United States restated a myth today with the purposeful intention of misleading, as this said, at best, wrong at worst, and I said, these are the types of things, we're here to have the discussion. 
   If this body and Members that were with us choose to cast their vote against overriding this veto, it should be based on factual knowledge. It should be based on the understanding of what this is going to do, and it should not be based on political rhetoric. 
   And with that, I turn it back over to my friend and colleague from Iowa.

   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. And I would respond to that, and the thing that I think this Nation wants more than anything is, this is a body and there are Members, please don't get us wrong. There's a veto-proof majority with many Republican sponsors on the Senate side. We had 45 of our Republican colleagues in this body vote with this. 
   This was crafted in 1997 under President Clinton, Democratic President, and a Republican House and Senate. This is a good piece of legislation. 
   I might also add that 43 of the Nation's 50 Governors are supporting this wholeheartedly, the piece of legislation we came up with. Fifteen of those are Republicans, including my Republican Governor, Governor Pawlenty, who happens to chair the Governors' Conference in this country. 
   So this is a strong piece of legislation. Many of us I think are quite confused, as you're right. This is something that Republican authorship on this should be proud of, as Senator Grassley and Senator Hatch have been, and I applaud them for their vision. I applaud them for reaching across to us to find a good piece of legislation, and I yield to my friend from Wisconsin.

   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. I think it's critically important, Madam Speaker, to understand the President is framing this in simply a dollars and cents argument. He's saying that this goes beyond authoring $35 billion in terms of what the compromise piece of legislation that overwhelmingly, in a veto-proof majority in the Senate, has passed, a large number of our colleagues across the aisle, 45, to join us on this piece of legislation. 
   Dr. Kagen so clearly pointed out everyone from AARP to the Children's Defense Fund, Easter Seals, March of Dimes, Cancer Society, across the board, American Nurses Association, pediatric physicians across the country agree that this is a good bill. 
   But let's say for a minute that that's not the case and let's say that it is strictly a fiscal thing, if the President can separate a budget into being strictly a fiscal document, not a moral document that affects this Nation's values. He is still undercutting massively what it's going to take. 
   We have watched this administration throughout the President's tenure continue to underestimate the need. We saw it in the Veterans Administration, where we saw the President say, well, I have two things that I think about the Veterans Administration. We are going to see fewer soldiers coming into the system, and health care is going to cost less. 
   Well, there's not a person in America that wouldn't take the bet the sun's not going to rise tomorrow before they would take that. 
   So, in the President's bill here, under the President's current piece of legislation, not only will we not add the 9 million American children who aren't covered, and I would like the President to go by and decide which one of those faces gets coverage and which one does not in this Nation. If he chooses to go with his piece of legislation, asking us to compromise, he is going to cut 840,000 children who are currently on the program off. We're not talking about even maintaining the program. We're talking about undercutting it. And under our bipartisan congressional bill, 3.8 million additional children will receive their coverage. 
   So you can see the difference here. When we have compromised, when Senator Grassley, Senator Hatch, when 69 Senators on the Senate side and 265 Members of this body and over 70 percent of the American public say this is a good piece of legislation, we have done our compromising. It is now time for the President to decide that he is not the sole decider on this. 
   The American public has spoken on this, and it is time to do the right thing: cover our children, get them good preventative care, keep them out of the emergency rooms, keep them  healthy, keep them in school, keep them moving forward, and keep this Nation in a place where it should be. 
   With that, I yield to the gentleman from Iowa.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. I appreciate the gentleman's passion on this. And I think it is really critical to point out, the gentleman was bringing to notion of how SCHIP works, and we already had addressed the issue of the $83,000 question that we know is just plain misleading. 
   I want to mention, in this idea of where this health care is going to come from, who is going to provide it; and I know that one of the issues that most affects families, they don't care what kind of insurance it is if they don't have it; they simply need to get it. And one of the issues here, and this again comes from Senators Grassley and Hatch, the fiction of this, that Congress by doing this, the congressional bill is a step towards government-run health care. 
   This is our Republican leadership in the Senate listing the facts. SCHIP is a leader in combining public-private solutions to provide health care coverage to uninsured children. The CHIP Reauthorization Act encourages a mix of public and private solutions to cover children and limits the scope of the program to the low-income, uninsured children Congress meant to be covered. 
   So this idea of perpetuating these myths first and foremost doesn't get us at the heart of this. The bottom line on this is, this is a wonderful mix of trying to deliver in that gap area. 
   Now, when we are talking some of these numbers that we are throwing around, 300 percent of poverty and those types of numbers; right now for last year, this is a family at poverty level, $17,170. Now, I would like to see  how someone can make that budget work. I can guarantee you that this body could not do it. And then at 200 percent of poverty is then the $34,340 as you hear some of these numbers coming up. So the President's claim that this is pushing children into some type of government-sponsored health care is simply not the case. 
   And the last thing I would like to do on this is that children who already have insurance, this myth has been out there and this is listed here. The fiction is Congress would move children with private insurance into government-run health care. The President reiterated that myth today at his press conference. The fact, according to Senators Grassley and Hatch is, according to independent Congressional Budget Office, and the one thing I would like to make very clear is the President is totally entitled to his opinion; he is not entitled to his facts. And the Congressional Budget Office, which is independent, clearly states, the Congressional Budget Office: The rate of substitution of public coverage for private coverage or what is called crowding out would be lower under the compromise bill than it is under current law. 
   So the fact is, not only is this not going to happen, it is going to get better under this piece of legislation because the coverage will be there. So this idea of these myths, and when you hear the story of a young man who is facing these type things or a family that is going to take those type of decisions, and the President trying to tell the American public, well, this is for rich people, 94 percent of people falling in that 200 percent or lower that are on that are children. The President is saying it is those with $83,000; it is government-sponsored socialized medicine. We dug that word back out of the seventies, apparently. Or, it is going to force people who have private health insurance to take it on the government dole. None of those things are true. 
   I yield to the gentleman from California.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. What I would like to talk about first is, and I said the good news in this is, this is a defining moment tomorrow. This is a defining moment, Madam Speaker, and my colleagues in this House, of what this body does to represent the American people. And if my colleagues who are undecided as of now want to know where the American people are at, the latest poll just came out from CBS News. This is the largest one done to date on this, and here are the factors: Would you favor the Democratic version of expanding SCHIP? Eighty-one percent of people in this country, in Iowa, in California, Minnesota, in Wisconsin, in Florida, in Georgia, across this Nation, agree. 
   Now, here is the real kicker. This is the part I think for us to listen and to hear this. They look at that picture. They see that little baby, they see that mother. And this Nation's heart is where it is at. They know exactly what we need to do. 
   They even went so far as to ask them a tough question. Keep in mind, under this new House leadership over the last 9 months, we have to balance the budget. We have to go by PAYGO. It is no more paying and letting the children in the future pay for it. That is not happening on this. So under this piece of legislation, they even asked people in this poll: Would you be willing to pay more taxes to expand to this program? Seventy-four percent said yes. Seventy-four percent of the American public is willing to give their tax dollars to help fellow American children receive the health care that they know they so richly deserve. And the issue of that is, is this Nation knows it is morally right, it is fiscally right, and it invests in the future. 
   I said we know this is an issue that the American people, as Dr. Kagen illustrated, the physicians are with it. The groups that care about this are with it. The majority of Members in the Senate are with us. The majority of the Members of the House are with it. And we have an opportunity here. We are about 12 hours away from being able to decide and override this veto and show that the system works.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. (SCHIP -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Absolutely. And this issue again comes back to the basic core principles of budgeting. I would just like to refer to the chart here for a moment. 
   Whenever you make a budget and whenever we sit down in this body, we have to determine what our values are, what our priorities are, put them in order, and pay for them accordingly. The President has indicated that this is simply too expensive, that we cannot do it. Now, to keep in mind, I want to give an illustration here. The cost of a day in Iraq in the war is about $33 million. To get an idea, that is about a quarter of a million children we could cover. For 37 days, just over a month of what this war is costing us, and this number doesn't include, by the way, soldiers' salaries nor the health care costs that, it was estimated in a hearing I was at today, are going to cost us somewhere in the neighborhood of $9 billion a year, probably stretching, with the total cost coming from CBO and the Congressional Research Service, to $1.3 trillion over the next 15 years. We could cover all 10 million kids. 
   So we have got a decision to make in this country, where we are going to put our resources, where we are going to invest, where we are going to see the future on this. And this is a simple decision. When the President comes to this body and will demand, cajole, just about everything you can think of and tell us why he is going to need $200 billion, of course he told us 5 years ago that it was silly when General Shinseki mentioned that this might cost $100 billion. Of course, General Shinseki was let go. He didn't agree with that budgeting. Or, that we might actually have to take care of more veterans. That is why we ended up short for the last 3 years taking care of our veterans.  
   So the President is going to say this is a budgeting issue. This is the same gentleman that did what the previous 42 Presidents could not do. He got us into a trillion dollars in debt to foreign nations. It took him about 60 months to be able to do that while it took 218 years for our previous administrations. This is the one who took a massive surplus under the Clinton administration and turned it into a massive deficit. 
   So the President's credibility when it comes to fiscal matters is pretty much zero. This Nation, 81 percent by the latest numbers, and possibly more, are saying, invest in the children, invest in the health care. Do what is right. 
   I yield to the doctor from Wisconsin.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Well, I thank the gentleman, and I'm encouraged. I'm encouraged by the number of Members of this body that understand this issue. I'm encouraged by the willingness of our friends on both sides of the aisle to come together. I'm truly encouraged by the leadership of Senator Grassley and Senator Hatch working on this. 
   I'd like to bring up one more point on this of fiction versus fact, that I think this is one of the, maybe the meanest spirited part of this. And something that gets brought up, and unfortunately all too often is brought up, this idea of scapegoating or trying to mislead the way the public, it obviously is not working very well with the numbers coming out of the latest poll, but this idea that somehow a nonlegal resident of this country, an illegal immigrant would be eligible for this. I don't know how many times we need to state this. But I think that, Madam Speaker, that those of us in this body owe it to one another to be very, very clear when we state this. 
   The fiction part says that the compromise bill would allow illegal immigrants to get SCHIP. Here's what our Republican leadership in the Senate has said. ``Section 605 of our bill states the following: Nothing in this act allows Federal payment for individuals who are not legal residents.'' Anything to the contrary, if I would go back to the beginning, is simply misleading or, at worst, is an absolute attempt to distort or to be dishonest about this. 
   This is not, and I reflect back with each of my colleagues here. This is not a Democratic bill. This was a bill that was crafted under a Republican House and Senate and a Democratic President. It is a good piece of legislation. Our 43 Governors across the country support it. Numerous organizations that you have heard about, ranging the spectrum from the American Medical Association to the Easter Seals to the Cancer Society, to AARP, you name it and they're there. This is a good piece of legislation. And if the American public wants to understand how close this is or if, Madam Speaker, if you'd like to check with the Members of this body, there needs to be about 25 Members of this body switch where they're at on this issue. That's all we're asking for, to switch them. We've got them to compromise on that. We get these 25 people, and all of a sudden we're looking at 10 million children getting the care that they can. 
   Decisions are big around here. There's repercussions for your decisions. There's repercussions on the American public understanding what this body's job is supposed to do. And by all accounts, and each of us hear it, the American public, I would be willing to bet, it would be very difficult to find any issue that 81 percent of the American public agrees on, and this is the issue. 
   So tomorrow we have the opportunity. The President can choose to see if he wants to see his veto upheld. The Members of this body have the opportunity to make a difference. 
   So, Dr. Kagen.

   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Well, I think the two gentlemen make excellent points on this. It's about having a vision. It's about understanding investment. 
   I would argue it has sunk in, Madam Speaker, to 81 percent of the country. It simply hasn't sunk in to another 25 Members of this body that will start to get that. 
   I want to give just an example here, a couple on this. This idea that the President's going to decide again, and the claims that came up here and, of course, the chart we talked about where the President's going to cut back on numbers, we have a situation now where we have children uncovered. The President is going to decide. Now, our bill is going to get us to the number we want to try to get to. The President is going to say, no, there's not enough there to get that. Well, he calls himself the decider. So Madam Speaker, I'd like you to think about this, and I'd like Members of this body to think about this. 
   Who gets coverage? Which one of these families gets coverage? You decide. Some aren't going to if you get the President's way. Our way makes the decision pretty easy. Cover the children. 
   How about the Wilkerson family from St. Petersburg, Florida? 
   ``This is personal not only to us but millions of parents,'' said Bethany's mother, Dara, in a telephone interview. 
   ``Dara Wilkerson said Bethany had to have heart surgery in 2005, when she was 6 months old, after doctors told them she'd been born with two holes in her heart and a valve that didn't close. The Wilkersons said their annual income was about $34,000 from their jobs, and they couldn't afford private insurance, and it wasn't offered to them. But even if they could, Bethany had a preexisting condition. The heart problem she was born with made enrollment in private plans impossible, her mother said. Thanks to Florida's version of SCHIP, the State Kid Care Program, Bethany gets the care she needs and has recovered and is a healthy, happy little girl.'' 
   The President can be the decider. Does Bethany and her family get the coverage or not? It's his decision. 
   How about the Spaeth family from Kentucky? 
   Tonya Spaeth will give birth to a baby whose health care is the subject of a contentious debate on Capitol Hill. For the Spaeth family, such matters go far beyond a political debate. The baby's two older siblings have spent much of their lives in Kentucky's version of KCHIP, which insures 51,000 uninsured, low-income children who don't qualify for Medicaid. The Spaeths pay $1 or $2 for prescription medication and a $20 monthly premium. Mom and dad both work, but are absolutely unable to afford private insurance, which would run about $400 a month. So you want to throw them off? We can see what they did. 
   How about the Mackey family from Memphis, Tennessee? When Barbara Mackey's sister sent her an e-mail earlier this year about Tennessee's new CoverKids health care, she jumped at the chance. CoverKids is making a huge difference, said Barbara, who earns less than $20,000 a year as a bookkeeper at a church daycare center. The center offers health insurance to employees but not their dependents. Barbara said three of her four children were covered under the TennCare health insurance program for the poor, but lost coverage when the State ruled that the family's income was too high to qualify. So do you want to throw off Barbara Mackey and her children? 
   The list goes on and on and on. So the decider is going to be able to make a decision. We, as the deciders of the people's will, the 81 percent of people who agree with this, the 74 percent who are willing to give up their hard-earned dollars to help invest, as we heard our good colleague from Iowa and from Wisconsin say, this is a good piece of legislation. It's bipartisan. It's well vetted. It's ready to go. It passed both Chambers. It was vetoed. And tomorrow we're going to have the opportunity to set that record straight. And I look forward to this vote. I look forward to standing on this floor with my colleagues and proudly casting that vote, knowing that this Nation's priorities are straight. This Nation's priorities are right. This Nation's commitments to its children are unwavering. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin.

   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, yesterday I talked to a farmer who told me he just purchased fuel to power his irrigation pumps. The cost for 2 weeks of that fuel, $33,000 worth of diesel. This Nation's people and economy are reeling because of high energy costs, and yet some in this House offer nothing but the same old political games, the exact games that put us in this position. 
   Let's be very clear: No one is saying we shouldn't be producing and using domestic supplies. But false solution land grabs and politics aren't going to get us to energy independence. Oil companies today are sitting on 68 million acres of Federal land, your land, Madam Speaker, that could produce up to a decade-and-a-half worth of all the fuel this country needs. Yet they are not drilling. Future generations deserve that we provide real solutions that not only include domestic production, but provide innovations and alternative technologies and crack down on speculation. 
   Yesterday, Madam Speaker, China increased their fuel prices by 17 percent, and the price of oil dropped by $6 a barrel. By anybody's best estimate, that is more than drilling in ANWR would drop the cost. 
   Madam Speaker, we deserve solutions that extend to the next generation, not the next election.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1538, the Wounded Warriors Assistance Act of 2007. 
   First of all, I would like to thank the chairman from California. I would like to thank the ranking member from Indiana for his leadership and colleagues on both sides of the aisle for introducing this timely bill that responds to the needs of our soldiers. Their leadership on both sides of the aisle is a testament to the 110th Congress' commitment to caring for this Nation's active duty forces and veterans. The commitment to veterans can show no political ideology. 
   As a 24-year veteran of the Army National Guard of this Nation, and the highest ranking enlisted soldier to ever serve in this Congress, I know that taking care of active duty forces and our veterans is one of the most important issues facing this country and this Congress. I, as all Americans, was outraged and saddened when we read reports of substandard care and unacceptable conditions at Walter Reed. Our Armed Forces and their families sacrificed too much to receive poor active duty care and difficulties in transitioning to veterans care. H.R. 1538 will fix these problems. 
   It will be done in a bipartisan manner and this piece of legislation has the possibility of starting to heal some of the divisions amongst this Nation, as we all agree, on the care of our veterans as a priority. This bill will provide more staff to work with outpatient servicemembers. It will improve training for medical staff. It will  find ways to better transition from active duty to veterans care, and it will create an oversight board for wounded warriors that they will properly investigate the quality of care our veterans are receiving in a timely manner. 
   I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, regardless of political ideology, to support this bill. We must give our brave servicemen and -women the care they deserve, while serving our Nation. We must continue to address the need for their ongoing care once they hang up their uniforms, that they have performed their service to this Nation with honor, pride and dignity. 
   Now this Congress must do its job, provide the tools, the funding and the oversight necessary to ensure quality care for every soldier that serves this Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. (THE COST OF STAYING IN IRAQ IS MAKING AMERICA LESS SECURE -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, the war in Iraq has now gone on for more than 5 years. Those 5 years have seriously hampered our military's readiness, and the human and financial  costs grow greater by the day. Eighty-eight percent of our current and former military officers believe this war has stretched our military dangerously thin, and 60 percent say it has left us weaker than at any time since Vietnam. 
   Pete Geren, the Secretary of the Army, said, ``We are consuming our readiness as fast as we build it,'' and the Army Chief of Staff, General George Casey, said, ``The last six-plus years at war have left our Army out of balance, consumed by the current fight, and unable to do the things we know we need to do to prepare for the future.'' In addition to spending hundreds of billions of dollars on this war, the cost to care for our veterans and rebuild this Army will take us decades. 
   While our military is standing up and facing these challenges with great dignity and professionalism, there are some here who say we need to stay the course and stay in Iraq for 100 years. This is not sustainable. This is not a plan. This is not security. We need real leadership that understands the cost of staying in Iraq and not redeploying our troops is making America less secure and not more.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act. This bill will ensure that 10 million of America's children will finally get the health care  they deserve, preventive health care, not expensive emergency room health care or poor choices. 
   Recently, my son, Gus, celebrated his first birthday. My whole family joined in celebrating this occasion. Shortly after I returned to Washington, my wife noticed that Gus wasn't feeling well; he was fussing and not sleeping. She was able to take him to the family doctor, who diagnosed a double ear infection, prescribed antibiotics, and Gus is a healthy 1-year-old back on the mend. The thought that any child would suffer through something so preventable in this richest Nation the world has ever seen and a parent would have to make that decision is unacceptable. 
   Budgets are far more than fiscal documents. They are a moral document that reflects the values of this Nation. Every Member of this House of Representatives speaking against this bill receives taxpayer-funded health care, and their children don't have to make these choices that 10 million do. 
   I ask that my colleagues join me in doing the right thing, reauthorize with an overwhelming bipartisan majority.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. (BUSH BUDGET IS MORE OF THE SAME MISSED OPPORTUNITIES AND MISPLACED PRIORITIES -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, we are here to talk today about the recent unveiling of the President's budget. I think we should give the President credit. At least he's consistent. Like all of his previous budgets, this one does several things. It leaves most Americans behind and puts this Nation further in debt. 
   At a time of a slowing economy and Americans increasingly struggling to make ends meet, the President focuses on $1 trillion in tax breaks to the top 1 percent of Americans. While the wealthiest few continue to prosper under the President, the President cuts vital energy, education, and health care investments. At a time of rising energy costs, the President slashes low-income energy assistance programs. At a time of college costs skyrocketing, the budget eliminates nearly $1 billion in grant programs. At a time of rising health care costs, the President proposes devastating Medicare and Medicaid cuts that would reduce affordable access to health care for our seniors. 
   The one good thing that people know is the winds of change have been blowing. This Democratic Congress will restore these and put the priorities of American people first.

   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Mr. Chairman, I say a special thank you to Chairman Miller and the ranking member. As a lifelong educator and a teacher in the classroom for 20 years, the understanding and the work that has been put into this piece of legislation is something that I think we can all be very proud of. It takes in and understands the investment in America's future comes in education. 
   I would like to make one comment. One of the issues that doesn't come up very often in the cost of college expenses is the cost of textbooks. It runs about $900 for an average student. One of the problems we've seen is small changes in textbooks that require students to buy new ones each and every year. There was a very important person in my district, Jared Stene, who was the president of the Winona State University Student Senate. Jared worked for years tirelessly on this issue to bring about some transparency in how textbooks are marketed. Unfortunately, Jared passed away unexpectedly over Thanksgiving, and I thank the chairman for giving me the opportunity and for the work he did in the committee to address this very issue.

   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and ranking member. I thank you for your pragmatism. I thank you for your vision and your willingness to get this done, understanding that the situation in our economy is one, as I heard Speaker Pelosi say, where most Americans knew far before we did that this was trouble. 
   Madam Speaker, I keep hearing people say that the economy was fine. Saying it doesn't make it so. We know that in the last 7 years, the policies we have seen have created the lowest job growth since the Great Depression. We have seen real wages drop by $2,500. 
   The American people needed something, and this is a good bipartisan piece of legislation, bringing them together to try to address those facts that they understood long before we did. And I think it sets the stage and shows the American public we can get along, we can move things, and we can make a positive difference. And this is a great first step. 
   With that, I urge my colleagues to support this good, timely piece of legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. (THE TREATMENT OF OUR VETERANS -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, the failures of this administration are once again on display today. From the failure to plan for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, to plan for the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and now we face the unconscionable failure to plan for the care of our veterans at Walter Reed and other facilities across the country. 
   This administration's inability to plan, their total disregard of expert advice, and the President's stubborn refusal to even acknowledge the consequences of marching our country off to war all have led to our servicemembers living in substandard conditions after coming back and fighting for this country. 
   Some of my colleagues deflect this criticism by saying yes, that's true, but what is your plan? Our plan is to actually plan ahead. Most members of the military like myself and the VSOs that support them anticipated the need for added resources to support our veterans at a time of war. But the President continued year after year after year to cut funding resources to the VA. The cost of war must include the cost of caring for our warriors. 
   Now another avoidable crisis is upon us and I say and the country says, Enough is enough. The era of putting politics before the needs of our citizens comes to an end. The American public will not stand for one more day of this incompetence. Now is the time to act. This Congress must exhibit the leadership that will restore the American people's confidence in their government and provide the services to our wounded veterans.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. Thank you to my colleague 
   Mr. Speaker, no debate in this House is longer overdue. This debate has been going on for nearly 4 years in houses, in grocery stores, in workplaces, in houses of worship all across America. No greater responsibility rests with us, the people's Representatives, than debating the decisions involved in waging a war. The decision to send our brave men and women into combat is not the end of our responsibility, it is the beginning. This body has a sacred duty to protect this Nation, our citizens, and especially those we send into combat in our name. 
   Constant vigilance, questioning, and adjustments to courses of action are our number one priority, and this newly elected Congress intends to do just that.     
   Some have said that this debate sends a message to our enemies. I would agree. The message our enemies are hearing this week is that democracy in America is alive and well. The message that our enemy is hearing this week is that this Nation will not live in fear of its own shadow and blindly give away those precious liberties that make this the greatest Nation the world has ever known. 
   The message our enemy is hearing this week is this Nation is able and willing to adjust our tactics to focus on the true threats to our security, which come from al Qaeda, and the Taliban in Afghanistan, and by securing our ports and borders. 
   The message they are hearing is that this Nation is no longer willing to wage a war based on political ideology and failed policy. We will wage it on facts and reality. Many of my colleagues have spoken of the need to support our troops. You will get no debate from me nor any other American. By implying that some do not support the troops based on nothing more than political posturing is cynical and divisive. 
   For more than two decades, I served with soldiers, airmen, marines, and not once did I ever see these brave men and women as anything other than patriots. I never saw them as a Democrat, a Republican, an Independent or a Libertarian; nor did they see me as anything but a fellow soldier. 
   The issue that we are debating this week is the execution of this war and the failure of this administration to provide a realistic plan for success. From the start of this war up to this recent plan to send more Americans into Baghdad, this administration has miscalculated, poorly planned, shifted blame and failed to couple our military policies with diplomatic, economic and long-range strategic planning that would have given the soldiers a chance to succeed. 
   Had the previous Congress done its constitutional duty of oversight and accountability, there is a strong likelihood we would be in much better shape today. Even as foreign policy experts, military experts, the Congress and the American public show an overwhelming desire to change course and oppose this escalation, this administration ignores all evidence and stumbles on. This debate marks the new beginning of this Congress's acceptance of our duty to provide the oversight and bring about policy changes based in reality and facts and long-range security needs of this Nation. 
   I have taken two oaths in my life. The first one was as a young man of 17 when I swore my allegiance to the Armed Forces of this country. The second was a month ago when I became a United States Congressman. In both cases I solemnly swore my allegiance to protect and defend the U.S. Constitution. 
   I swore alliance to no man. I swore no alliance to a political ideology. I swore only to uphold the laws of this great land and protect with my life, if necessary, the liberties and freedoms we so dearly cherish. This debate today is exactly about that oath. 
   Previous Congresses gave this President the authority to conduct this war in Iraq, which is right, but not the authority to disregard the expert advice, not the authority to take civil liberties from American citizens, and not the authority to disregard our constitutional right in this body as a coequal branch of government. 
   I, like all Americans, wish nothing more than this President had made good decisions and that the situation in Iraq were better. Unfortunately, wishful thinking does not make good foreign policy. But, fortunately, the genius of the Founders of this Nation are on display right now. This Congress, by taking this first step of oversight and accountability, and passing this resolution, will begin to right the ship of state and take this country on a path that will lead to greater security and begin to return our brave men and women back to their families. 
   A few short months ago, I was teaching high school. Call me optimistic and naive, but I do not see where casting a vote in this sacred room is anything but binding. Call me naive again when I hear this is nothing but words on paper. How does that differ from the U.S. Constitution? 
   Yesterday, I had the opportunity to visit with two soldiers from my old unit, the proud 34th Red Bull Division. Those two young men are out at Walter Reed Army Hospital. Both John and Tony are being fitted with their prosthetic limbs for the other ones they left behind in Iraq. 
   We spoke of everything from how they were injured, to football, to how to get ready to ski again. I do not know and I do not care about their political ideology. I only care that this Nation honors its commitment by providing everything possible to these brave Americans. Today is the day that  I tell Tony and John, we will always support you. We will provide true security to this Nation

<DOCNO>Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. (NATIONAL HIGHWAY BRIDGE RECONSTRUCTION AND INSPECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALZ of Minnesota. I thank the ranking member and the chairman of the committee, not just for this very good piece of legislation, which I stand in support of and offer this amendment to, but I would like to thank the chairman for his leadership. 
   Madam Chairman, August 1 of last year was a tragic day for the country but especially for those of us in Minnesota, as you've heard the chairman talk about the stunning nature that a bridge could fall in Minnesota. And I've heard many people afterwards refer to it as a wake-up call for many people. If that's true, one person has never slept on this issue, and that's the chairman. He has spoken about this. He has talked about the need for infrastructure rehabilitation and improvements for decades. And leadership is not reacting to a situation, it's being proactive and anticipating and doing the things necessary. So I thank the chairman for that. 
   Madam Chairman, we in Minnesota this year are celebrating our sesquicentennial. One hundred and fifty years ago this year, our great State joined this great union. And of all the beautiful places across the expanses of the Land of 10,000 Lakes, the North Star State, the U.S. Postal Service issued their stamp, their commemorative stamp, and it came out on May 17 of this year. This stamp highlights one of the most beautiful parts and one of the most recognizable icons of this country, the winding Mississippi River near Winona, Minnesota, as it separates the Minnesota side from the Wisconsin side. 
   This bridge in the foreground is the Highway 43 Bridge. This was issued on May 17. And less than 3 weeks later, on the evening of June 3, the Minnesota Department of Transportation issued  an immediate critical warning on the bridge and closed the bridge to all traffic. Because of the tragedy of August 1 of last year and because of Chairman Oberstar and the changes that happened in the Minnesota Department of Transportation, an accelerated inspection, critical inspection, of these bridges happened, and it was found that the gusset plates had eroded on the Minnesota 43 Bridge. This iconic photo that just came out, it was also eroding in the same manner that led to the collapse of the 35-W Bridge. 
   This bridge closure was done with caution. It was done with professionalism. It was exactly the right decision to make. But when thousands and thousands of commuters woke up on the morning of June 4, they were stuck in a pretty difficult situation. There are 11,000 vehicles a day that cross this bridge. Over 3,000 people depend on their livelihood for jobs that were literally minutes across, and because of the closure now, they had to travel between 25 and 35 miles to the alternative crossing and then back over again, adding between 100 and 140 miles a day and hours to their commute time. It basically shut down all commerce in one of the larger cities in our district and shut down a major corridor between our two great States of Wisconsin and Minnesota. Other problems were emergency vehicles and response times were dependent on this bridge being open that were no longer there. 
   And while commuters were dealing with high gas pries, the city was dealing with emergency vehicles, commerce was being shut down to a crawl or to nothing, I do commend the City of Winona, the County, the State officials under Commissioner Sorel for responding as quickly as they possibly could. 
   What they needed to come up with was they needed to figure out a mitigation plan in very short order. They needed to figure out what they were going to do, determine how long they were going to have to set that up, and this was a situation that fell under very little Federal control and very little Federal help could be offered to the people that were there. And we ended up bringing in ferries and barges and different things, buses, and people worked through it and got it done. 
   What my amendment says is let's be more proactive on this. This is going to happen in the future. There are going to be emergency shutdowns. We hope that we get to the point where we don't end up inspecting a bridge when we almost see it at a point where it can't be driven on. But the case needs to be we need to proactively plan, especially on these federally aided highways. 
   This amendment asks the Secretary of Transportation to report to Congress within 15 days of the issuance of a critical finding the results of a bridge closure. The report from the Secretary will include an assessment of the economic impact of the closure as well as the impact on regional transportation and transit patterns. The amendment requires the Secretary to recommend solutions to mitigate these impacts. 
   The State and the City were able to do this, but it was really a big reach, especially where there were Federal funds involved. It was a Federal aid highway. 
   So I'm hopeful that we will never use this. I'm hopeful that no other locality will be stuck in this situation. I am pleased to tell you that because within hours of this happening, Chairman Oberstar was on the site, standing on the bridge, inspecting it. The community and the State pulled together, and the bridge is now open for limited traffic again and is getting back on. It's scheduled for repair as we speak and should be finished by the end of summer. 
   But I thank the chairman and the ranking member, and I would ask that the diligence be done to make sure this doesn't happen to another locale.
