<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. (CONGRATULATING ENSIGN D<em>e</em>CAROL DAVIS -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of legislation I authored to recognize a remarkable young woman, Ensign DeCarol Davis. 
   On May 21, 2008, Ensign Davis graduated from the Coast Guard Academy with a grade point average of 3.96 in electrical engineering. She earned the distinction of being the first African American valedictorian of the Coast Guard Academy. 
   The Coast Guard Academy was founded in 1876, but the first African American did not graduate from the institution until 1966. Women were not admitted to the school until 1976. Today, we honor Ensign Davis, who, through her hard work and perseverance, accomplished what no African American has done before her, she achieved the Academy's highest honor. 
   This achievement is remarkable, given that over the past three decades the number of minorities graduating from the Coast Guard Academy has not kept pace with the other military service academies. Legislation approved by the House earlier this year, Mr. Speaker, would bring about more diversity within the Coast Guard Academy by allowing Members of Congress to nominate individuals for this academy, just as we do all other military service academies. 
   I would also note that outside of the classroom Ensign Davis has distinguished herself as a community leader. On her own initiative, in the little spare time that she had, Ensign Davis wrote and directed a play for a local elementary school that introduced engineering as a possible career to the students. 
   During her time at the academy, Ensign Davis also excelled in sports. In fact, she was selected to be the 2006 Arthur Ashe First Team Sports Scholar for basketball. She was also selected to be on the 2007 ESPN Academic Women's Basketball Team for All-District  One Colleges. This is just a sample of this gifted young person's accomplishments. Ensign Davis clearly is destined for a successful career in the Coast Guard. 
   Earlier this month, Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity to meet Ensign Davis and spent some time getting to know her. During our meeting, she spoke passionately about her internship with D.C. Voice, a group of education activists concerned about public education in our Nation's capital. As a Truman scholar, Ensign Davis could have worked anywhere, but she chose to focus her energies on the District of Columbia and work to make a difference in the lives of thousands of children who attend D.C. public schools. 
   Today, Mr. Speaker, we honor Ensign DeCarol Davis for being a trailblazer whose academic accomplishments are matched by a commitment to protecting our Nation and contributing to our communities. 
   Congratulations to Ensign Davis and the rest of the Class of 2008. This Nation is appreciative of your commitment to service. Your talents are needed to ensure that the Coast Guard can continue to be a ``can do'' agency that we have all come to rely upon to keep our ports and waterways safe and secure. 
   I urge you to support this resolution and join me in recognizing a future leader of our country.

<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. (WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I applaud Chairman WAXMAN, Ranking Member DAVIS, and others for their work on this badly needed bill. 
   This bill extends whistleblower protections to Federal employees who work on national security, mainly in the intelligence area, workers in the Transportation Security Administration, especially screeners, and Federal contractors, amongst others. 
   As Chairman WAXMAN correctly identified, there is a tremendous need to protect Federal workers and contractors who are our best sources of identifying waste fraud, abuse or security problems. 
   This bill treats Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) the same as all other Department employees by giving them full whistleblower protections, which TSOs currently do not have. 
    Mr. Chairman, others will tell you that TSOs have adequate whistleblower rights. While this is debatably true on paper, it is not true in practice. 
   The truth is TSOs do not enjoy full whistleblower protections. They have extremely limited whistleblower protections granted by a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that was entered into when TSA was part of the Department of Transportation. 
   In fact, while reviewing a TSO whistleblower claim in 2004, the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) ruled that the Homeland Security Act does not provide TSO whistleblowers with a right to MSPB review. 
   Compared to other Department employees who do enjoy the right to MSPB review, TSOs are treated differently. 
   Under the MOU, TSOs can only bring a claim to the Office of Special Counsel, but TSOs have no right of outside appeal to either the MSPB or any other independent agency or court, like all other the Department employees can. 
   This bill remedies this situation by giving the TSOs full whistleblower rights, including the right to independent outside review. 
   Besides independent outside review, this bill also allows a whistleblower to go to court if their claim has not been acted on within 6 months of filing. 
   This bill permits the whistleblower to bring an appeal on their case to any federal court of appeals having proper jurisdiction over the case. 
   I am also pleased that this bill provides the same rights to the Department's Office of Intelligence and Analysis employees as it does to intelligence employees in other agencies. 
   As we know, whistleblowers in the intelligence community must be careful when they disclose certain information.  
   This bill helps govern how these people can bring their claims, but it also adequately protects any sensitive or classified information that may be involved. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to note that H.R. 1, which passed the House in January, has some similar effects as H.R. 985, mainly that it provides whistleblower protections to TSOs. 
   H.R. 1 also fixes the poor morale problems by allowing collective bargaining rights for TSOs, similar to other law enforcement officers and others within the Department, such as the Border Patrol and Customs and Border Protection Officers. 
   Nonetheless, I am happy to vote for H.R. 985 today as it not only makes America safer and more secure, but it also allows for all employees to report waste, fraud, or abuse of vital and limited government resources. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. (VIOLENT RADICALIZATION AND HOMEGROWN TERRORISM PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1955, the Violent Radicalization of Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007. 
   In May, six men were arrested for allegedly plotting to attack Fort Dix. Three of those men were United States citizens; the other three had been in the United States since they were small children. Then, again, in June, another four men were charged with plotting to attack JFK Airport by blowing up jet fuel tanks. The alleged mastermind of this plot was a United States citizen. 
   Today, one of the most frequently visited English language Web sites that preaches hate, violence and radicalized views of Islam is operated by a 21-year-old U.S. citizen from the comfort of his parents' home in North Carolina. Some may say these incidents are isolated cases, but I believe that they are indicative of a growing trend of homegrown terrorism in this country. 
   Homegrown terrorists no longer need to travel to Afghanistan or Pakistan to get support and training. They can simply go on the Internet to find violent propaganda and others who share their violent ideology. H.R. 1955 provides us with a strategy for how to address this very challenging Homeland Security issue. I commend Chairwoman Harman for authoring this important legislation and for championing this case. 
   The centerpiece of this bill is the creation of a national commission. It is a step in the right direction. National commissions have a long and successful history in this country. The Gilmore Commission, of which our chairwoman was a member, which functioned from 1993 to 1998, made 164 recommendations regarding the domestic response to terrorism. Of those 164 recommendations, all have been adopted in whole or in part by the Congress and the Federal Government. 
   Another commission, the National Commission on Terrorism, which operated in the early 1990s, was on the cutting edge of the terrorism debate. That commission provided the Nation with the blueprint of how to address the threat of terrorism long before the September 11 attacks. 
   The more recent 9/11 Commission set the tenor of our administrative and legislative response to the September 11 attack. That commission's recommendations were the bedrock of legislation I offered that was enacted into law this summer. 
   The commission established in H.R. 1955 will help build on the work of past commissions and help our Nation come up with strategies for new threats. The bill also requires our government to reach out to other nations that have experienced home grown terrorism. Learning from other nations about what works and what doesn't will better position us to prevent the spread of violent ideology in our country. 
   The bill also creates a center of excellence to conduct research that is desperately needed in determining the root cause of violent radicalization. 
   At the same time, H.R. 1955 also protects simple rights and liberties of U.S. citizens. The bill is mindful of Americans' right to free speech, freedom of association and freedom to worship. H.R. 1955 makes certain that individuals exercising these rights within lawful parameters are not singled out. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important Homeland Security bill and ask them to vote in favor of passage of this important legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, in closing, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 1955. This vital legislation will put our Nation on the path to addressing an emerging threat, homegrown terrorism. 
   There is general agreement that the threat of foreign-based terrorist groups is real. We, as a Nation, have dedicated a great deal of resources to global counterterrorism. However, in some corners, there has been a kind of mindset about homeland security that believes we will be safe if we get the terrorists there before they get us here. It's the kind of mindset that ignores the fact that there are some would-be terrorists who are born here, raised and educated here, and only have lived here in the United States. For those of us who love this Nation, it is not the kind of thing that we want to acknowledge, but we must. Enactment of H.R. 1955 will put us on a course to understanding homegrown terrorism and coming up with strategies to reduce this major threat to the homeland. 
   Madam Speaker, I, also would like to pay tribute to the chairwoman of the committee for ushering this passage, as well as the ranking member of the committee. But I would also like to acknowledge that Ranking Member King, who had an unfortunate death in his family, is not here. He has been a source of support for this legislation and has helped get us to this point, and I would like to acknowledge that for the record. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. (SECURE HANDLING OF AMMONIUM NITRATE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1680, the Secure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate Act of 2007. 
   The committee has worked vigilantly to get this bill to where it is today. In fact, we've been working on this bill in a bipartisan way for two Congresses now. 
   We all know the devastating impact that fertilizer bombs can have. Over 12 years ago, domestic terrorists used an ammonium nitrate-based bomb to blow up the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. That blast had a force equal to that of 4,000 pounds of TNT. It killed 168 people. 
   Since that time, ammonium nitrate-based bombs have repeatedly been used throughout the world. In 2002, a group linked to al Qaeda detonated a bomb outside a night club in Bali, Indonesia, killing 202 people. In 2003, an al Qaeda cell in Istanbul killed 57 people in two separate explosions. Last year, Canadian authorities arrested 17 people in Toronto for plotting to attack targets with ammonium nitrate-based bombs. 
   This threat is real, Madam Speaker. To do nothing about it is unacceptable. However, I have always believed that we must act in a thoughtful manner that recognizes the importance of ammonium nitrate in our agricultural sector. 
   I am proud of the work that the Committee on Homeland Security has done. The committee has worked hard to ensure that H.R. 1680 strikes the right balance between ensuring access to ammonium nitrate for farmers and making it difficult for terrorists to obtain. 
   Specifically, this bill directs DHS, in consultation with State agricultural authorities, to create a registry of facilities that manufacture and sell ammonium nitrate. H.R. 1680 requires the sales of ammonium nitrate to be limited to purchasers who register in advance and that the name, address, telephone number and registration number of the purchaser be recorded. 
   The tracking and registration functions are not new phenomena. The agriculture and fertilizer industry and some States have been engaged in voluntary programs to monitor sale of ammonium nitrate for some time. In fact, Madam Speaker, a handful of States, including New York, California, New Jersey, Nevada, Oklahoma, Missouri, South Carolina, Maryland, Michigan, and Iowa have enacted laws regulating the sale of ammonium nitrate-based fertilizer. 
   The time has come to put Federal rules in place to ensure that terrorists cannot cross State lines to buy ammonium nitrate without being registered or checked against the terrorist watch list. 
   Madam Speaker, I am proud to say that our committee has worked collaboratively with industry stakeholders in the agriculture industry on this legislation. We consulted State and local farm bureaus, fertilizer manufacturers and retail outlets, and mining and explosive makers. It is reassuring to know that we can all come together to come up with a reasonable approach to regulating ammonium nitrate. 
   I have somewhat of a vested interest in getting this right, Madam Speaker. There is an ammonium nitrate plant in my district. The Terra Yazoo City plant has been in operation for more than 50 years. The Terra plant is a major economic engine in our local economy, providing good-paying jobs and stable jobs for the community. 
   The Terra facility and many others like it across the country are committed to safeguarding ammonium nitrate, but they cannot do it alone. The Federal Government needs to show some leadership here. That is why H.R. 1680 directs DHS to take the lead in coming up with an approach to registering ammonium nitrate purchases. 
   I am pleased that through this bipartisan effort we've been able to come up with an approach to tighten control of ammonium nitrate, yet allow it to remain accessible for crop nutrition purposes. 
   This legislation is another of our ongoing homeland security efforts at preventing a future terrorist attack on our Nation. 
   I would like to thank subcommittee Chairman Langevin, Ranking Member King, and others, for their leadership on this critical issue. Each has put their mark on the bill through the committee process. Their efforts, without question, made this a better bill. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1680. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, as DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff recently said, improvised explosive devices are the weapon of choice for terrorists. And when it comes to making an improvised bomb, regrettably, ammonium nitrate seems to be an easy access to use. That is why I authored the Secure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate Act. It will put safeguards in place to keep ammonium nitrate out of the hands of terrorists while ensuring that farmers can still access it. Ammonium nitrate fertilizer is a popular fertilizer because it is relatively inexpensive and highly effective. 
   In 2005 alone, 1.4 million short tons of ammonium nitrate fertilizer was used to direct application to farmers' fields. Passage of H.R. 1680 will ensure that ammonium nitrate will remain available to those who need to access it for proper purposes. At the same time, passage of this bill is an important step toward ensuring that our Nation is more secure against the threat of improvised explosive devices. 
   I, too, would like to acknowledge the work of the minority committee as well as Colleen O'Keefe, who will be leaving the committee today. Karis Gutter on this side, has worked on the majority side on the committee, and I would like to acknowledge both of them. At an earlier comment, I referred to Ranking Member King's unfortunate tragedy in his family and why he was not here. So I would like to join with the comments of Mr. Lungren in that respect. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this critical homeland security legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. (RECOGNIZING THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, It is my pleasure to be here today to honor the employees of the Department of Homeland Security. As we mark the Department's fifth anniversary, we must keep in mind that it is the people of the Department who make the sacrifices to keep us all safe. 
   Five years ago, this new Department was created and charged with the crucial mission of protecting and securing our homeland. This was not an easy task in the wake of the September 11th attacks. Hurricane Katrina demonstrated that this was a broader mission than the Department's leadership initially thought. However, despite the challenges before them, the employees of the Department have remained focused on ensuring the security of all Americans. 
   We talk about the activities of TSA or FEMA or CBP. What sometimes gets lost in the discussion are the individuals behind the acronyms. The people of DHS deserve our praise and our gratitude. They include the Customs and Border Protection Officers who man our ports-of-entry; the Federal Air Marshals who, everyday, sit through the same flight delays that so frustrate the American public to do their part to keep the flying public secure; FEMA teams who trek selflessly into disaster zones to help those in need; and support personnel such as contracting officers, administrative assistants, technical support teams without whom the folks on the front lines could not do their jobs. 
   I could go on, but my time is limited and I think my point is clear. All the men and women of the Department deserve to be recognized for 5 years of hard work. They work nights, weekends, and holidays. They put their life on the line to secure our country from all manner of threats. Today, we are here to extend a hard-earned and much deserved ``Thank You.'' 
   As Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, it is an honor for me to stand here today in support of this resolution. I have, at times, been critical of the Department's management. But I want to be very clear: my criticism of the Department's management should in no way be construed as a lack of appreciation for the individuals who are making daily sacrifices to secure our Nation. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring these ``everyday heroes.''

<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. (ADDRESSING VULNERABILITIES IN AVIATION SECURITY -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1413. 
   H.R. 1413 was introduced by Representatives Lowey and Brown-Waite to establish a pilot program to test the viability of physically screening airport workers at seven (7) airports. I am pleased to report that this bipartisan bill, as amended in Committee, not only requires TSA to test physical screening but also alternative forms of screening, including: biometrics, behavior recognition, and canine teams. 
   Consideration of H.R. 1413 is timely in light of the October 2007 arrest of 10 airline employees for operating a drug smuggling ring at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. The ring leader allegedly directed JFK airport employees from inside the airport on how to move heroin and cocaine into so-called ``safe areas'' of the airport. 
   Mr. Speaker, most people that work in our nation's airports are hardworking, trustworthy people who pose no threat to the traveling public. However, in a post-9/11 world, we have to address the risk of an ``inside job''--where an attack is planned and executed by an airport worker who exploits security gaps. H.R. 1413 does just that. 
   H.R. 1413 does so in a manner that strives to assure that that people that keep the planes flying are able to do their job. Specifically, H.R. 1413 creates a 180-day pilot program where all the people that access the terminal and the airplanes, not just the American Flying Public, are screened. 
   To those who think this can't be done, I'm here to tell you ``it can be done.'' They do it at London's Heathrow airport. They do it at DeGaulle Airport in Paris. I understand that there are those who don't want us to look at this approach. But in a post-9/11 world, failing to do so is just plain wrong. 
   Under the leadership of Subcommittee Chairwoman Jackson-Lee, H.R. 1413 was agreed to ``as amended,'' on April 24th by voice vote. The full committee considered, voted and reported favorably on August 1. I strongly urge passage of this bill that takes a reasonable approach to exploring how to better secure our airports, airplanes and travelers. 
   Mrs. Lowey and Ms. Brown-Waite are to be commended for their leadership on this critical legislation. I look forward to continuing to work with the bills sponsors and other interested parties to ensure that TSA structures the pilot in a manner that provides Congress with the best guidance on how to address this gap in security. I strongly urge passage on this important homeland security measure.

<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. (NATIONAL SECURITY FOREIGN INVESTMENT REFORM AND STRENGTHENED TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I stand here today as chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security in support of H.R. 556, the National Security Foreign Investment Reform and Strengthened Transparency Act of 2007. This bill provides needed reform by formalizing and streamlining the structure and duties of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Indeed, this bill addresses many of the concerns raised about CFIUS during the past twelve months, especially its current lack of transparency and oversight. This bill rectifies these concerns by formally establishing CFIUS and its membership, while also streamlining how and when a CFIUS review will be conducted. 
   Mr. Chairman, the bill formalizes the CFIUS membership and requires the following to serve: (1) Secretaries of Treasury, Homeland Security, Commerce, Defense, State, and Energy; (2) Attorney General; Chair of the Council of Economic Advisors; the U.S. Trade Representative; Director of Office of Management and Budget; Director of National Economic Council; and (3) The Director of Office of Science and Technology Policy; the President's assistant for national security affairs; and any other designee of the President from the Executive Office. 
   Under this bill, the Treasury Department will be the Chair with the Secretaries of Commerce and Homeland serving as the Vice Chairs. CFIUS will conduct a review of any national security related business transaction in which the outcome could result in foreign control of any business engaged in interstate commerce in the U.S. After reviewing the proposed business transaction, CFIUS will make a determination, the outcome of which could require conducting a full investigation if one of four circumstances exists: (1) Transaction involves a foreign government-controlled entity; (2) Transaction threatens to impair national security and the review cannot mitigate those concerns; (3) National Intelligence Director  identifies intelligence concerns and CFIUS could not agree upon methods to mitigate the concerns; or, (4) Any one (1) CFIUS Member votes against approving the transaction. 
   Incidents such as the Dubai Ports World (DPW) and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation's attempted bid for control of oil company Unocal raised and increased awareness around transactions that should receive CFIUS review. These incidents highlighted the need for meaningful CFIUS reform. 
   The bill balances the need for continued foreign investment in the United States, but reviewing that investment to determine if it would impair or threaten national security or critical infrastructure. 
   This bill establishes accountability to key Cabinet level agencies and, much like other corporate reform, requires personal action by the Secretaries of Treasury, Commerce, and Homeland Security. Congressional Research Service's independent report found that for all merger and acquisition activity in 2005, 13 percent of it was from foreign firms acquiring U.S. firms. This is up from 9 percent almost 10 years before. This statistic shows that foreign investment in the U.S. is vital to the economy. Only through this legislation, will CFIUS have a formal budget, membership and clear mission--protecting American security while maintaining a free and growing economy. 
   In closing, let me thank my colleagues on the Financial Services Committee for their leadership on this legislation, especially my Democratic colleagues Representative Carolyn Maloney and Joseph Crowley of New York for their efforts.

<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. (CLOSE THE CONTRACTOR FRAUD LOOPHOLE ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5712, the ``Close the Contractor Fraud Loophole Act.'' 
   The name of this bill really says it all. Today, as I speak, there is a loophole in Government procurement regulations that allows some contractors to avoid reporting violations of Federal law or overpayments. 
   The privilege--and, yes, it's a privilege--of earning Federal dollars carries with it certain responsibilities. One of those responsibilities is to do your utmost to avoid fraud, violations of law, and overpayments. Now, I understand that many large contractors have thousands of employees, and sometimes there can be a bad apple. But when a contractor learns of such a bad apple, it is its responsibility to report what it learns to the Government, and to make the Government whole for any loss. 
   Today, most contractors working in the United States are required by regulation to do just this. But contractors working overseas, and a few here in the U.S., fall outside this simple, commonsense reporting requirement. 
   This is not right--contractors accepting Federal dollars should be treated the same, whether they are performing the work in the United States or overseas, and regardless of whether they are selling ``commercial items.'' 
   I want to commend Mr. Welch and Chairman Waxman for recognizing this problem, and for doing something about it. Now that they have acted, the administration says that this loophole was a ``bureaucratic mistake'' and should be closed. Yet, before Congress moved, the administration was curiously slow to do anything to address this ``mistake.'' 
   My committee has devoted a lot of time and energy to examining the Department of Homeland Security's contracting practices. What we have found is not always pretty. The Department is young, and has made some poor contracting decisions. But poor decisionmaking and the occasional inexperienced contracting officer is not a license for abuse, and it is incumbent on any contractor who discovers such abuse to report it. 
   I hope the administration makes good on its word and closes this loophole, but I'm mindful that it took congressional oversight and action to stir them into action. This is oversight at it best, and make no mistake, our oversight--of both the Government and the contractors themselves--will continue. I encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this rule. Every day the valiant men and women of the United States Coast Guard save lives and protect the welfare of our great country. And every day the Coast Guard lives its motto and stands always ready to help those in need.     
   Since the devastating attacks of September 11, 2001, the Coast Guard has taken on the enhancement role in homeland security. Yet the President has consistently submitted budgets that fail to give the Coast Guard adequate resources to execute all its missions. Now it's our turn to help them. 
   The legislation to be considered today, H.R. 2830, funds the Coast Guard at $8.4 billion, $200 million over the President's budget. It also increases the Coast Guard in strength to 47,000 by adding 1,500 new members. The bill authorizes additional maritime security response teams to provide anti-terrorism protection for strategic shipping, high-interest vessels, and other critical infrastructure. These teams are the Coast Guard's quick response force. They can be deployed rapidly anywhere in the Nation via air, ground, or sea to respond to changing threat conditions. 
   H.R. 2830, Mr. Speaker, also authorizes additional K-9 detection teams to detect explosives, drugs, and smuggled persons. 
   Additionally, this bill authorizes the Waterway Watch program, a nationwide initiative modeled after Neighborhood Watch programs, to allow fishermen, recreational boaters, and others who work or play on American waterways to notify the Coast Guard of suspicious activities. 
   Since 9/11, the Coast Guard has struggled to develop much-needed port security regulations, including those mandated by the Safe Ports Act, such as long-range vessel tracking and enhanced crew member identification. H.R. 2830 address this critical gap and others by creating a dedicated assistant commandant for port and waterway security to oversee port security measures. 
   With respect to liquefied gas terminals, the bill requires the Coast Guard to protect and enforce the security zones around all existing LNG facilities. Admiral Allen himself has acknowledged, Mr. Speaker, to Congress that when it comes to the proliferation of LNG facilities, he doesn't have the resources necessary to fulfill the Coast Guard's port security responsibilities.

H.R. 3033 mandates the establishment of a database that includes detailed information on civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings concluded against contractors and grant recipients by State and Federal governments; a listing, by contractor or grant recipient, of all contracts or grants that were terminated; any suspensions or debarments, or any agreement to resolve a suspension or debarment; any findings that the contractor or recipient is not a ``responsible'' source for Federal contracts. 
   As the great justice Louis Brandeis famously wrote, ``sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.'' H.R. 3033 will shed some sunlight on the contracting world. 
   This database will have myriad uses. Governments at all levels can turn to it when considering whether to award a contract or grant. Citizens can look to see how their tax dollars are being spent--and what steps are being taken to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. Job seekers can look up prospective employers to find out what kind of company they might work for. Companies can do a little due diligence about prospective customers or vendors. In this information age, there is simply no reason information such as this should not be available to all of us. 
   My committee oversees the Department of Homeland Security. It is still young, as are many of its contracting professionals. But even the ``old pros'' of the Department are new to homeland security contracting--because homeland security contracting itself is new. A database like this--that allows these officials to quickly examine the history of prospective, contractors--might have helped the Department avoid some of the contracting fiascos that have plagued it to date. I am hopeful it will help the Department pick the best contractors in the future. 
   I encourage all of my colleagues to support this important legislation.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, it's been 5 years since the Department of Homeland Security was established. November's election demonstrated that the Nation agreed with the Democrats' new direction for America. 
   In the movie A Few Good Men, Tom Cruise asked Jack Nicholson for the truth. Nicholson's response: You can't handle the truth. 
   Mr. Chairman, can the minority handle the truth? I submit to you today that the minority cannot, in fact, handle the truth. Mr. Chairman, the truth is that the minority can hear the heart of the American people no more than they could before November. 
   Truth is, Mr. Obey has made this process way more transparent than it was under the minority's watch. The truth is, we have much more of an efficient process. Most importantly, the truth is that there are no earmarks in this bill that we're debating here today. 
   The appropriations measure has been on the floor for 12 hours and still  counting. Eight motions for the committee to rise later, the minority continues to stifle progress, the minority continues to foster trivial debate to defer and deter us from our mission. 
   Perhaps the minority's not in touch with the interests of our Nation. The Nation is interested in leadership that remembers not to forget. The Nation is looking for leadership that remembers 9/11, leadership that remembers Katrina, leadership that realizes that there are still vulnerabilities that we need to address to prevent the next terrorist attack or natural disaster. 
   Chairman Price has showed leadership by addressing these issues in this bill, as my committee addressed in H.R. 1, 1401 and 1684. 
   We owe Department employees, we owe the Department's management, and we owe our great country the passage of this appropriations measure. 
   Mr. Chairman, I invite my colleagues in the majority to join me as chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee in passing a measure that brings us one step closer to protecting this Nation. 
   Homeland security is not a partisan issue. Mr. Chairman, it's an American issue. If we agree on that, then let's end this obstruction and pass this bill.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman giving me the time. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2638. This legislation goes a long way to meeting the Nation's homeland security needs. It also provides funding in a number of areas at the Department of Homeland Security that have repeatedly been shortchanged. 
   Specifically, the bill before us today provides DHS with $36.3 billion, a $2.1 billion increase over the President's request. Additionally, H.R. 2638 addresses many of the areas identified in the authorization bill that the Committee on Homeland Security developed. 
   The House overwhelmingly approved the authorization bill in early May. At the same time, it also is shaped by many of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, as well as programmatic changes called for in H.R. 1, legislation that I authored and that passed the House in January on a bipartisan basis.     
   For instance, this bill includes $78 million to double the amount of cargo screened on passenger aircraft. This would put TSA on the path of inspecting 100 percent of cargo, a key provision in H.R. 1. 
   Chairman Price is to be commended for producing a bill that makes the homeland more secure, especially given the tight budget constraints. We all know that to get border security right, we need to put more trained ``boots on the ground.'' H.R. 2638 provides funding for 3,000 additional Border Patrol agents to bring the number of agents to 17,819 by the end of the fiscal year. 
   It also makes some major enhancements to the operations of the Department. It mandates that all grants and contracts can only be used for projects that comply with Davis-Bacon. It also allows State and local governments to set chemical security rules that are stronger than those issued by the Federal Government. And it sets information protection standards for vulnerability and security plans for chemical facilities. 
   I support this bill and urge its passage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to announce my support for the COPS Improvements Act of 2007. Although the COPS Act was originally introduced in 1994, its reauthorization is a clear indication of this Congress' dedication to passing legislation with the intent of securing our streets and providing for first responders, all of whom are vital to securing our Nation. The COPS Improvements Act is a post-9/11 legislation implementing a homeland security policy, specifically in the areas of terrorism preparedness, intelligence gathering, interoperability and other concerns we have in our communities across America. 
   The Committee on Homeland Security supports the COPS Improvements Act authorizing $600 million per year to hire officers to engage in their communities across a variety of policing duties, including counter-terrorism. The Amtrak Police Department, whose officers are on the frontlines of transportation security, will be given the resources to hire and train officers to perform intelligence, anti-terror, and other homeland security duties protecting our railroads. 
   The COPS Improvements Act is also applauded by the Committee on Homeland Security for authorizing $350 million per year for COPS technology grants. Among the grants established, many were dedicated to the development of interoperable communication technologies. The improvement of interoperable communications is vital to homeland security. It ensures there is communications connectivity between and among civilian authorities, local first responders, and the National Guard in the wake of a national emergency. This is a vital lesson we have painfully learned in the aftermath of emergency responders facing a lack of centralized coordination during a terrorist attack such as 9/11. 
   The reauthorization of the COPS legislation is important to the protection of our citizens and from domestic and foreign threats. I, and the Committee on Homeland Security, promote the COPS Improvements Act of 2007 as it is legislation that assists in protecting all Americans. But, I want to be clear--the Committee on Homeland Security should work with my colleagues in other committees to ensure these grants are used for their intended purpose and do not somehow exceed their legislative bounds. I look forward to discussing this issue further with Chairman CONYERS and others. Terrorism is an issue we at the Committee take very seriously and believe the COPS Improvements Act can serve a vital role in reducing and responding to a possible terrorist event.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I would rise today in strong support of the underlying bill which reauthorizes one of the most effective agencies in the Department of Homeland Security. H.R. 4847 provides $70 million annually to the Fire Administration through 2012 to ensure long-term funding stability for this critical agency. 
   I would like to thank the gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Mitchell, and the chairman of the Science and Technology Committee, Mr. Gordon, for their leadership on this issue and for working with me to bring this legislation to the floor today. 
   Mr. Chairman, the statistics are sobering. Every year, over 100 firefighters die in the line of duty. In 2005, the National Fire Protection Association reported 3,675 civilian deaths, nearly 18,000 civilian fire injuries, and over $10 billion in direct losses due to fire. The United States Fire Administration plays a critical leadership role in leading local fire departments to dramatically reduce these numbers. 
   Mr. Chairman, I, along with all of the other speakers who have come before you in support of this legislation, encourage its passage.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, today I rise in support of the amendment offered by my good friend, a member of the Committee on Homeland Security, Mr. Pascrell. The gentleman from Paterson, New Jersey, is a leader on the committee and in Congress on first responder issues. 
   As a former volunteer firefighter and graduate of the Mississippi Fire Academy, I understand that many firefighters are unable to travel to the National Fire Academy's campus in Maryland to partake in training. The Fire Academy recognizes this need. By harnessing technology, the Fire Academy partners with existing local and State training academies to reach more first responders. 
   The Pascrell amendment addresses one key area of training: terrorism response training. Specifically, the amendment seeks to ensure that fire service personnel get training on response tactics and strategies for dealing with ``terrorist-caused national catastrophes and incidents that involve weapons of mass destruction.'' Such incidents can be very complex and require response from many public safety agencies across multiple jurisdictions. 
   Today, the Fire Academy has a terrorism curriculum in place. The Pascrell amendment will ensure this continuation. 
   It has been nearly 7 years since the attacks of 9/11, and, thankfully, we have not been attacked since. However, Mr. Chairman, the threat is still very real. As Members of Congress, it's our collective responsibility to ensure that responders in our communities are fully trained, equipped, and staffed to answer the question call. 
   Once again, I encourage my colleagues to support the Pascrell amendment as well as the underlying bill.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, as you know, the House has passed its own language as it relates to the issuance of the TWIC cards. We have negotiated for the last 2 months with our Senate colleagues and, for the most part, we have a bipartisan agreement on the issuance of the transportation security cards to convicted felons. 
   That agreement talks about many of the things my colleague referenced in the report. It talks about treason, it talks about sedition, it talks about espionage, all those things. 
   Therefore, I think carrying it to the level that my colleague would want to carry it is not in the spirit of the conference report that we are negotiating with our colleagues in the Senate. 
   It is bipartisan. We have been meeting for 2 months to craft a language. It's good language.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, for the record, I would like to say to my colleague from Tennessee, this bipartisan agreement was worked out in the spirit of making sure that those individuals who work in various capacities in high-risk areas, that they are, in fact, not security risks. So what we have done, we have taken espionage, we have taken sedition, we have taken treason, any felony crime of terrorism, crime involving a transportation security incident, improper transportation of hazardous material, unlawful possession, use, sale, distribution, manufacture, purchase, receipt, transfer, shipping, transporting, import, export, storage of or dealing with an explosive device, we have gone into great detail in defining those disqualifying areas. 
   In addition to that, we have laid out interim disqualifying criminal offenses that go toward unlawful possession, sale, manufacture, purchase, distribution of firearms; extortion, bribery, smuggling, immigration violations; distribution, possession with intent to distribute or importation of controlled substance; arson, kidnapping, rape, assault with intent to kill; robbery, conspiracy, fraudulent entry into a seaport, a violation of the Racketeering Influence and Corrupt Organization Act. Mr. Speaker, we have gone in great detail to list as many offenses as we could. 
   Now, from what I understand from the gentlelady's motion that we are debating, the only issue is that you don't want the Secretary of Homeland Security to have the ability to look at these things and say whether or not they should be modified. Now, if we are wrong in our interpretation, that is fine, but as we look upon what you have before us today, that is the only thing. 
   If we can't trust the people who run the Department to make certain administrative decisions, then who can we trust? And it is in this spirit that we left that particular modification language there for the Secretary to look at any unforeseen crime that may or may not have been excluded in this disqualifying criminal offense. 
   So clearly, Mr. Speaker, it was a bipartisan effort, and we wish to offer it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   We should not micromanage the Department of Homeland Security. We should let the Secretary of Homeland Security run the Department. He should have the administrative authority to do it. This would not be in the best interests of us. We do not do this in other secretarial departments. 
   And so, again, Mr. Speaker, in the interest of identifying crimes that are disqualifying, but notwithstanding the fact that the Secretary should have some discretion over running his or her Department regardless of what that Department may be, this is the bipartisan spirit in the conference that we reached.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 399, the bill naming the soon-to-be-constructed courthouse in Jackson, Mississippi, after attorney R. Jess Brown. 
   For most of those individuals here, I represent Jackson, Mississippi. I knew R. Jess Brown. Most of the African American attorneys in the State of Mississippi would not be there had it not been for R. Jess Brown's tenacity and perseverance to encourage other people to participate. 
   Both speakers have talked about his ability as a lawyer; but the one thing that I would like to share is, while he did not graduate from law school, when he was practicing, you could practice law if you could pass the bar. He taught himself law and ultimately became one of the great lawyers in our State. He represented James Meredith. He represented Medgar Evers. He represented teachers who were trying to get equity in pay. He represented other students trying to go to the University of Southern Mississippi, a number of schools. 
   But the good thing about R. Jess Brown, Mr. Speaker, he also was a teacher. He always had time for young people. He taught at Alcorn State University as well as Lanier High School at a time where practicing law was not as beneficial as it is perhaps now. 
   I am happy to join the support of H.R. 399, this bill nominating the soon-to-be-constructed courthouse after R. Jess Brown. 
   The Brown family in Jackson, Mississippi, is well known. The widow of attorney Brown will be quite pleased with this. Oftentimes we don't give flowers to people while they are living, but perhaps this legacy in naming this Federal courthouse after attorney R. Jess Brown is fitting and proper. 
   So R. Jess Brown, Mr. Speaker, will be remembered more than as a brilliant attorney and civil rights leader. He will be remembered as a great American. As such, it is very appropriate that the United States courthouse soon be built in Jackson, Mississippi, is designated the R. Jess Brown United States Courthouse.

<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. (INTEGRATED DEEPWATER PROGRAM REFORM ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, I stand in support of H.R. 2722 because I recognize the importance of the Integrated Deepwater Systems (Deepwater) program to our National security. 
   We need to replace our aging ships and aircraft that operate offshore to protect our borders. While this program has come under much scrutiny for being more expensive than previously thought and taking more time to complete, it is still a worthwhile endeavor. 
   Everyday, valiant members of the U.S. Coast Guard risk their lives to rescue and protect Americans. The continued success of this mission is dependent upon Coast Guard assets which are aging by the day. In the mid-1990s, the Coast Guard decided to replace all of these assets in a single procurement program--the Integrated Deepwater System program, typically referred to as Deepwater. The Coast Guard's plan was to set forth broad mission requirements and then rely on private contractors to determine the mix of assets necessary to carry out those missions. Ultimately, the contract went to ``Integrated Coast Guard System'' (ICGS), a consortium headed by Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. 
   Deepwater was intended to replace or modernize the approximately 90 ships and 200 Coast Guard aircraft used for missions taking place more than 50 miles offshore. The primary missions carried out in this ``deepwater'' zone are drug and migrant interdiction operations, search and rescue, homeland security, and fisheries law enforcement. Unfortunately, this program has been beset with problems. One part of the ICGS's Deepwater plan was to lengthen the Coast Guard's existing 110 foot patrol boats by 113 feet. Shortly after the first extended boat was delivered, cracks were found in its hull. The Coast Guard dry-docked the boats in December 2006 due to the lack of operational capacity in heavy seas. On February 14, 2007, the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General released a report concerning whistleblower allegations made against the 123-foot Coast Guard cutter program. The report found that aspects of the C4ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) equipment installed aboard the 123-foot cutters do not meet the design standards set forth in the Deepwater contract. 
   Specifically, the contractor did not install low smoke cabling aboard the 123-foot cutter, despite a Deepwater contract requirement. The intent of this requirement was to eliminate the polyvinyl chloride jacket encasing the cables, which for years produced toxic fumes and dense smoke during shipboard fire. 
   Additionally, the contractor installed C4ISR topside equipment aboard both the 123-foot cutters and prosecutors, which either did not comply or was not tested to ensure compliance with specific environmental performance requirements outlined in the Deepwater contract. On April 17, 2007, the Commandant of the Coast Guard announced the decommissioning of the entire 123-foot fleet. 
   Similarly, there are problems with the National Security Cutter. On January 23, 2007, the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General's Office released a report stating that ``the National Security Cutter, as designed and constructed, would not meet the performance specifications described in the original Deepwater contract.'' The report also states that ``The National Security Cutter's design and performance deficiencies are fundamentally the result of the Coast Guard's failure to exercise technical oversight over the design and construction of its Deepwater assets.'' 
   Furthermore, the Inspector General's Office found that ``since the deepwater contract was signed in June 2002, the combined cost of National Security Cutters 1 and 2 has increased from $517 million to approximately $775 million.'' The $775 estimate does not include costs to correct or mitigate the National Security Cutter's structural design deficiencies, additional labor and materials costs resulting from the effects of Hurricane Katrina, and the final costs of a $302 million Request for Equitable Adjustment (REA) that the Coast Guard is currently negotiating with the contractor. Finally, the report states that the Inspector General's Office ``encountered resistance'' from the Coast Guard and the contractor in its efforts to evaluate the structural design and performance issues associated with the cutter. 
   The IG's findings are very serious and I am deeply concerned about the Coast Guard's ability to manage the Deepwater program. Strict Congressional oversight on the part of the new Democratic Congress has forced the Coast Guard to make several significant changes to this much-needed program and continued oversight is needed. The Homeland Security Committee has already held one hearing on the Deepwater Program this year, and more are planned. 
   H.R. 2722 makes improvements to the Deepwater program that will refine the process and make it effective for protecting the homeland for decades to come. For instance this bill creates a process for the Coast Guard to become the lead systems integrator for the program, it opens up competition for procurements, requires the Coast Guard to provide life-cycle cost estimates, requires the appointment of a Chief Acquisitions Officer, establishes testing and certification requirements for Deepwater assets, provides design criteria for the National Security Cutter, and allows the Department of Homeland Security to work with the United States Navy. These changes to the program are necessary to make Deepwater an effective homeland security program.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 3 months ago the American people sent a resounding message for change. They voted for a new direction in Congress and new direction for the war in Iraq. 
   In solemn tribute to the sacrifices of the men and women of the Armed Forces in Mississippi's Second Congressional District who have served in Iraq and who have paid the ultimate sacrifice, I would like to recognize some of Mississippi's Second District heroes: 
   Staff Sergeant Kenneth Bradley. Hometown: Utica, Mississippi; 39 years old; died May 28, 2003, in Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
   Larry K. Brown. Hometown: Jackson, Mississippi; 22 years old; died April 5, 2003, in Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
   Rapheal S. Davis. Hometown: Tutwiler, Mississippi; 24 years of age; died December 2, 2003, in Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
   Captain Kermit O. Evans. Hollandale, Mississippi; 31 years old; died December 3, 2006, in Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
   Joshua S. Ladd. Port Gibson, Mississippi; 20 years old; died May 1, 2004, in Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
   Master Sergeant Brian McAnulty. Hometown: Vicksburg, Mississippi; 39 years of age; died December 11, 2006, in Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
   Staff Sergeant John McGee. Cary, Mississippi; age 36 years; died May 2, 2005, in Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
   Staff Sergeant Joe Wilson. Crystal Springs, Mississippi; 30 years of age; November 2, 2003, in Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
   Madam Speaker, the Department of Defense reports that as of February 15, 2007, 3,126 U.S. military servicemembers have died as a result of their service in Iraq. More than 25,000 have been wounded. 
   This bipartisan resolution before us today asks Members a straightforward question: Do you approve of the President's announced proposal on January 10, 2007, to deploy more than 20,000 additional United States combat troops to Iraq? 
   There is no question that the way forward in Iraq is one of our greatest challenges. The open debate offered here today allows us all an opportunity to express our sentiments on the administration's proposal. The sacrifices, dedication, and patriotism of our elite military and their families deserve no less. 
   I oppose the President's proposal. Until the President is willing to sit down with Congress and provide accurate data on what is really going on in this war, I cannot in good conscience support putting more men in harm's way. 
   This administration used bad intelligence to justify the rationale for war, and I fear that they are using bad judgment here today in their call for sending 25,000 more troops into harm's way. 
   The administration keeps calling this proposal a troop surge. Let us call it what it is. The proposal is a troop increase. Rather than a troop surge, what we need from this administration is a truth surge. The incompetence and misinformation that has gotten us into this mess is not the competence it will take to get us out. 
   The President and this administration must remain faithful and truthful to Congress and the American people by openly discussing appropriate measures to resolve the situation in Iraq that is worsening daily. The President must allow Congress to do what it was formed to do under the Constitution. His decision to continue in this direction is not democratic and, therefore, does not demonstrate the best example of what we are fighting for in Iraq. We must not allow the President to escalate the Iraq War without specific congressional approval. 
   Madam Speaker, we must send the President a message he cannot ignore. We must pass the Skelton-Lantos-Jones resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I would like to express my support for the House Amendments to Senate Amendment to H.R. 2764--State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2008, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008. Specifically, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight and clarify language included in Division E, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2008 regarding the Secure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate. 
   Farmers who use ammonium nitrate in agriculture production normally obtain their ammonium nitrate from a retail fertilizer dealership. Any retail fertilizer dealership that stores and sells ammonium nitrate would have to register under this legislation. The intent of this legislation is ``track and trace''--to provide law enforcement officials with the ability to know where ammonium nitrate is being stored and the establishment of a pre-screening process before a person can take possession of ammonium nitrate. 
   Retail fertilizer dealerships provide many services for farmers and one of those services is custom application. Many farmers that buy fertilizer never physically take possession of ammonium nitrate. The farmer purchases the services of the dealer who spreads the ammonium nitrate on the farmer's field. These custom application services can be provided by other businesses that would be subject to the registration requirements of the legislation. 
   In Mississippi and southeastern United States, nearly 90 percent of the 41,800 tons of ammonium nitrate purchased is applied by a fertilizer dealer or applicator company to the field. Only 10 percent of the ammonium nitrate fertilizer purchased in the southeastern United States is ever under the direct control and possession of the farm customer. 
   It is not the intent of this legislation to require individuals that use custom application services and do not take possession of ammonium nitrate to be subject to be registered. I believe this bill will enhance the security surrounding ammonium nitrate in agriculture and ammonium nitrate will be kept out of the hands of would-be terrorists. 
   I also ask that a letter submitted by The Fertilizer Institute (TFI), in support of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, be inserted in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
   Again, I support this legislation that reduces the risk that large quantities of ammonium nitrate could fall into the wrong hands while ensuring access for agriculture professionals and farmers who use this fertilizer for legitimate purposes.

   Inclusion of several National Guard provisions in H.R. 1585, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, sends a powerful message to our first military responders around the nation that we recognize their numerous contributions, many of which extend far beyond war fighting. As chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, I am heartened that this legislation provides resources to the Guard's needs here at home for missions relevant to homeland security and sustainability in our States. 
   Over the last 5 years, the Guard has nobly accepted and completed missions in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere abroad. True to form, Guardsmen and women from almost every State have sacrificed a great deal, including in some instances their lives, to stay true to the motto of ``always ready, always there.'' 
   Provisions in this legislation will provide $1 billion to address the strain on Guard and Reserve units in the States who are facing critical equipment shortages. For the first time, we will ensure that State Guard units are prepared for homeland security missions such as disaster response. Equally important is language in this bill that will encourage integration between the National Guard Bureau and other Defense components, such as Northern Command, who share responsibility for protecting the homeland. 
   In short, this legislation incorporates key recommendations from the Commission on the National Guard and Reserve. It takes us a step closer toward closing the gap between Guard units categorized as ready and Guard units resourced to be ready.

<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. (SMALL BUSINESS CONTRACTING PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3867, the Small Business Contracting Program Improvements Act. 
   I want to thank Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez for introducing this important legislation, and for all of her hard work in getting it to the floor today. 
   This bill is important to all Americans, because small business keeps this country working. 
   The Federal Government has numerous programs to assist America's small businesses, but problems remain, and H.R. 3867 addresses several of them. 
   In particular, I support the bill's efforts to crack down on large firms that masquerade as small businesses. 
   In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, we learned about a particular multinational corporation that listed itself as a small business and gained disaster recovery contracts set aside for small businesses. 
   When we checked further, we found that this firm had 17 divisions and had generated $4.5 billion in revenue in its North American operation alone. 
   That surely doesn't look like any small business I've ever seen. 
   Morever, we learned that this was not the first time that this multinational company had been awarded contracts that were set aside for small businesses. 
   In fact, another government agency had given them an award for outstanding ``small business performance''. 
   H.R. 3867 creates penalties for companies that misrepresent themselves as being owned by ``a service-disabled veteran.'' 
   This is a good first step at cracking down on companies that misrepresent themselves to improperly gain government contracts. 
   At the same time, the Small Business Administration needs to step up and do more. 
   SBA must full its responsibility to enforce the laws and allow small businesses the opportunities that Congress has said they should have. 
   Until the laws we pass are truly enforced, small business will never be able to fulfill their economic promise. 
   I urge my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. (CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS -- (House of Representatives - October 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Thank you very much. 
   Mr. Speaker, I join members of the Congressional Black Caucus, who have unanimously opposed the nomination of Leslie Southwick to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
   For the record, Mr. Speaker, the Fifth Circuit is composed of Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas. This circuit historically was one of those circuits that moved civil rights and voting rights issues in a manner that allowed all people representation. So what we've seen under the President's administration, we've seen this court move in the opposite direction. 
   As a resident of Mississippi and a representative for the Second Congressional District, we have yet to have a member of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals who is an African American. We have the highest population of any circuit in the State in the circuit; yet we are completely void of representation. 
   I don't have to go through the litany of problems we've had in Mississippi with respect to civil rights. As you know, and as so many know, Mr. Speaker, had it not been for the Federal court system, many of us would not be in elected office. Many of us would not hold positions of higher responsibility because our State denied African Americans, for a number of years, equal representation under law and denied that representation because of color. 
   And so what we have in the Southwick nomination, Mr. Speaker, is a continuing pattern of nominating people who have demonstrated racial insensitivity toward people of color. In the Richmond v. Mississippi Department of Human Services, a white employee was fired for using the phrase ``good ole nigger'' toward an African American coworker. When the white employee was fired, a hearing officer reinstated the employee. 
   In upholding the reinstatement, the majority, Mr. Speaker, which Judge Southwick joined, concluded that using the phrase ``good ole nigger'' was equivalent to calling the other employee her ``teacher's pet''. This opinion, I'm happy to say, Mr. Speaker, was unanimously reversed by the Mississippi Supreme Court. And this is our President's number one nominee for the Fifth Circuit, who says that it's all right to use the ``N'' word when referring to people of color because it's equivalent to being called the ``teacher's pet,'' or as he said in later words, ``a term of endearment.'' That's an insult. But it goes to the crux of the issue of whether or not the temperament of this gentleman, Leslie Southwick, fits promotion to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
   In addition to that, on another case, McWilliams v. Mississippi, when a prosecutor cites nonracial readiness for strikes. Davis v. Mississippi is another case. Judge Southwick denied the defense's warranted attempts to strike white jurors, even when the defense used the same nonracial reasons for strikes. Webb v. Mississippi. In other words, it's all right to strike black people from juries for nonracial reasons, but you can't strike white people from juries for nonracial reasons. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, we have a problem. This is the person under consideration this week by the United States Senate. I'm happy to say that the Congressional Black Caucus has taken up a number of issues this session, but the Southwick nomination really goes to the heart of why we are all here. We cannot put people on the bench for a lifetime job who demonstrate this kind of insensitivity.     
   So, Mr. Speaker, I am happy to join my colleagues with the Congressional Black Caucus in unanimously opposing the elevation of Judge Southwick to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. His nomination is not just an affront to people of color, but it is an affront to people of good will. That someone who demonstrated a lack of judicial temperament can actually be nominated and be given serious consideration by the United States Senate is beyond me. 
   But, again, I want to express my sincere opposition to the nomination of Leslie Southwick to the Mississippi Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Mississippi needs a nominee who will not look to discourage or impede its growth, but instead support and empower Mississippi's legacy. I appreciate my colleague from Ohio yielding me the time.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Well, the record will reflect, Mrs. Tubbs Jones, that at that hearing significant evidence was introduced as to the statistical probability of African Americans being nominated to the court. It was also introduced that the population of African Americans was the greatest in the State of Mississippi, that Mississippi had fewer individuals on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and has never had an African American on a court in its entire history from the State of Mississippi. So this is a golden opportunity, it was a golden opportunity for President Bush to do the right thing. But this was his third nominee for this one judgeship. Each of  the other individuals who he has nominated also had that judicial temperament and their qualifications questioned to the point that they were denied. 
   So what we have here is a third bite at an apple that really deserves reconsideration by the President. But since he did not choose to do so, I am committed, like the other members of the Congressional Black Caucus, to make our voices heard this week on the floor of the United States Senate with its colleagues there to say that this is not the America that we all want to be known for. 
   And so that issue, Mrs. Tubbs Jones, was thoroughly aired. I am disappointed that a letter from Judge Southwick swayed one member of the Judiciary Committee to change their vote. You know, we can all write letters. But in the record, we have opposing views from the Magnolia Bar, which is the African American Bar Association in the State of Mississippi, the Mississippi NAACP, a whole host of elected officials and others saying that this is not in the best interests going forth with this nomination. 
   So we believe that the record was complete and that a thorough airing of what is before that Judiciary Committee would have basically provided significant opposition to Judge Southwick. But, you know, this is politics. That letter changed the position of one member on the judiciary who did not talk to anybody from Mississippi, did not talk to anybody from California, did not talk to anybody who had an interest diametrically opposed to the person under consideration. They took a letter, read it into the Record, and made a decision as to a person saying, I will do better now that I understand that it is not proper to use the N word or that it is not proper to deny African Americans positions on juries just because they happen to be black. 
   Well, that is not enough in my book, nor the Congressional Black Caucus's book, to warrant a person being elevated to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Now, the reason I say that, to be honest with you, is that the majority of the voting rights and civil rights legislation that comes before the court generally comes from that circuit. So if you have someone who demonstrates time and time again that they lack the temperament, that they lack the judicial restraint to deal with cases relating to people of color, then that person should not be promoted to that position for which they are not made. So for that reason, I am happy to be here on behalf of those Members who serve the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in the United States House of Representatives. 
   We have, as you know, gone on record many times in writing opposing the nomination. We reiterated that opposition today in a letter when we found out that it would be considered sometime this week. So there is no question that people who represent individuals, more than 700,000 American citizens, in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals district are in opposition to it. And how one can take a letter from the person that is nominated and say that that one letter rises above those hundreds of thousands of people who have sent individuals to represent them here in Washington gets beyond me. But, again, we will continue to press the case. As you know, we are prepared to speak to the leadership before the issue is considered and do other things, because this is too big an issue for us not to give it our maximum effort.

<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. (MINNIE COX POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4010, legislation designating the United States Post Office located at 100 W. Percy Street in Indianola, Mississippi as the ``Minnie Cox United States Post Office''. 
   Minnie M. Geddings Cox was one of two daughters born to William and Mary Geddings of Lexington, Mississippi. She graduated from Fisk University and first taught school at the common schools in Lexington. Soon after, she married and assisted her husband, Wayne, when he was principal of the Indianola Colored Public School. 
   Minnie M. Geddings Cox, was appointed postmistress of Indianola, Mississippi in 1891, by President Benjamin Harrison, and was reappointed by President William McKinley; thereby, becoming the first Black postmistress of the United States. On January 25, 1900, President McKinley raised the rank of the Indianola Post Office from fourth class to third class and appointed Mrs. Cox for a full 4-year term. 
   However, in the fall of 1902, under the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt, a controversy brought national attention to Mrs. Cox. James K. Vardaman, running for governor, in 1902 used Minnie Cox as proof that African Americans had too much power, and that President Theodore Roosevelt was a Negrophile. Vardaman, who was indeed elected governor, called Theodore Roosevelt that ``coon-flavored miscegenationist in the White House.'' 
   Jim Crow Laws overran Reconstruction in America and whites wanted blacks eliminated from leadership positions. Mrs. Cox was threatened with violence by local whites, who held several mass or mob meetings to demand her removal (her term expired in 1904). The mayor and sheriff declined to protect her, and as a result of the increased tension and threats of physical harm, she resigned as postmaster, effective January 1, 1903, and left town for a time. 
   President Roosevelt believed Mrs. Cox had been wronged, and that the authority of the federal government was being compromised and refused to accept her resignation. Instead, he closed Indianola's post office on January 2, 1903, rerouted the mail to Greenville, MS, thirty miles away and Minnie Cox continued to receive her salary. For four hours in January 1903, the Indianola postal event was debated on the floor of the United States Senate, and appeared on the front pages of newspapers across the country. One year later, at the expiration of Mrs. Cox's term, in February 1904, the post office was reopened, but demoted in rank from third class to fourth class. 
   Minnie Cox and her husband Wayne W. Cox, who had been an employee in the railway mail service, returned to Indianola and organized the ``Delta Penny Savings Bank.'' They had been substantial property owners before 1903, and they bought more land and became successful bankers as well. Much of  the success of African-Americans is attributed to Wayne and Minnie Cox. Both descendants of parents who were former slaves, through their ability to penetrate barriers, promote progress, and instill pride as educators, bankers, entrepreneurs, real estate investors, and political activists, exemplify remarkable courage, wisdom and tenacity. 
   United in matrimony October 31, 1889, Wayne and Minnie Cox had one daughter, Ethel Grant Cox. The Coxes acquired thousands of acres of land and ranked among the wealthiest of the race in Mississippi. Their spacious home sat on some five acres of land in the white section of town. As premier supporters of the business enterprises of blacks in the state, they sold homes to hundreds of African Americans on terms that would not have been possible if they were dealing with people who had no interest in them. 
   Today, a street in Indianola named in their honor, Cox Street, bears their name. Also, the city's most popular park, Cox Park, located within minutes of the business district at Faisonia Avenue and West Gresham Street in Indianola, is named in their honor. Minnie Cox died in 1933. 
   Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to in strong support of this resolution and urge Congress to pass this legislation renaming the Post Office in Indianola, MS, after the first African-American postmistress, Mrs. Minnie Cox.

<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. (RECOGNIZING AND HONORING THE EMPLOYEES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to be here today to honor the employees of the Department of Homeland Security. Four years ago the Department came into being with the crucial mission of protecting and securing our homeland. 
   It has been a tough 4 years, and the importance of this mission has only grown with time. If you watch the news, you hear all the acronyms for the different parts of the Department--DHS, CBP, FEMA, ICE, FPS, TSA, and the list goes on. 
   I fear that this alphabet soup may hide the faces of the people who make up the many pieces of the Department. But the vital mission of these different components cannot be fulfilled without the people who make them up. For example, the U.S. Secret Service does not protect the President--Secret Service Agents protect the President. United States Customs and Border Protection does not protect our ports of entry, Customs and Border Protection officers do that. 
   The Border Patrol does not guard our border, Border Patrol Agents guard the border. The Coast Guard does not watch our shores and rescue our citizens, Coast Guard men and women do. I could go on, but the point is the same: It is not the ``Department'' that gives up family time to help secure our Nation. It is not the ``Department'' that works nights, weekends, and holidays. It is not the ``Department'' that puts its life on the line. It is the people of the Department who make these sacrifices. 
   Let's not forget that these everyday heroes I just mentioned can't do their jobs without the support personnel in their agencies and Directorates--the contracting officers, administrative assistants, technical support teams, financial managers, and many more. While these folks don't always get the best support and guidance from their management, that in no way diminishes their efforts and sacrifices. It pained me to see the recent Office of Personnel Management survey, in which the Department ranks last in terms of job satisfaction. For the sake of its employees--and for the security of our Nation--the Department's management must do better. I have been critical of the Department's management and some of its decisions in the past, and I'm sure I will be in the future. But no one should mistake my occasional criticism of the way this Department has been run with criticism for the fine men and women who are on the front lines, day after day. I pledge to the employees of the Department that the Committee on Homeland Security will not ignore this problem. We will do our part to see that things improve. We will work with the management of the Department when we can--but we will also give them a gentle push in the right direction when we need to. As Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, it is an honor for me to stand here today in support of this resolution. This Nation must never forget the lessons of 9/11 and Katrina. And it must never take for granted the men and women who go out every day with one purpose: to do their best, in ways small and large, to keep us all safe. I urge all the Members of the House to join me in honoring these everyday heroes.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule for H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007. I am also grateful to the Rules Committee and my colleague from Florida for offering this rule. 
   The bill passed out of the Committee on Homeland Security was a comprehensive bill. I know a number of my colleagues offered amendments, and I appreciate their interest. 
   I am also pleased the rule makes in order the manager's amendment I will be offering. This amendment was the result of extensive negotiations with my colleagues on the Oversight and Government Reform as well as Transportation Committees. Chairman Waxman assisted in perfecting the whistleblower protections in the bill. Chairman Oberstar worked with me on clarifying the roles and responsibilities of the Departments of Transportation and Homeland Security in this bill. 
   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I feel this is a good rule. It provides for sufficient debate on this important legislation. It also rules in order several amendments that deserve discussion and consideration by the House.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Three years ago this month, 10 explosions shook Madrid's commuter rail systems, killing 191 people and leaving thousands wounded. As Americans, we mourned the loss felt by Spain. We wondered whether terrorists would try the same here at home. Then we waited. 
   The next year, suicide bombers attacked the Tube in London. Last year, it was Mumbai. Last month, it was New Delhi. Each time we watched and waited. 
   Mr. Chairman, the time for wondering and waiting has come and gone. Today, we act. The Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007 makes clear that America simply will not wait for terrorists to attack our trains, buses and subways. We will act now to secure them. 
   A bipartisan bill, H.R. 1401, was passed unanimously out of the Committee on Homeland Security. This legislation goes a long way to protect our rail and mass transit systems so that we can move freely, yet securely, through our communities. 
   For example, it requires rail and public transportation systems to complete vulnerability assessments and security plans. It requires the Department of Homeland Security to finally develop a strategy for rail and transportation security. It strengthens intelligence and information-sharing efforts. It ensures that hardworking rail and public transportation employees are trained and on the lookout for security violations. It requires railroads to use the most secure routes to transport hazardous materials. It provides for much-needed R&D testing and technology in the rail and public transportation arena. 
   I am certain that bill is not without its naysayers. There are some that have and will continue to say that we can never secure these systems. I have heard many excuses from people in the past years. They say that the systems are too expensive, that the systems are too open, that we should only worry about aviation. 
   I say in response, if Congress does nothing and America is attacked, it will be our responsibility. We will deserve to be judged harshly for our inaction. Instead of waiting, let's do something right and protect the people we are here to serve. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.  
   Mr. Chairman, I submit these two letters, correspondence between myself and Mr. WAXMAN, chairman of the Committee on Oversight  and Government Reform, regarding H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007.

   Clearly, this legislation helps close the gap in terms of vulnerability. Those people who fly have been reasonably safe since 9/11. However, we clearly have vulnerabilities that we need to fix on the rail and public transit systems. So what this bill does is move us in that direction.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, as I noted earlier, H.R. 1401 is an important milestone in protecting our Nation's rail and public transportation systems. 
   Since its introduction, however, Chairman Oberstar and Chairman Waxman have worked with me to improve the bill and satisfy a number of concerns they had. I am proud that my colleagues and I were able to put aside jurisdictional squabbles that plagued our committees in the past two Congresses. By working together, we came up with compromise language that is good for the Nation and good for Congress. 
   I want to thank Chairman Waxman for the assistance he and his staff gave me on improving whistleblower protections for transportation workers. The manager's amendment strengthens the protections for Federal employees and contractors. 
   As revised, the protections more closely resemble those found in H.R. 985, the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act. Members may recall that H.R. 985 overwhelmingly passed the House 2 weeks ago. 
   I also have worked closely with Chairman Oberstar to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the Departments of Homeland Security and Transportation under this bill. The two agencies will have the same responsibilities established in the various laws, executive orders, and MOUs already governing their relationship. 
   Additionally, in order to improve efficiency, we will create a new relationship between the Departments to manage the rail, public transportation, and bus security grants created by this bill. For all three grants, the Homeland Security Department will be responsible for determining the requirements for recipients of grants, including application requirements; determining who receives the grants; determining the uses for the grant funds; and establishing priorities for uses of funds. 
   Transportation will be responsible for distributing grant funds to those recipients as directed by Homeland Security. Both agencies will jointly monitor and audit the use of grant funds. 
   I believe that this cooperative relationship will create efficiencies. Allowing Transportation to be the ``Western Union'' for grants is consistent with the recommendation of the American Public Transportation Association. 
   I am proud to have worked side by side with Chairman Oberstar to ensure that our Nation's security needs are met in an efficient and effective manner. 
   Since its creation in the 108th Congress, the Committee on Homeland Security has had to compete with other committees just to get things done. Good bills were stalled or held up too long because of jurisdictional squabbles. Not this Congress. I thank Chairman Oberstar for his help. By working together, I think we can demonstrate that the 110th Congress is a do-something Congress, not a Congress of competing jurisdictions. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment and make this a Congress that acts to better protect our rail and public transportation system.  
   Mr. Chairman, I enter the following for purposes of explaining my request for unanimous consent to correct a technical drafting error that resulted in the omission from the Manager's Amendment of two sections clearly referenced throughout the Manager's Amendment, specifically referred to below as sections 112A and 112B. 
   The two sections listed below are not essential to making this section of the underlying bill operative, but, while the bill and section are still operational, the bill would be further clarified if the following sections were included. I am disappointed that my unanimous consent request was objected to, apparently for mere partisan advantage. As such, at conference, I plan to work with Chairman Waxman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee to offer this language as it represents a compromise between myself and Chairman Waxman. I worked with Chairman Waxman to make the provisions of H.R. 1401 similar to those in H.R. 985, which is the bipartisan whistleblower protection bill that overwhelmingly passed the House on March 14. Below is the technical amendment that should have been made today:

<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. (RAIL AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I want to call to your attention a problem which has been slowly developing based on recent court cases, and why it is necessary for Congress to rectify the situation. Courts are ignoring congressional intent and leaving Americans injured by the negligence of the railroads without any remedies. 
   The Federal Rail Safety Act (FRSA) was enacted in 1970 to create a system of minimum safety standards to improve railroad safety and reduce accidents. Congress intended for these federal standards to be a floor, and expressly granted states the authority to pass stronger safety laws. 
   Now some courts are ignoring congressional intent and denying Americans grievously injured in railroad accidents their rights under state law, even when it is undisputed that the cause of the accident was the railroad's wrongdoing. By preempting state law, these courts are leaving injured Americans with no remedy at all--since FRSA itself does not provide a remedy or cause of action for victims. 
   The residents of Minot, North Dakota and others similarly injured should have their day in court. One only needs to look at the tragedy in Minot, North Dakota to see the impact of these court decisions on real people. On January 31, 2002, 31 railroad cars derailed near the city of Minot, North Dakota, releasing over 200,000 gallons of the deadly gas, anhydrous ammonia. The dense cloud of toxic fumes engulfed the town of Minot causing one death and injuring hundreds of people. If this tragedy had happened in a big city or even in the middle of the day (instead of 2:00 a.m.) countless more people would be killed or injured. 
   Among the various causes of the derailment was the failure of a so-called temporary joint bar that had been left in this substandard track for over 20 months. In addition, the track itself was old, worn out and poorly maintained--not even meeting the minimum standards under FRSA. The Canadian Pacific Railroad admitted that it was responsible for the derailment, but argued that it could not be held accountable because FRSA preempted state law claims. 
   The federal court dismissed the claims brought under state law on the basis of federal preemption, admitting that ``such a result is unduly harsh and leaves the Plaintiffs no remedy for this tragic accident.'' Mehl v. Canadian Pacific Railway, 417 F. Supp. 2d 1104, 1120 (D.N.D. 2006). 
   Unfortunately, this isn't a problem limited to one court. Court decisions in Minnesota and Massachusetts have left victims of negligence with no recourse for their injuries. See, e.g., Kalan Enterprises, LLC v BNSF Railway Co., 415 F. Supp. 2d 977 (D. Minn. 2006); Ouellette v. Union Tank Car Co., 902 F. Supp. 5 (D. Mass 1995). 
   Congress mut act now before more Americans lose their right to a remedy, and that is why we have chosen to add technical language to the Rail Security bill to alleviate this problem on a timely basis. Over 200 claims pending in Minnesota state court have been removed to federal court by Canadian Pacific. The railroad is arguing that all claims against it should be dismissed based on preemption under the FRSA. Oral argument on the railroad's motion to dismiss has been scheduled for May 15th so it's imperative to clarify that the FRSA does not preempt state remedies in order to prevent an additional travesty of justice. 
   The language would clarify that the purpose of the FRSA was and is to set uniform minimum safety standards, and that an expansive application of preemption to deprive accident victims' access to state remedies is a misapplication of the law.  
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the ayes appeared to have it.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, as you know, we just received the motion to recommit a few minutes ago, and if I could ask some questions of the ranking member about the motion to recommit, it would help. 
   You have the motion to recommit being retroactive back until November 20, 2006. Is there any reason for that date?

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Reclaiming my time, Madam Speaker, I think the issue is if individuals who were singled out, not charged with anything in violation of the law, then why shouldn't they be able to seek remedy in a court of law? 
   For the sake of discussion, Madam Speaker, all of us in this body don't look alike, and it is clear that people could be profiled because of their religion or their race.     
   I think the record is clear in this country that some people are profiled,  and I am wondering if people are profiled illegally, not charged with a criminal act. They absolutely should have the ability to seek redress in a court of law. 
   What I want to do is to say that there is nothing wrong with reporting in good faith, but when it is clear that we have not defined in a good-faith language in this motion to recommit what that is, then a number of people in this country could be singled out for various and sundry reasons. And what I am saying in this motion to recommit is it sets us up to start profiling against individuals regardless of religion, custom, or what have you. 
   If I am praying on a plane simply because I am afraid to fly, then I could be singled out in the eyes of someone else. So I am clear that this is speculative on people who look different; it is speculative on people who perhaps act differently. I am convinced that, knowing you, you have not proven on the committee to be a punitive person; and the reason I say that, Mr. Ranking Member, is we should not be singling people out for personal reasons. We need to catch bad people, but we need to make sure that we are not profiling those individuals because of how they look. I mean, this is America. This is the melting pot with a rainbow. 
   The point that I am making, while this motion to recommit might be well-intended, it has unintended consequences on a lot of people, people who, for religious or other reasons, might look different; and I think that the offerers of this motion to recommit should think about this. Because we are not a body or a country of just one people. And if you look at it, we should be tolerant, and tolerant doesn't mean singling people out or having them arrested for no apparent reason other than the fact that they look different. 
   Madam Speaker, I accept the motion to recommit.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 2830 is an important milestone in protecting our Nation's port and maritime security. It is the first bill to provide adequate resources to an agency that has been systematically underfunded for years. H.R. 2330 authorizes 1,500 additional Service Members, more Maritime Security Response Teams, more Canine Detection Teams, and the Waterway Watch program. 
   This bill was favorably reported by my committee on a bipartisan basis last fall. Representative King and I share a commitment to the Coast Guard. I am pleased that we were able to work together to give the Coast Guard the resources it needs. For too long, the Coast Guard has had to make do with aging assets that do not meet the challenges of a 9/11 world. The Coast Guard is actually still operating boats that were used during World War II. It is time that these boats were retired and newer assets brought into service. These boats, however, must work. 
   Unfortunately, the Coast Guard has accepted, under the Deepwater contract, boats that can't even float. That is unacceptable. The American public and the men and women of the Coast Guard deserve better. The Homeland Security Committee has added the Deepwater reform provisions during our markup to get this critical program back on course. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar and Chairman Cummings for displaying a willingness to work with me to bring this bill to the floor. I urge passage of this important legislation that will significantly improve the security of our Nation's maritime environment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I support H.R. 2830, not only for what it does to enhance port security, but also for what it does to get the Deepwater program back on course. As someone who cares about the Coast Guard, it has been disturbing to see the mismanagement of the Deepwater program. 
   This year, a $24 billion effort to modernize the Coast Guard's fleet has suffered delays, cost increases and design flaws that ultimately culminated in the idling of eight patrol boats. By the time that these problems were discovered by both the Inspector General of DHS and the Comptroller General, $88 million had been wasted. Both Federal watchdogs have said that program failures were due to the excessive leeway given the program contractors. 
   H.R. 2830 includes provisions that protect American taxpayers by forcing the Coast Guard to, for the first time, manage this contract. Regrettably, the administration in its Statement of Administration Policy denounced the Deepwater provision, which, incidentally, was approved by the House on a vote of 426-0 on July 23, 2007. We cannot allow the Coast Guard to continue on a poorly navigated course. H.R. 2830 will steer the Deepwater procurement process in the right direction. 
   Mr. Chairman, for this reason and dozens of others, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2830.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, we are here today considering this bill for one reason: To protect America from terrorism and from those who advocate hate and violence against our Nation and its values. 
   Let's be clear. The bill before us today does not contain Democratic or Republican ideas on how to protect our Nation. It contains American ideas. 
   Madam Speaker, it contains ideas formulated by the 9/11 Commission, a bipartisan group of Americans chosen for their wisdom, expertise and love of country; Americans who we tasked to tell us what happened on September 11,  2001, and how to avoid it happening again. That is why we are here today. 
   I hope my colleagues will put rhetoric and political games aside to do right by the American people, to do right by those whose lives were affected by 9/11, including those whose memories we honor. 
   I have heard and read a lot of excuses about fulfilling the recommendations, Madam Speaker. On one hand, many of my colleagues across the aisle have publicly said for months they already fulfilled the recommendations. 
   In the past week they have accused the Democratic leadership of presenting a bill that doesn't fulfill the recommendation and leaves gaps. 
   Madam Speaker, I am a bit baffled. Did the Republicans fulfill or not fulfill the recommendations? I think we all know the answer, and that is why we are here today. 
   To those who want to point out alleged gaps in the 9/11 bill, I say, we can do better than the past. Here is a chance for Congress to stop dragging its feet, to become the ``do something'' Congress. We can stand around complaining and pointing fingers, or we can finally do the job we are here and hired to do. 
   There is an old Irish proverb that says, ``You will never plow the field if you only turn it over in your mind.'' 
   Congress has spent 5 years turning over the 9/11 recommendations in its mind. On the topics covered by this legislation, we have seen bills introduced, amendments offered, hearings held, and investigative reports written. 
   Don't be fooled by those who say that this bill is moving too quickly. It has been 5 years since 9/11. It has been 3 years since the 9/11 Commission issued its report. 
   Now is the time, Mr. Speaker, to plow the field. Now is the time to act on the 9/11 recommendations. The 9/11 Commission has told us that we must provide Homeland Security grants to States and cities based on risk, not a pork barrel formula. This bill meets that recommendation. 
   The 9/11 Commission told us many more people could die after a terrorist attack or natural disaster if police, fire fighters and paramedics can't communicate with each other. 
   Today, we will create a dedicated grant program to ensure State and local first responders have communication systems that talk to one another. 
   The 9/11 commissioners told us that more than 5 years after the hijacked planes flew into our national landmarks, our aviation system is still not secure enough. 
   We still do not spend our money cost-effectively to screen checked baggage. Airport checkpoints are not equipped with the most modern technologies, like those needed to detect liquid explosives, and cargo that is stored under a passengers seat is still not adequately inspected. 
   This bill extends funding for advanced baggage screening and creates a novel new trust fund to strengthen checkpoint security. 
   Perhaps more importantly, Mr. Speaker, this bill requires TSA to create a system of inspections to ensure that 100 percent of the cargo shipped on passenger planes is screened within 3 years. 
   TSA will do this through a system that uses equipment, technology, canines, inspectors and other means to ensure that the level of security provided for air cargo is equivalent to the level of security for checked baggage. 
   This bill also requires all cargo containers carried on ships to be scanned and sealed before they leave for an American port. The scanning requirement in this bill are put in place within a reasonable time frame, 3 years for large ports and 5 years for smaller ports. 
   This bill takes other key steps to fulfill the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, such as strengthening critical infrastructure security and improving private sector preparedness. 
   Perhaps more importantly, this bill will create a strong independent Privacy and Civil Liberties Board. It will also strengthen the authority of privacy officers in Federal agencies. 
   We all know that securing our Nation will be of little use if we lose our way of life. Our commitment to privacy and individual freedom is in this process. 
   For too long, Mr. Speaker, many in this House have talked about strengthening Homeland Security. But they are unwilling to pay the necessary price or confront the waste and White House mismanagement. 
   Now is the time, Mr. Speaker, to put action into words. Supporting the 9/11 Commission Fulfillment Act today will do just that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of the time. 
   First of all, I would like to set a couple of things straight for the record. For my ranking member, these 9/11 recommendations are not cheap political tricks; they are very serious and things that we all take very seriously because of that. 
   With respect to the 100 percent port cargo screening, it says take the lessons learned from the pilots and then implement what you learned from the pilots, not go forward, like you say. 
   You talk about not bringing bills before the committee. You brought a fence bill straight to the floor without going through a subcommittee or a committee. 
   So I might say to my colleague, I look forward to working with him over the next 2 years on making sure that we keep America safe from bad people, but also that we are able to respond to natural disasters and other things. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is fitting and proper that this bill, the first bill voted upon by the new Congress, gets the record straight on the 9/11 Commission's report. We finished the job. Yesterday, former Vice Chair Lee Hamilton of the 9/11 Commission made it very clear why we are here today. 
   He said in his view, ``The terrorists are plotting today on how best to strike the United States. They will not wait, and it has been a source of very considerable frustration to the members of the 9/11 Commission that so many of our recommendations, which really are commonsense recommendations, like the ability of the first responders to communicate with one another, the allocation of funds on the basis of risk and not politics, and many other recommendations, are simply common sense. It has puzzled us and frustrated us that they have not been enacted into law.'' 
   Let us be very clear, Mr. Speaker, today's bill fixes these problems and fulfills many of the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. In short, as 9/11 Vice Chair Lee Hamilton said yesterday, if this bill is enacted, funded and implemented, the American people will be safer. 
   I urge support of the bill.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take the opportunity to make reference to the fact that H.R. 1 includes provisions in which the Judiciary Committee has a jurisdictional interest. Specifically, I am speaking of provisions that touch on the following aspects of the bill: the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center, the Fusion and Law Enforcement Education and Teaming Grant Program, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, the Federal Advisory Committee Act, and the treatment of detainees. 
   I appreciate the assistance of my colleague from Michigan, Mr. Conyers, in assuring the expedited consideration of this important legislation on the House floor, given his Committee's jurisdictional interest in the legislation. While it is important to note that I do not control the entire process, as there are other House Committees involved and the Senate will likely have its own positions on a variety of these issues, I am glad to work with the gentleman from Michigan and other Members of the Judiciary Committee as this legislation moves forward.

<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. (ALIEN SMUGGLING AND TERRORISM PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. I appreciate the yielding of the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Alien Smuggling and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007. 
   During consideration of the Homeland Security authorization bill earlier this month, I made a commitment to my colleagues that the House would  have the opportunity to vote on maritime smuggling legislation. I am pleased to have been able to work with the Judiciary and Transportation Committees to craft this critical homeland security legislation. It addresses not only alien smuggling at sea, but also alien smuggling by land and air. 
   Specifically, the Alien Smuggling and Terrorism Prevention Act includes tough new penalties for those who recruit, encourage, transport, or shield from detection aliens who cross our land, maritime, or air borders illegally. These enhanced penalties are essential to discouraging criminals from building tunnels in remote parts of the desert to smuggle aliens across our borders. 
   We know that the same people that smuggle drugs into our country are ready and willing to smuggle individuals who would do us harm. In fact, in January we learned of a plot to smuggle about 20 would-be terrorists into the United States from Mexico for $8,000 a head. The drug dealers called them ``Osama's guys.'' 
   The bill requires that interdicted smugglers and aliens be run against all available terrorist watch lists. This is an important step in protecting America from terrorists. 
   I would especially like to commend the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Hill) for authoring this commonsense enforcement legislation. He is to be commended for his commitment to border security. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for working together on this important legislation and urge all Members to give it their support.

<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. (PROMOTING ANTITERRORISM COOPERATION THROUGH TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE ACT -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 884, Promoting Antiterrorism Cooperation through Technology and Science Act, a bill considered in one form or another since the 108th Congress. 
   There is an old saying we tell school children: if at first you don't succeed, try, try again. 
   Although these words of encouragement may have originally applied to the grade school study of algebra or Latin, they are equally motivational to those of us serving in the 110th Congress. 
   I first raised the idea of this bill in January of 2005, soon after I became the ranking member. I know my Democratic colleagues had pushed for it in the 108th Congress at well. 
   Well, after years of trying, this Congress will succeed in sending this legislation to the President's desk. I know the other body will be taking up a similar provision attached to their bill seeking to fulfill the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. I am very pleased that they will soon join the House in passing this legislation. 
   Why is this bill so important? The answer lies in the nature of the terrorist threat. Terrorism is an international threat to the democratic way of life. Though we have experienced terrible tragedies of our own, terrorist attacks occur all over the world. 
   Terrorists have attacked buses in London; hotels in Israel; trains in Mumbai; embassies in Indonesia; resorts in Bali; and schools in Russia. As the global threat of terrorism is evident, so too is the solution to limiting those attacks. By promoting international cooperation, we will defeat the efforts of our enemies. Cooperation in developing antiterrorism technologies should be a top priority. The different challenges faced by our friends around the world have resulted in new approaches that the United  States should leverage to protect our citizens. 
   International cooperation is nothing new for our country. In fact, the United States has a history of productive scientific and technical collaborations with Israel, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and others. 
   The Department of Homeland Security has participated in some of these partnerships with foreign governments and other entities. 
   This legislation will encourage and strengthen those efforts and direct the Department to look for new partners beyond those we already have. This includes working with folks in the small business community who can bring exciting technologies to the table. 
   I am especially heartened that the bill will strengthen the means for protecting our Nation from exotic diseases. Active collaborations with scientists in Africa, where many of these diseases originate, should be promoted. This bill encourages that collaboration. 
   Too often, the United States presents a posture of unilateralism to the world. I hope that through programs like the ones authorized in this legislation, we encourage a more cooperative approach to fighting terrorism. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 884. I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5690 which ensures that African National Congress (ANC) members will no longer be denied visas to enter the United States solely based on their anti-Apartheid activities. 
   I am proud to have introduced this long-overdue legislation that will remedy a situation that was brought to my attention by my colleague, the gentlelady from the U.S. Virgin Islands, Dr. Christensen. A few months ago, Dr. Christensen informed me that Nelson Mandela, the South African civil rights icon that won 1993 Nobel Peace Prize, is not eligible for a visa to enter the U.S. because he is a member of the African National Congress. I was stunned. How could one of the giants of the 20th Century who is revered for bringing peace and reconciliation to a country that was torn apart by racism be ineligible to receive a standard visa to visit the United States? I quickly learned that the ANC, which was established in 1923 to advocate for the rights of black South Africans against the brutal Apartheid regime, was designated a ``terrorist organization'' by the same government that subjected black South Africans to racial segregation and violence. 
   For decades, ANC leaders, including President Mandela, withstood great hardships to overcome the oppression of Apartheid in South Africa, risking everything for basic principles of fairness and opportunity. By 1994, the ANC was the ruling party in South Africa, yet, some ANC leaders and members are still denied entry into America--today--solely because of their affiliation. H.R. 5690 will remedy this situation and ensure that these leaders  and members are no longer deemed to be inadmissible solely because of their membership in the ANC and their anti-apartheid activities. 
   I am pleased to have worked with my colleague on the Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Berman, to bring this timely legislation to the House floor. I urge all my colleagues to join me and pass this important bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 1429 which applauds the public servants at Department of Homeland Security for their outstanding dedication to securing our Nation. 
   More importantly, House Resolution 1429 encourages citizens to prepare themselves and their families to respond to emergencies--whether it is an act of terror, natural disaster and other crisis. 
   The Department of Homeland Security has partnered with over 1,700 organizations, including the American Red Cross, to promote September as the National Preparedness Month. 
   In fact, this is the 5th year that the Department of Homeland Security has observed September as the National Emergency Preparedness Month. 
   As a former volunteer firefighter, I know that lives are saved when the public takes steps to prepare for the worst. 
   Likewise, as the Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, I want the people of this Nation to take the necessary steps to prepare themselves in the event of an emergency. 
   Constituents should be encouraged to visit the following websites to get information on how to be prepared for different types of emergencies: www.ready.gov and www.redcross.org. 
   Among the Department's recommendations to help Americans prepare for emergencies are: 
   1. Get a Kit--Build a disaster supplies kit that includes enough supplies for each family member for three days and remember to check the kit every six months. Be sure that the kit includes water, food, medicine, batteries, flashlights, hygiene materials, blankets, etc. 
   2. Make a Plan--Every family should develop and communicate with each other their evacuation or sheltering plan. The plan should correspond to the school, work and community of every member of the family. All families are encouraged to practice this plan to ensure familiarity with evacuation or meeting routes, have cell phones charged and have a charger in the car. 
   It should be known that at times it may be easier to make a long-distance phone call than to call across town, so an out-of-town contact may be in a better position to communicate among separated family members. 
   Also every family should have a secure location of important documents such as, insurance papers, etc. 
   3. Be informed about the type of disasters or emergencies that may occur where you live, work and play and how they can affect you, your family and community. In other words do you live in a place prone to hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, etc? Every citizen should also learn about what to do in the event of a biological, chemical, explosive, nuclear or radiological attack. 
   It is important to identify how authorities will notify you and how you will get important information. 
   You should learn what you can do to prepare for that emergency as well as first aid, CPR and disaster training. 
   Consider sharing what you have learned with your family, neighbors and friends. 
   4. Get Involved--After preparing yourself and your family for possible emergencies by getting a kit, making a plan and being informed, take the next step and get involved in preparing your community. The American public should visit the www.citizencorps.com website to learn about how Citizen Corps brings together community, emergency and government leaders to involve community members in emergency preparedness, planning, mitigation, response and recovery. 
   More than 2,200 state, local, tribal and territorial governments in all 56 states and U.S. territories have formed Citizen Corps Councils, and every day new Councils are formed in communities around the country. 
   These Councils assist with outreach and educational efforts to the public; training and exercises that effectively integrate emergency responders, volunteers with a response role, and the general public; and volunteer programs that support emergency response services. 
   I conclude by asking my colleagues to adopt this resolution.

Res. 1150) expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the Transportation Security Administration should, in accordance with the congressional mandate provided for in the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, enhance security against terrorist attack and other security threats to our Nation's rail and mass transit lines, as amended.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure and I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1150 was introduced earlier this year by Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON-LEE. The resolution was marked up and adopted unanimously by the Subcommittee on Transportation Security and Infrastructure Protection on May 1. The full committee approved it unanimously on May 20. 
   I would like to congratulate Congresswoman Jackson-Lee who is both  the sponsor of the resolution and the subcommittee chairwoman. I strongly believe that this legislation fits well with the work that the committee has done on H.R. 1684, the DHS authorization bill that is pending before the Senate. As we approach the 1-year anniversary of H.R. 1, the Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007, there is much still to be done to secure rail and mass transit systems in the United States from the threat of terrorist attack. 
   Each weekday, 11.3 million passengers in 23 States use commuter heavy or light rail. History has shown that terrorists view rail and public transportation systems as attractive targets. In 2004, terrorist bombs tore through Madrid's rail system, killing and maiming hundreds of innocent commuters. Next month, of course, marks the third anniversary of the terrorist bombings of London's public transportation system. And just in the last 2 years, transportation systems in Mumbai, India, were attacked twice. 
   Since the 9/11 attacks, there has been justifiable attention paid to enhancing aviation security. However, the security needs for rail and public transportation have, at the same time, been largely neglected. Last year, we took steps toward ending the secondary status by passing H.R. 1. H.R. 1, now Public Law 110-53, includes wide-range surface transportation security provisions and authorizes $3.5 billion for transit security and $2 billion for rail security. 
   The legislation before us today, House Resolution 1150, renews the call for TSA to enhance security against terrorist attack and other security threats to our Nation's rail and mass transit lines. Specifically, it instructs TSA to strengthen security efforts towards rail lines, mass transit lines, and school transportation systems across the country. It also directs TSA to build on successful programs such as its canine detection and online learning programs, to expand the program's reach and to further strengthen transportation security across the country. TSA is uniquely positioned to be a leader in securing rail and mass transit systems from the threat of terrorism because of its experience in protecting commercial aviation. 
   Finally, I would note that House Resolution 1150 includes language authored by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Etheridge) that gives appropriate consideration to the security needs of school transportation systems. This resolution continues the effort by the Committee on Homeland Security to raise rail and mass transit security to the prominence it deserves. I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 1150. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   House Resolution 1150 sends the right message at the right time. It reminds TSA of the House's continued interest in seeing progress on securing our rail and mass transit systems. 
   Last year we took steps towards that goal by passing H.R. 1 legislation, that I was proud to author. That landmark Homeland Security law took a comprehensive approach to addressing the challenges of securing rail and mass transit, viewing it as a critical infrastructure that is essential to effective operations of our national economy. 
   Incidentally, with gas over $4 a gallon, America's reliance on these systems is only going to increase. Today I am proud to stand here and renew the call for meaningful progress and urge passage of H. Res. 1150. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of the resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Explosives remain the preferred weapon of choice for terrorists the world over. Explosives have been used against this Nation abroad and on American soil. Because explosives, be they military grade or homemade, improvised explosive devices are easy to obtain and use, the explosives threat needs a focused, coordinated approach. 
   In the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attack, a great deal of attention was paid to the emerging threats, such as chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons of mass destruction. At the same time, needed focus on the explosives threat has been lacking, despite the issuance of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 19, Combating Terrorist Use of Explosives in the United States, in February 2007. H.R. 4749, the National Bombing Prevention Act of 2008, will help fill this gap. 
   The legislation that the gentleman from Long Island (Mr. King) and I introduced was considered in committee in May. It was improved at full committee markup with the addition of some key amendments and reported unanimously by our committee. 
   This is a straightforward bipartisan bill. It establishes the Office of Bombing Prevention within the Office of Infrastructure Protection at the Department of Homeland Security. 
   As with other bills we have brought to the floor today, I strongly believe that this bill fits well with the priorities found in H.R. 1684, the DHS authorization bill that is pending before the Senate. 
   The Office of Bombing Prevention, in fact, already exists in the Department. This bill simply authorizes it and sets forth its responsibilities in law. The bill authorizes $10 million for FY 2009, a little over the administration's budget request. 
   For fiscal years 2010 through 2012, the bill authorizes $25 million annually. Then, for each subsequent fiscal year, such sums as may be necessary are provided. The Office is responsible for coordinating the government efforts to deter, detect, prevent, protect against and respond to terrorist explosive attacks in the United States. 
   To do so, the Office is required to conduct analysis of the Federal, State, local and tribal government capabilities and maintain a national database on the capabilities of bomb squads, explosive detection, canine teams, tactic teams and public safety dive teams around the Nation. 
   Additionally, the bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop and periodically update a national strategy to prevent and prepare for terrorist explosive attacks in the United States. A national strategy is also required under HSPD 19. 
   H.R. 4749 also authorizes the Office to support efforts, as well as research, into explosives detection and mitigation. An informed public is a prepared public. In this spirit, the bill directs the Office to develop and implement a public awareness campaign that can reach the private sector as well as ordinary citizens. 
   Finally, the bill ensures that we understand and enhance bomb detection through the proper training and use of canine detection units. For all these reasons, I encourage my colleagues to support this important legislation.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Madam Speaker, H.R. 4749 is important legislation that will ensure that we are positioned to address explosive threats at all levels of government. We know that explosives are all too often terrorists' weapons of choice. 
   Under HSPD-19, DHS is tasked with researching, identifying, and communicating ``lessons learned and best practices, concerning the use of explosives as a terrorist weapon'' to enhance ``the preparedness of Federal, State, local, territorial, and tribal government personnel to deter, prevent, detect, protect against, and respond to explosive attacks in the United States.'' 
   Passage of H.R. 4749 will put us on a path to enhance the Nation's terrorism response capability and ensure that first responders and first preventers have what they need. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this important homeland security measure.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, H.R. 2631, the Nuclear Forensics and Attribution Act, was introduced last year by the gentleman from California, Congressman Schiff. It was marked up and adopted unanimously by the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, and Science and Technology in October 2007. The full committee approved it unanimously on May 20 of this year. 
   I would like to congratulate Congressman Schiff and thank Subcommittee Chairman Langevin and Ranking Member McCaul for their work in getting the bill to the floor today. 
   Like the other homeland security measures we are considering today, I strongly believe that H.R. 2631 ties in with the DHS authorization legislation that the House approved last spring, H.R. 1684, and is still pending before the Senate. 
   We know that our enemies, both terrorists and rogue nations, are interested in developing and using nuclear and radiological weapons. In the case of an attempted or, heaven forbid, a successful nuclear or radiological attack, rapid attribution is critical. Our government must have the capability to quickly determine the source of nuclear material so that the key decision-makers have information needed to respond. 
   Certainly, if the terrorists know that we have a nuclear forensic capability that can pinpoint their role in creating a bomb, they're bound to have second thoughts. The deterrent effect of a robust nuclear forensic capability is enormous. 
   Unfortunately, today the U.S. must rely on expertise and technology developed during the Cold War to address the emerging threats of a nuclear ``dirty'' bomb. The nuclear weapons work force is aging, just as its mission has shifted from traditional deterrence policy to the more complicated challenge of containing the threats posed by terrorists and rogue nations. Our Nation's capability in the scientific fields of radiochemistry and geochemistry must be fostered to meet this new threat. This is the purpose of this bill. 
   H.R. 2631 expresses the sense of Congress that the President should pursue international agreements and develop protocols to share sensitive information needed to identify the source of a nuclear detonation. 
   It also tasks the Secretary of Homeland Security with the mission of developing methods to attribute nuclear and radiological material, both within the Department's Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, and in partnership with other Federal agencies. 
   The legislation, as amended in committee, emphasizes that development of a robust nuclear forensics capability depends chiefly on an expertly trained work force in this area, and provides support for educational programs relevant to nuclear forensics. 
   H.R. 2631 also authorizes the National Technical Nuclear Forensic Center, which will be responsible for providing centralized planning, assessment and integration of all Federal nuclear forensic activities; requires the Secretary to report annually to Congress on the Federal Government's efforts to enhance its nuclear forensic capability, including the status of work force development programs, and authorizes $30 million per year for the next 3 fiscal years for this effort. 
   H.R. 2631 continues this committee's practices of authorizing programs and offices within DHS that are of value to the agency's mission, so as to assure that the work can continue and progress can be achieved in the years to come. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 2631, the Nuclear Forensics and Attribution Act. I would like to pay tribute to Congressman ADAM SCHIFF, Subcommittee Chairman Langevin, and Ranking Member McCaul for the thoughtful approach taken on this critical Homeland Security concern. 
   The risk, vulnerability, and consequences of a nuclear bomb are significantly different than what we think of as a dirty bomb. While a nuclear bomb is most assuredly a weapon of mass destruction, a dirty bomb is at best a weapon of mass disruption. A dirty bomb may include some radioactive material, but if detonated, few people, if any, would die shortly after exposure. 
   In contrast, tens of thousands of people could potentially die from an explosion of a nuclear bomb. 
   We need a new Manhattan Project, one where we build a nuclear forensics capability and workforce that can address the myriad of nuclear threats that we face today. H.R. 2631 does just that. That is why, Madam Speaker, I urge passage of this important legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, as you heard, Ranking Member King is attending the services of Tim Russert. I would like to join my ranking member and other Members of Congress in expressing our sympathies to the family of Tim Russert.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4179, the Fair, Accurate, Secure and Timely Redress Act or FAST Redress Act was introduced last year by a relatively new member of the Homeland Security Committee, Congresswoman YVETTE CLARKE. Representative Clarke is to be commended for the yeoman's job she has done. 
   Everyone complains about the lack of sanity in the watch-listing process, but few have dared to wade into all the ins and outs of the system. Representative Clarke has done just that, and this legislation is the product of that thoughtful undertaking. 
   H.R. 4179 was marked up and approved on a bipartisan basis by the committees's Transportation Security and Infrastructure Protection Subcommittee in early May. On May 20, 2008, the bill was marked up and adopted unanimously by the full committee. 
   This legislation, like other Homeland Security Committee bills that will be considered today, builds on the solid provisions in H.R. 1684, the Department of Homeland Security authorization bill that has been pending in the Senate since May of 2007. 
   Certainly, the practice of watch-listing individuals plays an important role in identifying possible terrorist suspects.     
   It is important to keep in mind that the watch list is only as good as the information on it. Without accurate, complete and reliable information, the purpose of the watch list is frustrated, the database becomes unreliable, and misidentifications persist. 
   Getting the watch list fixed and reducing misidentifications is a particularly difficult challenge. To do so, all the intelligence and law enforcement components that populate the list would need to come together and agree to clean it up. Unfortunately, this has not happened. Therefore, redress is the only real recourse for an American who is repeatedly stopped or delayed at airports and border crossings because one is misidentified as a terrorist threat. 
   Presently, there is a redress process available at DHS. Since February 2007, over 32,000 Americans have sought redress through DHS Traveler and Redress Inquiry Program, also known as DHS TRIP. Each individual voluntarily provided personal information to establish their identity. When there is a determination that this person is not a  threat, their names are placed on a ``cleared list'' that is maintained by the Transportation Security Administration. 
   This cleared list is populated with names of individuals who have the same or similar name as someone on the ``no fly'' or ``selectee'' lists, but have proven that they are not the person on the list. The cleared list is then shared with only the airlines for screening purposes. 
   Under H.R. 4179, it will be shared throughout DHS and with other Federal agencies that use the terrorist watch list database. This would assure that individuals that go through the redress process are not stopped as potential terrorists by other Federal agencies. 
   Specifically, H.R. 4179 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish the Office of Appeals and Redress to provide a timely and fair redress process. The Office of Appeals and Redress is directed to maintain a ``comprehensive cleared list'' that contains the names of individuals who have been misidentified and have corrected erroneous information. 
   The comprehensive cleared list would be made available to other Federal, State, local and Tribal authorities and others that use the terrorist watch list or database to resolve misidentification. 
   The bill directs TSA, CBP, the Coast Guard and other DHS components to reference the comprehensive cleared list when assessing the security risk of an individual. This would assure that individuals like our esteemed colleague, the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. JOHN LEWIS, would not be repeatedly stopped or delayed or have to seek redress from components in the same Federal agency. 
   H.R. 4179 also authorizes the DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding with other Federal agencies to enhance the redress process. 
   Importantly, the measure includes protections to assure that personally identifiable information is handled in accordance with privacy laws. 
   Once enacted, individuals that go through the trouble of clearing their names will not have to repeat the exercise again and again and again. 
   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of every John Lewis and James Smith, I urge passage of this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, as you have heard, H.R. 4179 is a commonsense Homeland Security legislation that has broad support. Representative Clarke, as well as Chairwoman Jackson-Lee and Ranking Member Lungren, ought to be commended for working together to get this critical legislation to the floor. We all know that the terrorist watch list has its problems. In fact, most of us fly a few times a week and have heard firsthand stories about people missing flights because they were misidentified against the watch list. We need to fix the watch list. That effort is ongoing and needs to continue. But at the same time, we need to provide people with a meaningful remedy. 
   The FAST Redress Act does just that. That is why I'm proud to cosponsor this legislation authored by my esteemed colleague, Ms. Clarke.  
   I urge passage of this important legislation.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this measure, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, the Civil Air Patrol has been in existence for decades, providing assistance to governments at the Federal, State and local levels in times of need. 
   Civil Air Patrol was established in 1941, just days before the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. From that moment on, Civil Air Patrol has stood ready to supplement America's military operations. And over the years, it has shown itself to be a faithful partner to the Department of Defense. Therefore, it stands to reason that Civil Air Patrol could also partner with the Department of Homeland Security. 
   That is the thinking behind H.R. 1333 introduced by Representative CHARLIE DENT, a member of the Committee on Homeland Security. H.R. 1333 directs the Government Accountability Office to examine the capabilities of the Civil Air Patrol to support DHS's activities across the country. 
   The bill was unanimously adopted by the Subcommittee on Emergency Communications, Preparedness and Response on April 30. Then on May 20, the full committee approved H.R. 1333 unanimously. 
   Civil Air Patrol is a great example of how patriotic Americans can contribute to the security of this Nation and their communities. As someone who served as a volunteer firefighter, I appreciate that kind of dedication. There is no doubt in my mind that the Civil Air Patrol is a United States treasure. In fact, during any given year, the Civil Air Patrol is responsible for nearly 95 percent of Air Force-directed search and rescue missions. 
   This Government Accountability Office study, called for in this bill, will improve Congress' and the administration's understanding of how Civil Air Patrol can provide homeland security assistance. The GAO study will also help Congress assess whether the operational structure in place for coordination between the Civil Air Patrol and its government and non-profit partners is sufficient and optimal for the security of our Nation. 
   Additionally, the bill calls for GAO to report on the cost-effectiveness of using Civil Air Patrol assets for homeland security missions and help Congress understand whether the current mechanism for Federal agencies and States to request Civil Air Patrol support are adequate. 
   Finally, the bill directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to review and analyze GAO's study and report to Congress as to which GAO recommendations warrant further action. 
   I commend my colleague, Mr. Dent, and his partner in this endeavor, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency Communications, Preparedness and Response, Mr. Cuellar, for developing this thoughtful bill. I support H.R. 1333 and its underlying goals and urge passage. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 1333. I strongly believe that the GAO report required under H.R. 1333 will provide us with the information needed to reach the right decision on the question of whether a formal relationship between DHS and CAP will serve our Nation's homeland security interests. 
   Certainly, over the past 60 years, Civil Air Patrol has shown itself to be a faithful partner to the Department of Defense. It is conceivable that the Civil Air Patrol could contribute to border security, search and rescue and responsive activities at DHS. 
   Additionally, it would be interesting to know whether the Civil Air Patrol can provide emergency transport for sensitive medical materials. I would also be interested to know whether the Civil Air Patrol area reconnaissance and communications capability can enhance our border security and DHS's ability to have situational awareness of natural disasters and other manmade events. The GAO study called for in this bill will answer these core capability questions. 
   For this reason, I support H.R. 1333, and urge its passage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, last month I introduced H.R. 5982, the Biometric Enhancement for Airport Risk Reduction Act of 2008, also known as the BEAR Act. The bill was marked up and adopted unanimously by the House Committee on Homeland Security on May 20. 
   The Transportation Security Administration is responsible for securing 450 U.S. airports and employs approximately 50,000 people. It has a very important mission of keeping the traveling public safe from terrorist threats. But the question remains, what is TSA doing to increase security and still allow workers with unescorted access to sterile and secure areas of airports? And what mechanisms are in place to ensure that only the employees are allowed to access the airports' secure and sterile areas.  
   The BEAR Act addresses these concerns. It requires TSA to provide Congress and airport operators with a report on best practices for using biometrics at airports. 
   Last November, Federal law enforcement raided Chicago's O'Hare Airport and arrested 23 people for fraudulently securing badges that gave them unescorted access to sensitive airport locations. According to the charging affidavit, more than 100 temporary workers were found to be in possession of fraudulent badges. And the investigation revealed that the staffing agency that sponsored these workers told them that they needed identification, but it did not have to be legitimate. 
   Today, workers with unescorted access to these critical facilities go through background screening to get identification badges. This background screening includes checking against a terrorist watch list. While this is a necessary and important check, a worker's biometrics are not being captured in check against biographic information to establish the individual's identity. 
   Since the Chicago incident, there has been a growing international trend to incorporate biometric identifying credentials in airport IDs. Canada and the United Kingdom have already taken action to address the security risk at airports by using biometric identifying credentials for airport workers. 
   Although I recognize the ongoing work that TSA has been doing in the last year or so, it's time for them to consider moving forward. The BEAR Act will make this happen. 
   The bill promotes collaboration between TSA industry, labor, and other stakeholders to collectively develop and provide airports with a blueprint on how to make biometrics work for them. The BEAR Act, as amended, includes changes proposed by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and TSA to improve the bill, including clarifying that TSA should only conduct a risk-based study of Category 10 and Category 1 airports on a selected groups of airports, defining uniform biometric identified systems to make sure that TSA looks at systems that actually match individuals, not just cards, that have biometrics on them, recognizing and not tampering with TSA's ongoing efforts in the area of biometrics such as the TWIC program and other programs. 
   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5982. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this commonsense approach to studying how biometrics can be used to improve airport security. 
   I think it is important to make clear again, this bill does not create any new mandates on airports. This bill does not require airports to use biometric identifying systems. Instead, it only provides for a study of how biometrics could be used. 
   I strongly believe that strategic deployment of biometrics in the airport is a sensible part of any layered security plan for the airport environment. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation and make our airports safer.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5909, the Catching Operational Vulnerabilities by Ensuring Random Testing Act of 2008, or the COVERT Act of 2008, was introduced by Congresswoman Lowey of New York. 
   The COVERT Act of 2008 was introduced to eliminate the practice of giving advance notice to transportation security workers of covert tests before the tests happened. I want to thank Congresswoman Lowey and the other members of the Committee on Homeland Security for working together in a bipartisan manner to approve this measure unanimously. 
   I also want to thank the Transportation Security Administration for recognizing the need for this legislation and working with us to ensure that the bill accomplishes its goal without impeding the way in which TSA conducts its covert testing. 
   This legislation is vital to protecting the integrity of covert tests of transportation security systems. We know of at least three incidents where covert tests were compromised by individuals who inappropriately warned security officials. 
   This bill will prohibit individuals from providing advance notice of these important covert tests to any persons, unless authorized to do so by the Assistant Secretary of TSA, the Inspector General of DHS, or the Comptroller General of GAO. 
   Covert testing efforts by TSA, the DHS IG, and GAO have helped to increase the effectiveness of our transportation security systems by highlighting vulnerabilities and keeping the screening workforce on their toes. Any effort to compromise these important testing efforts, whether intentional or accidental, should not be tolerated by this Congress. 
   If we choose to ignore the problems of the past, we will provide future opportunities to compromise a worthy program intended to educate the workforce and benefit the security of our transportation security systems throughout the country. 
   I strongly encourage all my colleagues to support H.R. 5909, which complements the work the committee has done on H.R. 1684, the DHS authorization bill that is pending before the Senate.

We have already had three we know of. We must do our part to stop the next one from happening. We must do whatever we can to ensure that these tests remain covert and candid so we can truly evaluate our transportation security workers. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues as we move forward on this important legislation that will make our transportation systems more secure. I ask my colleagues to support this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise also to salute the two newest members of this committee for introducing this legislation. 
   This legislation, the Public Housing Disaster Relief Act of 2008, will strike section 9(k) of the U.S. Housing Act and clarify the funding structure of public housing authorities in the wake of disasters. 
   Just 2 weeks ago, the Financial Services Committee and Homeland Security Committee held a joint hearing to examine the housing conditions of individuals displaced by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. During this hearing, the testimony provided by the FEMA and HUD witnesses revealed that there is confusion between the two agencies over who is responsible for providing disaster recovery funds to public housing authorities that are damaged by disasters.     
   A number of public housing authorities received significant damage, Mr. Speaker, during Hurricane Katrina. But these housing authorities did not receive any funds from the 9(k) account because there simply were not any funds available. 
   Public housing authorities did receive some assistance from the Public Housing Capital Fund Emergency Needs Account, but the funds were quickly exhausted and left many housing authorities without the resources they needed to repair their units. 
   In total, Mr. Speaker, only $29 million was made available to the housing authorities along the gulf coast. If you are familiar with the degree of devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina and Rita, you know this was not enough. 
   H.R. 6276 will eliminate an account that has historically been underused and clarify the funding structure by making it clear to FEMA that public housing authorities are eligible for Stafford Act assistance. 
   I urge the passage of this important legislation, Mr. Speaker.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure, and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 2490 is an important milestone in protecting our Nation's maritime security. This bill authorizes a program that has been conducted by the Coast Guard since November of 2006. The Biometric Identification at Sea Pilot Project has allowed the Coast Guard to collect biometrics from individuals interdicted in the Caribbean to run them against terrorists and criminal data bases. 
   Under this program, the Coast Guard has collected biometric information from over 1,100 individuals, using state-of-the-art handheld scanners. As a result, over 250 individuals with criminal records have been identified, and 72 have been brought ashore for prosecution under U.S. laws. 
   This program breaks the cycle of migrants with criminal histories being returned to their country of origin without prosecution. It also has proven itself to be an effective partnership between the Coast Guard and Federal law enforcement. 
   I would note that these provisions also are carried on H.R. 2830, the FY 2009 U.S. Coast Guard Authorization, a measure that was approved by the House in April of 2008.     
   I am pleased that this is being considered today as one of the key provisions that we have included in our DHS authorization package. I urge passage of this important legislation, which will significantly improve the security of our Nation's maritime environment. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, first of all I would like to congratulate Mr. Bilirakis on what is a good bill. We enjoyed working with him on it. I look forward to working with him on future bills. 
   I support H.R. 2490, Mr. Speaker, because it breaks the cycle of migrants with criminal histories being returned to their country of origin without prosecution. This bill also requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to analyze the cost of expanding the biometrics program outside the Caribbean. 
   Every day, the United States Coast Guard men and women are valiantly protecting our Nation's 95,000 miles of shoreline with aging infrastructure. This legislation will provide them with the additional high-tech tools they so desperately need. 
   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2490. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and urge support of this legislation.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Keeping our Federal and critical infrastructure network secure is an issue of national security. The United States and its allies face a significant and growing threat to our information technology systems. The acquisition of our government's information by outsiders undermines our strength as a Nation. Over time the theft of critical information from government computers could cost the United States our advantage over our adversaries. 
   This legislation is the result of extensive oversight work undertaken by the chairman of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Science and Technology, Mr. Langevin. 
   An organization is only as strong as the integrity and reliability of the information that it keeps. H.R. 5983, a piece of the DHS authorization package, seeks to improve cybersecurity at DHS by ensuring that DHS's defenses of information systems are robust and by holding individuals at all levels accountable for mitigating vulnerabilities. 
   H.R. 5983, which was approved by voice vote in the committee, Mr. Speaker, is composed of five important provisions: 
   First, it establishes authorities and qualifications for the Chief Information Officer position at the Department. Through our oversight work, Mr. Speaker, we have observed how lack of an information security background can hamper the CIO's understanding and ultimately efforts to secure DHS' networks. 
   Second, the bill establishes specific operational security practices for the CIO, including a continuous real-time cyber incident response capability, network security architecture, and vulnerability assessments. These are fundamental elements for a comprehensive information security program. 
   Third, H.R. 5983 establishes testing protocols to reduce the number of vulnerability exploitations throughout the Department's networks. Time and again we have heard the current Federal information security requirements do not go far enough to actually ``operationalize'' security to reduce the number of successful attacks. Under H.R. 5983 security will be ``operationalized'' at DHS, a Federal agency that has a critical homeland security mission and is the receptacle of highly sensitive information. 
   Fourth, Mr. Speaker, the bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to determine if the internal security policy of a contractor who provides network services to DHS is consistent with the agency's requirements. This is a standard operating procedure for all private sector companies. It should be also for DHS as well. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, this bill seeks a formal report from the Secretary of Homeland Security on meeting the deadlines established by the Office of Management and Budget for Trusted Internet Connections, encryption and authentication mandates. These are critical for the Department's efforts to improve information security. It is unclear whether proper deadlines are being met. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support the Homeland Security Network Defense and Accountability Act of 2008.  
   House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,
   Washington, DC, July 24, 2008. Hon. Bennie G. Thompson, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Ford House Office Building, Washington, DC. 
   Dear Chairman Thompson: I am writing about H.R. 5983, the Homeland Security Network Defense and Accountability Act of 2008, which the Homeland Security Committee ordered reported to the House on June 26, 2008. 
   I appreciate your effort to consult with the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform regarding H.R. 5983. In particular, I appreciate your willingness to strike the provision of the bill addressing the Freedom of Information Act and for agreeing to add rule of construction with regard to application of the Federal Information Management Security Act (FISMA) to the Department of Homeland Security. 
   In the interest of expediting consideration of H.R. 5983, and in recognition of your efforts to address my concerns, the Oversight Committee will not request a sequential referral of this bill. I would, however, request your support for the appointment of conferees on the Oversight Committee should H.R. 5983 or a similar Senate bill be considered in conference with the Senate. 
   Moreover, I believe it is important to identify additional provisions in H.R. 5983 that are of particular concern to me. 
   Specifically, H.R. 5983 creates new responsibilities that might cause confusion with existing requirements under FISMA. Although these requirements do not necessarily contradict FISMA, I am concerned that when the Department seeks to implement these new requirements there may be uncertainty as to which law takes precedence. The unique set of requirements created in H.R. 5983 does not appear to align with current governmentwide requirements. 
   In addition, I am concerned that H.R. 5983 puts too much responsibility with the Department's Inspector General. In my view, primary responsibility for performance reviews and testing should reside with the Department. 
   Again, thank you for your efforts to address my concerns with H.R. 5983. Although I still have reservations about a few provisions, I look forward to working with you to resolve these matters and develop policies that benefit the federal government as a whole. 
   This letter should not be construed as a waiver of the Oversight Committee's legislative jurisdiction over subjects addressed in H.R. 5983 that fall within the jurisdiction of the Oversight Committee.  
   Please include our exchange of letters on this matter in the Homeland Security Committee Report on H.R. 5983 and in the Congressional Record during consideration of this legislation on the House floor. 
   Sincerely, 
   Henry A. Waxman, Chairman.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5983 is the product of extensive oversight by Chairman Langevin and the other members of the Emerging Threats, Science and Technology Subcommittee. 
   After hearing from hundreds of experts on how best to improve information security, reviewing best practices in the public and private sectors, and investigating cyber incidents across the public and private sectors, Chairman Langevin authored the Homeland Security Network Defense and Accountability Act. 
   H.R. 5983 will ensure that a qualified leader serves as the Chief Information Officer and has direction on what specific operational security practices should be implemented to make DHS's information security defenses robust.     
   This legislation seeks to make DHS the gold standard when it comes to information security. After all, Mr. Speaker, how can DHS legitimately be the lead Federal agency for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection when it doesn't have its own house in order.  
   I am pleased to include H.R. 5983 in the package of DHS authorization bills that the Committee on Homeland Security has approved on a bipartisan basis. I urge my colleagues to support me in passing this critical piece of legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5170, the Department of Homeland Security Component Privacy Officer Act of 2008. 
   The Department's Chief Privacy Officer was the first ever statutorily created Federal Privacy Officer. The creation of this Office served as the ``gold standard'' for other Federal agencies to follow. 
   Along those same lines, this bill advances the committee's authorization process by improving DHS and making it the first Federal agency to have statutorily created privacy officers in its component agencies. Hopefully, this will put the Department at the forefront of individual privacy protection. 
   Under the current structure, the Chief Privacy Officer has to rely on component agencies--such as TSA, Customs and Border Protection and FEMA--for information concerning programs and policy that impact privacy rights. Sometimes this information is shared, sometimes it's not. When it's not, the risk includes spending valuable taxpayer funds on programs that may become stalled or cancelled due to privacy concerns or missteps. 
   The component agencies are the pulse of the Department of Homeland Security. Most homeland security efforts stem from component agency actions. Privacy officers need to be where the action is happening, not waiting for a phone call after decisions have already been made. 
   Establishing privacy officers in the component agencies that make up the Department of Homeland Security is the first step in ensuring that privacy protections are in place at the beginning of the process. 
   Under the leadership of Management, Investigations and Oversight Subcommittee chairman, Mr. Carney, this legislation is informed by Government Accountability Office findings, internal discussions with the Department's Office of Privacy, and publications released by the DHS Chief Privacy Officer. 
   H.R. 5170 requires the component privacy officers to, among other things,  serve as the main point of contact between their component head and the DHS Chief Privacy Officer; draft and review Privacy Impact Assessments and Federal Register notices published by their component; monitor the component's compliance with all applicable Federal privacy laws and regulations; and conduct supervision of programs, regulations, policies, procedures or guidelines to ensure the component's protection of privacy. 
   As a result, Mr. Speaker, of the committee's oversight and its commitment to the authorization process, this bill would ensure that privacy considerations are integrated into the decision-making process at all of the DHS components. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation that is not only critical to privacy rights, but the security of our country as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, public trust in the Department's ability to protect personal privacy rights is abysmally low. 
   Recently, the Department's Inspector General determined that the Science and Technology Directorate's ADVISE program should be cancelled due to privacy concerns. This determination was made after the Department had spent $42 billion on the program. We also learned that the chief privacy officer was not brought into the process until almost 2 years after the system had been deployed. 
   This bill would put a privacy officer in the Science and Technology Directorate. Moreover, the Automated Targeting System, which is a Customs and Border Protection program, has been heavily criticized by privacy advocates. Again, this was a program that was operated for some time in the dark without proper safeguards and departmental oversight. Under this bill CBP would get a privacy officer too. 
   Quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, there has been a litany of DHS programs that have been cancelled, delayed, or discontinued due to privacy concerns. Almost all of these were the products of Department Component Agencies that do not have a privacy officer within their ranks. 
   H.R. 5170 will ensure that privacy protections and appropriate safeguards are part and parcel of how each component develops its policies and programs. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure, and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today to express my strong support for H.R. 5531, the Next Generation Radiation Screening Act of 2008, and I ask my colleagues to support this bill. I would like to congratulate Ranking Member King for offering this legislation. I thank him for continuing to work in a bipartisan manner in accepting some of our recommendations to improve the bill in his amendment in the nature of a substitute, which passed out of our committee unanimously. 
   This legislation reflects the committee's oversight of next generation radiation portal monitors. It fits well within our package of DHS authorization bills, since H.R. 5531 will greatly improve DHS's operational effectiveness in the areas of border and port security, domestic preparedness, and nuclear detection. 
   Specifically, H.R. 5531 will put in motion a plan to deploy next generation radiological detection technology at our ports of entry to help more effectively and more efficiently scan cargo as it enters the United States. Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups, as well as rogue nations, have made clear their plans to obtain fissile material and aspirations to detonate a radiological or nuclear device in the United States. 
   Events around the world continue to sharpen our focus on this growing threat. Just last year, it was reported that Pakistan was expanding its nuclear program, constructing new facilities capable of producing weapons grade plutonium. In November of last year, three men were arrested in Slovakia for illegally possessing highly enriched uranium. That same month, a coordinated attack took place in South Africa's most secretive nuclear facility, where a laptop containing sensitive information was stolen, only to be recovered during a shoot-out with guards. 
   It is imperative that we implement the best, most effective technology at our disposal to protect the American people from attack. This bipartisan legislation requires firm benchmarks for the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office to measure progress and to ensure that only the best technology is installed at our borders. 
   It also requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to clearly define what he considers a significant increase in operational effectiveness, the standard required by law to procure and deploy Advanced Spectroscopic Portals, or ASPs. 
   The Department expects to complete its certification this fall. H.R. 5531 will ensure the certification criteria are clearly laid out and quantified before a final decision is made. The bill also authorizes $40 million for the Securing the Cities Initiative, which my committee strongly supports. The initiative employs the concept of defense in-depth, and deploys an array of detection technologies, both stationary and mobile, throughout New York City, for added layers of security. 
   This initiative shows what is possible when Federal, State, and local authorities cooperate. Certainly, it is a model that can be replicated in other major U.S. cities. 
   H.R. 5531 will ensure that both the ASP program and the Securing the Cities Initiative are operationally effective and cost-effective too. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   In closing, I once again want to express my strong support for H.R. 5531, the Next Generation Radiation Screening Act of 2008. I again thank Ranking Member King for offering this legislation and for continuing to work in a bipartisan manner as we move legislation to make our country more secure. 
   This bill will help to ensure the state-of-the-art technology that allows our Customs and Border Protection officers to effectively and efficiently scan cargo is procured and deployed. This was the promise of the Advanced Spectroscopic Portal Monitors program. 
   We have to make sure that the ASP delivers and provides significant improvement of operational effectiveness. Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups are interested in attacking us with dirty bombs, and we must do everything we can to find and intercept these materials. That means looking for materials not just at our borders and ports, but inside the United States too, and that is why authorizing the Securing the Cities Initiative is so important. 
   I am proud to support this critical bill that also advances the important process of providing congressional input to improve the Department. H.R. 5531 represents an important step in protecting the country from nuclear terrorism, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Langevin. 
   Today I rise to support a bill that reaffirms our commitment to ensuring that safe and effective antiterrorism technologies are being deployed by the Department of Homeland Security. 
   This bill, offered by my colleague Mr. Langevin, will provide much-needed reforms to the SAFETY Act process within the Department. 
   In conducting oversight over the Department's implementation of the SAFETY Act over the last several years, it was apparent that there was several significant disconnections within the Department. 
   It became clear that the Office of SAFETY Act Implementation and the private sector were working on separate wavelengths. The right hand simply was not speaking to the left. 
   The private sector struggled to fulfill the lengthy paperwork requirements of the SAFETY Act, while the SAFETY Act office often seemed nonresponsive to private sector requests. 
   While the Department's adoption of final regulations this summer implementing the SAFETY Act appears to be an encouraging step forward, still more must be done to ensure that the government is being responsive to developments in the private sector. 
   This bill would require that the Secretary employ a sufficient number of analysts in the Office of SAFETY Act Implementation who can deal with the ever-growing number of applications. This will ensure that applications are being processed in a timely fashion to bring more technologies to the table earlier than ever. 
   Perhaps more importantly, this bill will also ensure the proper coordination between the Department's procurement and implementing offices and raise the awareness of SAFETY Act risk management provisions among procurement officers across Federal, State and local government, and throughout the private sector. 
   In order to generate revolutionary breakthroughs in antiterrorism technologies, the Department must actively promote awareness of SAFETY Act protections not only among private sector, but across government procurement agencies. This legislation will help achieve those goals. 
   I congratulate Mr. Langevin for offering this legislation and strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. We must enable the private sector to deliver the revolutionary, breakthrough technologies that will help win the Nation's fight against terrorism.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 954, honoring senior Border Patrol agent Luis A. Aguilar, who lost his life in the line of duty near Yuma, Arizona, on January 19, 2008. 
   I would also like to thank Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, a member of the Committee on Homeland Security, for introducing this important legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, on January 19, 2008, Agent Aguilar was working with fellow  Border Patrol agents to secure a suspected narcotics smuggler in the Imperial Sand Dunes Recreational Area when he was struck and killed by the suspected smuggler's vehicle as it fled into Mexico. 
   A native of El Paso, Texas, Agent Aguilar had been assigned to the Yuma Border Patrol station since joining the Border Patrol in July 2002. He was just 32 years old at the time of his death. 
   Agent Aguilar is survived by his wife, Erica; his children, Luis and Arianna; his father, Luis Aguilar, Sr.; his sister, Angie; and his Border Patrol brother, senior Border Patrol agent, Marco Antonio Aguilar. 
   Sadly, Mr. Speaker, Agent Aguilar's mother, Cecilia Silva, recently passed away after her son's tragic death. 
   We're here to honor Agent Aguilar, a young man who's made the ultimate sacrifice to protect the sovereign borders of the United States and make America more secure. 
   The mission of the U.S. Border Patrol is to control the nearly 6,000 miles of land border between ports of entry with Mexico and Canada, and the coastal waters around Florida and Puerto Rico. 
   The death of Agent Aguilar serves as a stark reminder of the risks our front-line agents and officers face each day as they serve as the guardians of our Nation's land borders. 
   As chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, I've been to the southern border on a number of occasions. I've witnessed firsthand the dedication of the men and women of the U.S. Border Patrol, often under difficult and dangerous conditions. They work long hours, often late into the night, in extreme heat and cold. 
   Like Agent Aguilar, they are our Nation's last line of defense against would-be terrorists, drug traffickers and others who would seek to enter this Nation illegally. Agent Aguilar's contribution to our Nation's security deserves this recognition. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring senior Border Patrol Agent Luis Aguilar in his service to our Nation, and offer my deepest condolences to the family. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. (FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND NATIONAL SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I stand here today as Chairman of the  Committee on Homeland Security in support of H.R. 556, the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007. This bill provides necessary reform by formalizing and streamlining the structure and duties of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, CFIUS. This reform combines an understanding of the need for ensuring that foreign investment in the U.S. is in the security interests of the American public with an appreciation for global commerce in the 21st century. Indeed, this bill addresses many of the concerns raised about CFIUS over the past year, especially with regard to its current lack of transparency and oversight. This bill rectifies these concerns by formally establishing CFIUS and its membership, while also streamlining how and when CFIUS review will be conducted. This bill sends an important message to the country and the world: The United States will continue to encourage the international flow of commerce in a manner that demands the security of our country. 
   Mr. Speaker, the bill formalizes the CFIUS membership and requires the following to serve: (1) Secretaries of Treasury, Homeland Security, Commerce, Defense, State, and Energy; (2) Attorney General; Director of National Intelligence (ex officio); and Secretary of Labor (ex officio); and (3) The heads of any other executive department, agency, or office, as the President determines appropriate, generally on a case-by-case basis. 
   Under this bill, CFIUS will conduct a review of any transaction by or with any foreign person which could result in the foreign control of any person engaged in interstate commerce in the U.S. to determine the effects of the transaction on the national security of the U.S. CFIUS will determine whether to conduct an investigation of the effects of the transaction on the national security of the U.S. if the initial review of the transaction results in the determination that: The transaction threatens to impair the national security of the U.S. and that the threat has not been mitigated during or prior to the review of the transaction; the transaction is a foreign government-controlled transaction; the transaction would result in control of any critical infrastructure of or within the U.S. by or on behalf of any foreign person, if CFIUS determines that the transaction could impair national security, and that such impairment to national security has not been mitigated by assurances provided to CFIUS; or 
   The lead agency recommends, and CFIUS concurs, that an investigation be undertaken. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that our colleagues in the Senate made remarkable contributions to this bill. For example, I think that its determination to eliminate the option for CFIUS to conduct a second 45-day review at the end of the investigation stage was a wise one. As a result of this change, CFIUS will be required to be efficient and will demonstrate our country's recognition of the importance of not hampering foreign investment that avoids hindering our national security. The Congressional Research Service's independent report, for instance, found that, for all the merger and acquisition activity in 2005, 13 percent of it was from foreign firms acquiring U.S. firms. This is up from 9 percent nearly 10 years before. This statistic shows that foreign investment in the U.S. is vital to our economy. 
   I must mention, however, my concern with one of the changes to the bill, as passed by my colleagues in the Senate, which eliminates an important role of the Secretary of Homeland Security. Both bills establish the Secretary of the Treasury as the Chairperson of CFIUS. Whereas the original House-passed bill required that the Secretaries of Homeland Security and Commerce be Vice Chairpersons of CFIUS, the current bill eliminates the Vice Chairpersons and, instead, calls for the Secretary of the Treasury to designate, as appropriate, a member or members of CFIUS to be the ``lead agency or agencies'' on behalf of CFIUS for each covered transaction, and for negotiating any mitigation agreements or other conditions necessary to protect national security. In addition, the lead agency or agencies will work on all matters related to the monitoring of the completed transaction. The ``lead agency'' role is particularly important because if the Secretary of the Treasury and the head of the lead agency jointly determine that a transaction will not impair the national security of the U.S. in certain cases, then an investigation will not be required. 
   The Department of Homeland Security has played a vital role with regard to CFIUS cases in the past and has an unparalleled institutional understanding of such cases. In its involvement with such cases, it represents the need to protect our homeland from attack and to ensure that our critical infrastructure is protected and available to the American public during, and in the aftermath of, an attack. In 2006, the Department was involved in each of the 113 CFIUS filings and, in 15 instances, the Department requested mitigation agreements. Thus far in 2007, the Department has been involved in each of the 80 filings and has requested five mitigation agreements. Furthermore, a large number of these filings regard the ownership of critical infrastructure, which is a major initiative of the Department. The Department's past involvement with CFIUS and its mission to protect our country only underscores its need to be second to none when CFIUS reviews cases. That the Department no longer has a clearly articulated leadership role in this process negates its understanding of such matters and undercuts a developing expertise of this new Department. Once this bill is enacted into law, I hope that the Secretary of the Treasury will appoint the Department of Homeland Security as one of the lead agencies in all CFIUS cases, unless there is an explicit reason to do otherwise. The need to protect our homeland is too vital--and the Department's role therein too intrinsic--for it to be left without a leadership position in all CFIUS filings. 
   This bill, nevertheless, brings the necessary reform to the CFIUS process. Incidents such as Dubai Ports World and China National Offshore Oil Corporation's attempted bid for control of an oil company, Unocal, raised an increased awareness regarding transactions that should receive CFIUS review. Importantly, though, this bill does not represent an isolationist reaction to these incidents but, instead, balances the need for continued foreign investment in the U.S. with the need to review that investment's impact on national security and our critical infrastructure. 
   Only through this legislation will CFIUS have a formal budget, membership, and a clear mission--protecting American security while maintaining a free and growing economy. 
   In closing, let me thank my colleagues on the Financial Services Committee for their leadership on this legislation, especially my Democratic colleagues Chairman FRANK as well as Representative CAROLYN MALONEY and Representative JOSEPH CROWLEY  of New York. I would also like to thank my colleagues in the Senate. 
   I encourage my colleagues to pass this legislation with strong bipartisan support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for her gracious 5 minutes to talk on this rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule. The Committee on Homeland Security is the only committee explicitly charged with overseeing the Department's organization and administration. 
   We don't take this responsibility lightly. This Congress, we have held dozens of oversight hearings. The topics of each hearing may have been different, but the basic message from the Department was pretty much the same: 
   Don't blame us for not having our House in order. We have high turnover. We don't have a headquarters. We don't have the authorities we need to be a leader on issues such as bio-preparedness and cybersecurity. We don't have the authorities we need to integrate 22 agencies into one competent unit. 
   H.R. 1684 takes away all the excuses. Under this bill, the Department is provided the resources, accountability and authority needed to finally become the Federal agency that Congress envisioned and the American people deserve. 
   Every day, we get another reminder of the urgent nature of the homeland security mission. Just yesterday, we learned that six individuals are in custody on charges of plotting to attack the U.S. Army base at Fort Dix. We don't need to have the luxury of giving DHS time to step up to the challenges of becoming a functional organization. 
   I introduced, Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill with Ranking Member King. The full committee, by recorded vote of 26-0, voted to order it favorably to the House. 
   I am pleased that the Rules Committee is allowing so many amendments to be considered today. I look forward to an active debate and the opportunity to present my manager's amendment. The manager's amendment is a product of discussion with other Members of the House and other House committees who have jurisdictional interest in aspects of this legislation. 
   I'm very pleased to bring this bill to the floor for consideration by the full House. Today, Members of the House of Representatives will have an opportunity to do something they have not been able to do in 2 years. They will get to cast a vote in favor of authorizing the Department of Homeland Security. 
   What's more, Mr. Speaker, they will get to vote to restore funding to critical first-responder programs that the President's budget would eliminate or severely cut. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and on the underlying bill.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I also yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, today we are considering H.R. 1684. This bill takes important steps to build capacity, provide resources, and ensure accountability at the Department of Homeland Security. 
   H.R. 1684 authorizes $39.8 billion in appropriations for the Department. This is $2.1 billion more than the President requested in his budget earlier this year. This bill sends a message to the President, America's security cannot be done on the cheap. Congress will not stand by as he cuts programs that help our hometown heroes protect our communities. 
   In this bill, we reinstate critical funding for first responder programs like the State Homeland Security grant program and FIRE Act grants. 
   In addition to authorizing funds, H.R. 1684 addresses issues that some of the committee's oversight efforts have exposed. For example, it has become obvious to us that the Department has no long-term vision. We created a Directorate of Policy to do just that. This office will also focus on private-sector partnerships, tribal security, and school security. 
   As another tool to help the Department get its house in order, we created a Comprehensive Homeland Security Review. This legislation also strengthens interagency coordination and supports integrating DHS at a single headquarters. 
   The Inspector General, GAO and the committee have all observed that DHS is spending a lot of money with little accountability. In the past few years, we have seen ice trucks take the scenic routes to disasters, trailers rotting in Arkansas, and border cameras packed away in warehouses. All of this waste was on the taxpayers' dime. No more. H.R. 1684 gives the Inspector General sharper teeth to investigate disaster response and border security programs. 
   The bill strengthens the integrity in the agency's contracting practices and promotes small business opportunities. This bill makes sure our Homeland Security agency is buying its uniforms and equipment here at home from U.S. sources. H.R. 1684 covers numerous other areas, including biosecurity, intelligence and cyber security. 
   Mr. Chairman, this bill is part of the real deal. It's the sixth Homeland Security bill that Democrats have brought to the floor since January. Only two bills made it to the floor last year in a Republican-led House. This Congress, we passed a 9/11 bill; and staff discussions have begun in preparation for a Member conference. We also passed bills on rail security, Homeland Security technology, international cooperation, and employee morale. 
   Winston Churchill once said, ``The pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity. The optimist sees opportunity in every difficulty. `` 
   In H.R. 1684, we have an opportunity to protect our homeland. We can be naysayers and complain about bureaucratic bungling, or we can tackle head on the difficult issues of Homeland Security. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill that puts DHS on the path to becoming the agency that Congress envisioned and the American people deserve. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of the time for closing. 
   First of all, let me pay tribute to my colleague from New York, Ranking Member King. We have worked very well on this bill. This is the first time that we have done an authorization bill before an appropriation bill. We are trying to establish jurisdiction for this committee going forward. This is the first Democratic effort in that direction. 
   Some of us would have preferred a broader bill, but my colleague understands that, given the nature of Congress and the nature of how we do business, sometimes that's not practical. 
   What I did was brought, through this manager's amendment, which you will see after this debate, a bill that we all have agreement on, even the chairmen of the various communities of jurisdiction. So I am committed, just like the ranking member and most Members in Congress, to support the Department of Homeland Security, to make sure that we defend ourselves against terrorists abroad as well as terrorists at home, to make sure that we respond to disasters regardless of what nature they come in. But in order to do that, we need a robust organization. We need someone with accountability. This bill, H.R. 1684, builds on that. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``aye'' on H.R. 1684.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, my manager's amendment strengthens H.R. 1684 by adding some things and taking out some others. Ninety-two percent of the provisions that I am seeking to have removed were items offered for the first time in the committee's mark-up. They were good ideas, but we haven't had the benefit of giving these novel ideas the full consideration they deserve. 
   After the mark-up, I had the opportunity to speak with a number of chairs who had a shared interest in these items. Collaboration is a wonderful thing, Mr. Chairman. In some cases, they offered suggestions to make the bill better. Those changes are contained in this amendment. In other cases, they offered to work together on these issues and other legislative vehicles. So, as a testament to the collaborative spirit of this majority, I offer this amendment. 
   I am well aware that some of my Republican colleagues are complaining about what my amendment does. I am reminded of what LBJ once told an audience: ``Perhaps you can help. Don't just complain, develop a better doctrine.'' This Congress, we're developing a better doctrine. 
   It is important to look at this milestone in context. Let me provide a little lesson on the Committee of Homeland Security's history. 
   In 2003, the year the committee was created, then Chairman Chris Cox failed to put forth an authorization bill. 
   In 2004, Chairman Cox scheduled his first markup of an authorization bill but barely got half the committee Republicans to show up. Outnumbered by Democrats, the markup was cancelled after opening statements. Even if the markup had proceeded, it was still 2 months late, as the appropriations bill had passed a month earlier. 
   In 2005, Mr. Cox was still a day late and a dollar short in getting the bill passed through the House. The appropriation bill still came first. 
   In 2006, the committee took two steps back. My colleague from New York didn't even mark up an authorization bill until late July, a month and a half after the appropriation bill passed the House. His bill never even went to the floor for a vote. Come on, now. We've all learned Legislation 101, that Congress first authorizes, then appropriates. 
   Today, under Democratic leadership, we are considering a timely, thorough and thoughtful authorization bill that has the input of numerous committees. 
   This is the earliest a Homeland Security authorization bill has ever appeared on the floor. It also bears mention that it is on the floor before the appropriations bill. America is not interested in congressional infighting but in getting the job done. We are doing just that. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support my manager's amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. For the purpose of support only, I am in support of Mr. Royce's amendment. The database created by Interpol has proven to be very, very successful. The Swiss presently use the database provided by Interpol. They stop some 100 persons entering into that country per month. For the life of me, I cannot understand why CBP will not use it. 
   It is a commonsense amendment. I trust the Department, once we approve  it and ultimately pass the legislation, will follow the directions of Congress. 
   So I support the Royce amendment in its present form.  
   Imposters who would do us harm prize fraudulent passports as a way to gain entry into our country under false identities in order to carry out criminal or terrorist activities. 
   INTERPOL has created a ``Stolen and Lost Travel Document'' (SLTD) database to provide valuable and timely information about passports reported lost or stolen to database users in order to intercept imposters and assist law enforcement. 
   In the last couple of years, INTERPOL has populated its SLTD database with millions of passport numbers that were reported lost or stolen. 
   Receiving real-time reporting of lost and stolen passports would allow us to detect these imposters and prevent their entry into the U.S. 
   Other countries that use INTERPOL's SLTD database have been successful in intercepting imposters. 
   For example, the Swiss, have been stopping over 100 attempted entries per month using fraudulent passports since December 2005 on the basis of the real-time information INTERPOL has provided. 
   Yet, at U.S. Ports of Entry, Customs and Border Protection inspectors do not yet have access to INTERPOL's database at primary inspection, so this valuable anti-terrorism tool remains unavailable for screening persons trying to enter the U. S. 
   This amendment would require CBP to provide its inspectors access to INTERPOL's SLTD database at primary inspection within one year. 
   CBP has already declared that that it intends to implement use of INTERPOL's SLTD database as soon as possible; this amendment will ensure this takes place. 
   Support the Royce Amendment.

   CBP has not re-issued a new notice, and the questions that I and many others have about ATS have not yet been answered. Until a new notice is released, I consider this program and this motion to recommit premature and the program itself highly questionable. 
   The amount of information collected by ATS and the fact that the information remains in the system for up to 40 years is reason enough to warrant a closer look.

<DOCNO>Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege, as the first Democratic chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, to rise in strong support of this rule and the underlying bill. 
   At the direction of the Speaker, I authored H.R. 1, legislation to complete the unfinished business of the 9/11 Commission. It had 200 original cosponsors. 
   H.R. 1 was the first bill of the 110th Congress. It passed the House by a vote of 299-128; 32 House conferees on a bipartisan basis, including Ranking Member King, signed the conference report. Late last night the Senate passed it by a vote of 85-8. 
   It would seem that 6 years after the 9/11 attacks and 3 years after the release of the 9/11 Commission report, Congress is finally embracing what the 9/11 families have been saying all along. It takes more than vigilance for our Nation to be more secure against the threat of terrorism. It takes a willingness to do things a different way. 
   The 9/11 Commission challenged the administration, Congress and the American people to think a different way and take concrete steps to deter and prevent future attacks. Over the past 3 years, some progress has been made, most notably, the reforms in the intelligence community. However, until today, many of the key recommendations of the 9/11 Commission remain unfulfilled. 
   The conference report on H.R. 1 ensures that most grant funding is allocated based on risk. It authorizes $1.6 billion for an interoperability grant program to improve communications for first responders. It provides over $4 billion in rail, mass transit and bus security grants to ensure that our at-risk communities have the security they deserve. 
   Additionally, the conference report on H.R. 1 puts in achievable benchmarks for ensuring that 100 percent cargo carried on passenger planes is screened. It also mandates the screening of all U.S.-bound ships in foreign ports for 5 years, but gives the Homeland Security Secretary flexibility to delay implementation in certain cases. 
   The conference report requires a new electronic travel authorization system to screen visitors from companies participating in the Visa Waiver Program. This bill also strengthens a board that oversees privacy and civil liberties issues.  
   It requires the President and Congress to publicly disclose total spending requested and approved for the intelligence community for 2 years. The bill provides civil immunity to those in good faith who report suspicious activities that threaten the safety and security of passengers on the transportation system, or that could be an act of terrorism. 
   Before I yield back, I want to say on the record that the provisions I authored to give TSA screeners collective bargaining rights and whistle-blower protections was not included in the final bill. Though not an explicit 9/11 Commission recommendation, I believe that giving voice to the eyes and ears in the airports will make America more secure. I will keep working to get them the protections they deserve. 
   That said, the bill that is being considered today will make America more secure. 
   I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule, as well as the underlying bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, it is indeed historic, this conference report we have before us at this point.  
   Almost 3 years ago, 10 American patriots came forward and spoke with one unified bipartisan voice. What they said in their 567-page report fundamentally changed America's views of its security. Quite simply, Mr. Speaker, the 9/11 Commission did its job and told us what must be done to deter and prevent future terrorist attacks on our Nation. 
   When Congress didn't do its job to implement their recommendation, the 9/11 Commission stayed vigilant and formed the 9/11 discourse project. They did so, as they explained, because the perils of inaction are far too high and the strategic value of the Commission's findings too important for the work of the 9/11 Commission not to continue. 
   Unfortunately, the project's December 2005 report card found little progress was being made on addressing known vulnerabilities and gaps in our Nation's security. Still, Mr. Speaker, the 109th Congress did not do its job. 
   On January 5, however, at the direction of Speaker Pelosi, I introduced H.R. 1, a bill to complete the unfinished business of the 9/11 Commission, with 200 of my fellow colleagues. Today, I'm privileged to present a bipartisan conference report that finally fulfills the recommendations. 
   This report passed the Senate just last night before midnight by a vote of 85-8. When H.R. 1 is law, Mr. Speaker, Homeland Security grants will finally be allocated based on risk. Targeted communities will get the Federal help they so richly deserve. First responders will have interoperable communications. When H.R. 1 is law, information necessary to uncover terrorist plots will be exchanged between Federal and local law enforcement. Would-be terrorists will not be able to exploit the Visa Waiver Program. Privacy and civil liberties will be central in how we approach homeland security. Our rail, mass transit and aviation systems will be more secure. When H.R. 1 is law, 100 percent of U.S.-bound cargo will be scanned in a commerce-friendly manner. 
   Though I'm disappointed that collective bargaining and whistle-blower rights for TSA screeners were not included in the final report, I applaud Senator Lieberman and the 42 other conferees who stood with us on this legislation. Their hard work, combined with the leadership of Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, assured that this effort came to fruition. 
   Frederick Douglass once said, ``The life of a nation is secure only while the nation is honest, truthful and virtuous.'' Thank you to the 9/11 Commission for exemplifying these values. And thank you to the 9/11 families, and everyone else who would not let us forget what was at stake if we did not act. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, it is quite clear that there is substantial support for the bill as well as substantial support to get on the vote for the bill. 
   I would like to thank my colleague, Ranking Member King, for his support as well as his staff. They have been very good. I would like to recognize the Democratic staff: Jessica Flanigan, Rosaline Cohen, Michael Stroud, everybody. I have something to insert in the Record to recognize their value. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is quite clear that this is a good bill. It is in the best interest of the country. It is completion of the 9/11 vulnerability report. I urge its adoption.  
   Mr. Speaker, while I commend the work on H.R. 1, I rise today to express my disappointment that the provision to afford our Transportation Security Officers, TSOs, the collective bargaining rights and whistleblower protections they deserve is excluded from the Conference Report. Mr. Speaker, our TSOs are not second class citizens and should not be treated as such. 
   In 2001, when the Transportation Safety Administration, TSA, was created, Congress vested power to set TSO compensation, leave, and other basic employment rights with the Secretary of Transportation. When TSA was moved to the Department of Homeland Security, this authority remained. While this authority was helpful in getting TSA up and running, the TSOs now need to be treated like all other TSA employees--fairly and equitably. This provision would have restored the labor rights of approximately 43,000 TSOs and provided them with veterans' preference, anti-discrimination protections, retirement, whistle-blowing, and collective bargaining rights. 
   Restoring basic employment rights is critical to recruiting and retaining TSOs. We do not need to look far to see what low morale can do to the health, recruitment, and retention of the Department of Homeland Security workforce. According to a GAO report released this month, TSOs account for approximately a third of the total workforce and their attrition rates are higher than the normal for the Federal Government. It is unfortunate that we are failing to provide the most basic labor protections to our front line workers who perform an important job and work to keep us all safe; rights that are afforded to thousands of workers in the Federal Government. 
   I commit to my colleagues today that as Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security I will continue work to ensure that our TSOs are afforded the rights and protections they deserve. 
   Additionally, Mr. Speaker, let the record reflect that in addition to the staff that I recognized earlier, the following individuals did a service to our Nation in helping the Conference develop legislation to make America more secure.

   Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Chairman, I would like to assure the gentleman from California that, as Chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, I look forward to working with him. 
   The border issue, from a security standpoint, as you know, is a major issue. Customs and Border Patrol should have more training in this area. I look forward to joint hearings with the Agriculture Committee on this, and subsequent to the findings of those hearings, look forward to strengthening our borders.  
   I must express my reservations to using the farm bill as a legislative vehicle to transfer agriculture import inspectors from the Department of Homeland Security to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. After the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Congress, in March of 2003 consolidated and transferred critical responsibility for inspections of passenger and agricultural commodities from USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Customs and Border Protection (CBP). 
   Since the transfer of APHIS inspectors to DHS, DHS had dedicated considerable resources to enhancing agriculture inspections to protect the nation from economically devastating agricultural pests and diseases. I agree that the Department of Homeland Security, especially Customs and Border Protection, must improve its training. 
   While DHS has experienced some challenges in implementing this enhanced inspection regime, those challenges are not insurmountable. As a former Agriculture Committee Member and representing many agriculture interests, I am very concerned about any breaches at the border, including foreign pest and prohibited agricultural products. 
   Though DHS carries out the inspections, USDA maintains the responsibility for establishing the regulations, guidelines, and even the training that govern the import of agricultural products. Thus, it is important to note that the success or failure of the program requires both DHS and USDA coordinated efforts. 
   Transferring employees at this time would divert attention from the real mission, delay any efforts to identify needed improvements, and set the program back for another several years while yet another readjustment occurs for both USDA and DHS. A far better approach than another disruptive, time-consuming transfer of thousands of employees would be for USDA and DHS to commit to conducting a thorough analysis of the program's performance, agree to a specific action plan for improvements, and to set clear and measurable goals. 
   Mr. Chairman and Mr. Cardoza, I am committed to working with you on this issue and would like to hold a joint hearing on this matter. I thank the gentleman for raising this important issue and look forward to working with you and Chairman Peterson immediately on this issue.   
   May 22, 2007. Hon. BENNIE G. THOMPSON, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
