<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. I thank the chairman for those generous remarks. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend Speaker Pelosi and commend Leader BOEHNER for working together to bring this package before us and working in  conjunction with the President. Speaker Pelosi, I think, was correct in reaching out to the President first through letter and then, of course, by making sure that we could bring to fruition this important package. It wouldn't happen, though, without the leadership of CHARLIE RANGEL and JIM MCCRERY, who have epitomized in this Chamber what working together is all about and the productive results that can come from that. 
   I am so pleased and honored to see that this package reaches out to 35 million people, 35 million Americans who would otherwise never know the benefits of a stimulus package and debunks once and for all the myth that they do not pay taxes. They pay the most regressive of taxes. And, therefore, this is money that will help stimulate this economy immediately. And, again, I commend the leadership for coming up with this progressive approach. 
   We also recognize that there is much more that needs to be done as well. Again, I want to commend our chairman, CHARLIE RANGEL, for recognizing the kind of long-term stimulus that we're going to need. 
   President Roosevelt said of another generation they had a ``rendezvous with destiny.'' For America today what Mr. Rangel understands and recognizes is that we have a rendezvous with reality. It's a reality that people face every day when they stare across the kitchen table and look at their spouses and understand what's happening to our economy. When you look at the national debt, when you look at the trade imbalance, when you look at personal credit card debt, when you look at the college tuition debt that people are experiencing, that's what's happening with this middle-class crunch. That's why long-term investment in infrastructure is so important. And, again, I commend Mr. Rangel and the entire body for pursuing it.

   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, I rise to associate myself with the remarks of our distinguished Republican leader, Mr. Boehner, and thank him for the large role that he played in putting this package together. 
   As he said in his remarks, the comity that exists in this Chamber today is warming. President Roosevelt used to say that what we need in this Nation is the warm courage of national unity. And it's great to see, on a day like today, that we can all pull together. 
   I think, again, Mr. Bachus and Mr. Frank deserve an awful lot of credit as well. And to my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts, whose eloquence is only superceded by his wit and understanding of the parliamentary process, he continues to amaze. 
   But in getting philosophical, my grandfather, Nolan, would say, in explaining the difference in the free market system, one thing has to apply, and that's Peter Finley Dunn's reminder to ``trust everyone, but cut the cards.'' And I think in coming together today, that's what we've seen is a cutting of the cards. 
   But as we all know, this wouldn't have happened without the great work of the distinguished chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, CHARLIE RANGEL, and again, the distinguished gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. McCrery). So, we're sad to see him leave, but the partnership that the two of them have had, as I've said earlier, exemplifies how the Chamber and how committees should conduct themselves. 
   Madam Speaker, Speaker Pelosi deserves so much credit for this, for first reaching out to the President, and then working hand in glove with Mr. Boehner to make sure that we were able to bring this important legislation to the floor today. As Mr. Rangel has outlined and Mr. Hoyer as well, we made sure that this was simplistic in its approach to get money out in a timely, targeted, and temporary manner. And I believe that we have been able to achieve those goals.     
   We further recognize, however, that we have a rendezvous with reality, and the Ways and Means Committee and Mr. Rangel are prepared, as we move forward in this session and into the next, to make sure that we're addressing the long-term concerns that we know this economy faces. 
   With that, again, I would like to thank the staffs of the respective committees who have worked tirelessly to make sure that this legislation was able to come to the floor in as speedy a manner as it possibly can and can only pray to God that the other body acts in as timely and targeted and temporary fashion as we have demonstrated here.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for his leadership, and I rise in strong support of this legislation. 
   But I especially want to commend Congressman Olver for his dedication and hard work. I think most people in this Chamber recognize John Olver as somewhat of an academician and someone who certainly knows the workings of the Appropriations Committee, but few probably know that he's an avid hiker. And next to Henry David Thoreau, from Massachusetts, probably is as close and akin to nature as anyone in the United States Congress. And so this is something that he has worked on a long period of time, at least since I've been in the United States Congress, and I want to commend him for his hard work, and especially commend Chris Murphy from Connecticut as well for his work in this district. 
   I'm proud to say that this trail runs all the way through from Massachusetts to the Sound, and the Governor of the State of Connecticut has fully endorsed this matter, and it impacts the communities in my district of East Granby, Bloomfield, West Hartford, Southington, Berlin, Middleton. More than 2 million people, as you've heard other members come to the floor and enumerate, are going to be fortunate enough to share the values that we derive from going out and hiking and  being able to be part of this unbelievable MMM Trail that will be provided for our constituents and citizens. So I stand in strong support of this bill and thank Mr. Olver again, and again, kudos to Chris Murphy for his hard work making sure that this came to the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Chairman, as a cosponsor of the New England Scenic Trail Designation Act, I rise in strong support of this very important bill. 
   Connecticut is proud to be home to part of the Metacomet-Monadnock-Mattabesett Trail System, a beautiful nature trail that runs 190 miles from Massachusetts through Connecticut to the Long Island Sound. First established in 1931, the 700-mile long Blue-Blazed trail network in Connecticut join the Metacomet-Monadnock trail system in Massachusetts, a trail laid in the late 1950s. The trail is a vital part of the natural beauty and recreational activity of the First Congressional District of Connecticut, as well as the other parts of the state and neighboring Massachusetts. This distinctive trail passes through one of the most densely populated parts of the country--2 million people live within 10 miles of the trail. 
   In 2001, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection designated the Metacomet Ridge System--part of the trail system--as an official state greenway. The ridge system contains a ``spine'' of traprock ridges, providing a habitat for various types of plants and animals. These living things that call the ridge home and add to its beauty are not protected from residential development pressures, and while seventeen towns in Connecticut have signed a compact to work towards protecting the ridge system the trail merits Federal protection. 
   In December of 2002, the President signed the Metacomet-Monadnock-Mattabesett Trail Study Act into law, which directed the National Park Service to study the trail to determine if the Metacomet-Monadnock-Mattabesett Trail should be included in the National Trail System. In April of 2006, the study recommended its inclusion. This legislation before us today urges the implementation of the study's recommendations, while protecting land owners. The bill protects the trail system against encroachment by residential growth, but prohibits the government from seizing private land through eminent domain. 
   Mr. Chairman, designation of the New England Scenic Trail would be an important step towards preserving the 190-mile long trail and its natural and recreational value for years to come. I urge my colleagues to join me in ensuring the environmental preservation of the Metacomet-Monadnock-Mattabesett Trail by supporting the underlying bill.

   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by commending this legislation and, more specifically, commending the work of COLLIN PETERSON and BOB GOODLATTE. You are a stellar example of what bipartisan cooperation should be like in this Chamber. Anyone who's witnessed how you have handled the agricultural bill and now this issue begins to deepen your appreciation for the way that you conduct yourself. It's a model for the Congress. 
   I'd also like to commend my colleagues ROSA DELAURO and CHRIS VAN HOLLEN for the legislation that they contributed to this piece of legislation, and probably the most comprehensive piece of legislation put forward by BART STUPAK who has been an advocate for this for several years. I want to also add FRANK LOBIONDO who assisted in a bipartisan way with this legislation. 
   But essentially, this came from Main Street and from independent oil dealers who recognize that the laws of supply and demand have been suspended and that what we needed to do was address this issue very forthrightly, but with the cautious manner which Mr. Peterson has laid out. 
   I'm delighted that included in the bill is an effort to make sure that there's an Inspector General----

   I'm specifically delighted that there will be an independent Inspector General within the CFTC. This is vitally important to make sure that the kind of oversight that we all desire is going to take place. 
   I want to further commend John Mitchell, former Republican mayor in South Windsor; his brother, Billy; and Gene Guilford; and the Independent Petroleum Council who came to us with this issue primarily because citizens were coming to them and having to exchange their entire Social Security check in order to get oil for themselves.

<DOCNO>Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Chairman, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 2761, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007, which would reauthorize the Federal terrorism insurance program (TRIA) for 15 years. 
   I am pleased that the years spent working on this issue with constituents, the insurance industry, and the financial services industries to build a consensus has produced a bill so widely supported by Members in the House on both sides of the aisle that has the strong support of the business community. I applaud Chairman FRANK, the members of the House Financial Services Committee, and Representative CAPUANO, the chief sponsor of the bill, for their leadership in crafting this critical legislation protecting the safety and security of America. 
   It is estimated that the September 11th terrorist attacks resulted in $40 billion in insured claims, the largest man-made insurance disaster on record. After the 9/11 attacks, given the size of potential liabilities, there was growing concern that insurance companies and reinsurers might not be able to write policies to insure losses due to future acts of terrorism. As a result, the TRIA program was enacted in 2002 in an attempt to prevent an industry-wide catastrophe in the event of another domestic terrorist attack. The TRIA program provides a federal backstop to the insurance industry by providing compensation for a portion of insured losses resulting from acts certified by the Government as acts of terrorism. The law was reauthorized with some changes in 2005 (P.L. 109-44) and will expire on December 31, 2007. 
   Currently, TRIA only covers foreign terrorism; however, this bill would extend TRIA coverage to both foreign and domestic terrorism. The bill would set the ``trigger'' level--the size of an attack at which the Federal Government would provide aid to insurers--at $50 million. According to studies from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the risk of nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological terrorism is uninsurable absent a Federal Government backstop. In response, this legislation would include acts of nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological terrorism in TRIA. The bill would also add group life insurance to the types of insurance for which terrorism insurance coverage must be made available by insurers. Finally, H.R. 2761 would create a 21-member ``blue ribbon'' commission to propose long-term solutions to covering terrorism risk. The goal of this legislation is to protect America's economy during a time of national crisis and is important to the economic security of the business community in Hartford and the Capital Region. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of final passage and for the President to sign this bill into law. The continued insurance and safety of our Nation against terrorist attacks is an urgent and bipartisan issue.

<DOCNO>Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam Chairman, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act, which would ensure that employees have the right to choose how they will organize their own unions. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 800 because it is a key step toward strengthening America's middle class. 
   Current law allows a majority of workers to sign cards to form a union. However, an employer can veto that decision and demand an election through the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Under H.R. 800, if a majority of workers sign cards indicating their support for a union then the NLRB must certify the union as a bargaining agent for those workers. This legislation would not eliminate the election process and would allow workers to choose an NLRB election if they wish. This bill gives employees a voice and choice in the work place, and eliminates the unilateral employer decision for an NLRB election. The legislation also puts teeth to good faith collective bargaining by establishing a system of mediation  and arbitration that would apply to an employer and union that are unable to reach a first contract. Finally, the bill would toughen employer penalties for violating workers' rights during an organizing drive. 
   The reality is that workers in unions earn 30 percent more in weekly wages than non-union workers. Unionized workers also receiver better benefits and working conditions than non-union workers. It's time to move this country in a new direction. I believe that passage of this legislation is crucial and will give working families the freedom to bargain for a better life.

<DOCNO>Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Well, let me first and foremost congratulate the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Meek), and Mr. Ryan and Mrs. Wasserman Schultz and Mr. Murphy for continuing to come to the floor, the 30-somethings, and talk about issues that are so important to this country. There is no more important issue before this Congress or this country, than the war in Iraq. 
   There is no more important issue to the American public. But it is clear, and I think General Odom stated it  best, because as the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Meek) pointed out, this Congress, with its small Democratic majorities, has done what it can to end the war in Iraq and put a bill on the President's desk. The President opted to veto that bill. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle opted to stay the course with the President of the United States. 
   As General Odom says, and I quote, ``The end game will start when a senior senator from the President's party, or a senior Member from the House of Representatives, much as William Fulbright did to LBJ during Vietnam, stands up and says no, stands up and says let's end the war.'' 
   Let's create the kind of strategic withdrawal that we need in order to preserve our troops, in order to maintain our military's readiness, in order to bring sanity back into the lives, especially the reservists and the National Guard who have put out so much for us. We are going to go home at the end of this week and celebrate the Fourth of July while our troops are slugging it out there, while this administration goes through some endgame strategy where they sound like the Bobbsey twins getting together and say, ``Well, now, all of a sudden, September 15 is only a snapshot of perhaps what will happen.'' A snapshot. 
   To the men and women who are putting their lives on the line every single day, it's time to end the war. That will only happen in this House of Representatives and in the United States Senate, as was pointed out by General Odom, when Members on the other side of the aisle recognize that they have to stand up and say ``no'' to the President. They hint about it. They talk about it. 
   Meanwhile, while they dither, we lost more than 23 soldiers this past weekend. How much longer can the insanity continue here without a strategy that provides us with the strategic withdrawal to an over-the-horizon force as has been advocated on this floor by colleagues on both sides of the aisle? Why is it that Ron Paul is the only presidential candidate who has the nerve on the Republican side to talk about it without fear of being called unpatriotic or in fact booed in an audience? 
   This Chamber should be a chamber where we have the opportunity to speak truth to power. Thank God for people like Wayne Gilchrest. Thank God for people like Walter Jones. But Members on the other side of the aisle need to join with this majority so that we can create an override if the President remains obstinate, along with the Vice President, in this myopic pursuit of victory. Victory. No definition of what ``victory'' is, other than ``staying there for as long as it takes.'' We see that the Iraqi government is not living up to its proposals, that the surge is an entire failure. Yet, people come to the floor and people present in the newspapers arguments that somehow the surge might work, what it just needs is a little more time, or perhaps what it needs is even more troops. 
   It is time to end this war. It is time to make sure that we have people on the other side of the aisle that are willing to speak truth to power and face up to the fact that it is in the best interest of our country, that it is the very American thing to do, to stand up for our troops, to provide for our families that are here at home worried sick about the prospect of sending their loved ones into this insurgent civil war nightmare we have come to call Iraq. 
   The American public is way ahead of this Chamber, way ahead of the Senate. We plead with our colleagues, especially as we go forward to this July 4 weekend, to find the courage of our forebears and to stand up, since we are the body that decides on war. You have Senator Warner saying that he ought to reconsider the authorization of this war, to do what they did in Vietnam, to recognize that the Congress, during that era, stood up and deauthorized the Gulf of Tonkin resolution that put an end to an unjust war. 
   We know now, of course, that we found no weapons of mass destruction. We know now that we had no exit strategy. We know now that this administration's closest adviser that they took into their bosom was Ahmed Chalabi, who ultimately ends up saying, ``So what? I lied to you. So what? I lied to you. You got what you wanted. You had a civil war in your country. The Iraqis are going to have to have a civil war in their country.'' 
   Americans soldiers, men and women who have served this country with honor, go over there to fulfill their duty to their country. We have a duty and a responsibility here to make sure that we are doing everything within our power to make sure that they are safe and secure. Instead, we have stuck them in the middle of a civil war. The military objectives of this war have long since been accomplished. It is time to bring the troops home. 
   I commend Mr. Meek and Mr. Ryan for having come to this floor day in and day out and discussed this thing. But we have to turn it up. Especially for those of you in our viewing audience, continue to turn it up at home. Turn up the conversation and the dialogue that so many have taken to the streets, to protest, to talk about moving other Members of this great body to come and arrive at the same conclusion that most Americans have. It is time for the safe, secure and strategic withdrawal of our troops from Iraq. 
   Mr. Meek, I thank you for the opportunity to come down here and address, along with you, Members of the 30-something Group, who have continued to speak truth to power here. I especially want to commend Mr. Ryan from Ohio for his efforts, as well.

<DOCNO>Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield for a moment, I thank you again, because I do want to say that Frank Rich wrote an important column in The New York Times yesterday, and it is one that I will submit for the record. I think it also lays it out pretty clearly. 
   I would like to quote here. First he is quoting retired General William Odom. ``For the Bush White House, the real definition of victory has become `anything they can get away with without taking blame for defeat,' said the retired Army General William Odom, a national security official in the Reagan and Carter administrations,'' when Frank Rich spoke to him most recently. ``The plan is to run out the Washington clock between now and January 20, 2009, no matter the cost.'' 
   ``A precipitous withdrawal is also a chimera, since American manpower, material and bases, not to mention our new Vatican-sized embassy, can't be drawn down overnight.'' 
   And here is the important thing that I think Mr. Rich says. ``The only real choice, everyone knows, is an orderly plan for withdrawal that will best serve American interests. The real debate must be over what that plan is. That debate can't happen as long as the White House gets away with falsifying reality, sliming its opponents and sowing hyped fears of Armageddon. The threat that terrorists in a civil war-torn Iraq will follow us home if we leave is as bogus as Saddam's mushroom clouds. The al Qaeda that actually attacked us on 9/11 still remains under the tacit protection of our ally, Pakistan. 
   ``As General Odom says, `the endgame will start when a senior senator from the President's party says no,' much like William Fulbright did. That's why in Washington this fall,'' he goes on to say, ``eyes will turn once again to John Warner, the senior Republican with the clout to give political cover to other members of his party who want to leave Iraq before they are forced to evacuate Congress. In September, it will nearly be a year since Mr. Warner said that Iraq was `drifting sideways' and that action would have to be taken if this level of violence is not under control and this government is able to function. 
   ``Mr. Warner has also signaled his regret that he was not more outspoken during Vietnam. `We kept surging in those years,' he told The Washington Post in January, as the Iraq surge began. `It didn't work.' Surely,'' Rich goes on to say, ``he must recognize that his moment for speaking out about this war is overdue. Without him, the Democrats don't have the votes,'' and I repeat, without Republicans, ``the Democrats don't have the votes to force the President's hand. With him, it's a slam-dunk. The best way to honor the sixth anniversary of 9/11,'' as we take up this week the 9/11 Commission response, ``is to at last disarm a President who continues to squander countless lives in the names of those voiceless American dead.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I include the entire Frank Rich article for the Record.  
   They'll Break the Bad News on 9/11  
   By this late date we should know the fix is in when the White House's top factotums fan out on the Sunday morning talk shows singing the same lyrics, often verbatim, from the same hymnal of spin. The pattern was set way back on Sept. 8, 2002, when in simultaneous appearances three cabinet members and the vice president warned darkly of Saddam's aluminum tubes. ``We don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud,'' said Condi Rice, in a scripted line. The hard sell of the war in Iraq--the hyping of a (fictional) nuclear threat to America--had officially begun. 
   America wasn't paying close enough attention then. We can't afford to repeat that blunder now. Last weekend the latest custodians of the fiasco, our new commander in Iraq, Gen. David Petraeus, and our new ambassador to Baghdad, Ryan Crocker, took to the Sunday shows with two messages we'd be wise to heed. 
   The first was a confirmation of recent White House hints that the long-promised September pivot point for judging the success of the ``surge'' was inoperative. That deadline had been asserted as recently as April 24 by President Bush, who told Charlie Rose that September was when we'd have ``a pretty good feel'' whether his policy ``made sense.'' On Sunday General Petraeus and Mr. Crocker each downgraded September to merely a ``snapshot'' of progress in Iraq. ``Snapshot,'' of course, means ``Never mind!'' 
   The second message was more encoded and more ominous. Again using similar language, the two men said that in September they would explain what Mr. Crocker called ``the consequences'' and General Petraeus ``the implications'' of any alternative ``courses of action'' to their own course in Iraq. What this means in English is that when the September ``snapshot'' of the surge shows little change in the overall picture, the White House will say that ``the consequences'' of winding down the war would be even more disastrous: surrender, defeat, apocalypse now. So we must stay the surge. Like the war's rollout in 2002, the new propaganda offensive to extend and escalate the war will be exquisitely timed to both the anniversary of 9/11 and a highstakes Congressional vote (the Pentagon appropriations bill). 
   General Petraeus and Mr. Crocker wouldn't be sounding like the Bobbsey Twins and laying out this coordinated rhetorical groundwork were they not already anticipating the surge's failure. Both spoke on Sunday of how (in General Petraeus's variation on the theme) they had to ``show that the Baghdad clock can indeed move a bit faster, so that you can put a bit of time back on the Washington clock.'' The very premise is nonsense. Yes, there is a Washington clock, tied to Republicans' desire to avoid another Democratic surge on Election Day 2008. But there is no Baghdad clock. It was blown up long ago and is being no more successfully reconstructed than anything else in Iraq. 
   When Mr. Bush announced his ``new way forward'' in January, he offered a bouquet of promises, all unfulfilled today. ``Let the Iraqis lead'' was the policy's first bullet point, but in the initial assault on insurgents now playing out so lethally in Diyala Province, Iraqi forces were kept out of the fighting altogether. They were added on Thursday: 500 Iraqis, following 2,500 Americans. The notion that these Shiite troops might ``hold'' this Sunni area once the Americans leave is an opium dream. We're already back fighting in Maysan, a province whose security was officially turned over to Iraqi authorities in April. 
   In his January prime-time speech announcing the surge, Mr. Bush also said that ``America will hold the Iraqi government to the benchmarks it has announced.'' More fiction. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's own political adviser, Sadiq al-Rikabi, says it would take ``a miracle'' to pass the legislation America wants. Asked on Monday whether the Iraqi Parliament would stay in Baghdad this summer rather than hightail it to vacation, Tony Snow was stumped. 
   Like Mr. Crocker and General Petraeus, Mr. Snow is on script for trivializing September as judgment day for the surge, saying that by then we'll only ``have a little bit of metric'' to measure success. This administration has a peculiar metric system. On Thursday, Peter Pace, the departing chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called the spike in American troop deaths last week the ``wrong metric'' for assessing the surge's progress. No doubt other metrics in official reports this month are worthless too, as far as the non-reality-based White House is concerned. The civilian casualty rate is at an all-time high; the April-May American death toll is a new two-month record; overall violence in Iraq is up; only 146 out of 457 Baghdad neighborhoods are secure; the number of internally displaced Iraqis has quadrupled since January. 
   Last week Iraq rose to No. 2 in Foreign Policy magazine's Failed State Index, barely nosing out Sudan. It might have made No. 1 if the Iraqi health ministry had not stopped providing a count of civilian casualties. Or if the Pentagon were not withholding statistics on the increase of attacks on the Green Zone. Apparently the White House is working overtime to ensure that the September ``snapshot'' of Iraq will be an underexposed blur. David Carr of The Times discovered that the severe Pentagon blackout on images of casualties now extends to memorials for the fallen in Iraq, even when a unit invites press coverage. 
   Americans and Iraqis know the truth anyway. The question now is: What will be the new new way forward? For the administration, the way forward will include, as always, attacks on its critics' patriotism. We got a particularly absurd taste of that this month when Harry Reid was slammed for calling General Pace incompetent and accusing General Petraeus of exaggerating progress on the ground. 
   General Pace's record speaks for itself; the administration declined to go to the mat in the Senate for his reappointment. As for General Petraeus, who recently spoke of ``astonishing signs of normalcy'' in Baghdad, he is nothing if not consistent. He first hyped ``optimism'' and ``momentum'' in Iraq in an op-ed article in September 2004.  
   Come September 2007, Mr. Bush will offer his usual false choices. We must either stay his disastrous course in eternal pursuit of ``victory'' or retreat to the apocalypse of ``precipitous withdrawal.'' But by the latest of the president's ever-shifting definitions of victory, we've already lost. ``Victory will come,'' he says, when Iraq ``is stable enough to be able to be an ally in the war on terror and to govern itself and defend itself.'' The surge, which he advertised as providing ``breathing space'' for the Iraqi ``unity'' government to get its act together, is tipping that government into collapse. As Vali Nasr, author of ``The Shia Revival,'' has said, the new American strategy of arming Sunni tribes is tantamount to saying the Iraqi government is irrelevant. 
   For the Bush White House, the real definition of victory has become ``anything they can get away with without taking blame for defeat,'' said the retired Army Gen. William Odom, a national security official in the Reagan and Carter administrations, when I spoke with him recently. The plan is to run out the Washington clock between now and Jan. 20, 2009, no matter the cost. 
   Precipitous withdrawal is also a chimera, since American manpower, materiel and bases, not to mention our new Vatican City-sized embassy, can't be drawn down overnight. The only real choice, as everyone knows, is an orderly plan for withdrawal that will best serve American interests. The real debate must be over what that plan is. That debate can't happen as long as the White House gets away with falsifying reality, sliming its opponents and sowing hyped fears of Armageddon. The threat that terrorists in civil-war-torn Iraq will follow us home if we leave is as bogus as Saddam's mushroom clouds. The Qaeda that actually attacked us on 9/11 still remains under the tacit protection of our ally, Pakistan. 
   As General Odom says, the endgame will start ``when a senior senator from the president's party says no,'' much as William Fulbright did to L.B.J. during Vietnam. That's why in Washington this fall, eyes will turn once again to John Warner, the senior Republican with the clout to give political cover to other members of his party who want to leave Iraq before they're forced to evacuate Congress. In September, it will be nearly a year since Mr. Warner said that Iraq was ``drifting sideways'' and that action would have to be taken ``if this level of violence is not under control and this government able to function.'' 
   Mr. Warner has also signaled his regret that he was not more outspoken during Vietnam. ``We kept surging in those years,'' he told The Washington Post in January, as the Iraq surge began. ``It didn't work.'' Surely he must recognize that his moment for speaking out about this war is overdue. Without him, the Democrats don't have the votes to force the president's hand. With him, it's a slam dunk. The best way to honor the sixth anniversary of 9/11 will be to at last disarm a president who continues to squander countless lives in the names of those voiceless American dead.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. As you have said on more than one occasion on the floor, Mr. Ryan, what we have needed all along here is a diplomatic surge, not a military surge. It is such a shame that we have abandoned so much of American foreign policy. In fact, more than 50 years of American foreign policy that were centered around deterrence, diplomacy and containment. Instead, we went into the wrong-headed policies of preemption and unilateralism, which have brought us to the quagmire that we are in today. 
   It breaks my heart to travel with Jack Murtha to Bethesda and see the young men and women who are there, who have become the heroes, of course, in our country, but victims of a myopic, failed strategy with no exit in sight. 
   How much longer can the American public, or for that matter, this body, put up with the slogans that ``we will stand down as the Iraqis stand up,'' when more of our troops are needed and less Iraqis continue to join us; when they decide that they are going to take the next couple of months off while we slog it out in a civil war? 
   Our soldiers don't know in many respects who the enemy is over there, because oftentimes they are getting played, one religious sect against another, settling ages of old scores rather than accomplishing any kind of goal of establishing a democracy or establishing a government or people that are going to stand up so that we can stand down.

   I think Mr. Warner has been on record publicly for having stated what he has.

   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. But over in the Senate, and most of the general public isn't aware of this, they have a cloture rule. Cloture in the Senate means it takes 60 votes in order to pass something, which is why Mr. Rich in his article prevails upon Mr. Warner, a senior Republican, to rein in Mr. McConnell. Now Mitch McConnell in the Senate has indicated that they continue to be obstructionists. Almost every single vote that has taken place over in the Senate, every single issue becomes a cloture vote which means that there are 60 votes needed in order to pass. Of course with only 50 Democrats in the United States Senate, that becomes impossible. So they become the obstructionist not only in the effort to strategically withdraw our troops and support the military and to revert back to a policy that makes sense, but also on every other issue that Democrats have been able to bring before and pass in this House of Representatives. 
   So, Mr. Meek, I am pleased to join with you this evening and thank you for coming to the floor with this.

   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Meek, I think you have made your point extraordinarily well. I especially want to commend, especially for the viewers and listeners who regularly tune in when the 30-Something Group comes to the floor, first and foremost, call up and thank courageous people like Walter Jones, Republican from North Carolina; Wayne Gilchrest, Republican from Maryland; Ron Paul, Republican from Texas, who more often than not sit almost isolated, almost ostracized on the other side of the aisle. And it is not that they don't have the respect of their colleagues, because I believe sincerely they do. What they should know is that they have the respect of America because they are willing to stand up and speak truth to power. 
   There are many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who would stand with them. Loyalty is important in any process, and certainly one can respect loyalty. Loyalty and fidelity are important concepts and in fact can be virtues. But when there is blind allegiance, and especially when men and women's lives are at stake, where is your voice? Will you stand together to have this institution, the United States Congress, stand up together, collectively, put an end to the war, find a process by which we together can end the war and provide, as you point out, as the most recent veterans' bill that we passed does, the greatest increase in 77 years for veterans, so that we provide the assistance to these brave men and women who have given their all. And also to provide the compassion and the caring for their family members who wait at home wondering what kind of policy is going to unfold here for them to see Congress bogged down the way it is in the obstinacy of an administration that says it is just going to run out the clock on its policy is wrong. 
   As Mr. Rich points out, if not Mr. Warner, then who? And certainly we have heard the Walter Joneses and the Wayne Gilchrests and the Ron Pauls in the House, but we need other brave Members who have found their voice who are able when they go back home to listen to their fellow citizens and then come to this floor and join with those men of character and stand up for what they know is right. 
   We know that Mr. Warner is thinking about it. We know he is talking about September. Twenty-three soldiers lost their lives this weekend. For people who are serving, tomorrow is today. The urgency is now. Find your voice prior to this July 4, strike a tone of independence from the administration that has got us here. 
   Historically this happened to a Democratic President during Vietnam. It is not about Democrats or Republicans. It is about America, and it is about standing up for our troops in the field. It is about standing up for fellow Americans. It is about Americans finding their voice. Our citizens have found theirs. We need the Members of Congress here to join together, both House and Senate, to end this insanity and come together on behalf of the American public, and especially the brave men and women who serve our country so valiantly who we owe such a debt of gratitude to, and ought to show it through the courage of our policy convictions here on the floor, and then in the funding that we provide them to make sure that they have the kind of life that they richly deserve when they come home, and that we honor the memory of their sacred sacrifice that so many have made on behalf of this Nation.     
   I thank the gentleman again from the 30-Somethings for having continued to bring this debate to the American public.

   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Ellen Tauscher has done a terrific job. 
   If the gentleman would yield just for a moment, when you're reading through these things, I can't help but think of the time, and I know that you hadn't arrived here on September 11. I served with your mom. I can remember a time when this entire Congress stood together on the steps of the Capitol after September 11 and spontaneously broke into God Bless America. It's a time that will be forever seared in my memory. 
   I remember a time in our caucus just this past year when the Speaker, the gentleman from New York, stood up, at a time when we knew that we only had and could only muster Democratic votes, stood up and gave a speech that I will always remember, that drew our caucus together and allowed us to go forward and place a bill on the President's desk. It was something that everyone said couldn't be done, the politics were too raw, people were too far apart, we couldn't possibly come together. But when people rise and find their voice as the Speaker from New York did, then great things can happen. A Nation can move. People find their voice because within their heart resides the great spirit of this country as you pointed out. Within every piece of legislation that you're chronicling here is a deep-seated belief on the part of its sponsors that this is the right thing to do. There are many on that side of the aisle who will disagree. I respect people's positions regardless of how they come to them. But I know the great reservoir that exists on that side of the aisle that understands what's going on, that events are unfolding daily around us and the need for us to act is now. That tomorrow has become today, that the urgency can't wait for September 15 for yet another report. The time is to act. 
   I plead for our colleagues on that side of the aisle, because, as Mr. Rich points out, it cannot happen without this Congress coming together. And so either we will stand together as a United States Congress and send a message and help this President find a way forward by demonstrating as a Congress did during Vietnam, no matter who the President is, that the right thing to do here is to bring our troops home safe, secure and strategically in a manner that will allow us to regroup and refocus and go after the enemy in Afghanistan where they continue to fester and grow and regroup, the people who actually knocked down the towers, the people who struck the Pentagon and but for those brave souls on Flight 93 would have surely hit this Capitol or the White House. It's time for us to come together in that spirit. 
   Mr. Meek, if it weren't for you and Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Chris Murphy and Tim Ryan coming here and repeatedly talking about it, if you're at home, you're thinking, has Congress forgot about this urgency. Do they not pick up the papers every day as we do? When I go home, and you said it, people talk about Iraq, they talk about Iraq, and then they talk about Iraq. The facts are that without Republican support, we cannot override a veto. The facts are that without a Republican Senate that will stop the cloture rule and Mr. Warner, or following the paths of a great American in Chuck Hagel, comes forward and speaks truth to power. There are people on both sides of the aisle that are great visionary Americans. We just need to come together at this time and find our voice in the same manner that Americans have already found theirs. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, I thank you again.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for H. Res. 120, which recognizes the African American spiritual as a national treasure. The African American spiritual is both an expression of culture and faith, and a symbol of the path to triumph in our democracy. 
   The African American spiritual originated with many cultures in Africa, and became one of the few forms of expression that the African slaves were able to maintain while held in bondage in America. The spirituals not only served to uplift, but also served as a secret code to direct those enslaved to freedom. Lyrics from songs like ``Steal Away (to Jesus)'' and ``Wade in the Water'' were guides for those who planned to escape and served as instructions to allow those escaping to avoid being traced by slave catchers. Spirituals such as ``Follow the Drinking Gourd'' were also means of secretly communicating maps and directions for escaping slaves to reach the network of the Underground Railroad. After the abolition of slavery in the United States in 1865, the African American spiritual remained an important expression of culture, faith, and social justice, especially during the Civil Rights movements across the Nation in the 1950s and 1960s. 
   And so today, also in honor of Black History Month, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the African American spiritual and the legacy left to us by those who fought for freedom and rights in this country for all citizens. The African American spiritual is not only testimony of history, but is a part of our national heritage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the H-Prize Act of 2007, H.R. 632, an important step forward in making America more competitive and energy independent. As a founding member of the House Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Caucus and a cosponsor of this bill, I believe we must move forward in fostering innovation and competition in hydrogen technology, in order to end our addiction to oil. 
   According to the Department of Energy, major advances must be made in hydrogen production, distribution, and storage before it can be widely used as a fuel source. The H-Prize Act would excite and attract innovators throughout the country to take up this important task. Specifically, the bill would authorize $50 million from fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2017 to be awarded in cash prizes to non-federal entities in three categories--technologies created to assist in the distribution or production of hydrogen; development of hydrogen powered vehicles; and ``transformational technology'' related to production, storage, distribution, or use of hydrogen fuel. And importantly, the cash prizes would only go to individuals who produce breakthrough results in these categories, spurring competition and innovation into much needed technology. 
   Solution to our energy crisis can be found in our backyard. Hydrogen can be produced here on American soil. Companies such as UTC Power and Fuel Cell Energy in my district in Connecticut produce hydrogen fuel cells which are a clean, reliable form of energy. Technology such as this can relieve us from our dependence on foreign nations for our energy and create a much healthier alternative for our environment. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me today in advancing science and supporting H.R. 632. It's time for us to take leadership and commit to the safety and health of our nation by inspiring our nation's brightest to make hydrogen technology a reality.

   Indeed, our troops have performed valiantly and achieved military victory. There is no question about that or their performance. But 4 years later, we find ourselves still in a quagmire, a quagmire that even the head of the CIA said was now all trumped up with misinformation, misled the country, sacrificing brave men and women and their lives in Iraq. 
   What we need is for the President to step up and recognize what the American people are calling for: a new direction. Refocus on Afghanistan, go after the terrorists where they are, go after Osama bin Laden, the people who actually took down the tower, and end this quagmire. And the only reason that we are there and continue to lose lives, because there is no mission other than arrogance and hubris that has led this President to stay this course in spite of the sacrifice by our brave troops and men, when 61 percent of the Iraqi people say it is okay to kill Americans, that sectarian violence is okay, and in the midst of the civil war is not where we belong.

   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the distinguished Congresswoman from California, Barbara Lee for her work on H.R. 2929, which bans permanent military bases from being established in Iraq. She has long been a voice on ending the war in Iraq and I commend her and the work of Congresswoman Maxine Waters and Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey for their fortitude on this issue. I would also like to recognize Congressman Tom Allen and Congressman David Price for their commitment and contributions to the bill. 
   In-line with the Iraq Study Group report, this bill would prohibit the establishment of permanent U.S. military bases. It would also prohibit the United States from exercising control over Iraqi oil resources. This bill signals a larger issue and bigger picture--our presence in Iraq is not permanent. Let it be clear to the Bush Administration and the Iraqi people that this Congress will not support an open-ended military occupation in Iraq. 
   The American people have spoken. The American Congress has acted. If necessary, we will go on the record everyday until we bring the troops home--we owe it to them and their families. I am proud to support this bill and I urge my colleagues to join me.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Creating Long-Term Energy Alternatives for the Nation (CLEAN) Energy Act, H.R 6. This critical legislation is an important step in increasing our investment in the development of clean and efficient energy technology that will one day end our dependence on foreign oil. 
   The oil industry has been reaping record profits while working Americans have faced record high gas prices. Last year, while millions of Americans struggled to afford gasoline at $3 a gallon, the top five oil companies made nearly $97 billion in profit. The hard truth is that at a time of record energy costs and oil profits, families in Connecticut and across the country were getting tapped into twice: once at the pump and once again with their tax dollars going to oil companies in the form of tax breaks and subsidies. 
   The bill before us today restores some common sense to our federal budget by repealing or minimizing nearly $13 billion in unnecessary tax subsidies given away to the oil and gas industries. It includes a rollback of a tax break for geological and geophysical exploration, a provision that the President himself suggested that Congress eliminate. In addition, it closes a $7.6 billion loophole written into the FSC/ETI international tax bill which allowed oil companies to qualify for a tax provision intended to help domestic manufacturers struggling to sell their products overseas. Finally, the CLEAN Energy Act ensures that oil companies that were awarded the 1998 and 1999 leases for drilling pay their fair share in royalties. 
   Our dangerous dependence on foreign oil is much more than just an energy issue--it is at its very core a matter of national security, foreign policy, environmental responsibility, economic development and technological advancement. Our dependence on foreign energy has grown to an alarming 65 percent of our total need, and we send $800 million each day to the Middle East and other oil producing countries. 
   H.R. 6 takes the important step towards ending this dependence by directing receipts to a newly created Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve. This fund will be used to fund future legislation promoting energy efficiency and investing in renewable energy technologies, such as the hydrogen fuel cells developed in Connecticut, which will one day provide us with almost unlimited amounts of energy to run our cars, power our homes and businesses and move us away from a petroleum based energy economy. 
   Eliminating unneeded tax breaks for the oil industry and investing in new energy sources are just part of the solution to lowering energy prices for hardworking American families. As we move forward in the 110th Congress, we must also work to protect the American people from high energy costs by preventing the manipulation of the oil futures market and ending the practice of price gouging. H.R. 6 is just the start and I look forward to working with my colleagues to address issues.

   President Kennedy was fond of saying that communities reveal an awful lot about themselves in the memorials they create and in the people that they honor. This evening my colleagues, led by STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES and the Speaker of the House, the majority leader, and the delegation from Indiana have stood tall in honoring the memory of JULIA CARSON.  
   Memory is what distinguishes us from every other creature on the face of the Earth. It's humbling listening to the reminiscing that took place this evening. 
   We have lost a number of people since I have been in Congress, wonderful, remarkable, dedicated citizens to this great country of ours. JULIA brought that warmth and dignity to this office. It was an honor to be with her and know her. 
   I often think at services such as this it's a shame she wasn't here to hear us all talk about her, and for those of us in this body who didn't get the opportunity to say good-bye, it's principally the ability to reminisce and the memories that so many of our colleagues have brought to this floor that make her come to life and live on. Not in memorials, though I am sure memorials will be created. Not in buildings named, because I'm sure that those things will follow. But those memorials that mean the most are those that are principally carried in our hearts. And listening to BARON and STEVE talk earlier and all the Members who spoke here, what a rich, rich life. What a wonderful person. 
   She has gone home to Indiana, but she will never leave us. God bless JULIA. God bless this country. I thank everyone here for the memorial that you created this evening.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. I thank the gentlelady from Ohio. And I also join in commending and thanking Mr. Rangel and Mr. Neal for their efforts in making sure that this legislation came to the floor. 
   Let me further associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished gentlelady from Ohio. By the end of next year, 2 million foreclosures will occur in this country. That's 2 million people and families whose lives and finances will be uprooted, 2 million communities affected. That's why it was so important for this committee to act. We should not add to their burden. We have to make sure that we preserve the American Dream for them. 
   The Ways and Means Committee reacted swiftly and reasonably to this crisis and said what we could do was make it easier for those who get a raw deal or are having a hard time. We could start by not making them have to pay taxes on money they will never see. And that is the beauty of this bill. 
   Also contained in this bill is a provision that helps firefighters and first responders. It wasn't lost on Mr. Rangel, or Mr. Neal either, that it wasn't the FBI or the CIA or the armed services who responded at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, or the fields of Pennsylvania. It was volunteer firefighters. But the IRS, in its wisdom, chooses to treat income that they receive from their county, their State or their communities in terms of rebates on property tax or other equipment as ordinary income. That is flat-out wrong. And again, I commend the leadership for making sure that we address these issues.

   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation, and I would like to associate myself with the remarks of Mr. Ackerman, Mr. Frank, Mr. Bachus, Mr. King, and all those who have spoken so eloquently on this floor. 
   Mr. Frank made two points; one essentially about the need for this legislation and the process we must go through. We all understand, for the economy to grow, banks need to make loans. In order for banks to make loans, they have to have insurance. 
   What this provides, as Mr. King says, is a security backstop for the Nation, not only in New York City but all across this great country of ours. 
   Mr. Frank made a second point as well about the process here, quoting Madison as being the problem here with our colleagues on the other side. I want to commend Senator Dodd for his willingness to go forward, and also Mr. Ackerman for pointing out the need for the reset provision, 15 years being better than 7, and the importance of including group insurance as well. These were all vitally important to the success and ongoing future of this Nation and the great City of New York. 
   So I commend my colleagues, each and every one of them on the Committee on Financial Services, and thank them for this compromise piece of legislation that we know will go much further in the next session.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to thank Mr. Rangel, Mr. Neal and Mr. McCrery, and since this was a bipartisan effort, all the hard work that went into this on both sides of the aisle. This legislation comes at a time when most of us are preparing to head home for the Christmas holidays. 
   Mr. Speaker, I can't tell you how our hearts all go out to those men and women who serve in our military who have sacrificed so much on our behalf. It is getting more and more difficult for many Americans to make ends meet. Why shouldn't we be doing everything we possibly can to make it easier on our military, our veterans, our first responders and their families? We should be making it easier, as this bill does, for those earning combat pay to qualify for an earned income tax credit. We should make it easier for veterans to get housing, disability assistance, and other benefits. This bill makes it easier for the spouses of fallen soldiers to draw from a loved one's retirement savings without penalty. And it makes tax breaks from State and local governments to volunteer first responders Federal income-tax free. 
   It wasn't lost on Chairman Rangel, Chairman Neal or the entire Ways and Means Committee, as I said previously, that with respect to the events that took place on September 11, it wasn't the military, the FBI, the CIA, the INS that responded at the World Trade Center, at the Pentagon, or in the fields of Pennsylvania. It was first responders. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, it is so vitally important that this legislation pass so that we provide an opportunity for those first responders who are so in need of the very rudiments that our government provides them in order to provide the great depth of service covering over 70 percent of the country in terms of the service they provide for this Nation to make sure that what little incremental benefits they get from their municipality, their county, or their State are not taxed by the IRS. 
   So I am proud to be part of this legislation that we move forward. 
   And with that I reserve my time.

   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, let me rise and join the sentiment expressed by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Reynolds), and I think everybody on our committee, in expressing not only the sheer joy and delight of having a ranking member and the chairman of the committee work as closely as they have throughout the year, whether we agreed or disagreed. It is quite a contrast from previous years. I think that Mr. Rangel deserves an incredible amount of credit for the manner in which he has conducted himself, as does Mr. McCrery, as evident by the concern that has been expressed by both sides as we take up this important legislation today. 
   Further, let me add, as has been expressed here by many, we should make sure that this bill is taken up in the Senate. They have a responsibility over in that body to make sure that they address the concerns of so many in our military, as eloquently expressed here today by so many Members on and off the committee who care deeply about issues that impact veterans and our volunteer firefighters as well. 
   I also want to thank the members of the Ways and Means staff, and especially Eileen Shatz, who is serving for her last week on the Ways and Means Committee; Janice Mays; John Buckley; Aruna Kalyanam, who has been here throughout the day; Kase Jubboori; Mildeen Worrell, who have all done great work on behalf of the committee; Chairman Neal, who also has been outstanding with this legislation and the hearings that he conducted in our committee; Melissa Mueller from the subcommittee staff, who was key. And also from my staff, I want to thank Amy O'Donnell. We call her the tax missionary. And also John Renfrew and Jackie Primeau, who have done such an outstanding job.

   What a remarkable afternoon this has been. What a remarkable journey of two of our colleagues. I rise today to support them for what they have done in the old-fashioned democratic way, reaching out across this country, holding hearings, and bringing back to this body a piece of legislation long overdue. I commend Representative Ramstad and Representative Kennedy. Their work has been extraordinary. 
   President Kennedy once said that communities reveal an awful lot about themselves in the memorials they create, the people that they honor. This body is about to reveal an awful lot about itself on the legislation we are about to vote on. Two of our colleagues revealed so much about themselves in an effort to bring forth the plight of others less fortunate than they, and unable to be here on this floor to speak. That is the crowning glory of this great democracy that we all participate in. 
   Patrick Kennedy had it right. This is a certain right. This is a civil right. This is something that goes beyond parity and speaks to the very essence of equality in what we stand for. And two of our colleagues have demonstrated the way to do that beyond the Chambers, beyond the Beltway, and out to the people where it really matters. Thank you so much for bringing their cause here today.

    Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the Committee on Ways and Means for passing this important legislation, the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Tax Relief Act. This legislation brings necessary tax relief to members of our armed services, veterans and their families and it also contains important technical corrections to a law that provides tax relief to volunteer emergency first responders. 
   Like our men and women in the armed services, volunteer emergency first responders provide a crucial service to our communities. They are in the front lines in the case of fire, natural disaster or other emergency. The majority of these brave men and women are volunteers and give up their time out of a sense of obligation to their communities. We owe them a debt of gratitude for their service. 
    This technical correction clarifies that property tax rebates and other benefits that are made to volunteer emergency first responders and are excluded from gross income are not subject to Social Security tax or unemployment tax. This was the intent of the original legislation and I appreciate the opportunity to clarify this through HR. 6081, the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Tax Relief Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2642, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2008, the annual spending bill for military construction and veterans' programs. 
   Today, the House is considering a bill that would appropriate $109.2 billion, with $64.7 billion in discretionary spending for military construction and veterans' programs, which is $4 billion more than the President's fiscal year 2008 budget request. The bill would provide $43.2 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which is $6.7 billion above 2007 and $3.8 billion over the President's request for veterans' medical care, claims processing personnel, and facility improvements. This includes $28.9 billion in funding to improve access to medical services for all veterans, which is $1.7 billion above the President's request. This legislation also defeats the President's ill-advised proposals to nearly double co-pays for prescription drugs for veterans and to increase TRICARE premiums by over $1,000 a year for military retirees. 
   The military health care system is understaffed and drowning in a backlog of cases and unable to provide our veterans with the benefits and resources they sacrificed a great deal to earn. In an effort to reduce the 400,000 claim backlog, the bill also includes $1.6 billion in funding to enable the VA to hire over 1100 more claims processors. This legislation is the largest single increase in the 77-year history of the VA and for the first time in 21 years that the House has exceeded the request of the veterans' Independent Budget. 
   There are over 251,000 veterans living in Connecticut and I am pleased the 110th Congress has made funding our Nation's military health care system a top priority. Since the previous Congress adjourned without passing a budget, the new Congress passed a Continuing Appropriations Resolution (P.L. 110-5) that provided $3.4 billion over the fiscal year 2006 funding level to fund the VA in fiscal year 2007. In addition, the Supplemental Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-28) added $1.8 billion directly targeted at the needs of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Part of the cost of war is to care for our servicemen and women when they return home and Congress has an obligation to ensure they receive appropriate care. 
   I applaud the leadership of Mr. EDWARDS, chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Mr. OBEY, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, and the members of the committee for their efforts and continued commitment to our Nation's veterans. Today's legislation takes us one step further in providing our veterans with the best health care and resources our country can provide and I encourage my colleagues to join me in voting for it and the President in signing it into law.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California for yielding but also for her continued outstanding service in the United States Congress and bringing the knowledge of her profession and her expertise to this body on a regular basis and especially the compassion that's needed for so many of those who suffer from eosinophilic disorder, more than 50,000 in this Nation. 
   I want to applaud my colleague from North Carolina, also, Representative Myrick, for her cosponsoring this legislation and understanding as well the importance that this has for so many families who oftentimes are the ones who suffer along with the patient because of lack of diagnosis, and then also because of the way Representative Capps has described the nature of this disease, what it does to the patient that it attacks when the white blood cells in your own system begin to attack itself and creates the disorders that it does, often resulting in people having to be fed by tubes. You can imagine the tremendous stress that this causes on the parts of parents and of course family members. 
   This bill comes before us not because of me, but because of a courageous woman like Lois Capps and like Sue Myrick who understand what families go through when they face issues like this. 
   I was fortunate to have Dr. Wendy Book from my district in Connecticut, who resides in Gastonbury, a doctor herself, as well as her husband, come before me to talk about this disorder because of their desire to make sure that the Nation be made aware of what so many children are suffering from. 
   She was joined by Beth Mays, who together are the co-founders of the American Partnership for Eosinophilic Disorders. When Dr. Book's son Ryan was sick before his first birthday, doctors sent him home with a feeding tube and no explanation for his mysterious illness. This illness went undiagnosed for 2 more years. Now, this Ryan, his parents are doctors. They are in the field, and so for doctors to be as confounded by a lack of understanding or a diagnosis, imagine the consternation that they feel, and then exemplify that by how other parents must feel who do not come from similar professions. 
   And so they felt in founding this organization, this partnership, that what was needed across the country was awareness and understanding. Quite frankly, what's also needed is funding, but it has to start in a place of education, awareness and understanding, and as most pieces of critical legislation do, it comes not from a Member of Congress, but it comes from a constituent, a citizen, who has the temerity to stand up and speak out for suffering that a neighbor or one of their own children is going through. 
   As Mrs. Capps pointed out, sometimes there is no cure or the diagnosis eludes all the best efforts of professions, but it is getting better, and with awareness, they know they can deal with this going forward. 
   Hospitals in Cincinnati, and most notably, the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where I visited personally, are working hard at identifying this disorder and helping parents and working with them. I want to commend the work of Dr. Chris Lancouris and Dr. Jonathan Spergel and especially Michelle Shuker who spent so much time dealing with the parents and helping them through this process. 
   As someone who has a son who has an illness that has gone undiagnosed, I empathize deeply with parents who go through this experience and understand deeply the need for education, the need for better understanding, and the responsibility that we share as Members of Congress to do our part, to first educate the public with respect to this disorder, but then secondly and more hopefully, to make sure that we follow through by funding and assisting. 
   But what you have to step back and admire, however, is the courage of these parents who, without their love and devotion and care for their children, without their consistent nurturing and support, you wonder what would happen to these children. But because of their courage and because of their ability to come forth and speak out about this, hopefully through resolutions like this and greater understanding we will be able to assist them and help them and assist families, and their not-for-profit organization will get the support that it needs, will create the understanding that it needs and provide the much needed relief for the children who are afflicted and the families that deal with this problem. 
   So I thank Representative Capps and I thank Representative Myrick and a number of cosponsors on this legislation for having come forward and assisted in bringing this to the forefront. 
   There will be members from this association on the Hill tomorrow going to various House Members and to their offices and talking with them and their staff about this disorder. Please listen to them. Take them into your heart. It is an important issue and vital not only for their children, their families, but I dare say for all of us in the country. It speaks volumes to the better angels that we have here in the United States Congress and our willingness to reach out and assist the constituents we are sworn to serve.

<DOCNO>Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Chairman, I am proud to rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 99, the House Budget Resolution for fiscal year 2008. This bill proves that a responsible budget can both reflect the values of our country and ensure the growth of our economy. 
   For all too long the voice of the American people has not been heard in this Congress. Today, I am proud to say that the new Democratic-led Congress is listening and we are delivering. We have brought a budget to the floor that begins to reverse six years of harmful cuts and reckless fiscal policy, and invests in the Nation's future. This budget supports programs that help more working families help themselves. It keeps our promises to our children, seniors, and veterans. 
   Unlike the Administration's budget, this carefully crafted budget brings down the deficit by $234 billion over the next 5 years and balances it by 2012. It supports middle-class tax cuts and sets up a reserve fund for a long-term fix for the AMT--a tax that will effect over 580,000 Connecticut families in 2007. The bill also creates a reserve fund of up to $14 billion over 10 years for investments in clean, renewable alternative energy that is paid for by redirecting oil company subsidies. 
   This budget refuses to leave children behind--it provides $7.9 billion more in funding for education, which means more funding for No Child Left Behind, special education, and aid to help students afford college. The bill also includes a $50 billion reserve fund to expand the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, to cover the more than 9 million children without health insurance, including the nearly 73,000 uninsured children in Connecticut. In addition, this budget ensures veterans receive the care that is worthy of their sacrifice. It provides $3.5 billion more this year to provide quality health care for veterans, repair VA health care facilities, and improve the accuracy and time of processing disability claims. 
   Our budget rejects the President's proposed cuts to Medicare and homeland security grants. Our budget refuses to increase the deficit. Our budget refuses to ``stay the course'' of the Bush Administration. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting the underlying bill, a budget that reflects the values and priorities of the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to one of the oldest and greatest civil rights organizations in our country's history. The NAACP has served for nearly a century to provide help for those who cannot help themselves, to provide justice for the wronged, and to give a voice to the disenfranchised. Though the group formed to fight for equality for minorities and the disadvantaged, the NAACP has vigilantly stood guard for all Americans so that the basic rights of none are infringed upon. 
   In 1909, six great Americans, Ida Wells-Barnett, W.E.B. DuBois, Henry Moscowitz, Mary White Ovington, Oswald Garrison Villiard, and William English Walling, banded together to produce the ``Call to National Action.'' This founding document of the NAACP laid out the organization's goals--to protect the rights guaranteed by the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution. From their ever-present task to preserve these rights to the fight to put an end to lynching, the great victory over segregation won in 1954's Brown v. Board of Education, and their continuing crusade to protect civil rights, the NAACP has been an inimitable champion of the cause of equality and social justice in our Nation. Today, under the leadership of Chairman Julian Bond, the organization has grown to over 2,200 branches with over 500,000 members nationwide. 
   Connecticut is very grateful for the work that the NAACP has done in the State. Headquartered in Hartford, Connecticut and led by chapter president Scot X. Esdaile, the Connecticut NAACP has been a great advocate for civil rights in the State. 
   The Connecticut NAACP has been a valuable partner in local efforts to ensure civil rights. Our chapter has worked to ensure that minorities are represented in all levels of government as important legislative decisions are being made. The group worked with other local organizations to develop a talent bank of highly qualified minority candidates to fill senior-level positions in the State and combat any discrimination that might exist. The local NAACP has also worked tirelessly with the seven members of the Connecticut Congressional delegation to ensure that our Federal Government secures the blessings of liberty for all. I am proud to have a 95 percent rating from the NAACP. It remains a prevalent voice in the State and a standard-bearer of the principles of equality and justice. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe we can honor the work of the NAACP best by continuing to work for the noble cause for which the organization exists: to protect the rights of all persons and eliminate hatred and racial discrimination. I extend to the NAACP my best wishes for a happy 99th anniversary and I commend and thank them for a century of service.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 7110, the ``Job Creation Unemployment Relief Act of 2008.'' This important legislation will help families struggling in these difficult economic times, provide critical investments in our infrastructure, and create jobs for Americans. 
   Right now, families in Connecticut and all across the country are facing rising energy costs, rising food prices, rising health care costs and an uncertain economic future. They are working hard but finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet. 
   This bill will put Americans back to work and provide needed relief for families. It invests $500 million in job training programs and invests billions to rebuild roads, bridges, schools, and public transportation. To protect our energy future, this bill invests crucial funds in the development of renewable energy sources and energy efficient vehicles. 
   To address the turbulent economic times, this bill provides key investments to assist families. With 11,000 Connecticut residents facing exhaustion of their unemployment benefits in October, H.R. 7110 will provide an extension of up to 13 weeks to help those workers get back on their feet. Finally, this bill will give crucial funding to increase food assistance and will also provide a substantial increase in Medicaid funding to the states. 
   At this time of great economic uncertainty, the American people need to know that their representatives are looking out for the interests of Main Street, not Wall Street. This bill is an investment in our greatest resource: the American people. I again want to express my strong support for this legislation and urge its passage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2, legislation that will fulfill our promise to America's working families by providing a long awaited increase in the federal minimum wage. 
   Passage of this bill today will increase the minimum wage for the first time in nearly a decade, from $5.15 to $7.25 per hour over 2 years. Inflation and increased demands on the wallets of American families have steadily chipped away at the purchasing power of our Nation's minimum wage earners, and the failure of the previous Congress to take action has left the federal minimum wage at its lowest value in more than half a century. 
   This legislation is critical at a time when America's families have seen their real income drop by almost $1,300 since 2000, while the costs of health insurance, gasoline, home heating, and attending college have increased by almost $5,000 annually. At the current level, a full-time minimum wage worker will make only $10,712 a year, nearly $6,000 below the poverty level for a family of three. While some States, such as Connecticut, have already taken action to raise their minimum wage, many more States still fall short of providing our hardest working Americans with the income they need to make ends meet. 
   In a Nation of abundant wealth and prosperity, we simply cannot be indifferent to the challenges faced by those struggling to make ends meet. This vote today sends the clear message that this Congress will be committed to America's working families. Passage of H.R. 2 is a critical step towards ensuring that every American is able to earn a real living wage.

   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of America's college-bound students. As an original cosponsor of H.R. 5, the College Student Relief Act, I join my colleagues in helping increase the access and affordability of college to over 5 million students. 
   In today's economy, the key to higher wages is through higher education. Unfortunately, the soaring cost of college education has left many of America's young adults behind. No student should ever be turned away from college for fear of being unable to pay the debt. 
   The College Student Relief Act of 2007, H.R. 5, makes good on the Democratic pledge for a New Direction for this country. This smart, fiscally-responsible bill would cut the interest rate for undergraduate students with subsidized student loans in half over the next five years, from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent. H.R. 5 is targeted to help the students most in need, those with subsidized loans from low and middle income families. The bill's cost is offset with six modest reductions in various subsidies to lenders and guaranty agencies. 
   In my home state of Connecticut, over 33,000 students with subsidized loans would benefit from this bill. For those entering college in 2007, they will save more than $2,000 over the life of their loans. When the rate cut is fully implemented in 2011, students will save over $4,000. This is a substantial savings for students entering our workforce. 
   Today's legislation is about helping students and their families. The opportunity for a college education should be available to all Americans. As a Nation, we must invest in our youth and insure they have every tool and opportunity to succeed in the global economy. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 5.

<DOCNO>Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. (BREAST CANCER PATIENT PROTECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 758: the ``Breast Care Patient Protection Act of 2008.'' I would like to commend my colleague, Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro who has fought passionately for issues like these since she entered the Congress. 
   Put simply, this bill protects the health of women and ensures they have the time they need to recover from difficult medical procedures. With passage of this legislation no longer will women have to feel pushed out the door following breast cancer treatment. There are too many stories of women across the country who ave suffered from not being given the proper time to recover from breast cancer surgery for Congress to stand idle. 
   According to the Connecticut Department of Health, in 2004, 29 percent of all new diagnosed cases of cancer in Connecticut were breast cancer. This was more than any other type of cancer diagnosed in women in the State. 
   While we need to continue to be vigilant in the fight against the causes of breast cancer we must also ensure that those seeking treatment are given the protections to allow for them to properly recover. I again commend my colleague Ms. DeLauro and repeat my firm support of this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. (PAUL WELLSTONE AND PETE DOMENICI MENTAL HEALTH PARITY AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6983, the ``Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008.'' I would first like to commend Representative Patrick Kennedy and Representative Jim Ramstad on their outstanding efforts and tireless work on this important issue. 
   For far too long too many individuals and families have struggled with mental health illness and substance abuse disorders and yet have faced a health care system that provided them with unequal access to care. This bill is a step in the right direction for our country as it provides another degree of fairness for our citizens. 
   In short, it ensures that group health plans can no longer charge people more for seeking treatment for mental health or substance abuse problems. It also provides that out of pocket and visit limits may be no different for mental health and substance abuse care than for other medical care. 
   According to a report by the Lieutenant Governor's Mental Health Cabinet in Connecticut, of the nearly 600,000 of our state residents who experience symptoms of mental illness, 135,000 suffer from a serious condition and 66,000 suffer from a severe condition. Countless others suffer from debilitating substance abuse disorders. These problems are every bit as serious as other medical conditions and must be treated by our health care system as such. 
   Again, I want to commend my colleagues who worked so hard on this issue to reach a bipartisan compromise and reiterate my strong support for this legislation.

   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for pointing out my age, but I am here primarily to salute you for continuing to do this kind of work. 
   I think, as Mr. Perlmutter pointed out, that the American public, who is always further ahead than the Congress is, found its voice in the November election, and you have given voice to the American people here in the people's Chamber, especially in the area of accountability. Because, quite frankly, as we debate today and throughout the remainder of this year, what we hear from our colleagues on the other side, and I don't question their patriotism or their love of country, and hopefully they don't question ours, but I do question their judgment. 
   Prior to you getting here, there has been a surrender of judgment on issues of oversight and review. So you are a breath of fresh air. You are the sunshine that needs to shine into every corner of this great institution of ours, because the people you are sworn to serve and who you have come here to represent, we are clearly proud in the leadership, of the efforts of this majority-making class that has set a new direction and a new course for this great country of ours.

   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation, and I commend Chairman Obey, Chairman Murtha, and Speaker Pelosi for putting it before us today. 
   I come here also to speak to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. With all sincerity, no one questions your patriotism or love of country. And yet we hear you come down here and belittle the proposal that we have before us and call Democrats defeatists, when it is you who have surrendered your judgment. You surrendered that judgment when you didn't listen to Scowcroft or Eagleberger or Baker or Kissinger or even Powell or Shinseki. 
   When you don't listen to the generals or even the soldiers in the field, you mock men when they stand up here and in principle, like JACK MURTHA, who you know have always stood on behalf of the troops of this country, and today offers more than $4 billion more that the President has put forward. But because of your blind, myopic allegiance to a failed policy, you have surrendered your judgment to what is the right thing. 
   Chairman DREIER asked us what is victory. Victory is joining with us in this proposal. Victory is once again standing on the Capitol steps hand in hand, as we all were against the war in Afghanistan, and once again fighting terrorists by going after the guys who actually took down the buildings, who hit the Pentagon. 
   Stand with us in the war against terrorism. End this God-awful situation in Iraq. Provide the Iraqis with the back bone that they need to stand up by giving them the tough love and the deadlines that this legislation requires.

   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, I want to extend as well and compliment Chairman Rangel, Chairman McDermott, and especially Chairman Neal, for the timely manner in which they have handled very important legislation that addresses veterans, but specifically to Mr. Neal because it was not lost on him in this piece of legislation that we also needed to address an important segment of our society, our volunteer firefighters. 
   It wasn't lost on Mr. Neal that volunteer firefighters protect approximately 38 percent of America's population and more than 70 percent of our land. It wasn't lost on Mr. Neal that volunteer firefighters save taxpayers nearly $37 billion annually with their efforts. 
   Two-thirds of the 1.2 million firefighters in this country are in fact volunteers. More importantly, it wasn't lost on anyone in this body that it wasn't the FBI, the CIA or the Department of Defense, it was our front line defenders, first responders that were there at the World Trade Center, at the Pentagon and in the fields of Pennsylvania. It's to them, of course, that we owe this debt of gratitude. 
   It was lost, however, on the IRS that when States like mine in Connecticut moved to provide a rebate on their local property taxes, that they sought to tax it and make it ordinary income on behalf of these brave volunteers. This legislation corrects that. I want to commend the Mitchell brothers, both John and Billy, from South Windsor, Connecticut, John McAuliffe of Whethersfield, and Chief Phil Crombie, who are the genesis of this idea and concept and brought it to my attention. 
   Madam Speaker, I again thank Chairman Neal for making it all happen.

<DOCNO>Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. (RECOGNIZING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BLACK HISTORY MONTH -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of this most important month of February, deemed as Black History Month. Let us join with the rest of the Nation in highlighting the significant contributions that African Americans have made to our great Nation, while celebrating this year's theme of ``Carter G. Woodson and the Origin of Multiculturalism.'' 
   Throughout this noteworthy month, we all should take a moment to reflect on the fact that February was designated to make a national appeal to Americans to make note of the tremendous role that African Americans have played in the development and advancement of our country's rich history. February embraces the birthdays of two distinguished Americans--Frederick Douglas and Abraham Lincoln--whose contributions to our society are immeasurable. Let us remember that not only are we honoring Black history; we are celebrating all of our history, American history. 
   This month we should remember the legacy of the illustrious Harlem Renaissance and the contributions this period had in shaping America's cultural heritage. African American writers Langston Hughes, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, James Baldwin, and Toni Morrison have now become major voices in American Literature. Military achievements, not only by the Tuskegee Airmen, the 54th Regiment from Massachusetts, and the 29th Regiment from Connecticut, but by other courageous Black soldiers, have helped to create the gallant Armed Forces of this country. In this month, let us all work together to ensure a positive future for the 40.2 million African Americans who contribute to this Nation on a daily basis. 
   In my home State of Connecticut, we make note of Hartford's Black governors who oversaw the region from 1755 to 1800; fearless Connecticut abolitionists James Mars and J.W.C. Pennington who petitioned Connecticut's legislature regarding voting and social rights for blacks in the 1840s and 50s; and of course the survivors of the Amistad slave ship, who spent days seated in a Hartford courtroom awaiting their fate by a U.S. circuit court judge. Through relics such as the Old State House, Mark Twain House, Harriet Beecher Stowe House, the Connecticut freedom trails, and the Amistad Center for Arts and Culture, we are paying homage to the extraordinary African Americans who have resided in our State. 
   Mr. Speaker, this year during Black History Month, I urge my colleagues and this Nation to remember all of the African Americans who have helped to weave the historical tapestry of America. I urge us all to realize the service, dedication and courage that have emerged throughout the decades. This year, let us truly celebrate Black History as a part of us all. Like our motto says, E Pluribus Unum, Out of many we are one. We are a great Nation formed by the contribution of many, and this month we celebrate one of those outstanding groups.

<DOCNO>Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 3, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007, which holds tremendous hope for the 100 million Americans affected by devastating diseases and medical conditions. 
   In 2001, President George W. Bush announced his final decision on the use of Federal funds for embryonic stem cell research. According to the National Institutes of Health, of the 78 stem cell lines that were declared eligible for Federal funding in the President's executive order of August 2001, only 21 lines are now still available for researchers. The 21 stem cell lines that remain available today are contaminated with ``mouse feeder'' cells, making their therapeutic use for humans uncertain. 
   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, which increases the number of embryonic stem cell lines eligible to be used for Federally-funded research. The bill also authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to support research involving embryonic stem cells meeting certain criteria, regardless of the date on which the stem cells were derived from an embryo. This legislation authorizes the use of stem cell lines generated from embryos that would otherwise be discarded by fertility clinics and it has strict ethical guidelines. These guidelines include stipulating that embryos can be used only if the donors give their written consent and receive no money or other inducement in exchange for the embryos. 
   In the 109th Congress, this bill passed the House by a vote of 238-194 and in the Senate by a vote of 63-37. Unfortunately, the President used his first veto to stop lifesaving stem cell research and set back the hopes of so many who are suffering. Today, we owe it to the millions of Americans with chronic diseases like Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and ALS to invest in this promising research and renew the hopes of millions. 
   Expanding stem cell research has the support of more than 70 percent of Americans. This vote today has the potential to unlock the doors to treatments and cures to numerous debilitating and life-threatening diseases and will send a clear signal that this Congress is committed to improving the lives of millions of patients affected by these diseases. Passage of H.R. 3 is critical and I hope the President listens to the American people by signing this bill that will allow this groundbreaking research to move forward.

<DOCNO>Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. (LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 1592, the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which would address the appalling crimes that continue to occur today simply because of a person's race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, gender, disability or sexual orientation. 
   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 1592 because it is the government's responsibility to defend the civil liberties of every American and prosecute acts of aggression directed at a specific group of individuals. Current federal law provides for enhanced sentencing for hate crimes, however, the vast majority of these crimes are not tried in federal court. This bill would make it a federal crime to cause, or attempt to cause, bodily harm to another person through the use of fire, a firearm, or an explosive device because of the victim's actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender or sexual orientation. Opponents of this bill claim that it would chip away at First Amendment rights. On the contrary, H.R. 1592 would protect First Amendment speech and is only intended to prosecute acts of violence. 
   The bill would also provide federal assistance to states and local jurisdictions to prosecute hate crimes. Specifically, the measure would authorize the Attorney General to make grants available to state and local law enforcement agencies that have incurred extraordinary expenses associated with the investigation and prosecution of hate crimes. Currently, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) collects statistics on crimes based on race, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, and disability. This legislation would require that the FBI collect statistics on gender and gender identity-related bias crimes. 
   I applaud Chairman CONYERS and members of the House Judiciary Committee for their tireless efforts and leadership on this landmark legislation. I would also like to single out the efforts of the gentlewoman from Wisconsin, Ms. BALDWIN, and the gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. FRANK, for their leadership on this issue. During my tenure in the House of Representatives and as a father of three children, I have been a consistent supporter of this measure and believe it is a tragedy that terrible injustices continue to occur in the 21st century. Our nation was founded on the principles of liberty and justice for all and these hate crimes run counter to our national conscience. 
   I believe Robert F. Kennedy spoke most eloquently on this issue while commenting on the loss of Dr. Martin Luther King: ``What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence or lawlessness; but love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country *.*.*'' Today's legislation takes us one further step towards the kind of nation Senator Kennedy and Dr. King worked for and I encourage my colleagues to join me in voting for it.

<DOCNO>Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. (LILLY LEDBETTER FAIR PAY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2007 (H.R. 2831), which is an important step in ensuring the fair and equal pay deserved by women in our workforce. 
   Women have made tremendous strides forward in America's workforce. Earlier this year I was proud to see the election of the first female Speaker of the House. Today, women serve as executives at some of America's largest corporations and in distinguishing professions such as medicine and law. However, 43 years after the Civil Rights Act was enacted by Congress, women such as Lilly Ledbetter continue to struggle to receive payment equal to their male counterparts. These women, who perform the same jobs with the same responsibilities, on average earn only 77 cents for every dollar that their male counterparts earn. They have had to overcome one obstacle after another on their way to earning equal pay and equal respect for their work. 
   On May 29th, 2007, the United States Supreme Court threw yet another obstacle into the path of women in the workforce with the decision of Ledbetter v. Goodyear. According to this decision, if an employee fails to file a claim within 180 days of their employer's decision to pay them less, rather than when she receives a discriminatory paycheck, she will be barred forever from challenging the discriminatory paychecks that follow and forced to live with the discriminatory pay for the rest of her career. If this is allowed to stand, it will be a severe setback to women everywhere. 
   I am proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 2831, which would restore protections guaranteed under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act for victims of pay discrimination who are entitled to justice and fair pay. Contrary to what opponents of this legislation have said, this bill does not eliminate the statute of limitations on claims. What it does is ensure that the clock on the statute of limitations begins once a discriminatory paycheck is received rather than from the point a decision was made to discriminate against an employee. Every discriminatory paycheck will be a new violation of this law and restart the clock for filing a claim. Until the Ledbetter decision, this was the accepted understanding of Title VII and this bill will restore the law prior to Ledbetter. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must continue the fight for pay parity begun by Congress over 40 years ago. I would like to thank Chairman GEORGE MILLER for his leadership on this important issue in the House Education and Labor Committee. This piece of legislation, as well as the Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 1338) introduced by my good friend Representative ROSA DELAURO of which I am also a cosponsor, are needed to ensure women continue to receive equal treatment. I urge all my colleagues to stand up for women workers and vote in favor of this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. (WATER QUALITY INVESTMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Chairman, I regret that I could not be present today because of a family medical matter and I would like to submit this statement for the record in support of H.R. 569, the Water Quality Investment Act. 
   The overflow of sewage into streets, basements, rivers and lakes is a serious environmental and health problem. Communities across New England face a higher risk of sewer overflows because of their aged and deteriorating infrastructure. For example, in my home State of Connecticut, the City of Hartford's sewer system was built 150 years ago.  It was designed to support roughly 15,000 people, but today the expanded system, including the district's central Hartford Treatment Plant, serves 400,000 people in 6 towns. As a result, over 1 billion gallons of untreated sewage overflows every year in Greater Hartford. On average, combined sewer overflows occur more than 50 times a year, which impacts 30 miles of the Connecticut River, including area basements and streets. 
   In Connecticut's First District, which I represent, the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC) is responsible for providing water supply, water treatment and water pollution control to eight cities and towns, including Hartford, West Hartford, East Hartford, Newington, Wethersfield, Rocky Hill, Windsor and Bloomfield. In order to support the rehabilitation and the rebuilding of Hartford's core system, in addition to satisfying State and Federal consent orders to eliminate sanitary sewer overflows, the MDC must expend more than $1 billion. On November 7,2006, the voters in the eight MDC municipalities approved an $800 million bond referendum for addressing the sewer overflow problem. However, without much needed Federal support, the annual cost to homeowners will increase from $119 per year to more than $1,000 per year. In Hartford, the city's residents have an average income less than the region's average and as a result of these regressive wastewater fees, will experience an even greater economic burden. 
   It is because of outdated wastewater systems, clean water needs and the direct impact it has on communities like those in Connecticut that the legislation before the House today is so important. The Water Quality Investment Act would reauthorize Sewer Overflow Control Grants for $1.8 billion over the next 5 years. These grants were authorized in Fiscal Year 2002 and Fiscal Year 2003, however, no funds were ever appropriated and the authorization of this program was allowed to expire. 
   Today and later this week when the House considers the Healthy Communities Water Supply Act (H.R. 700) and the Water Quality Financing Act (H.R. 720), the Democratic Majority is sending a clear message to the American people--this Congress is committed to investing in the health and safety of your family and your community. I urge all of my colleagues in supporting the underlying bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5351, the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2008. I commend the Speaker and the Ways and Means committee for their tireless efforts on behalf of this important legislation. 
   We are at a crucial point in the United States in the development of our alternative energy economy. We are at a point where, without our support, these industries could either grow and prosper or be sent overseas. This bill represents an important step to ensure that alternative energy technologies like windmills and fuel cells are manufactured in Connecticut, not China and in Indiana, not India. 
   Tax credits for alternative energy technologies are crucial to these industries across the United States, and particularly in Connecticut. Connecticut has become a leader in the alternative energy field, particularly in the area of fuel cell technology. We have succeeded as a result of investment in research and development, partnerships between the industry and the state and federal government and the ingenuity and talented workforce in the state. 
   The impact of the fuel cell industry on Connecticut's economy has been powerful. The Connecticut fuel cell industry has created over 2,000 jobs statewide and generates $29 million in tax revenues to the state annually. 
   The Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2008 strengthens and extends the tax credits for investment in fuel cell technology for 8 years, providing much needed certainty to the industry. It also extends the production tax credit for alternative energy technologies like wind, solar and geothermal energy. 
   In a recent New York Times article, a reporter traveled to small towns in Texas that people had all but given up on because of their faltering economies. These same towns are now experiencing a rebirth because the wind industry is bringing jobs back to their community. This is the impact this important legislation can have on towns throughout the Nation and why I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5351.

   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington State. 
   I want to commend Mr. Rangel and Mr. Neal for an outstanding piece of legislation that they have put before us. I am particularly pleased with the extension of credits as it relates to fuel cell and geothermal technology, but wind and solar as well. To extend these credits in a manner that will allow us to become energy independent is something that is long overdue for this Nation. Let us hope that our colleagues on the other side are able to join us in making sure that we take a positive step forward for the future of energy independence. 
   What seems apparently is the stumbling block on the other side is that we are providing that we pay for this, and that we are doing so by, well, taxing a group of people who otherwise go untaxed and yet reap all the benefits of this great Nation. But those poor hedge fund guys who sequester their funds offshore and are making millions of dollars, to subjugate them to a tax, oh, just the thought of it sends a shudder up the spines of our dear friends on the other side. Imagine the people back home, the people that they talk about, that Mr. Burton said need this relief immediately. But to do so by taxing offshore hedge funds? Well, we can't have a part of that. 
   It is time for this country to get serious about energy independence. It is time for us to step up to the plate and for Americans to understand that people who are making funds offshore paying no taxes ought to contribute to making sure that we are able to move  this Nation forward in the direction of energy independence.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address an extraordinarily important issue, one that, quite frankly, is not often discussed on this very floor and needs in so many ways to be brought forward, not only to the attention of the Members of this body, but a dialogue that needs to reach out all across this country to discuss the devastating trends of youth violence. I am pleased to note that colleagues today, including Stephanie Tubbs Jones, Bobby Scott, Yvette Clarke, Donald Payne, Sheila Jackson-Lee and Linda S&#225;nchez, will be coming to the floor under these 5-minute Special Orders to also address this issue of youth violence. 
   There isn't a day that goes by that we don't thank our veterans for the sacrifice that they have made and note the loss of life that has taken place in Iraq and in Afghanistan and the wounded. And we take great pride, and rightfully so, in this Chamber for making sure that we are providing for our veterans, providing especially for those that come home with post-traumatic stress syndrome, and addressing these concerns in a meaningful and significant way. And yet here in our own country, in our cities, in our suburbs, most recently out in Nebraska, violent deaths and shootings take place and seemingly go unnoticed. 
   John Lewis traveled with me to Hartford, Connecticut, to address there a group of citizens concerned about violence in the neighborhood, where in 2006, 16 shootings took place in a single week. At that hearing, a Vietnam veteran, Steven Harris, stood up and said, I appreciate what Congress is doing on behalf of veterans and providing them with post-traumatic stress syndrome relief. But what about the kids in my neighborhood who have to deal with this on a regular basis? What about the youth all across this country who are perishing? 
   There are incredible statistics, Mr. Speaker, that this body needs to discuss in a way that will send hope out to our communities and our neighborhoods. Homicide is the second leading cause of death among 15 to 24-year-olds overall. Homicide is the leading cause of death for African Americans between the ages of 10 to 24 and the second leading cause of death for Hispanics of that age. Guns are a factor in most of these homicides. 
   In a nationwide survey of high school students, 6 percent reported not going to school on one or more days in the 30 days preceding the survey because they felt unsafe at school or on their way to and from school. Children who have witnessed violence in their communities are vulnerable to serious, long-term problems. This country stood and paused and we said the world had changed forever after September 11. But for grandmothers in their communities, the world had changed before that, because this kind of senseless violence continues. 
   This Nation, this Congress, must solve this problem. The problem cannot be addressed explicitly through incarceration. We have ample amounts of punitive measures that exist on our books today. What we don't have is a comprehensive approach to it, reaching out into these communities, assisting and helping and providing the plans such as Bobby Scott has outlined, ``From Cradle to College,'' that provide the hope, that provide the leadership for communities coming together in a manner in which they care about our children. 
   We are aware of what is happening all around the world, and we can come to this floor and chronicle it. But in our own cities, in our own States, we must begin to speak and save our children there.

<DOCNO>Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. (COMMISSION TO STUDY THE POTENTIAL CREATION OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN LATINO ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 512, the Commission to Study the Potential Creation of the National Museum of the American Latino Act of 2007, which would recognize the tremendous cultural contributions of the American Latino community.  
   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 512, which would create a 23 member commission responsible for developing a plan of action for the establishment and maintenance of a National Museum of the American Latino in Washington, DC. Specifically, this commission would be tasked with bringing experts, policymakers, and other interested parties together to discuss a viable blueprint for the museum. The commission would also design a public-private partnership to fund the museum. These recommendations would be reported to Congress within 24 months of the bill being signed into law. 
   During my tenure as Ranking Member of the House Administration Committee in the 108th Congress, the committee held a long overdue hearing on this legislation. In the 109th Congress, I was a cosponsor of this legislation and it passed in the House by a voice vote on September 27, 2006. Unfortunately, the Senate was unable to pass this bill before the adjournment of the 109th Congress. 
   The Latino population in the United States is estimated at 42.7 million, making the community the fastest growing group in the country. They also have a rich heritage in this country that is worth celebrating. I am hopeful that we can finally get this bill to the President's desk for signature and get the process underway for establishing this important museum. As a former high school history teacher, I believe that passage of this legislation is crucial in educating all Americans of our nation's cultural diversity.

<DOCNO>Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. (IMPLEMENTING THE 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1, a long awaited legislative package that will finally fulfill our duty to protect the people of our nation by fully implementing the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. 
   After months of careful investigation into the security weakness that led to the 9/11 attacks, the bipartisan and independent 9/11 Commission proposed a series of reforms necessary to secure our country and prevent future terrorist attacks. These recommendations addressed a number of areas, including revamping the way we fund homeland security, preventing nuclear materials and WMD from falling in the worst hands, and targeting the root causes of terrorism. Yet, despite bipartisan public support for their work, 20 of the Commission's 41 recommendations--nearly half--have gone unfulfilled. 
   Over the past two years, the 9/11 Commission has rated Congress' implementation of their recommendations with failing grades. Protecting the American people is the primary responsibility of our government, and I am proud that one of the first bills considered by the new Congress is the implementation of all of the 9/11 recommendations. This bill meets our duty to protect the nation we serve by requiring the scanning of all air and maritime cargo, increasing resources that will enable our first responders to communicate with each other in times of crisis, and ensuring that we distribute our homeland security funding where it is needed the most. 
   I am particularly grateful that this bill increases our commitment to preventing the worst weapons from falling into the worst hands. During public forums on nuclear nonproliferation I have hosted in the past year at St. Joseph College and Trinity College, many of my constituents expressed their concerns about nuclear materials falling into the hands of terrorists. That threat to our nation is real, and this bill fulfills the 9/11 Commission recommendation to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction and strengthen our nonproliferation programs around the world. 
   More than sixty Connecticut residents lost their lives on that tragic September day in 2001. Over five years later, we owe it to them and their families to finally implement these measures and ensure that such a day will never happen again.

I especially want to applaud the efforts of Norm Dicks and the hard work that he's done not only on the Defense appropriations subcommittee but throughout his career protecting American technology and workforce. 
   This was a great victory today for the American workforce. So many of our jobs here, the critical mass of highly trained, highly skilled workers that reside here in this country don't know what a great favor was done today by GAO. This is a rare occurrence that this happens. 
   But the case that was made by Boeing, that was carried out by Mr. Dicks  and the committee, was so compelling, and the misdirection and information so badly flawed that Boeing was given, that the GAO overturned that decision. 
   The Air Force has 60 days to respond, but let us hope that we can come together and follow the leadership of Mr. Dicks and get those tankers built here in this country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition of the Flake amendment, and I wish to associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished lady from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro). I think she has articulated and laid out very eloquently the argument, an argument that is put forward on this floor that makes all the sense in the world, especially as we seek, in the ensuing days and next week, to talk about farmers and, in essence, fishermen. 
   I don't think there is any greater representation of the American way and the American way of life and rugged individualism than through the eyes of people that labor in agriculture or aquaculture. 
   And so, when you take a look at this very modest earmark so eloquently defended by Ms. DeLauro, it is surprising to me, especially as someone who is the co-Chair of the Congressional Shellfish Caucus, that this amendment would be drawn against such a regional way of looking and promoting and fostering aquaculture and making sure, especially in light of the concerns that Ms. DeLauro raises with regard to foreign entities importing into our country without the kind of care and caution that we know comes from home-grown fisheries, and in this case, shellfish, and the science behind this and the coming together. 
   Government operates best when it operates as a collective enterprise, and this process here, contrary to what the gentleman is saying, is most democratic in terms of representing those fishermen and those farmers who rarely get a chance to come to this floor themselves. But through their representative process, whether it's Puget Sound or whether it's Long Island Sound, from coast to coast, we make sure that their concerns get represented and that there is an opportunity, through this earmark, to make sure that we provide them with the necessary research to continue to foster and grow. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 372, honoring the outstanding contributions that African American singers and musicians have made to the United States. June 2008 marks the 29th year of national recognition of Black Music. It is difficult to imagine American music without the rich and continuing innovations of African Americans. Prompted by Songwriter/producer Kenny Gamble, producer Berry Gordy, and artist Stevie Wonder, President Jimmy Carter designated June as Black Music Month in 1979. 
   From the African American spirituals created and sung by those who were enslaved or who were striving for equal rights, to the celebration of faith in gospel music, to the trials and struggles of life illuminated in blues, the music throughout the years served as a narrative to the African American experience. The number of actual contributors to the African-American Music Movement is immeasurable, and the impact of these artists on American music and culture has been astounding. African American artists have influenced the development of all branches of American popular culture including rock, country, and popular or ``pop'' music. Artists such as Paul Robeson and Marian Anderson, who lived in my home State of Connecticut, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Duke Ellington, Louie Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, Mahalia Jackson, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, and Marvin Gaye set the tone for American music and have influenced artists and musicians across generations throughout the globe. 
   And so Madam Speaker, I rise to celebrate the numerous African American musicians and singers who have enriched and defined the various forms of American Music and urge the passage of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, last week President Bush marked the fourth anniversary his proclaimed ``Mission Accomplished'' in Iraq with a veto. He refused to heed the will of the American people and disregarded the work of this Congress by vetoing the Iraq Accountability Act that called for a new direction in Iraq. 
   Earlier tonight, I supported a bill offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. McGovern that would have provided for the redeployment of U.S. Armed Forces and defense contractors from Iraq. I have believed for some time now that we must begin the safe and strategic withdrawal of our troops. While this measure was defeated, I remain resolved we must change the current course in Iraq. 
   Before the House is a revised Iraq Accountability bill. This bill continues to keep our commitment to our servicemen and women and to the American people. It fully funds our troops, improves military readiness and holds the Bush Administration and the Iraqi government accountable. The bill would provide $95.5 billion to the Department of Defense, but would fence off $52.8 billion, more than half of the funds. This funding would be held by Congress until the Bush Administration accounts for progress on the ground. President Bush would have to report to Congress the progress of the Iraqi Government in meeting key security benchmarks by July 13, 2007. Only with this accountability and another vote by Congress would the remaining funds be appropriated. 
   The era of ``stay the course'' and blank checks without accountability is over. I call upon my colleagues and the President to search their conscience and join me in supporting the underlying bill--a balanced and reasonable approach to Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment offered by Mr. Hoekstra that would strike language requesting an assessment of the national security challenges posed by global warming. As a member of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming and an original cosponsor to H.R. 1961, the Global Climate Change Security Oversight Act, I support the inclusion of this language in the Intelligence Authorization bill. 
   There are serious political, social, economic and national security risks associated with climate change. It is only appropriate that our nation have a National Intelligence Estimate assessing its global warming threat. The National Intelligence Council is already a producing a community assessment on this issue, this provision would simply require that assessment be elevated to a formal National Intelligence Estimate. 
   This type of review is supported by a group of 11 retired three-star and four-star generals and admirals, who on April 16, 2007, issued a report entitled, ``National Security and the Threat of Climate Change.'' This report concludes that global warming presents significant national security challenges the United States. The effects of climate change are projected to have grave consequences for some of the poorest areas of the world--already volatile areas, the instability of these regions would be multiplied. Projected climate change will seriously exacerbate already marginal living standards in many Asian, African, and Middle Eastern nations, causing widespread political instability and the likelihood of failed states. As retired U.S. General Gordon R. Sullivan described before the Select Global Warming Committee, the potential national security threat of global warming in certain regions of the world could potentially be a Petri dish for terror. 
   Climate change is yet another front in the war on terror and now is the time for the United States to fully understand the implications it has on our national security. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Chairman, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 1538, the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act, which would be the first step in addressing poor patient care and problems experienced in navigating the military's medical bureaucracy. 
   In February 2007, the media uncovered the grotesque living conditions, inattentive care, and bureaucratic hassles experienced by some of the wounded soldiers staying at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. However, the situation at Walter Reed is not an isolated case, but a systemic problem that plagues the veteran health care system. A recent review by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) of 1,400 hospitals and other veterans' care facilities found ``more than 1,000 reports of substandard conditions--from leaky roofs and peeling paint to bug and bat infestations.'' In Connecticut, approximately 2,500 veterans are waiting for benefits. The military health care system is understaffed and drowning in a backlog of cases and unable to provide our veterans with the benefits and resources they sacrificed a great deal to earn. 
   The Wounded Warrior Assistance Act would restore the process of integrity and efficiency  in our nation's military health care system. This bill would create a new system of case managers, advocates, and counselors for wounded service members returning from combat overseas to help them get the care they need and to help navigate the military's health care bureaucracy. The legislation would also require the establishment of a toll-free hotline for reporting deficiencies in facilities supporting medical patients and family members. Under H.R. 1538, the Department of Defense (DoD) and the VA would conduct a joint study on the disability evaluation systems operated by both departments in order to improve the consistency between these two systems. 
   I applaud the leadership of Chairman SKELTON and the honorable members of the House Armed Services Committee who crafted the legislation before us today. Congress has an obligation to be a watchdog for our veterans and ensure they receive appropriate care. These men and women have sacrificed their lives for our freedoms and they deserve the best health care and resources our country can provide.

   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Chairman, I regret that I could not be present today because of a family medical situation and I would like to submit this statement for the record in support of H.R. 1684, the Department of Homeland Security Authorization for Fiscal Year 2008. 
   Since its creation in 2003, the Department of Homeland Security has been one of the most mismanaged departments in the Federal Government. Failing to learn from the severe preparedness gaps exposed by the failed response to Hurricane Katrina, the Administration has proposed deep cuts to vital, core programs that assist local communities in responding to disasters. For example, the Administration requested a 52 percent funding cut for the State Homeland Security Grant Program and no funding for the Metropolitan Medical Response System, MMRS, program--the only Federal program that helps first responders, medical personnel, emergency rmnagement workers, business and other stakeholders develop effective, integrated capabilities to minimize causalities in the event of a terrorist attack using a weapon of mass destruction, natural disaster, or public health emergency. Eliminating funding for MMRS would have grave implications for 125 municipal authorities, in 43 States, including Connecticut. 
   In comparison, the Democratic-led House has put forth a bill that invests in securing the homeland and ensures accountability within the Department of Homeland Security. The bill authorizes $39.8 billion for the Department of Homeland Security for fiscal year 2008. This funding would provide our local communities with the tools to respond to terrorist attacks and natural disasters and improve the Government's ability to prevent terrorist attacks through greater information sharing. The bill also authorizes $63 million annually for the MMRS program through fiscal year 2011. Most importantly, the bill includes accountability provisions and provisions to strengthen and streamline management of the Department. 
   We must remain vigilant in protecting the American people and in preparing to respond to terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other emergencies. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the underlying bill.

   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Chairman, I regret that I could not be present today because of a family medical situation and I would like to submit this statement for the record in support of H.R. 1873, the Small Business Fairness in Contracting Act. 
   All too often mega contracts are too large for small business to compete for in the federal marketplace. Last year, the federal government spent more than $417 billion on goods and services in over 8 million contracts in 2006, of which small businesses won about $80 billion (22 percent). Of the $80 billion for small business contracts, $12 billion was actually awarded to large businesses, not small businesses. 
   For the past six years, the federal government has failed to meet its 23 percent small business contracting goal. The bill before the House today would create a fair and open federal contracting system, that would ensure all small businesses have an equal opportunity to secure government contracts. This bill would increase the government-wide goal for small-business participation in federal contracts, limit the ability of federal agencies to bundle small projects into large contracts, and require the Small Business Administration to take steps to reduce erroneous entries in the government's contractor registry. The Small Businesses Fairness in Contracting Act would require no less than 25 percent, an increase from 23 percent, of all contracts be awarded to small-business in a fiscal year. It would also increase the government-wide goal for procurement for small disadvantaged and women-owned businesses to 8 percent from 5 percent. 
   This bill is a vital step for America's 26 million small businesses, including Connecticut's 341,000 small businesses. It is an investment in our nation's small businesses. For every $1 invested, small businesses will contribute $7 to the economy. I call upon my colleagues to join me in supporting a bill that supports a vital national interest--America's small businesses and economy.

And while our colleagues on the other side are heralding the program that they produced, through what I believe to be their good intentions, they are terribly misguided. 
   But it does draw strong philosophical differences between the two parties and our approach. Yes, you would like to privatize Social Security. Yes, you would like to privatize Medicare. And this bill, essentially, is the privatization of Medicare masquerading as prescription drug relief and forbids explicitly the Secretary of Health and Human Services from negotiating directly for lower price while the VA commissioner does. 
   But then you say you introduce competition. Wow. Everybody is for competition. So how do all these plans, why were they enticed into it? The government pays and incentivizes the private sector to get involved in this? That is interesting competition. They incentivize the private sector to compete against the government program. They fund them the money. 
   Oh, and by the way, there is no penalty and no risk if they pull out. The only penalty and risk are on the elderlies' backs, because they can cancel the formulary, they can pull out with no risk and no penalty. It is only the people that fall into the doughnut hole and only the people that have to pay the extra prices that understand why it is so important that government step up and level the playing field for its citizens.

<DOCNO>Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Thank you, Mr. Meeks, and also let me thank my colleagues across the aisle for the solemnity of the debate that has taken place over these last several days. I think it is so important to the constituents that we are sworn to serve, and they deserve to hear the voices that reside within the people's Chamber. 
   This debate, in so many ways, is an echo chamber for what Americans already know. They have found their voice and expressed it in several manners and several forms, most notably in last November's election, where they called for a new direction for this country, not the staying of the course that it is currently on. 
   It is long overdue then that the Congress find its voice as well. Past is prologue, and we must go back to June of 2002 when the President enunciated the Bush doctrine, the doctrine of preemption and unilateralism that has placed us in this situation that we have today in Iraq. 
   He was warned, most notably by people like Scowcroft, Eagleberger, Baker, and Colin Powell about the folly of this effort. It was not Kennedy or Berg or even Larson or other people that spoke out as eloquently as those former members of Bush the Elder's Cabinet. 
   I traveled with Jack Murtha in the buildup to the war, and we met with our ambassador in Saudi Arabia, Robert Jordan, who I said to him, Ambassador, you have a gathering storm here in Saudi Arabia, with all the tensions in the Middle East. And he said, Congressman, you are from New England. Gathering storm, he said? What we have here is the making of a perfect storm.     
   And if we unilaterally invade and attack this toothless tiger, Saddam Hussein, we will unwittingly accomplish what bin Laden failed to do: we will create a united Islamic jihad against the United States. 
   Professor Gram Ellison wrote that ``this occupation has diverted essential resources from the fight against al Qaeda, allowed the Taliban to regroup on Afghanistan, fostered neglect of the Iranian nuclear threat, undermined alliances critical to preventing terrorism, devastated America's standing with every country in Europe and destroyed it in the Muslim world.'' 
   Instead of following the wisdom of Scowcroft and Eagleberger and Baker, Powell, this administration embraced Ahmed Chalabi with all the hubris and arrogance of staying the course. 
   And so we find our troops today in the midst of civil war, in the midst of sectarian, religious, and tribal conflicts that are more about settling old scores that seek revenge over the centuries than about creating a democracy. And it is into that caldron that we wish to send more troops, more troops that 87 percent of the Iraqi public says they want a time line for us to be out of there, and over 50 percent of them think that it is okay to kill Americans. 
   Our troops need leadership that is worthy of their sacrifice. It is important that this Congress on both sides of the aisle, as it has done, understands the difference between the war and the warriors. 
   I conduct hearings back in my district; I listen to what my constituents have to say. And, most earnestly, to those parents, those men and women who come to these hearings and talk about their children in harm's way: Carol Tripp of Bristol said it best, a woman with three of her sons and her  husband stationed in Iraq, who hasn't shared a holiday dinner with their entire family since 2001. 
   I define success by being able to look into their eyes and tell them that the best path forward is the safe, secure, and strategic redeployment of our troops so that our Army can regroup and restore itself and proceed after the people who took the towers down in systematic fashion to go after al Qaeda and continue to regroup.

<DOCNO>Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. (AMENDING THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986 TO RESTORE THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND BALANCE -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I regret that my vote today on rollcall vote No. 518, on final passage of H.R. 6532, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to restore the Highway Trust Fund balance, was not recorded. I was present on the floor and voting during this voting series, but did not realize that the electronic voting system did not register my support for this specific bill. As a cosponsor of this important legislation my vote should have been recorded as ``yea'' on rollcall vote No. 518.

<DOCNO>Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. (HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Thank you, Mr. Neal. I commend you for your hard work on this bill and enthusiastically support it, commending Mr. Rangel and, of course, Mr. Frank who, as we all know from New England, has labored tirelessly along with Senator Dodd from my home State of Connecticut to bring this legislation to fruition. 
   I want to commend our dear friend Mr. McCrery for his remarks, and I have some sympathy with regard to his concerns about procedure. But they pale in comparison to the relief that people in the State of Connecticut, the State of Louisiana, and all across this nation are desiring. I can't emphasize enough the work that Charlie Rangel and Barney Frank have done on this legislation to bring relief where it's greatly needed, as Mr. Levin pointed out, especially in our urban and city areas where the block grants will provide an opportunity and great flexibility for them to do the kind of things and provide the incentives needed to both preserve people in their ability to stay in their homes and expand that opportunity across the State.

<DOCNO>Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. (REGARDING INSPECTOR GENERAL OF COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Thank you, Chairman Towns. 
   I appreciate the opportunity to speak on behalf of this important bill that's a  vital piece of our anti-speculation measures we have passed in the House this session. 
   By elevating the Inspector General of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to the level of a wholly independent office will provide for greater oversight in our commodities markets and, as Mr. Etheridge has said and as Mr. Peterson and the committee acknowledged, was important in terms of us letting all the sunshine we can into what is commonly referred to as the ``dark market.'' And this would provide us a great opportunity to make sure that, on behalf of the American people, that we return the sheriff to the job and bring back much-needed regulation in these areas. 
   I want to thank Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Goodlatte for their leadership and Chairman Waxman and Ranking Member Tom Davis for helping with this legislation. But I must say that the genesis of this legislation comes from individuals from my home State who came to me with concerns about senior citizens having to take their entire Social Security check and put it into home heating oil. And what they had noted is that rampant speculation was driving the costs up in these markets and the laws of supply and demand have been suspended, and what was needed was an antiseptic, a way to open up and look at these markets in terms of allowing the sunshine to come in. 
   As my grandfather Nolan would say, ``It's a simple case of trust everyone, but cut the cards.'' And in this, not only do we have an opportunity to cut the cards, but shuffle and give a new deal to the American people. That's why this legislation is so important. 
   I appreciate all of the work and effort the committee has done. Certainly the surge in oil prices this summer has worsened the concerns on behalf of the American people. It's important, especially given all that has happened as we sit here, that this Congress, that this body do everything that it can to restore oversight and review and bring back to the American people the notion that this is the people's House, and we're watching what's happening on Wall Street on their behalf and empowering people with all the appropriate tools to go after those who will break the law or move outside of the law and not act on behalf of the interests of the American people. 
   Again, I want to thank the chairman. And I want to thank those in the committee for ushering this legislation forward.
