<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Virginia. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and vice-Chair of our caucus for yielding me the time. 
   If his chairman, Mr. Rangel, and Mr. Frank had had their druthers, not to mention the Speaker, this would have been a far better bill than it is today. It would have included the extension of unemployment insurance and food stamp benefits; it would have helped out States with their Medicaid funding crisis. 
   It would also have included home mortgage foreclosure mitigation which has had a tremendous impact upon thousands of families throughout the country. We know that a one-time payment of $600 will do nothing to help a family facing foreclosure, as some 250,000 American families are expected to do every month this year. 
   The Bush White House insisted that this mortgage foreclosure counseling be taken out over the objections of Mr. Frank, and it is a darn shame when this could have had such a positive impact. 
   The impact of home foreclosures isn't limited to the lender and borrower, as we so well know. They have a negative impact on the entire community.  
   The reality is that across this country over the ensuing year there will be nearly 45 million homes that will be foreclosed on. This will shrink the local property tax base by $223 billion this year as a result of the foreclosure of home mortgages. And, yet, when we look around at what has worked, we find that one hotline, for example, is currently taking more than 1,000 calls a day preventing an estimated 200 foreclosures by empowering borrowers with the skills and education they need to work out terms with their lenders and to stay in their homes. 
   That's one of the things that this this bill needs to be about. It needs to be about extending unemployment insurance and the kind of helping hand to America's working class that this party stands for. We are going to pass the bill, but we could and should have done better.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Virginia. (THE TRUTH ABOUT OFFSHORE DRILLING -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Well, Madam Speaker, now we know the truth, that the television ad that the Republican Presidential candidate is using to impugn the patriotism of his Democratic opponent is a complete fabrication. So I guess we shouldn't be too surprised when the same camp is trying to convince the American people that offshore oil drilling is going to reduce the price of gas. Sure, it will--in more than a decade, by two to four cents. In fact, the Bush/Cheney administration's own Energy Information Administration has said that ending the Federal moratorium ``is certainly not going to make a difference in the next 10 years.'' 
   In fact, the Big Oil companies already have access to more than 34 billion barrels of offshore oil they're not even drilling. All it's going to do is give more profits to these oil companies by being able to have publicly-owned reserves on their balance sheets, increasing the value of the oil shares. 
   The fact is, though, that lies and half truths say far more about the people uttering them than the people who are targeted by them.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Virginia. (ETHIOPIA DEMOCRACY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Ethiopia Democracy and Accountability Act of 2007. As an original cosponsor of this legislation, I commend the majority and minority managers and urge strong support for this measure to support human rights, democracy, independence of the judiciary, freedom of the press, peacekeeping capacity building, and economic development in the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia; to collaborate with Ethiopia in the Global War on Terror; to seek the release of all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Ethiopia; to foster stability, democracy, and economic development in the region; and, finally, to strengthen U.S.-Ethiopian relations. This is a message not just to the leadership in Ethiopia, but also to the Secretary of State to take specified actions to support human rights and democratization in Ethiopia. 
   This important legislation expresses the sense of Congress that we should encourage the government of Ethiopia to enter into discussions with peaceful political groups to bring them into full participation in Ethiopia's political and economic affairs. We need to provide the necessary assistance to help achieve such a goal, so this legislation directs the President to provide Ethiopia with resource policy assistance and health care assistance. This legislation is crafted to seek a balance and return democracy to one of the African continent's oldest democracies. 
   Northern Virginia is home to one of the largest African immigrant populations in America, with significant numbers of Nigerians, Ethiopians, Eritreans, Somalians, and Ghanaians. They both enrich our culture, and enrich our appreciation of what a return to democracy in Ethiopia could mean. Ethiopia's peoples--in my District, in our country, and in Africa are the proud representatives of a great and ancient civilization. I believe we have an opportunity and responsibility to them to help restore democracy, human rights, and the rule of law--goals they want desperately for their own country. It should be our country's policy as well to promote these objectives which correspond to our long-term interests. 
   What it ought not to mean was last summer's sentencing of 35 opposition politicians and activists to life in prison--in a case where the prosecution had asked for the death penalty against the defendants, who included Ethiopia's top opposition leaders. Those sentenced to life imprisonment include the leader of the Coalition for Unity and Democracy, Hailu Shawel; Berhanu Nega, who was elected mayor of Addis Ababa; former Harvard scholar Mesfin Woldemariam; and former U.N. special envoy and former Norfolk State University professor, Yacob Hailemariam. 
   Thus, this is an important step for the Congress to take to foster accountability for the actions the Ethiopian government has taken that undermine rule of law and fundamental political freedoms. It is an important act to restrict security assistance for Ethiopia until such time as the President certifies that, among other things, the government of Ethiopia has taken steps to release political prisoners, hold security forces accountable for human rights abuses related to the demonstrations of 2005, and the Meles regime is respecting freedom of speech and information and allowing human rights groups to operate without being harassed. 
   For, as our colleague Chris Smith said, ``Terrorism is not just a military issue; it is also a human rights issue. Terrorists come from countries whose governments failed to respect their human rights. In promoting human rights in Ethiopia, we are attacking terrorism at its roots.'' It is for this reason that the bill also contains provisions for economic assistance and health care assistance for victims of torture, and it authorizes $20 million in 2008 and $20 million in 2009 to carry out these provisions. 
   Equally important, this legislation is intended to promote accountability for the killing of innocent civilians by government security forces, to build the institutions of democracy, and to provide meaningful support for human rights and those who defend them in Ethiopia. It requires our Secretary of State to support human rights by establishing a mechanism to provide funds to local human rights organizations and victims' support networks to provide legal support for political prisoners and prisoners of conscience. In this legislation, we require the Secretary of State to put in place a means to identify and extradite members of the Mengistu regime currently residing in the United States. We are trying, through this effort today, to balance this demand for accountability by supporting democratization through directing the State Department to provide assistance to strengthen local, regional, and national democratic processes through training authorities, political parties, and civil society groups in negotiation skills, campaign management, and election monitoring. The legislation bars non-humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia if the ruling party obstructs U.S. efforts to provide human rights and democracy assistance and training within Ethiopia. It makes it illegal for members of the security forces who have committed human rights violations against civilians to receive U.S. security assistance training. 
   This bill does provide flexibility for the administration by providing a waiver the President can exercise to continue security assistance to programs with Ethiopia that support U.S. efforts on the Global War on Terror and the Ethiopians' efforts in United Nations peacekeeping and whatever is deemed necessary for the U.S. national interests. 
   Mr. Speaker, we cannot and must not remain silent, but rather we have an obligation to do much more in order to promote the rule of law and respect for fundamental freedoms in Ethiopia--a very proud country with a tremendous heritage and history. We want to see Ethiopia move back, as it has in the past, to being our good ally. We can no longer allow this situation to fester.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Virginia. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I support the conference agreement on the Energy Independence and Security Act and I thank Speaker PELOSI for her personal involvement and leadership on this issue. 
   This legislation: (1) reduces our dependency on unstable foreign sources of oil; and, (2) moves us away from our unsustainable reliance on fossil fuels. 
   To do so is absolutely necessary for our economy, our future prosperity and our environment. 
   Americans are reminded how important this is every time they fill up their gas tanks at the pump. 
   While we should not try to manipulate the price at the pump, we can take concrete steps to reduce the amount of oil we consume, by making our vehicles travel further on each gallon they burn, and in doing so, reducing our dependency on too many unstable and unfriendly foreign sources of oil. 
   It's been more than 30 years since Congress last raised automobile fuel efficiency standards, and during the interim, the average fuel efficiency of our vehicles has actually declined. We've regressed in meeting our goals. 
   This legislation corrects this inexcusable abdication of responsibility and mandates tough, but achievable, fuel efficiency standards that will reduce our daily consumption of oil by 4 million barrels per day by 2030--more than twice the amount we import from the Persian Gulf today. 
   Consumers can look forward to savings hundreds or even thousands of dollars every year on their gas bills. 
   This legislation also looks toward the future and crafts responsible policies that, if implemented today, will reduce the threat of global warming and the impact of future oil price shocks by moving us toward cleaner, more environmentally responsible alternative sources of energy. 
   The mandate on commercial power companies to produce 15 percent of their electricity from renewable sources will be the equivalent of retiring 300 coal-fired power plants, the single largest source of carbon dioxide emissions. 
   With this legislation, we have the beginnings of a substantial commitment toward lower greenhouse gas emissions and greater energy independence. 
   By 2030, the policies implemented under this legislation will have achieved about 40 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions reductions most scientists have concluded are needed to avoid catastrophic global climate change. 
   Despite the claims of rising prices, economic disruption and disaster, this legislation will achieve its objectives in a way that will spur innovation, create thousands of new manufacturing and service jobs, increase savings for consumers, put fewer of our earnings into the pockets of unfriendly foreign interests and set up a safer, more secure future for our children. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this conference agreement.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Virginia. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of the Employee Free Choice Act.  
   As President Franklin Delano Roosevelt once said, ``It is one of the characteristics of a free and democratic nation that it has free and independent labor unions.'' 
   Today we are considering legislation that, in the spirit of FDR, would allow workers seeking free and independent labor unions a fair shot. The Employee Free Choice Act would change our current system, one prone to intimidation, harassment and discrimination; into a fairer, more democratic process. 
   In most cases, to get elected to public office in the U.S.--whether at the Federal, State or local level--you need to win a majority of the votes. Based on this democratic principle, The Employee Free Choice Act provides that when at least 50 percent plus one of the employees decide to form a union, the will of that majority is carried out. 
   The current system for organizing a union has some very undemocratic components. Under existing law, employers hold all the cards when it comes to the election process for employees to decide whether they want to form a union. The result is often a bitter, divisive, drawn-out process, in which union supporters are frequently spied on, harassed, threatened, strong-armed, and even fired. Surveys show that in 25 percent of elections campaign workers are fired and that 78 percent of the time employers force supervisors to deliver anti-union rhetoric to workers whose jobs they oversee. While this type of coercive action might seem reminiscent of a banana republic, it is happening today in 21st century America. 
   Madam Chairman, despite the views of some in this body, unions do benefit the working man and woman. Union workers earn 30 percent more than non-union workers; they are 63 percent more likely to have employer-sponsored health care and four times more likely to have guaranteed pensions. 
   We should be removing undemocratic hurdles impeding the formation of unions, not protecting them. 
   Since 1935, the majority sign-up process has been available and used by fair-minded employers. It is a tried and true method, having stood the test of time. Making that process mandatory prevents employer abuse and gives workers a fair shot to form a union. 
   Madam Chairman, our workers need good representation at the bargaining table and unions best provide that leadership. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation which would make the unionizing process fairer, more democratic and more representative of the will of the American worker.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Virginia. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this rule change and real Pay-As-You-Go or ``Pay-Go'' budget requirements. 
   Madam Speaker, the 109th Session of Congress left behind a legacy that is certain to go down in the annals of history as the height of fiscal irresponsibility. Unless you consider an additional $781 billion extension of the debt limit, the fourth of a series approved since 2003 that added an additional $3 trillion in new debt, the 109th Session can boast of no budgetary accomplishment. 
   In fact, it failed in its most basic responsibility: passing a budget for the Federal Government and failing to enact 9 of the 11 regular spending bills that fund the government's operations. 
   But, it simply didn't just fail pass a budget, it actually made the Nation's fiscal problems worse. It took what it already knew were large projected deficits and passed legislation that makes them even larger in future years. According to the Congressional Budget Office, legislation enacted last session actually increases the projected budget deficits by $452 billion above what they would have been between 2005 and 2011 had they never been in session. 
   Over the course of the past 5 years, with full control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, the Republican leadership inherited an estimated 10-year budget surplus of $5.6 trillion and after 5 years has turned the same 10-year period (2002-2011) into a projected budget deficit of $3 trillion--a disastrous $8.6 trillion turnabout. 
   This explosion of budget deficits is largely the result of 2 irresponsible budget policies of the former Republican majority: 
   First, was its decision to waive all budget rules and not to pay for the current war in Iraq and Afghanistan, letting emergency spending bills be enacted within the discipline and restraints on the regular budget process; and 
   Second, was to make tax cuts its highest priority, enacting a series of tax cuts, targeted primarily at the wealthiest Americans and corporations that need them the least, with no offsets. 
   According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the 3 major tax cuts enacted over the past 5 years cost $1.5 trillion between 2001 and 2014. The actual number is somewhat higher once you tack on the additional costs of debt-servicing. 
   I don't pretend to have all the answers to solve our fiscal problems. But, one thing we should not do is more harm. We should not increase the amount of debt our children will inherit. 
   Adopting a real Pay-Go requirement as part of the Rules for the 110th Congress will keep this institution and the White House from digging an even larger budget deficit hole. 
   The pay-go rule we are considering today is not unlike the original one adopted as part of the 1993 budget agreement that required any spending or revenue measure we consider before the full House be fully offset and not increase the budget deficit. 
   The first Pay-Go requirements were adopted in 1993 as part of the largest deficit reduction package that Congress ever approved; a package that passed both chambers with a single Republican vote. It included both real spending cuts and real tax increases and placed us on a course toward balanced budgets. 
   The Pay-Go requirements were subsequently extended as part of the 1995 bipartisan budget agreement and closed the final gap in deficit spending that in 1999 produced the first balanced budget in more than 30 years. 
   We would be in a much better situation today had the original ``Pay-Go'' rule remained in effect. 
   Instead, a Republican-controlled Congress allowed the Pay-Go requirements to expire, enabling them to adopt irresponsible tax cuts that are largely responsible for the deficits we face today. 
   Adopting a true Pay-Go rule today gets us back on track toward responsible fiscal policy. I encourage my colleagues to support its inclusion in the Rules of the 110th Congress.

   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, in a recent international survey, we find that nations around the world think China could be better trusted to lead this world than the United States. It's a devastating conclusion. It would not have been the case even 6 years ago. 
   It's not that people around the world don't acknowledge our military power, but it is our arrogance and the fact that we don't live up to our principles and ideals that this survey reflects. 
   If we are going to win this so-called global war on terrorism, it is not going to be through a military victory. It is going to be because we stand by the values and ideals and principles that define us as a nation and as a people. 
   One of the things that every day undermines those defining principles is keeping the Guantanamo detention facility open, keeping hundreds of people detained without charging them, without enabling them to know what they are charged with and thus being able to defend themselves. It's the antithesis of what this country stands for. That detention facility needs to be shut down. And we need to regain our rightful position as the leader of the free world.

How is that possibly worthy of the sacrifice of our soldiers? Mr. Speaker, it is not. 
   The fact is that, if the President's supplemental for Iraq that he is requesting now is granted, we will be spending almost as much in 1 week, $3.5 billion, as it would take to provide needed health insurance for 4 million poor children for an entire year. Isn't it time to put America's priorities in order?

   Mr. Chairman, the rail system that this amendment funds serves the capital of the free world. Yet, along with Los Angeles, we have the very worst congestion in the country. 
   In fact, when you look at lost productivity, it is the most expensive loss of productivity, congestion in the country and those who are wasting so much of their time in traffic are our government workers. The reason for this deficiency is that we are the only public transit system that doesn't have a dedicated source of revenue. 
   Now, what we are suggesting here, when gas is at $4 a gallon, when it costs over $60 to fill up your tank, we have got to have more public transit throughout the country. But shouldn't we lead the way? Shouldn't we show by example that at least the Washington metropolitan area has a decent transit system? 
   That's what Mr. Davis's amendment does. It does what should have been done years ago. It creates a dedicated source of funding for Washington's transit system. 
   I very strongly support Mr. Davis's amendment, and I thank all of my friends and colleagues who have contributed to it. It belongs on the Amtrak bill. It's all about finding more intelligent, more efficient ways of transportation.

   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007. This bill would give new hope to millions of Americans with debilitating illnesses such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and cancer, and would do so under an ethically stringent framework. We owe it to our citizens living in pain to find cures for these terrible afflictions, and enable them to live out long, healthy lives. While I am aware of the ethical questions raised by stem cell research, I believe it represents one of the most promising medical opportunities in human history. 
   Unfortunately, research on embryonic cells is stagnating because it is currently restricted to the 78 stem cell lines that NIB held before August 9, 2001. Of those 78 lines, only 22 were in good enough condition to be used: Most lines were contaminated by mouse feeder cells and could have been deadly if transplanted into people. In order to make new progress in stem cell research, there is a dire need for researchers to have access to lines that are new and uncontaminated. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that the bill before us would be a strong step toward reclaiming our status as the world's scientific leader and finding cures for millions of Americans suffering from debilitating and often fatal diseases. We must support our medical and scientific communities in their efforts to extend and enhance human life. Doing anything less is a disservice to our country and our citizens.

   This is a bill that all of the Members have an interest in, and all of the Members have issues within this bill that they would particularly like to see increased, and some decreased. But it is a difficult one. 
   She has told me how much she appreciates the ranking member, Mr. Wamp, and I hope Mr. Wamp is listening, how much she appreciates Mr. Wamp's cooperation in coming up with a bill that was acceptable to the overwhelming number of the full Appropriations Committee members when they reported it out to the floor. 
   Now, this bill is $276 million below the President's request. That is extraordinary, and it is the first time that the Legislative Branch appropriations bill has reflected that deep a cut versus the President's request. So if you are looking for fiscal responsibility, you will find it in this bill, more than any other appropriations bill. We congratulate Mr. Wamp, as well as the chairwoman, for coming up with a bill that accomplishes that kind of fiscal responsibility. 
   But if anybody else wants to cut another $100 million, which this amendment would do, below that, then it is concomitant upon the proponent of that amendment to say exactly where you would make those cuts. Because this is the result of a lot of give and take, a lot of compromise, a lot of very conscientious investigation.

Meanwhile, the President continues to pour hundreds of billions of dollars more into the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the first wars in America's history in which most Americans have never been asked to sacrifice anything. 
   The President has offered no means to pay for this war spending. It is being financed solely through increased borrowing. Apparently, the idea is to borrow money, particularly from China, while driving up oil prices that benefit Iran in order to fight the war on terrorism. I am not sure that is such a wise strategy. 
   We send an astounding $60 million a day to China. We now owe China $1.4 trillion. America has never been so deeply in debt to another country in our Nation's history. It is the equivalent of every American borrowing $4,000 from China. 
   Today, the Bush administration will announce that our trade deficit with China is $250 billion, a quarter of a trillion dollars, just this year.

This legal impasse creates an imperative for Congress to address the legal black hole that we have created at Guantanamo. 
   There have been almost 800 people sent to Guantanamo. There are 385 left; and, of those 385, only 80 will be charged and tried with a crime. Now, that means that 90 percent will not even be charged and tried, but it will take more than a decade even to try those 80 people, given the island's remote location. In fact, there's only one courtroom there. 
   Mr. Speaker, every day that we keep Guantanamo open, we damage our credibility and we lose ground in the global war on terror. Congress has an opportunity to change this wrong-headed policy, and we can do so by shutting the facility down and transferring the detainees to the U.S. military brig system. There they will still be under lock and key but also have the right to a fair and speedy trial.

   The Virginia Ridge and Valley Act will protect nearly 43,000 acres of the Jefferson National Forest in southwestern Virginia as wilderness or wilderness study areas and another 12,000 acres as scenic areas. 
   Today, wilderness designations are often very controversial. That's because our public lands are visited more frequently by a much more diverse and engaged public, a public that now holds very different views oftentimes and expectations on how the public land should be used. As a result, we have seen fewer and fewer wilderness designations work their way through Congress. That's unfortunate because saving some of our last pristine public lands from resource extraction is an obligation and should, in fact, be a legacy we can pass on to future generations. 
   My colleague from Virginia, however, is a very persistent colleague. And the time that he and the conservation community have invested to find middle ground and build a consensus to support this legislation is a model that other conservation groups around the country should look to to enact wilderness legislation. It can be done, but it takes that kind of commitment, persistent dedication that Mr. Boucher has shown. 
   This legislation will protect the scenic and undisturbed character of pristine areas of the Jefferson National Forest. 
   Now, while all terrain and four-wheel-drive vehicles are prohibited in the wilderness areas, recreational activities such as hunting, fishing, camping, canoeing, kayaking, swimming, picnicking, backpacking, bird watching, horseback riding, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, spelunking, rock climbing, and so many other outdoor activities are allowed and, in fact, encouraged. So it is not that the public can't be fully and actively engaged in enjoying this land. But motorized traffic will be permitted only in certain circumstances in the 12,000 acres that have been designated as national scenic areas. 
   This legislation, though, will protect the recreational, historic, and natural resources in the delineated areas in a manner that is generally similar to the protections wilderness status affords. By finding consensus, this bill has won the endorsement of all the local governments and the counties that it would affect. It is supported by a broad array of businesses and chambers of commerce and enjoys broad support from conservation organizations. 
   So I encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill. It's a fine bill, and I congratulate Mr. Boucher for bringing it forward.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I have no doubt that the gentleman who has offered it is well intentioned, and he is clearly becoming a leader on moving our country to greater energy independence. But we will not get there by lifting the moratorium on drilling off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. We will, however, invite great harm to established fishing and tourism industries, as well as the environment. 
   Off the coast of Virginia, we will interfere with the U.S. Navy's Virginia Cape Operations area in a way that the Department of Defense has warned us in unequivocal terms would be totally unacceptable and utterly incompatible with the operations that they are currently conducting. They could not conduct very sensitive essential operations off the coast of Virginia that are ongoing if we were to pass this amendment. 
   While it's technically feasible to drill for natural gas, there are also some fundamental, legal and economic questions about whether any drilling offshore could be limited to just natural gas. 
   But I want to focus particularly on the fact that this amendment can't possibly solve our energy problem. 
   The natural gas and oil estimated to be recoverable from the outer continental shelf will not result in lower natural gas prices. It simply takes too long to develop a natural gas field to affect prices in the short term. We are talking 1 to 3 years at least to develop a field. Natural gas from areas currently off limits to drilling won't reduce prices in the long term either, since there is not enough gas there compared to either annual U.S. production or consumption.

   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, the so-called global war on terrorism cannot be won by military might alone. It is a war of ideas and philosophies. Terrorism is the tactic used by people who seem to hate what the U.S. stands for more than they love life itself. But it is hard to hate the concepts of justice, individual freedoms and human rights. 
   The problem is that as long as our enemies can claim that we deny justice and abuse human rights and individual freedoms, we lose ground in this war of ideas. In fact, as long as we maintain the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, we undermine our standing, our credibility, throughout the world. 
   This is not what America stands for. America stands for the concept of habeas corpus and human rights. Guantanamo Bay is unAmerican, and that's why it needs to be closed.

   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. As you know, Mr. Chairman, there have been significant advancements in the development of technologies that allow safe and effective application of contraceptive medicines to wild horses to allow wild horse populations to be maintained at sustainable levels. I believe these medicines have been used in pilot programs running for years as a result of the partnering of private organizations like the Humane Society of the United States with the Bureau of Land Management.

   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. I believe that contraceptives could potentially be effective and also would be a more humane approach to managing wild horses than the current strategy that relies primarily on rounding up wild horses and placing them in pastures where they must be fed for years until they die of old age at a cost of over $20 million a year. 
   It is also my understanding that the BLM signed a memorandum of understanding in October of 2006 outlining a large scale pilot program that will expand the pilot wild horse management effort. 
   I would like to thank you for working with me to see that the Wild Horse and Burro Management Program does not get such a large budget cut as was proposed by the administration. It is my understanding that BLM will be able to move forward with that pilot program under this act; is that correct, Mr. Chairman?

   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I would like to paraphrase a poem that Rudyard Kipling wrote upon the death of his son in World War I that seems particularly apt to the war in Iraq: 
   When they ask why the young men died 
   Tell them it's because the old men lied. 
   Madam Speaker, when the White House announced 4 years ago the U.S. military would attack Iraq under the guise of the global war on terrorism, there wasn't one single uniformed military officer who believed that Iraq was part of a global war on terrorism. Saddam had had nothing to do with the 9/11 attack. 
   Saddam wasn't harboring any al Qaeda cells that did attack us. In fact, they understood that starting a new war would distract us and limit us from accomplishing our immediate need to eliminate Osama bin Laden. Saddam was a vicious, secular, despotic dictator, but he saw al Qaeda as a threat to his control, and al Qaeda viewed Saddam as an enemy of their religious extremist world vision.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank very much my very good friend Chairman Rahall. He has shown a lot of courage and also caring and sensitivity to the situation that confronts these particular Indian tribes. I see my good friend Mr. Scott from Virginia, as well, who will speak to this and my good friend, the ranking minority member, Mr. Don Young; and I thank him for stepping up on this, too. I know that his words are deeply felt, and his support is deeply appreciated. 
   I also want to compliment the staff on both sides. They have done the research. They have provided the accurate information; and without that, there would be a lot of misimpressions that would be going around the floor that could defeat this bill; but the facts are on our side, and that is because particularly the very good, hardworking staff has made sure that the facts have become public. 
   Let me share some of those facts with you. The argument is going to be used that these tribes should go through the regular process at the BIA, and the argument will be made that this just opens it up to gambling and there is going to be another issue in terms of the corruption that is inherent within casino gambling and so on. 
   The fact is that it would be virtually impossible for these Virginia Indian tribes to provide the documentation that the Bureau of Indian Affairs requires. This is a unique situation that does not apply in other States because other States did not make it legal to go into courthouses, local courthouses, throughout the State and destroy the very documentation that is now necessary. 
   Now, of course, the Governor of Virginia and all the previous Governors, including Senator Allen who specifically recognized these Indian tribes when he was Governor, they have all acknowledged there is no question these Indian tribes exist. In fact, they have the oldest treaty that has been in existence in the United States, 1677, signed with King Charles II.     
   But, of course, that was before there was an American government; and, as a result, ironically, we haven't specifically recognized these Indians, because they have the oldest treaty. But these were the Indians that enabled the Jamestown settlers to survive. 
   Here we are, the Queen is at the White House, and we are having all this pomp and circumstance, and the very Indians that enabled it to happen have not been recognized by our government and, in fact, have been treated to some of the worst injustices across this land. From 1912 to 1946, their documents were deliberately destroyed. 
   In 1924, there was a Racial Integrity Act passed by a white supremacist, Dr. Walter Plecker. He was head of the Department of Vital Statistics, very politically powerful. And that, in effect, made it a crime to be identified as an Indian. You had to check a box ``white'' or ``colored'' throughout the State in the parlance of that time. 
   My friend and colleague from Virginia knows what I mean, and he believes it, because he knows Virginia history. Many of our colleagues, though, might not believe that this could happen; and, yet, it did. It was a penalty of a year of imprisonment for identifying oneself as an American Indian. So they don't have the documentation. Bureau of Indian Affairs would say, yes, we would recognize you, there is no question you exist, but it won't be in your lifetime. 
   Well, 400 years. Isn't this time? Now, obviously, there has been a lot of intermarriage, but the fact is, there are records, and we can produce those records. But we don't have the time, and it doesn't seem to be fair to force these Indian tribes through a process that may fail only because of governmental action, a grossly unjust governmental action. 
   So gambling is not an issue. These Indian tribes, even though they should certainly be on a par with all other Indian tribes, have compromised, have accepted language that prohibits them from being able to gamble, even bingo. The State gets an enormous amount of money from lottery, but they can't participate. They have accepted that. This is a matter of pride for these Indians. 
   This is a matter of pride. These Native Americans want to be able to tell their children, and their grandchildren, and their grandchildren, in turn, their grandchildren, we were the ones that enabled the English settlement to survive. We have a proud tradition. We were recognized by the United States Congress. 
   Now, hopefully, at some point, the other compromise we have made in terms of putting land into trust, that will be rectified, too, but that's not going to be immediately put into trust. We compromised with the communities; we have gone through all of the possible procedures that might raise some objection to this. 
   Now, Members may come to the floor who, I suspect, have not read the bill, with some objection. I don't think it's a matter of bias, but it certainly is a matter of concern that there has been abuse on the part of some lobbyists working with Indian tribes. We understand that. 
   But, gosh, this is a unique situation. This is a matter of injustice that cries out to be rectified. This bill rectifies that injustice. Hopefully we can do it in time for the actual date of the English settlers landing at Jamestown. It's 400 years overdue. 
   Again, I thank the chairman, the ranking member, and I thank the Speaker for the time. In advance, I thank my colleagues for doing the right thing.  
   Mr. Speaker, if floor procedures were to permit, I would address the members of the six Virginia tribes seeking Federal recognition. 
   I would say that I know their quest has been a long struggle to assert their identity and their rights.  
   Despite centuries of racial hostility and coercion by the Commonwealth of Virginia and others, they have refused to yield their most basic human right and have suffered and lost much. 
   But, throughout the centuries you have retained your dignity and supported your people. 
   When it appeared that no one else would, when little was available, when even the doors of the public school house were closed to your children, you have never yielded to those who said you didn't exist. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would say to the Virginia tribes that win or lose today, you have already won by refusing to yield and by remaining true and faithful to who you are. 
   I would also say that it has been an honor for me to have helped carry this legislation. 
   While it is less than ideal, it moves you closer to the day our national government recognizes you exist. 
   Mr. Speaker, as Member of this chamber know, the crafting of congressional legislation is far from a perfect process. But, when it speaks, it speaks with the people's voice. 
   Today, I encourage my colleagues to speak and finally affirm that the Virginia tribes exist and deserve Federal recognition.

   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 291, which supports the goals and ideals of National Peace Officers' Memorial Day to honor Federal, State, and local peace officers killed or disabled in the line of duty and calls upon the people of the United States to observe such a day with appropriate ceremonies and respect. 
   I am proud to be a co-sponsor of this resolution and support the recognition of May 15th as National Peace Officers' Memorial Day, a day dedicated to the recognize and pay tribute to more than 870,000 law enforcement officers throughout the United States, and those officers who are killed or disabled in the line of duty. 
   It is estimated that more than 56,000 law enforcement officers are assaulted every year, and 143 law enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty in 2006. Of those 143 killed in the line of duty last year, we also lost two outstanding law enforcement officers, Detective Vicky Armel and Master Police Officer Michael Garbarino of the Sully Police Station of Fairfax County in Virginia. 
   Exactly 1 year ago today, on May 8, 2006, Detective Armel and MPO Garbarino were both shot and killed when a suspect using a hunting rifle opened fire on them in the parking lot of the Sully District Station. Detective Armel died on the scene and MPO Garbarino died 9 days later while in the hospital. 
   Both officers gave a combined 40 years of service, protecting our country. They died heroically trying to protect their fellow servicemen. Today, they, along with all other peace officers, are being honored in our hearts and minds. This week, a monument will be unveiled at the Sully Police Station in Fairfax honoring Detective Armel and MPO Garbarino and a full memorial service is also planned. 
   Detective Armel and MPO Garbarino, along with the hundreds of thousands of other law enforcement officers that serve us or were injured or killed in the line of duty, deserve our support. We owe the thousands of men and women who put their life on the line the recognition and gratitude for all their hard work, tireless efforts and daily life threatening situations that they encounter, to protect and serve us. I urge my colleagues to vote for H. Res. 291.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Florida for yielding me the time. 
   I would also like to address my good friend from Washington, also Mr. Hastings, as well as my friend from Connecticut sitting behind Mr. Hastings, because I heard his statement earlier which reflected the statement of the gentleman representing the minority on the Rules Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to address these concerns, legitimate concerns, that have been raised, and explain why I think you would agree that what we are doing today is not only appropriate and proper, but well-justified. 
   There was a white-tie dinner at the White House last night. The country, particularly Virginia, is celebrating the 400th anniversary of the Jamestown settlement. But these six Indian Tribes are the reason why those English settlers were able to survive. They showed them how to survive. They sheltered them. They taught them how to grow the plants that were native to North America. They took care of them. Subsequently, when the English settlers got on their feet, they displaced these Indians, took their land and treated them pretty badly. 
   Finally, in 1677 there was a treaty signed with King Charles II. There was no American government at the time. It was the only government that could sign a treaty. It is the oldest Indian treaty in existence today. It continued, that treaty, but the implementation of it did not. The English government, in other words, its settlers here, violated that treaty at every opportunity, diminished these tribes and took their land. 
   Then, to compound this situation, and to understand why this is a unique situation beyond the 400th anniversary, in 1924 the Commonwealth of Virginia passed what was called the Racial Integrity Act. It was sponsored by a white supremacist who had alliances with the Nazi government in Germany, we understand. It was a very bad time in American history. 
   This law allowed the Commonwealth of Virginia to destroy the documents that proved the existence of these Native American families. They legally went into the courthouses and destroyed the birth records, they destroyed everything that identified them as Native Americans, and that is why there is a unique situation here. They don't have the documentation that they would need to present to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
   This is compounded, of course, by the fact that this recognition process is almost impossible. We wouldn't want to wish it on our worst enemy, to have to go through what Native American tribes now have to go through. It is demeaning and deliberately frustrating. And they were told, well, you might get recognition, but certainly not in your lifetime. These Native Americans have been mistreated by this country. 
   Now we have compromised. You could say we have unfairly treated them again, but it is the only way to get this recognition through in time for the celebration of the Jamestown settlement. 
   We said, we are not going to treat you like other Native American tribes. You are not going to be able to have  gambling, to have casinos, to even play bingo. We are going to prohibit it in this legislation, just to reassure people who are concerned about gambling, and understandably, given all of the corruption that has occurred, Jack Abramoff and so on. I don't have to get into all that. We made the compromise, and they reluctantly agreed to it. 
   Then, even though they have 500 acres that everyone agrees is theirs that should be put into trust, we are going to hold back and require all of the environmental processes and so on to be gone through by the Department of Interior. Whatever that administrative process is, they have to wait and go through all of that in order just to have their own land put into trust. Another compromise. 
   We have compromised in every way we could. That is the reason for the closed rule. We have talked to everyone that appeared to have any opposition. 
   Mr. Wolf had legitimate concern about gambling. We tried to bring this to the floor before. He has blocked it. I can understand his concern. But this is a unique situation. We have addressed it. We have addressed that issue on gambling. Mr. Wolf now supports the bill, he has told me. 
   Mr. Young supports the bill, because he has have looked at it extensively. I don't believe my good friend from Connecticut is on the Natural Resources Committee and may not have participated in those discussions, all of those compromises that have led us to this point. 
   But I think if you look at the justice of this situation, if you look back at the truth of what has occurred to these Indians, you have to come to the conclusion that this is a unique situation. This is justified. In fact, this is urgent. 
   There are some representatives of the tribes here today. They have been so frustrated, cynical even, disappointed that the Congress won't understand what they understand and what they would like to be able to pass on to their children. 
   The only people that would ever educate them and their ancestors were Christian missionaries. They were forbidden to go to public schools. They were forbidden to have jobs. They couldn't get their children out of hospitals if they called them an American Indian because they would be subject to a year in prison. 
   I don't want to go into all of this, because I would like to put this behind us, because it is a very sad chapter of American history. Hopefully that chapter is about to end and a new chapter will begin with this legislation. 
   That is why I would ask my colleagues, approve this legislation. Do the right thing. Do it in time, so we can honestly celebrate with the people in Jamestown and with these tribes. 
   These tribes deserve recognition. They deserve to be able to have the kind of pride that they have merited through their persistence. They are extraordinarily patriotic, loyal to this country, honest and obedient. They are good people. Let's pass this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. I would ask my friend from Connecticut to listen to my response to the points that he just made because I know he is a fair man. And when he considers the fact that, first of all, the Narragansett Tribe was recognized in the 1990s with a similar prohibition, and they don't gamble. 
   This particular tribe, they were raised by Christian missionaries. They believe gambling is a sin. They could be operating bingo parlors down the street today. They don't because they believe it is wrong to do so. They don't want to gamble. 
   But they are unique, and I would say to my friend, in 1912 through 1946, the Bureau of Vital Statistics in Virginia systematically erased all reference to Indians in all public records. That is unique. That hasn't happened in other States. The Governor of Virginia recognizes these tribes. They have been recognized for hundreds of years. 
   And the fact is, we are not bringing this legislation up all of a sudden now.  This legislation we have been trying for 8 years to get through; 8 years I have sponsored it. But these Indian tribes didn't have any money to influence the process. 
   The Racial Integrity Act of 1924, and I go back to this, as embarrassed as I am about the fact that it passed the legislature of Virginia, required all persons to register as ``white'' or ``colored'' in the language of those days, and it made it a criminal offense for Indians not to so register. That is why they were eliminated in the State. It is what a historian called a paper genocide. That is why this is a very unique situation. It is not all of a sudden. For 8 years, we have been trying to pass this legislation. The Governor recognizes they exist, and it is not about gambling. 
   It is understandable you would assume it is about gambling. It is not, and we have examples of other tribes that are not gambling today that have similar prohibitions. So I would say to the gentleman, please do the right thing. Read the bill carefully, and I trust you will support it as a result.

They will also help families that are on the cusp of losing their homes to be able to keep their homes. This is so important. 
   Mr. Speaker, as many as 7 million families will lose their homes by the end of this year. In fact, mortgage defaults are up by 72 percent.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Virginia. (UNITED STATES-PERU TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the time and rise in support of H.R. 3688, the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement. Peru has been a longstanding ally in the region with the war against illegal narcotics and has committed to opening its markets and providing American businesses, farmers, ranchers and workers the opportunity to establish economical ties in that country. 
   Because of globalization and the benefits of growing business, cultural, and technological connectivity, Peru has become one of the fastest growing economies in Latin America with an 8 percent GDP growth in 2006. Our two-way trade with Peru has doubled over the last three years reaching $8.8 billion in 2006, with U.S. exports reaching $2.9 billion. However, because of the most-favored nation tariff rates and the various preference programs, including the Andean Trade Preference Act and the Generalized System of Preferences, 98 percent of Peru's exports enter the U.S. duty free. 
   While Peru's number one source of imports comes from the United States, U.S. products are subject to tariffs as high as 20 percent. With this agreement, the playing field will even out for U.S. businesses and move us from a one sided agreement to a full partnership. Once this agreement enters into force, 80 percent of U.S. consumer and industrial products will enter Peru duty free, while remaining tariffs phase out over ten years. 
   Like our past free trade agreements, Peru will prove to be beneficial to the U.S. economy. In the last 3 years, we have entered into several Free Trade Agreements with Chile, Singapore, Australia, Morocco, Bahrain, Oman, and several Central American nations and the Dominican Republic under CAFTA. And the results of these agreements have proven to be beneficial to the U.S. economy, businesses, and workers alike. 
   Three years after the U.S.-Chile FTA entered into force, our exports more than doubled reaching nearly $7 billion last year. Likewise, our exports to Singapore nearly quintupled over the first three years also reaching $7 billion. In 2006, one year after implementing the CAFTA-DR FTA, the United States exported $19.6 billion worth of goods, up 16% from the previous year. In 2005, almost 4,000 companies exported goods from Virginia of which 82 percent were small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with fewer than 500 employees. 
   But free trade agreements are more then just buying or selling products. They are also about adhering to sets of rules such as respect for intellectual property rights and with this agreement enforcement of international labor and environmental protections. 
   A free trade agreement with Peru will establish greater protection for Intellectual Property rights, a growing concern for U.S. businesses and a particular concern for the N. VA technology community. It is estimated that intellectual property piracy costs the U.S. economy between $200 and $250 billion per year in lost sales and is responsible for the loss of 750,000 jobs. This agreement will improve standards for defending intellectual property by including state-of-the-art protections for digital products such as U.S. software, music, text, and video. 
   Peru is the first free trade agreement that includes fully enforceable commitments to adopt and maintain fundamental labor rights as stated in the International Labor Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at work. This agreement will also include critical provisions emphasizing our commitment to our environmental values by addressing the impacts of illegal logging and establishing specific and enforceable requirements to prevent the trade in illegally sourced timber. 
   Finally, this agreement will emphasize U.S. support for a country that values democracy,  economic freedom and growth. Trade with Peru will continue to significantly increase opportunities for economic growth and help Peru further develop and modernize its economy. Recently, Peru has experienced a decline in their poverty rate from 54.3 percent in 2001 to 49.5 percent in 2006. 
   As a friend of trade and of Peru, it is essential we continue to cultivate this partnership so our two nations can continue to prosper and be competitive in this growing global economy. I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Thank you, Madam Speaker. I won't take that much time. I do want to thank the chairman for his masterful leadership on this bill, and I do want to clarify that the intent of this legislation is to authorize the Treasury Department to strengthen credit markets by infusing capital into weak institutions in two ways: By buying their stock, debt, or other capital instruments; and, two, by purchasing bad assets from the institutions, in coordination with existing regulatory agencies and their responsibilities under this legislation, as well as under already existing authorization for prompt, corrective action and least-cost resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Virginia. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Speaker, under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, the Treasury Department's Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) will have the ability to support the financial system through the purchase of securities and through investing in equity/preferred securities. I strongly believe equity infusion if used wisely will have greater benefits for our economy and yield higher returns to American taxpayers. 
   A strong consensus among financiers and economists has developed supporting these conclusions. George Soros, Joeseph Stigliz, Bradford Delong, Paul Krugman, John Makin, Alex Pollack, Lucien Bebchuk, and Edmund Phelps are a sample of the bipartisan expertise that has contributed to the debate and strongly support the finding that using capital infusions rather than distressed asset purchases alone will have a far greater re-invigorating effect on our economy. 
   If done effectively, equity infusions will introduce 10 to 12 times the amount of the initial government investment into our credit markets. This means that capital infusions of $700 billion would yield credit flow effects totaling $8.4 trillion. In contrast, distressed asset purchases of $700 billion yield credit flow effects of only $700 billion. Capital infusions could give us 12 times the support for the communities and small businesses that badly need credit. 
   The capital infusion approach would involve using Warren Buffett type investment strategies and would result in the government owning equity interests in the institutions which are assisted. If these government investments do only half as well as Buffett's investments in distressed institutions such as Goldman Sachs, U.S. taxpayers will earn as much as $200 billion profit when the financial sector recovers. This is far beyond any forecast return to taxpayers from buying distressed assets. In fact the difference for taxpayers of the two methods could be as large as $375 billion. This will result in lower taxes longer term and better health care, better schools, and a cleaner environment. Because it is sound, transparent and effective, it will restore global confidence in the U.S. economy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act. I want to congratulate Congressmen Kennedy and Ramstad for their excellent work on this bill. Their effort to secure parity for all Americans suffering from mental heath conditions has truly been an historic one, and I am proud to stand here today and support the House's comprehensive mental health parity bill. 
   Mental health conditions are the leading cause of disability for Americans aged 15-44, and are implicated in 90 percent of the more than 30,000 suicides that occur here annually. Productivity loss due to depression costs employers an additional $31 billion per year before disability claims are even taken into account. Every day, patients suffering from these debilitating conditions are denied treatment by insurers who do not provide mental health coverage--patients who could be treated safely and effectively thanks to new advances in medicine. 
   Mental illness is, according to nearly all medical experts, a biologically-based illness just like getting cancer, or diabetes, or the flu. But in addition to the horrendous costs that untreated and unchecked mental illness imposes on patients and society as a whole, failure to provide parity in coverage for mental illness stigmatizes patients suffering from mental health conditions and decreases the likelihood that they will seek treatment that could aid their suffering and enable them to be more productive members of society. This unjust stigmatization has no biological or medical basis, and yet it threatens promising American lives every day. We do not blame cancer patients for having cancer--why should we treat patients suffering from mental health conditions any differently? 
   H.R. 1424 is a comprehensive mental health parity bill that will ensure access to vitally needed treatment for countless Americans currently suffering from mental health conditions. Again, I applaud my good friends on their efforts on this bill, and I am proud to support this historic legislation here today.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Virginia. (CONDEMNING THE ONGOING PALESTINIAN ROCKET ATTACKS ON ISRAELI CIVILIANS -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, over the past few days we have witnessed the Annapolis peace process come unraveled. There have been grave escalations between Israel and Hamas. These are a symptom of failed policies, irresponsible actions, and a lack of strategic thinking. Further escalation of the violence in Gaza may deal a fatal blow to the credibility and viability of any peace process. It would further erode support for the peace process. It would further erode support for the peace process among both Israelis and Palestinians. 
   No one can help but feel deep concern for the residents of Israeli communities near Gaza, who have been suffering from a campaign of Qassam rocket attacks. Israel has the right and must take measures to protect its citizens, as well as to seek to free its captured soldier Gilad Shalit. But excessive response that endangers innocent lives and threatens emergency care and services in hospitals is likely to cause graver harm than good. 
   Certainly Hamas understands that its crude rockets, while able to create fear and suffering in Sderot and, now, Ashkelon, can neither destroy Israel, nor break its economic blockade--just as Israel's citizens and military leaders appreciate that while its air force and army can achieve lethal short-term tactical gains in Gaza, this strategy has only enhanced popular support for Hamas, coalesced West Bank sympathy for the Gazan population, and harmed any realistic chances for lasting peace.  
   I firmly believe that any realistic, sustainable resolution to this crisis will require all parties including the United States to engage, directly or indirectly, to achieve a ceasefire. For that reason, I would prefer that the resolution before us were focused not on condemning one side, but rather on supporting more constructive and balanced efforts to achieve a meaningful cease fire and constructive engagement. I believe that any resolution of this conflict needs to recognize and address the current humanitarian crisis facing the people of Gaza. How many more innocent Israelis and Palestinians will die or be wounded before our country attempts a more productive policy approach? 
   While the Bush Administration has recently become more proactive in its efforts to attain a ceasefire, stabilize Gaza, and re-build Palestinian national unity, the policy of not including all parties and of blockading Gaza, risks making our country less and less relevant. We need more constructive leadership on all sides.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran's vitriolic, anti-American, Holocaust-denying leader, just concluded the first ever trip to Iraq by an Iranian President. Many commentators in the Middle East hailed the visit as a diplomatic success for him. Before our invasion, no Iranian President would have dared to step foot inside Iraq. He was received by Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki not with one, but four kisses for luck at a staged press conference with Iraqi media. 
   I quote Ahmadinejad: ``The Americans have to understand the facts of the region. Iraqi people do not like America.'' 
   After 6 years in Iraq, 4,000 American lives lost, tens of thousands wounded, and $570 billion spent, this is what we have to show for it? Iran's anti-American leader being given the opportunity to try to humiliate us at a joint press conference with Iraq's leader? 
   Mr. Speaker, we are seeing the fruition of our strategic blunder in Iraq. The groundwork has been laid for a Shiite-dominated Iraqi theocracy, loyal to Iran and diametrically opposed to our strategic interests in the region. We can stay this course or chart a new direction that will end this failed policy and bring our troops home. 
   It's about time we chose a direction that is worthy of the patriotism of our troops and the sacrifices of their families.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Virginia. (RECOGNIZING AND HONORING EARL LLOYD FOR BECOMING THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN TO PLAY IN THE NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION LEAGUE -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend Mr. Davis, and also his excellent staff assistance provided by William Miles and Roberto Valencia. I very much appreciate the work that has gone into this. 
   I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 286. It recognizes and honors Earl ``Big Cat'' Lloyd for tearing down the color barrier and becoming the first African American to play in the National Basketball Association. 
   Earl Lloyd was born in Alexandria, Virginia, on April 3, 1928, at a time in our Nation's history when racial prejudice was intense. 
   Mr. Lloyd developed his passion for the game of basketball as a star at the segregated Parker-Gray High School. This was well before Parker-Gray was joined with George Washington High School into T.C. Williams, which subsequently has been made famous by the movie ``Remember the Titans.'' 
   He was twice named an All-American at West Virginia State College, where he led his collegiate alma mater to two conference and tournament championships, including the school's only undefeated season in 1947-1948. I am told our colleague ED TOWNS was actually recruited by West Virginia State or played with them, but, anyway, he has some connection. But this is about Earl Lloyd. 
   Drafted by the Washington Capitols in 1950, Mr. Lloyd played his first game in the NBA on October 31, 1950. Imagine. This was the first time that the NBA actually allowed somebody to play in the NBA who could actually jump. Over the course of nine seasons, interrupted by a 2-year stint in the Army, Mr. Lloyd played in 560 games, helping carry his team to an NBA championship in 1955. Mr. Lloyd later became the NBA's first African American assistant coach, and went on to be the head coach of the Detroit Pistons. 
   When I spoke to Earl yesterday, he wanted to acknowledge this honor on behalf of all the great African American players along the way who never got a chance to play in the NBA solely because of their race. His mom used to tell him, ``Earl, never fold up your tent, never give up, and never disappoint the people who love you.'' He had just returned from the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association Tournament. For decades, that used to be called the Colored Intercollegiate Athletic Tournament. How easy it is to forget the way things used to be, even in our lifetimes. 
   I trust that this resolution will receive the unanimous support of my colleagues, and I thank the dozens of Members who were willing to sign on as cosponsors. Mr. Lloyd deserves this recognition.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I cannot imagine how more tragic life could be than to be the parent of a child and be told that their father or mother is not going to ever see them again, that he or she was killed in Iraq. This is the month of military families where we recognize military families, and the best thing we could do is to say 2,100 children having been given that information is enough, but this is also the anniversary of the Columbine massacre. 
   At the very time when we are offering our condolences for more than 30 people being slaughtered at Virginia Tech. While it is certainly appropriate to grieve with those parents who thought they were sending a child to a nurturing, secure learning environment, only to find that their child's life was cut off before they could realize their potential, it is even more appropriate that we act and respond to these tragedies, to try to prevent them, because we know unless we can reduce the proliferation of firearms in our society, that this will continue to happen time and time again. 
   Our words of condolences after a tragedy will be hollow unless we can stand up before the fact to the gun lobby and to those who think that we can continue to offer grievances and not change the situation. 
   Mr. Speaker, we need to renew the assault weapon ban. We need to end the gun show loophole. We need to restrict handgun purchase to no more than one per month. We need to stop these tragedies from recurring again and again and again.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee for yielding. 
   I will vote for this. I was a cosponsor of this. And certainly Mrs. McCarthy deserves credit for bringing it to the floor. 
   But I do have concerns, as the chairman does, that this needs to be very tightly regulated because it is quite liable to allow thousands of people who should not have access to guns to be able to do so by dropping their mental health treatment. There are 190,000 veterans who, because of their experience in combat, have had serious mental illness problems, but it appears that if they drop the treatment that they have been in, they can become eligible to purchase guns. Again, much of this is going to be in the regulation and the good judgment of States to make it work properly. 
   It is not a gun control measure, as Mrs. McCarthy, stated. It does nothing about the fact that we have hundreds of millions of guns in circulation and tens of thousands of people die from those guns, the vast majority are innocent victims, every year, more so than any civilized nation. It doesn't address issues with regard to the second amendment where the Supreme Court has made it clear there is really not a right for individuals to own guns but rather for States to have well-regulated militias. These are issues that need to be addressed at some point by our country. 
   But this bill, hopefully, will address a very egregious situation where the person that the court had determined to be mentally deranged was allowed access to firearms that he never should have gotten. There are other problems in other States that could have allowed such a thing to happen. Hopefully, this bill will clean up this record-keeping system that sufficient resources will be made available. 
   But, again, Mr. Speaker, this country ought not be allowing people to be buying assault weapons, 50 caliber sniper rifles and weapons that clearly are used for military purposes, not for purposes of recreational hunting. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill will pass unanimously and at this point, it should.

   Yesterday, we debated the homeland security bill, and we'll continue today, but we should make the public aware that beyond the issues that we seem to be distracted by, the main point about the homeland security bill is that it strengthens our borders by providing funds for 3,000 additional border patrol agents. It also prioritizes the need of our first responders while doubling the amount of cargo that will be screened at our airports. 
   Democrats are going to bring a veterans and a military construction bill to the floor that includes the largest increase in veterans health care funding in the 77-year history of the Veterans Administration. 
   We will also be bringing to the floor the Energy and Water and Interior appropriations bills. Now the Democrats will address the important issue of global warming in those bills. These bills also show that, as Democrats, we recognize what a serious problem that is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Speaker, as President Bush allows the war in Iraq to drag on, with no change in policy and no end in sight, it is important that we hear what our combat soldiers are saying on the front lines of that war. Over the weekend, The Washington Post published a story on the First Infantry Division of the First Battalion, which has been patrolling the streets of Baghdad for the last 14 months. Those troops are tired, bitter and skeptical. One such soldier told the reporter, and I am quoting, ``I don't think this place is worth another soldiers' life.'' 
   Our soldiers are also frustrated that decisionmakers here in Washington don't fully realize what is going on. Quoting another soldier: ``They just know back there what the higher-ups tell them. But the higher-ups don't go anywhere, and actually they only go to the safe places with a little bit of gunfire. They don't see what we see on the ground.'' Having been to Iraq a number of times, as many of my colleagues have, how true that is. 
   Madam Speaker, none of us in this Chamber can imagine what our soldiers go through on a daily basis in Iraq, but the White House needs to start listening to them. It is well past time to bring our sons and daughters home from this fiasco we call the war in Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the McCrery substitute and in support of the Rangel-Levin-McDermott underlying bill. 
   As we continue to expand and open our markets to new competition, we have an economic and a moral responsibility to ensure that our domestic workers are equipped with the necessary skills and tools to compete in a global market. 
   I support free trade, which is all the more reason to support the reforms and expansion of a program that will help our workers adversely affected by trade and the globalization of our economy. It is estimated that more than 3 million service workers' jobs will go overseas by 2015, so the expansion of coverage to the service workers section is especially important and appropriate. 
   But the McCrery substitute will limit trade assistance adjustment by not offering any support to service or public sector workers. The substitute will also set a cap on available training funds, denying many workers the tools and resources to be more competitive in the global economy. And as I read the language of the substitute, for the first time of the 70-year history of the unemployment insurance system, the substitute would allow States to deny unemployment insurance benefits to dislocated workers. The underlying bill provides American workers with the support and tools needed to expand job training opportunities and transition workers into 21st century jobs. 
   This bill, H.R. 2930, triples the current job training cap to $660 million by 2010 and increases the health care premium subsidy to 85 percent. This is an important investment in the American workforce to enable Americans to remain competitive in the global economy. 
   So I ask my colleagues to vote against the Republican substitute and vote for H.R. 2930, the McDermott-Rangel-Levin bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Virginia. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Chairman Frank, thank you for trying to save America's economy. I don't know anyone who could have understood the intricacies of this bill, held your own with the Bush-Cheney administration on behalf of the taxpayer and navigated Congress' political waters as skillfully as you have. If this bill passes and the markets have stabilized, it will be to your credit and perhaps, more importantly, when the taxpayer reaps the benefit of this bill, they will look back to your leadership and your legacy. 
   I want to say a word about that latter point. This is a good deal for the taxpayer, and let me explain why with the help of a current analysis from the staff of Barron's magazine. This is the time to be buying--when everyone else wants to sell. But the government is the only agency that can do so because we can borrow at 3 percent with no collateral requirement. There is such a gap today between today's panic prices and tomorrow's inherent value that the taxpayer is in an enviable position. But the Treasury must act as a proxy for the taxpayer. There's no alternative to that. 
   Now, once we start buying tranches of securities, even with a third of the money authorized by this bill, the securities markets will bounce back and, more importantly, so will the value of residential real estate. Treasury is likely to be buying mortgage debt at  an average of 65 cents on the dollar. Since Treasury borrowing is about 3 percent with no collateral requirement, we will get about $35 billion in annual interest on $250 billion or $70 billion on $500 billion from these mortgage securities because they will yield a net of about 7 to 8 percent return. I know those are just numbers but this is about numbers. 
   More importantly, Treasury has the luxury of time. With proper oversight and regulatory discipline, markets will be back on their feet within a year and at that time the taxpayer is likely to recoup a 25 to 30 percent nontaxable capital gain on many of these security packages, on top of the underlying maturity value.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I rise to strike the last word and to address the House for 5 minutes in opposition to this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to express my very strong support for the bill that Mr. Rahall, the Chair of the Resources Committee, has brought to this floor because it restores a longstanding prohibition on the commercial sale and slaughter of wild horses and burros. 
   This amendment that we are currently debating is designed to defeat the substance of this bill. The reality is that this is not a bill that costs the Treasury money, but it does cost our country something of great value. 
   At the turn of the 20th century, some 2 million wild horses roamed freely in the wild. But by the 1950s, just half a century, their population had dwindled to fewer than 20,000. The population went from 2 million to 20,000. Ninety-nine percent of these majestic creatures were taken off the face of the American continent, and many of them were being inhumanely captured by profiteers who would slaughter them and then sell their meat for pet food and human consumption in European and Asian restaurants. 
   So, after enough awareness and concern, Congress passed the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 that protects wild horses and burros on Federal lands from such atrocities. But then in the 108th Congress, under different leadership, longstanding Federal policy that protects wild horses from being sold at auctions and subsequently shipped to slaughter plants was reversed. 
   Last year, two Texas plants and one in Illinois slaughtered nearly 105,000 horses for human food, mainly for European and Asian consumers. I think it's time to end this senseless for-profit massacre, really, of the symbol of the spirit of the American West. 
   Animals are given into our care, and we ought to treat them with some greater respect than we do, particularly in the case of horses. 
   I believe that a generation from now we will shudder at how recklessly we treated these animals which are so symbolic of the spirit, the strength, the stamina of this country. In the event of survival, so many of them face neglect and abuse today, and that is the argument that is raised. But that is not an excuse not to pass this legislation nor to implement a more humane policy, because this policy is inhumane at every step in the process, from how they're purchased at auction, to their transportation to the slaughterhouse, to how they are killed. 
   Many of the horses that are transported to the slaughterhouse are bought by what are called ``killer buyers'' at auction. These unscrupulous buyers prey on the trust of horse owners who believe that their horse is being bought by a good family and will lead a comfortable life. They are unaware that they are being misled by professional slaughterhouse agents, with their companion animal being sent to a very painful death. 
   The reality of the slaughtering process is difficult and uncomfortable for many of us to hear, but the suffering begins during the transportation of horses to the slaughterhouse. They are shipped with no food or water or any ability to rest. Often due to overcrowding and slippery floor surfaces, the horses fall and they are trampled during transportation. If they survive the trip to the slaughterhouse, the horse's suffering needlessly continues. Due to their cautious nature, many of these horses are not properly stunned before slaughter. Many are completely conscious when they have their throats cut. Simply put, this is not in the American tradition. 
   Despite what some of my colleagues will have you believe, the practice is not needed to control the number of horses in the United States. California banned horse slaughter in 1998, and since then there has been no corresponding rise in cruelty or neglect cases.     
   There has even been a 34 percent drop in horse theft since the ban went into effect. 
   The fact is that the American public wants to protect horses and is horrified that they are being slaughtered for use as food in other countries. Poll after poll shows that 70 percent of Americans believe that we should end the slaughter of horses. They are right, we should end this slaughter, today. And that is why we should pass this bill and defeat the amendment.

   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, our intelligence agencies have confirmed that America is more vulnerable now than it was 6 years ago before the 9/11 attacks. That is because Osama bin Laden has gained strength, gained recruits and gained experience in the meantime. 
   It didn't have to be that way. We had him cornered and crippled in Tora Bora, but then we outsourced the job of capturing him. Then, to make matters worse, we poured our military and financial resources into Iraq, where al Qaeda was nonexistent, thereby giving Osama bin Laden his most effective recruiting tool. 
   The President keeps referring to al Qaeda in Iraq. It is not the Iraqis who are planning on how to attack America. It is al Qaeda in Waziristan. We need an intelligence strategy to go after bin Laden in Waziristan with our Special Operations working with the tribal chiefs who want to rid themselves of this pest. That is what we need to do. 
   Mr. Speaker, that is the only strategy that is deserving of the sacrifice of our military families. We need leadership that is deserving of the American public's support.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Virginia. (ANIMAL FIGHTING PROHIBITION ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank both my friend from North Carolina and my friend from Virginia, as well as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for bringing this forward, as well as those who have spoken on behalf of this bill. 
   This is not just a nuisance industry. This is a malicious industry that represents a very, very serious public health threat. We are very much concerned that the interstate or international transport, especially of birds used for cockfighting, could spread an influenza outbreak. The World Health Organization has reported at least nine confirmed human cases of avian flu in Thailand and Vietnam that they expect is related directly to cockfighting activity. 
   The American Veterinary Medical Association, the poultry industry, all the animal protection associations, of course, but the National Sheriffs' Association as well has urged us to pass this bill. 
   Yes, there are 50 different State bills against dog fighting, 49 against cockfighting, but many of them are different. And the fact is there is a great deal of interstate commerce that takes place, so you need a Federal law banning this, because it is so closely associated, and this is what the National Sheriffs' Association tells us, so closely associated to illegal gambling, trafficking of narcotics, public corruption, dangerous gang activity. There are so many reasons why we should ban this practice. 
   As has been said, it is cruel, and it is inhumane. They drug these animals so that they are hyper-aggressive, so that they will continue fighting until they kill or are killed. That is not right. It is not moral. But even beyond the cruel and inhumane aspect of this practice, it represents a very dangerous public health threat, as well as a source of a great deal of other illegal criminal activity. 
   This House would be well-served to listen to the more than 300 Members who have cosponsored this legislation and pass it today.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Virginia. (THE COST OF THE WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Speaker, the Congressional Budget Office just released an analysis that on top of the half a trillion dollars that we have already spent on the war in Iraq, it will cost us another $2 trillion over the next decade. That includes $564 million of interest, because every dime of this war in Iraq has been borrowed, from our children and from our grandchildren. It will come to a greater cost than the cost of the Korean, the Vietnam War and all three theaters of operation in World War II. It boils down to about $7,000 for every man, woman and child. 
   And here we thought the only real sacrifice was being borne by our soldiers and their families. We are beginning to see the real implications for all of America. In fact, just last week, the President vetoed a bill that would have cost $35 billion but would have provided health care to 10 million children over the next 5 years and at the same time demanded that we instead spend that same amount of money for 3 weeks in Iraq. This is not what America expects from its President or its Congress, Madam Speaker.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I want to voice my strong opposition to the substitute amendment that this rule makes in order because it usurps D.C.'s home rule authority and imposes upon the residents of our Nation's Capital laws that they don't support and that will make them less safe. 
   The substitute amendment goes well beyond anything contained in the Heller decision. It leaves D.C. City Council with little authority to impose sensible regulations on deadly weapons. It will repeal requirements that guns be properly stored in the home, requirements that we know prevent the accidental deaths of hundreds of children every year. States with safe storage laws have seen substantial drops in unintentional firearm deaths compared with States without those laws. And, in fact, a gun in the home is 22 times more likely to kill a family member or a friend than it is to ward off an intruder or be used in self-defense. 
   The substitute amendment will repeal the District's ban on semi-automatic guns. Even a .50 caliber semi-automatic sniper rifle is allowed, whose manufacturer publicly advertises that it can pierce the fuselage of a jet airplane from miles away. Talk about making a mockery of our homeland security rhetoric. 
   And the amendment will require Virginia and Maryland to sell guns to D.C. residents, breaking with decades of Federal gun trafficking laws, forcing the Commonwealth of Virginia to allow guns to fall into the hands of the mentally unbalanced and into the hands of criminals. We have already seen this happen with Virginia Tech. How dare this Congress overturn Virginia's State laws without even consulting them. 
   Who does the NRA think it is? There is no reason we're debating this issue today other than to appease the NRA at the expense of public safety. The Members who would impose this unwanted law onto D.C. residents would never do this to their own constituents, but it's being done because D.C. residents can't fight back. And that's the definition of bullying. It is beneath the character of the Congress to be doing this. 
   And let me tell you, when you have a Presidential motorcade, you clear all the streets in other cities. But in D.C., by this law, you're going to be able to have a loaded gun in your window that poses an immediate danger to the President. 
   What are we thinking of? This is wrong. It needs to be defeated. It is beneath the dignity of this Congress to even bring it up, and if it passes we will live to regret it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Chairman, the moratorium on A-76 public-private competition at the Department of Labor is the right provision, in the right bill at the right time. 
   The moratorium is included in this Appropriations bill because the Department of Labor has made indications that the agency is trying to reach numerical privatization targets--quotas--for its outsourcing. 
   The use of outsourcing quotas was first addressed by Congress when the Office of Management and Budget under the Bush Administration introduced its effort to outsource at least 15 percent of each agency to the private sector, with a goal of outsourcing up to half of the agency workforce. 
   The problem with outsourcing quotas is that they are a ``one-size-fits-all'' arbitrary privatization effort. Quotas never consider the unique needs of different Federal agencies, and they often lead to widespread cuts that harm the ability of Federal agencies to effectively carry out their mission. 
   I offered an amendment to the Transportation-Treasury Appropriations Act in 2003 that shed light onto the administration's effort, and outlawed the outsourcing quota. 
   Now it appears that the Department of Labor is taking the same approach. 
   In the next two years, over 2,000 jobs are expected to be competed, many of which appear to be both inherently governmental and even discriminatory. 
   These jobs include technical writers reviewing OSHA enforcement action, senior instructor for safety specialist responsibilities, and physical scientists that analyze toxic materials in working environments. It is vital that these positions provide sound, objective services that Federal employees can. 
   Furthermore, the majority of employees impacted by the recent round of A-76 competitions were older African-American women. The GAO report will analyze whether the scheduled outsourcings are discriminatory. 
   The DOL has won 21 out of 23 competitions conducted in the past 3 fiscal years. Millions of dollars have been spent over the last several years on these initiatives; 90 percent of the cases are won by Government. 
   The GAO report would give Congress an objective analysis of the outsourcing program at the Department of Labor from which to base further decisions. 
   Competitive sourcing is not inherently a bad thing if it can save money for the Federal Government, but arbitrary quotas, numerical targets, are a bad thing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 5 years after the start of the war in Iraq, a new authoritative poll shows the growing concern of U.S. military officers about the impact of the war in Iraq on our Nation's security. The poll is based on the opinions of 3,400 present and former military officers. Eighty-eight percent of these officers believe that the demands of the Iraq war have ``stretched the U.S. military dangerously thin.'' Eighty percent of the military officers believe it is unreasonable to expect that the U.S. could respond to any new military threat in another part of the world. And nearly three-quarters of the officers believe civilian leaders set ``unreasonable goals for the military in post-Saddam Iraq.'' 
   Clearly, the Bush administration is not listening to its own military officers. In fact, before the start of the Iraq war, not one single military officer believed that Iraq had anything to do with the war on terrorism. And yet President Bush is determined to continue this war irregardless of his military's own concerns. 
   Mr. Speaker, the war in Iraq has undermined our Nation's military strength and our readiness and, therefore, our national security.

   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, the President's proposal that he will announce tonight to increase rather than decrease the number of troops in Iraq defies the reality on the ground and the advice of our wisest military commanders. This decision will only serve to put more forces in the crossfire of a growing civil war. If there ever was a justifiable mission to depose a ruthless dictator, that mission has been accomplished. The Congress never authorized this military occupation. It is irresponsible and, in fact, immoral to allow more innocent American lives to be lost in vain. 
   Iraq is an artificial nation that was created by Winston Churchill and Gertrude Bell in 1922 to promote their concept of British imperialism. The reality is that this was never a winnable war for the United States of America nor in my view is it a sustainable civil society, and adding more troops is not going to change that reality.

   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman, and I also thank Speaker Pelosi for making this a national priority within our first 100 hours agenda 
   This is about the middle class and those struggling to make it to the middle class. 
   Frankly, I am stunned at the opposition from the Republican side. I guess I shouldn't be because the Republican Party opposed the GI Bill of Rights half a century ago which in so many ways created the middle class in this country by enabling soldiers coming back from World War II to be able to afford to go to college. 
   I guess I shouldn't be stunned either given the fact that when 9 months ago Chairman Miller suggested that we increase the value of Pell Grants for low income families and reduce the cost of student borrowing, it failed on virtually a party-line vote 220-200. 
   I guess I shouldn't be stunned either because 6 months ago, the White House and what was then the majority Congress, decided it was more important to give tax breaks to the very wealthiest  people in this country than to give some help to those middle class and working class, families who couldn't afford to go to college. Then they took $12 billion out of college student aid to pay for those tax cuts. You have to ask yourself, where are there priorities? 
   You know, the cost of college has gone up by more than the cost of health care. It has gone up by more than the cost of inflation per capita personal income and by more than the cost even of health care.     
   The fact is, right now, here in January, there are hundreds of thousands of families trying to decide whether they can send their child to college. How can they afford it? And there are also any number of college students trying to decide whether they can become a teacher or work in health care or any other number of professions we critically need because they have to pay off their college student loans and those professions generally don't pay enough. 
   This is the right thing for America. It will make America stronger and smarter.

But in fact there are job openings posted for five major defense contractors for interrogators.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, this is about whether or not we continue to fund the worst foreign policy fiasco in American history. 
   This is not about al Qaeda. In fact, if we had gone after al Qaeda when we had the opportunity, they wouldn't have been able to strengthen themselves in Pakistan and Afghanistan. But we've been diverted over to Iraq, where al Qaeda didn't even exist until our invasion gave them a recruitment tool and rallying cry. 
   And sure there's less violence in Baghdad, but the reason is because the Shiia have ethnically cleansed much of Baghdad. When we started, 60 percent of Baghdad was Sunni. Now, almost 80 percent of Baghdad is Shiia. 
   And the reason there's less violence in al-Anbar province is because the Sunni warlords have taken it upon themselves to drive out the al Qaeda insurgents. 
   Our military generals have told us this war does not lend itself to a military victory. The most we can do is to step up our diplomatic efforts. 
   But the fact is that we are supporting a government that doesn't deserve our support. It is not representative of the people of Iraq. It is endemically corrupt. And the reality is that when we look back and ask ourselves what have we accomplished, we are going to look at a government which is far more loyal to Iran than it is to the United States. That's what we've done, to empower our enemies. 
   We've created chaos throughout the Middle East. And isn't it time now to have a plan to start withdrawing our troops, to tell our military families that they have sacrificed as much as we could possibly expect of them? 
   But the reality is that this policy has never been worthy of the sacrifice of our soldiers and their military families.     
   And if you really believed in what you're doing in this war, you would support Mr. Obey's attempt to pay for it. Not one dime of this war has been paid for.

The opposition is hiding behind the language of the Constitution. I say ``hide'' because there are any number of interpretations and any number of conservative constitutional scholars who have said this is fully constitutional. 
   But it is the right thing to do because there is no jurisdiction, no State, no local government that has had more legislation passed in this body affecting them than the onerous provisions directly affecting the citizens of the District of Columbia and uniquely affecting them. 
   Forty-four thousand veterans are in the District of Columbia. Every D.C. resident pays Federal taxes. 
    1330 
   They are solid American citizens and there are more of them than in the entire state of Wyoming. They deserve voting representation. 
   Let me say one further thing. I represent the area in Alexandria that used to be part of the District of Columbia. When that area retroceded back to Virginia, on the front page of the Alexandria Gazette they described the freed men and freed women on their knees begging for citizens of Alexandria not to do this--not to deprive every black person of all their rights. But the entitled white people of Northern Virginia voted to deny them their rights because of racism. The history of this disenfranchisement of D.C. residents is not a pretty one.

   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I would like to say a word about the President's veto of the congressional ban on torture. By vetoing this measure, he is essentially instructing America's torturers to act in a way that is illegal according to international law, to act in a way that is wholly inconsistent with the military's code of conduct who are required to abide by the Army Field Manual, to act in a way that does not consistently provide reliable information because people being tortured tell their torturer what they know they want to hear so as to stop the torture. They know it is not the most effective means of acquiring information. 
   He also must know that this puts our own soldiers and civilians in much greater jeopardy because our enemy will consider it license to do at least as much as we do to them. But, most importantly, it undermines our moral authority. How far we have strayed from the vision of our Founding Fathers that this Nation would serve as a moral guidepost to the rest of the world.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Conference Report on the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education and Military Construction/Veterans Affairs Appropriations bills. This bill begins to correct key deficits in biomedical research, elementary and secondary education, job training, and health care for veterans and civilians alike, and sets out a clear, sustainable vision for the future. I want to thank and congratulate Chairman Obey, Ranking Member Walsh, the Conferees and their staff for putting together such an excellent bill, one which will bring needed relief to so many of our constituents. 
   The President, of course, has vowed to veto this bill, because he believes it costs too much, that we can't afford to make these investments in cancer research, in Head Start, in economic development. Meanwhile, the President is asking us to spend an additional $200 billion this year alone in his misguided war in Iraq. The amount by which this bill exceeds the President's request, $9.8 billion, would pay for approximately 1 month of that war. Instead, this bill would use that money to help States provide health coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, help college-ready low-income students afford higher education, and help low-income individuals and their families keep their homes warm in the wintertime--a wintertime that could well feature oil at costs in excess of $100 a barrel. 
   The President says we can't afford to make these investments; I believe we can't afford not to. These are investments which pay dividends over time, investments which will keep America strong, competitive, and healthy. While I strongly support this Conference Report, I would be remiss if I didn't express my concern that this bill includes a $27.8 million increase for abstinence education programs, which research has shown to be ineffective, and worse, often medically inaccurate. Since 2001, we have spent more than $1 billion on these programs, some of which tell our children that using condoms is ``like Russian Roulette,'' and that HIV/AIDS can be transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. 
   Madam Speaker, teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections are serious problems that demand serious solutions. Of course we should want to delay the onset of sexual activity in our children--what parent of a teenager wouldn't want that? But we cannot let that desire blind us to the very real fact that teenagers, despite our best intentions, will and do have sex, and that our wanting them not to does not absolve us of our obligation to protect them and keep them safe. 
   Pretending that sexual activity among teenagers does not exist will not reduce the number of new sexually transmitted infections; it will not reduce the number of teenage girls who become pregnant; and it will not reduce the number of abortions performed every year. 
   I want to thank Chairman Obey for including language in this Conference Report to ensure that programs will not be funded that are medically inaccurate. I hope that in the future, we can continue to work together to ensure that our children receive high quality, science-based, age-appropriate sex education that is medically sound and free from ideological or religious bias. Despite my concerns about this program, Madam Speaker, I am proud to support this important bill and urge my colleagues to do the same, so that we can get needed funds to these critical programs as soon as possible.

   The Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act extends and expands tax incentives for renewable energies including renewable electricity and fuel, hybrid cars and energy-efficient homes and appliances. 
   By investing in renewable energy, we can take another cri tical step in reducing our Nation's dependence on foreign oil. And at a time when our economy is struggling to produce new high-paying jobs, this legislation will help create hundreds of thousands of new green jobs in renewable energy that will help us provide a cleaner environment for the next generation. 
   Mr. Speaker, our legislation is also fully paid for by repealing $18 billion in tax subsidies that big oil companies continue to receive despite record earnings. It's time Congress modernizes our Nati on's energy policy by passing this important bill regardless of President Bush's opposition.

   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. I thank my good friend and colleague for yielding, and I appreciate the fact that this resolution has come to the floor. 
   It is difficult to imagine a more heartbreaking moment than to have a family receive a call from the university, where they thought they had sent their child to a secure, nurturing, learning environment, only to find out that their child's life has been cut off before any of their potential could be realized. What a horrible loss. And to think that more than 30 of those calls have had to take place over the last 2 days. 
   This is a time for grieving, for trying to console. But, Mr. Speaker, as important and appropriate as it is to grieve after the fact, I think it may be even more appropriate for this body to stand up before the fact, because we know that this type of tragedy, perhaps not in as large a scale, but this type of tragedy will happen again. Whether it is in the workforce or on a college campus or a high school campus or on the street, innocent victims will be mowed down. And it happens more often in our country than in any other civilized nation, than in any other civilized nation on this planet. And the reason, Mr. Speaker, is because it is simply too easy to obtain a firearm. 
   If you are a criminal or mentally deranged or simply emotionally upset, virtually anyone can go to a store, even a retail department store, and buy a weapon of mass destruction. That is what has happened here and will happen again. And I know that the National Rifle Association is able to brag that it controls the gun control agenda now from the White House. And the majority of Members of Congress are not going to stand up to the NRA. But the fact is, Mr. Speaker, I think we have a responsibility, particularly at moments like this when we are so acutely aware of the carnage that the proliferation of weapons throughout our society creates. When we are aware of the tragedy that this laxity causes, this lack of courage to stand up to gun manufacturers and say it is time, Mr. Speaker, no matter how politically difficult it might be, to try to reduce the number of weapons in our society. I'm not talking about those that are meant for hunting. People in Canada have all kinds of guns, but their rifles are used for hunting. They are not used for stalking and killing other human beings. 
   It is the proliferation of handguns, the kinds of guns that were used in this tragic incident and the ammunition clips that should be banned under the assault weapon legislation we let expire that have to be brought under control. And it is we, the people's representatives, who have to stand up and do something about this so that it doesn't have to occur again. As appropriate as it is, as I said, now to grieve with those families and to offer condolences, it is more imperative that we stand up before the fact, before another such tragedy occurs because of our lack of political courage.

   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, for the last 8 years, our President and Vice President the founder of Bush Oil Exploration and the former CEO of Halliburton, the world's largest oil servicing firm, have had this country focused almost exclusively on drilling for fossil fuels, the use of oil and gas to power our economy. This administration issued 40,000 permits for drilling on public land onshore, and made 300 million acres offshore available to oil and gas companies. They still have 68 million acres of proven reserves that they are not drilling on. 
   But what is the focus now? Let's go after that last remaining 20 percent, even though it's the most environmentally sensitive, even though it will devastate the tourism industry and fishing industry of several states. Let's go after that. That's the answer. Forget the fact that we opposed research into solar power, cutting it by 80 percent, cutting wind power research and opposing more fuel efficient engines. 
   They put us in this situation, and now they want more of the same. And they're wrong.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Virginia. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND MEDICARE PROTECTION ACT OF 2007--Continued -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, Republicans have attacked a provision in the CHAMP Act that would allow states flexibility in how they verify the citizenship of the American children applying for or renewing coverage under Medicaid, claiming that language in the 2005 Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) that imposed harsher citizenship verification requirements on state Medicaid programs is the only barrier protecting taxpayer dollars from being spent on healthcare for illegal immigrants. 
   Empirical evidence from the first nine months of the implementation of this rule demonstrates, in fact, that the new requirements have denied tens of thousands of American children access to health care. 
   In my own state of Virginia, this draconian requirement has adversely affected thousands of U.S. citizen children, children who are among the most medically vulnerable in the state. In the first nine months of implementation, there was a net decline of more than 11,000 children enrolled in Medicaid. Had growth in enrollment continued at the same rate it had during the previous 2 years, the state would have seen a net increase of 9,000 poor children, suggesting that overall, at least 20,000 have been denied access to health coverage. 
   Among those who do receive coverage, the average wait time for processing has increased from sixteen days to four to six months. 
   Twenty-one other states also reported declines in enrollment since the implementation of the DRA, including a net decline of 14,000 children in Kansas. 
   While the DRA's requirements have unfortunately limited access to care for so many low-income U.S. citizen children, they also have imposed enormous administrative costs on the states, our financial partners in this program. In Virginia, the number of ``pending'' cases awaiting further documentation skyrocketed from about 50 per month to 4000. The DRA requirements have made measures to increase the efficiency of the Medicaid application process (including mail-in, phone and online applications) impossible. 
   The DRA requirements don't seem to be succeeding in fulfilling its objective: in the first nine months of implementation, six states spent $17 million implementing the DRA requirements, but only identified eight undocumented immigrants out of a total of 3.6 million Medicaid beneficiaries. 
   In addition, enrollment has fallen significantly in these states among white and African-American children, while enrollment among Latino children has increased--which would not be occurring if the provision were affecting undocumented immigrants, 78% of whom are from Mexico, Central America or South America, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. 
   The DRA requirements imposed substantial bureaucratic costs on the states, but have produced almost no cost savings. Instead, millions of dollars spent implementing the DRA requirements have served only to deny care to tens of thousands of American children. 
   The costs of care denied to low-income U.S. citizen children are passed on to taxpayers in the form of uncompensated emergency room visits and costs to treat the infectious diseases that these children may contract and unknowingly pass on while awaiting access to treatment. 
   The debate about CHAMP should be about the public health and improving the health of our children. Attacks on this provision come from Members who are grasping at straws, trying to come up with reasons to oppose this bill, which takes monumental steps to improve the health of low-income children in this country. 
   In a recent survey, 90 percent of parents applying for Medicaid for their children indicated that they have no other health coverage available. Allowing state flexibility in citizenship verification is sound public health policy that would enable thousands of American children access to vital health services to help them live better, healthier, and more productive lives. Because Medicaid is now the single largest cost to state taxpayers, we ought to make a concerted effort to support state flexibility. 
   State flexibility is widely supported. Twenty-four Senators signed letters to Chairman BAUCUS asking him to include this measure in the Senate's bipartisan SCHIP bill, and fifty-one other House Members joined me in requesting that Chairman DINGELL include this provision in the bill. I urge your support of this landmark legislation to protect the health of our most vulnerable low-income children, and your support of state flexibility in citizenship verification.

   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I would like to address America's legal black hole, known as Guantanamo Bay. 
   The administration would like us to believe that the 15 prisoners that were very recently sent to Guantanamo are typical of the other 772 that have been sent there over the last 4 1/2 years. Many of them are still languishing 4 1/2 years later, even though only four of those 772 have ever been charged with a crime. In fact, only 8 percent are alleged to have ever acted as a ``fighter'' against the United States. Only 5 percent were actually captured by American forces. The vast majority were turned in for bounties by Pakistani or other northern alliance Afghan forces. 
   That is why, Mr. Speaker, we need to shine the light of the law on this situation, to ask the administration what are they going to do about people who are being illegally detained there without charges and with no plans as to how to fix this situation, which continues to undermine America's reputation and credibility throughout the world.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, when the President vetoed this bill, he said it was because he felt that decisions like this should be left to the military, not the politicians. But Mr. Speaker, the fact is that when the President declared that Iraq was part of the global war on terrorism, there was not one single military officer who agreed. That was a political decision made in the White House to go into this war. Had he listened to the military, we wouldn't be in this war. 
   Mr. Speaker, the fact is that none of us have been asked to sacrifice anything in pursuit of this war. The sacrifice has fallen exclusively on the backs of our military and their families. 
   Mr. Speaker, this week, the 2,108th child was told that they will never see their mommy or daddy again because they will never return from Iraq. How many more children have to lose their parents before this policy is reversed, Mr. Speaker? 3,351 American soldiers have lost their lives. More than 24,000 have been seriously wounded. This past month, more than 100 soldiers lost their lives, the deadliest month on record. 
   Things are getting worse rather than better. 
   The British Broadcasting Corporation and the American Broadcasting Corporation just completed an extensive survey of Iraqis. It turns out that 82 percent have lost confidence in U.S. policy in Iraq, that 86 percent have lost a member of their household due to violence, and the majority feel that this policy is ineffective, and in fact, they were better off under Saddam Hussein than under the American occupation. 
   Mr. Speaker, the State Department just reported that the number of terrorist incidents has gone up by 25 percent, most of them in Iraq. 
   This policy has been a failure. I urge a rejection of the President's veto of this bill. This bill will set the course that the American people are demanding.

Let me quote from a random sample of newspapers around the country. 
   The Seattle Post Intelligencer wrote, ``Well, slap us twice and call us Betty, the Democrats in Congress actually accomplished what they pledged to do, on schedule no less.'' 
   The Charlotte Observer concluded, ``House Democrats are getting high marks from the public for their legislative moves in the first 100 hours of the new session of Congress. They are on the right road.'' 
   The South Florida Sun-Sentinel wrote, ``Democrats in the House made good on their promise to pass significant legislation during their first 100 hours in power. Actually, it took less than that time to pass the six bills the House Democrats hailed as their top priorities. This belies the perception that nothing ever gets done in Washington.''

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Virginia. (COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE METROPOLITAN WASHINGTON COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. I thank my good friend and distinguished colleague from Illinois for yielding me the time. I have the great honor to offer this resolution on behalf of all of my colleagues in the Washington metropolitan area. 
   The Council of Governments of the Washington Metropolitan Area began 50 years ago, in 1957. In the ensuing 50 years, it has become the premier group for collaboration on transportation, air and water quality, regional growth, emergency response, and any number of other domestic issues that are important to its individual jurisdictions. We will be honoring the Council of Governments Thursday night in their 50th anniversary gala, and all of our Washington area colleagues, including Ms. Norton, Congressman Van Hollen, Congressman Hoyer, Congressman Wynn, Congressman Davis and Congressman Wolf, will all participate, as they have been participating since they have been elected to office in the Council of Governments. 
   Since its first meeting during the Eisenhower administration where there were seven charter member governments, it has grown to include 21 local jurisdictions. As it has grown, it has become the place to discuss and address and solve so many of the region's problems. 
   Because of the Council of Governments, this is one of the finest regions in the country in which to live. But it wasn't always that way. Fifty years ago, it had half of its current population, it had no Metro system and no interstate highway system. Imagine, just 50 years ago. But the visionary leaders of this area got together, and in working with the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, have made enormous strides in creating a region that is proud to be the capital of the free world, and those who live here reflect that pride. But it didn't happen by accident. COG has been an essential component of that growth. 
   In 1967, COG was responsible for the D.C. Air Pollution Act. It was a model that was created by the Council of Governments, signed by President Johnson. The fire chiefs of the area got together and put together a mutual aid agreement. That became the model for the 9/11 Commission's recommendation for all metropolitan areas in the country. The response of the Council of Governments on September 11, 2001, in pulling together all of the emergency responders, was tremendous and deserves great credit as well. The Regional Incident Communication Coordination System is a model in the country. 
   Now those 21 local governments have over 250 members. We have one of the highest quality of life achievements in the country and the Nation's strongest economy. And as we plan for an additional 1.6 million people and 1.2 million more jobs over the next 25 years, COG will continue to address those challenges. When we look forward to the next 50 years, COG predicts that by the year 2057 the average home in metropolitan Washington will cost more than $14 million. That means a lot of pay increases for all of the Federal workers, I guess including the Members themselves. But we are going to be part of a mega-region stretching from Baltimore to Richmond. The way in which we use energy is going to be a key determinant in terms of the region's prosperity. 
   There will be enormous changes that take place. But whatever changes take place, we know that the Council of Governments is going to be there as a meeting place, as a forum, as a facilitator, to address all of the challenges that confront us. 
   So, after 50 years of tremendous achievement, we do want to recognize this organization, and I very much appreciate the committee giving us the opportunity to do so. I think I have used my time, and I don't think there is much controversy, so I will conclude my remarks at this point.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, there are as many private contractors in Iraq as U.S. soldiers on the ground. Outsourcing our military should be a cause for concern for all Americans, but the recent uncovering of indiscriminate hostility toward Iraqi civilians and unprovoked killings by security contractors in Iraq is a siren warning that demands immediate attention. 
   Blackwater, a company that has reaped over $110 million from the taxpayers since 2006 in U.S. contracts, offers one of the most egregious examples of what is wrong with our occupation of Iraq. 
   Last week, Blackwater security protecting State Department officials opened fire in a Baghdad neighborhood, and in what appears to be an unprovoked incident, Blackwater guards killed at least 11 innocent Iraqi civilians and wounded 12 others. But because of a decree delivered in 2004 by our Ambassador Paul Bremer on his last day on the job, these contractors are granted immunity from Iraqi law and will likely face no charges at home. 
   This lack of accountability is anathema to our fundamental principle of equal justice under the law and exemplifies why the occupation of Iraq has been such a failure.

   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and Mr. Price for bringing this legislation forward. It is fully consistent with what the vast majority of this House voted for in the report language in the Defense appropriations bill. It needs to be done. 
   I have to tell you that after talking with so many soldiers in Iraq and those who have returned from Iraq, it is desperately urgent that we do it because things are out of control. 
   The fact is that many of these contractors, not all of them, but too many of them are acting with impunity. They tell me that they will work all day trying to communicate and working with the people in a village, trying to understand their customs and the like and show them respect, and then it is undermined by the actions of these security contractors who don't understand the language, who don't show the kind of respect that our soldiers do, who get paid almost three times what our soldiers get paid. It is undermining our mission in Iraq. 
   The fact is that this is not what America is about, conducting oneself with impunity. America is about equal justice under the law. It is about protecting the preciousness of human life, particularly innocent life. 
   It is not about outsourcing our inherent military functions, giving a contractor $1 billion since 2004 and having 200 incidents of misconduct reported by that very contractor. 
   This legislation is necessary. Let's pass it overwhelmingly. Let's send that message to our soldiers.

Madam Speaker, after all the fabrications and all the incompetence associated with Iraq, not to mention the human rights abuses in Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib, you wouldn't think that America could lose any more credibility, but now we understand the President was warned well in advance that there was new information on Iran's nuclear program; yet he continued with his bellicose rhetoric, even raising the specter of World War III. 
   Well, now we know. There is absolutely no excuse for going to war with Iran. But the fact is that if the President is still concerned about Iran, which he very much should be, he should read the rest of the National Intelligence Estimate which makes it clear that Iran is going to acquire even more wealth and, thus, power because of our dependency on oil. 
   So the best thing that the President can do if he's concerned about Iran is to sign the energy bill that we are considering today. We cannot continue our dependence upon foreign oil, and the first way to start moving in a new and more secure direction, is to sign the Energy Independence bill that will go to his desk very shortly.

<TEXT>
    Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the H.R. 5264, the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA), a program meant to assist the Andean countries in their economic development. The ATPA provides duty free treatment for 94 percent of imports from the four Andean nations-Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. 
    The original Andean Trade Preferences Act was passed in 1991 and extended and expanded in 2002 with the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA), and again extended last June 2007. This program is fundamental in our mission to foster trade-based economic relations between the United States and the Andean region and stimulate legitimate economic alternatives to narcotics production and trafficking in the Andean region. 
    If Congress does not pass the Andean Trade Preference Act, the previous extension of the program will expire on February 29, 2008. Renewing ATPA will continue to build on the program's success and help us achieve our larger policy goals for the Andean region. At a time of increasing economic uncertainty, it will help sustain critical U.S. jobs that are dependent on stable trade with and investments in the Andean region. 
    From 2003 to 2006, U.S. textile exports to the Andean region increased by more than $50 million signifying a 40 percent increase. However, with the uncertainty the constant renewal brings, last year it was extended for 8 months 2 hours before it was set to expire, it has discouraged companies from continuing their investment in the Andean region. 
    Our current regional partnership is grounded on the joint struggle to eradicate the narcotics menace that terrorizes both the Andean region and the United States and to provide economic stability through trade. As the Andean region currently enjoys duty-free treatment, an expansion of these trade policies, like the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement, would allow us to enter into a full partnership with the remaining Andean countries instead of just a one way trading benefit. 
    While free trade agreements are not on the immediate agenda of Congress, I urge a vote in favor of H.R. 5264, to extend trade preferences for Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia and continue to show our support for our Andean neighbors and allow U.S. companies to continue investing in that region.

   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, the fact is that Americans are in a crisis in terms of affordable housing today. This is the most programmatically rational and fiscally responsible way to address that crisis. 
   I strongly support Mr. Frank's bill, and I appreciate him offering this opportunity for the Congress as a whole to show that we really can make a positive difference in people's lives. 
   I would appreciate some clarification on one aspect of the bill, however. Within the bill, at least 75 percent of the funds are set aside for families whose incomes are no more than 30 percent of the area median income, and at least 10 percent is for people whose income is more than 50 percent of the area median income. That only leaves about 15 percent of the trust fund available to be flexibly used by localities. 
   I represent the Washington suburbs where housing is extraordinarily high, not dissimilar from the Boston suburbs that the chairman represents. Many of these families and governments are concerned that there will not be the opportunity to address the crisis that their middle-class families are facing in housing. In fact, there are more than 50,000 families in northern Virginia who are paying over 30 percent of their income for housing but who are at about 100 percent of the area median income. 
   What I would like to ask the chairman to do is to clarify how we can address that affordable housing need within this bill's parameters.

   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of the tragic events that took place on September 11, 2001. On that crisp fall morning, we lost nearly 3,000 American lives in an event that shook this nation to its core, violently searing the depths of our consciousness. 
   Six years removed from that infamous day, we continue to mourn the victims, praise the first responders' heroics and seek out our enemies who committed such heinous, inhuman acts. It is still hard to comprehend what could drive someone to take their own life in order to kill others. 
   What we do know is that the forces propelling the destruction and devastation of 9/11 were hatred, intolerance and fanaticism. Understanding what triggers this fervor of hate and how to mitigate its ascension is the key to ensuring our nation's long term security. 
   As we continue to move forward from 9/11, the importance of well equipped, highly trained first responders and a robust but constitutionally balanced intelligence gathering apparatus remains paramount to our homeland security. 
   The immediate and heroic emergency response to the attacks on the Pentagon from Arlington County's fire and police departments remind us that localities--not just the Federal Government--will play the integral role in any and all homeland security efforts. Further, sound intelligence and the regularity today with which law enforcement and agencies share intelligence across jurisdictional boundaries, which has proven difficult in the past, will lower the possibility of future attacks. Complacency is not an option, but the progress we've made in these areas has put us on the right track. 
   Mr. Speaker, coming to terms with the realities of a post-9/11 world has been difficult for our nation. But to honor the lives of those lost and protect our current and future generations it is our responsibility to continue doing everything within our power--in line with our values as Americans--to ensure that a tragedy of this magnitude never occurs again.

   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I rise to commend my colleague Congressman Green for sponsoring this resolution to recognize and honor the 40th anniversary of congressional passage of title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, the Fair Housing Act, and the 20th anniversary of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988. It is important that we honor the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King and reflect on how far we have come. It is equally important, as we witness tens of thousands of Americans who risk losing their homes to foreclosure this year, that we rededicate ourselves to standing firm for those victimized by this economy or victimized by residual discrimination. We must continue to encourage all people and all three levels of government to rededicate themselves to the enforcement and the ideals of fair housing laws. 
   The fair povision of housing and economic opportunity--and especially the drive to ensure safe shelter for those in need--has been a compelling foundation of my career in public service. As a council member and subsequently as mayor of Alexandria, I served as vice chairman of the Alexandria Economic Opportunity Commission when the commission began its efforts to ensure local, State, and Federal action to bring down the barriers in rental housing that so discriminated against single women with children. 
   The enactment of the Fair Housing Act of 1988 was a testament to many of our former colleagues in this region, including former Congresswoman Gladys Spellman, former Senator Charles MacMathias, and former Delegate, Reverend Walter Fauntroy. That enactment was an honor to them and to thousands of Americans who joined in a national effort to seek justice and enduring rights for women in that most fundamental of human needs: shelter. 
   In Alexandria, our commission--and our city--focus on special populations, such as at-risk preschool children and teens, the homeless, ex-offenders, single parents, as well as the low-income community in general. These populations, our most vulnerable, face enough of an uphill struggle everyday as it is without governmentally permitted discrimination. I am proud at what we were able to accomplish so many years ago, but I remain committed the vision that Dr. King and others set before us, which we honor and remember today.

   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, last week the 2,100th American child had to be informed that they will never see their daddy or mommy again because their parent was killed in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, our military families deserve a policy worthy of their sacrifice. They deserve better. This war is going to turn out to be one of the worst military, political, economic and moral blunders in American history. 
   I heard my colleague refer to 9/11. We now know that we were brought into this war through deliberate deception and the politics of fear. Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with 9/11, wouldn't allow al Qaeda into his country. In fact, he wasn't trying to get nuclear weapons. He had no weapons of mass destruction. All those mobile labs didn't manufacture chemical weapons. Nor is this war being paid for with Iraqi oil. 
   And yet, you want us, 4 years later, to believe the very same people that brought us into this fiasco. When do you start to lose your credibility? After we have had 58,000 soldiers killed as in Vietnam? We are up to 3,300 now. About 25,000 seriously wounded. And how can you stand before them and tell them that this fiasco was worthy of their sacrifice? 
   The government that we are supporting doesn't go outside the Green Zone in Baghdad. They don't serve their people. In fact, many of its ministers are corrupt. That is the reality of our policy in Iraq.     
   And the fact too is that if the government we are supporting had the opportunity, they would turn Iraq into a Shi'a theocracy. Is that really worth our military families' sacrifice? The answer is no. 
   Support this rule and vote for this supplemental.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Virginia. (NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Chairman, I first want to thank the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and his superb staff for helping redraft portions of this language so that it might be considered. The final language represents a common-sense agreement that I think we should all reach consensus on. 
   The amendment's purpose is to shed some light on what has become an increasingly invisible world down at Guantanamo Bay. 
   The first detainees were brought to Guantanamo in 2002 to bypass the U.S. legal system and avoid international conventions and public scrutiny. Since that time the detainment facility has become a blight on American ideals and principles. 
   We have captured, tortured and interminably held men that we call enemy combatants, some of whom are guilty of crimes against our Nation and should be punished. Others, however, are only guilty of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
   We have created closed military tribunals that offer the false impression of justice, but they fall woefully short of what we should expect from our American system of justice. 
   Like Abu Ghraib, we've created an unnecessary rallying cry and recruitment tool for al Qaeda and militant Islamists throughout the world. I strongly believe that the continued operation of Guantanamo Bay puts Americans in harm's way and threatens the safety of any of our captured military and civilians abroad. 
   Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Secretary of State Rice have agreed that Guantanamo Bay represents a serious problem if we are to prevail in the global war on terror. They both advocated shuttering Guantanamo Bay's detention facilities. Even President Bush expressed a desire to see Guantanamo Bay closed. 
   This amendment offers a first step in giving the President, the Congress and the Department of Defense policy alternatives to Guantanamo Bay. This amendment will require the Department to develop a plan to transfer detainees from Guantanamo Bay. 
   The report must estimate how many detainees the Department will charge with a crime, how many will be subject to release or transfer, or how many will be held without being charged with a crime, but whom the Department feels that it must detain. 
   Lastly, the report would include a description of actions required by the Secretary and Congress to ensure that detainees who are scheduled for release are, in fact, released. 
   This last piece is particularly important, as the Department of Defense has scheduled release of 82 detainees. DOD and the State Department, however, face obstacles releasing these men to their home countries, and in some instances their home nations won't accept their return. In other instances, the State Department won't return detainees to their home nations for appropriate reasons. But we need to know what policy tools Congress can provide to expedite the release of innocent detainees. 
   All of this information is absolutely necessary for Congress and the administration to make informed decisions about what to do about Guantanamo Bay. 
   Whether you like it or not, whether you believe that Guantanamo Bay is a blight on our international standing, or whether or not you believe that these detainees should be held and tried in the United States, we should all agree that the policy options before the President and Congress should not be limited by a lack of information. 
   To opponents of shutting down Guantanamo Bay and my colleagues who believe its closure is a sign of weakness, I suggest that upholding our American principles of justice are not incongruent with our war against terror. 
   And in a speech before the Republican National Convention in 1992, I would remind my colleagues President Reagan emphasized that our greatest strength as a Nation comes not from our wealth or our power, but from our ideals. 
   I ask all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this common-sense amendment, to move forward in our battle against anti-American sentiment, and to provide the President and Congress with real policy options for shutting down Guantanamo Bay.

   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend for yielding. 
   First of all, I agree with you the people you described, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and the like, appear to be very dangerous people. These people, however, who were just transferred to Guantanamo, I think when Secretary Gates and the President spoke about Guantanamo, they were referring to the 772 that had been there over the period of 4 years now, rather than new arrivals. 
   But the point is, this is only a report; this does not mandate any action. It just presents information to the Congress. If the Congress was to transfer it, what would be the implication? So it is only a report, I would again remind the gentleman. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN (Mr. Altmire). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Moran). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the ayes appeared to have it.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Virginia. (FEDERAL EMPLOYEES PAID PARENTAL LEAVE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act. The legislation will provide a necessary update to the current statute and takes an important step forward for workers rights and benefits. As one of the original cosponsors of this legislation during the past several sessions of Congress, I am pleased that the leadership is moving the bill for consideration before the full House of Representatives. 
   Since its first passage in 1993, the Family and Medical Leave Act has provided Federal employees with unpaid leave to care for families, allowing for time off at the birth, adoption, or foster placement of a child. Upon the completion of this leave, Federal employees can return to their position without penalty. Now, 15 years later, the law needs to be updated to reflect the changing needs of families. 
   The Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act of 2008 does just that. This new act guarantees at a minimum 4 weeks of paid leave to Federal employees--both fathers and mothers--to care for new children in their families. 
   This additional benefit is vital because of the need for the Federal Government to compete with the private sector for quality recruits and retaining experienced employees. At one time, the Federal Government provided the best benefits, but it is falling sorely behind in this area. Currently, 75 percent of Fortune 100 Companies provide paid leave to new mothers. Further, the United States is the only industrialized country that does not provide benefits to its employees with new children. 
   As the Federal workforce ages and begins to experience anticipated shortages in critical skills, we must rely on our benefits rather than pay to attract and retain new employees. Studies show that new parents who have access to leave when their first child is born are more likely to stay with their employer than those who do not. Moreover, retention of these employees easily compensates for the extra leave this legislation provides. The average cost of turnover in a position is about 20 percent of an employee's annual salary. On the other hand, 4 weeks of paid leave costs less than 8 percent of an employee's salary. 
   Finally, this legislation recognizes key changes to the American economy. Most families no longer have a stay-at-home parent, and with the average middle class family spending nearly $11,000 on infant expenses, they cannot afford any amount of unpaid leave. With the current economic downturn, working families simply cannot afford to take any time off while paying childcare expenses along with increased food and fuel prices. Something in the system has to provide some relief to these new parents, and with this legislation, we can provide some help. 
   Mr. Speaker, for all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the Federal Employees Paid Leave Act of 2008.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Virginia. (EXTEND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Speaker, today this body will have an opportunity to show the American people that we get it. We will be asked to vote on an extension of unemployment insurance for 13 weeks for every State in the country. 
   Normally, this would be a no-brainer, given the fact that a couple weeks ago we had the largest percentage increase in the number of unemployed. There are almost 4 million Americans without a job who can't find one, and we have had millions of Americans lose their homes through mortgage foreclosures. All of our constituents are paying over $4 a gallon for gas, almost three times what they were paying before the Bush administration came to office. 
   But it is not a no-brainer, because many of our Republican colleagues have consistently opposed extending unemployment insurance. A number of times, President Bush said he would veto the bill if we tried to extend unemployment insurance. 
   Madam Speaker, this is a failed economy. Let's not fail the American people today. Let's extend unemployment insurance.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Virginia. (SMALL BUSINESS CONTRACTING PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I first want to thank the chairwoman of the Small Business Committee for her leadership in bringing this bill to the floor today. I appreciate the membership on both sides of the committee for finding an agreement on so many issues that are important to small businesses. 
   They know that small businesses must overcome long odds and difficult obstacles in navigating the waters of Federal contracting. Size thresholds, growth requirements, endless paperwork and late contracts payments are all part of the challenges that competing small businesses regularly face. 
   Yet there is another challenge that has been brought to my attention. Some small businesses, after being awarded a competitively bid contract, must face frivolous protests by the incumbent contractors just for the purposes of delaying the award of a contract. For an incumbent contractor, there is an economic incentive to protest an award, even if there is no substance to the challenge. The award to the small business is thus delayed, and the current contract is retained until the protest is concluded. It can take months or even years before the dispute is resolved by the government. 
   In the meantime, the incumbent contractor can reap millions more for the extended contract that they had been granted previously but lost out on. These protests have serious consequences for many small businesses. During protests, the small businesses must cover their legal costs. Moreover, they must cover payroll and administrative costs for the workforce that they hired for the awarding contract. That's before they ever get paid by the Federal Government. These costs can cripple some small businesses that run on tight budgets without built-in overhead for the costly protests.     
   In other words, it's an uneven playing field. 
   This amendment will require the Small Business Administration to study the degree to which incumbent contractors are submitting frivolous protests to extend the length of current contracts. It's a problem I know exists because many of my constituent companies have, in fact, experienced it firsthand. 
   The Small Business Administration's study will determine the number and the merit of GAO and SBA protests that are filed by incumbent contractors and analyze the number of extended contracts. It'll analyze the  extra costs of extending contracts, including the costs to small businesses that won the initial award of those contracts, and the costs incurred by Federal agencies as a result. 
   Finally, it will develop recommendations to ease the financial burden on small businesses during protests and offer recommendations to discourage frivolous protests made to squeeze small businesses. 
   It's clear that not all incumbent contractors submit frivolous bids. But it's also equally clear that there are some built-in incentives for incumbents to submit protests that they know have little merit but, nevertheless, will enable them to profit by the delay. 
   Mr. Chairman, I ask for support of this amendment so that small businesses can cope with frivolous incumbents' protests, and I look forward to working with the Small Business Committee on this ongoing issue of fairness. 
   I will retain whatever time is left. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, while not opposed to the amendment, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Virginia. (THE ENERGY SITUATION REQUIRES A THREE-LEGGED STOOL -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, you know, when you listen to the Bush White House and our Republican friends, you really do get the impression that this is a government of, by, and for the oil companies. And in fact, maybe it is. I mean, after all, President Bush was the founder of Bush Oil Exploration. He was a paid board member of several oil exploration companies. Vice President Cheney is the former CEO of Halliburton, the world's largest oil services company. He's made millions off Halliburton stock while he's been in office. 
   Newsweek, in fact, at the beginning of the Bush administration, identified 11 key decision makers in the energy policy area that had worked for or lobbied for the energy industry. And in fact when Vice President Cheney put together his energy transition team, 50 members were from the big corporate energy companies. None was from renewable energy organizations. Maybe that's why the Bush administration has cut renewable energy programs by 27 percent, including a 54 percent cut in solar energy. 
   There are many reasons why we're in this situation, Mr. Speaker, and one big reason is the background and the priorities of the President and Vice President.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, a report released today by the nonprofit research organization Media Matters has found that military analysts secretly cultivated by the Pentagon's communications apparatus appeared over 4,500 times on major TV and radio networks since 2002 in segments covering the Iraq War, Guantanamo Bay, Abu Ghraib and other foreign policy and national security issues. 
   The New York Times exposed this extensive, coordinated campaign by the Pentagon and the Bush administration to influence the commentary of what viewers rightfully believed were independent television military analysts. It is an unethical, possibly illegal propaganda machine, a media Trojan horse designed to shape war coverage from inside the major TV and radio networks. 
   It was also apparent that the motivation on the part of many was the extraordinary access they were granted to the Pentagon for their defense contractor employers. 
   One particularly disturbing example is when troops in Iraq were dying because of inadequate body armor, a senior Pentagon official wrote to his colleagues, ``I think our analysts ..... can push back in that arena.'' The analysts, of course, were 75 retired military officers. 
   This is conduct unbefitting of our military officers and our Nation, Mr. Speaker.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Virginia. (NATIONAL MONTH OF THE MILITARY CHILD -- (House of Representatives - April 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. I thank my friend, the distinguished delegate from Guam, for yielding me the time. 
   I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman) for his kind comments as well. I am glad to be joined here by the Chair of Military Construction, Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, Mr. Chet Edwards. 
   Madam Speaker, a child's process of growing up is difficult, but imagine what it must be like when one parent or even both parents are deployed abroad as part of their duty in our Armed Forces. 
   While friends and relatives pray for their safe return, no one feels the impact of deployment more than the children of servicemembers in combat overseas. We are learning more about the impact that living under this shadow of uncertainty has on our children. 
   The incidence of military children needing psychological counseling has increased dramatically. Last year Children's Hospital in the District of Columbia had over 1,000 visits from military children suffering from behavioral and mental health problems. These are just normal kids who want what any child wants, their mothers and fathers at home to tuck them in at night reassuring them everything will be all right. 
   Today more than 2,300,000 Americans demonstrate their courage and commitment every day to our Nation by serving in our Armed Forces. Of these men and women, most have families subjected to frequent moves from one installation to another, long deployments abroad, and the fear that their loved one serving overseas might never come home.     
   Fifty percent of our troops deployed overseas have children that are left behind. That is more than one million children with at least one parent deployed overseas. Those figures, statistics, can too easily be ignored sometimes because they are abstract. But here is one that can't be dismissed: 3,400 children have already lost a parent serving in the Armed Forces over the past 6 years. 
   When I introduced this resolution 2 years ago, the number of children who had lost a parent was 1,000 and now it is 3,400. The Department of Defense understands that without the families' support, they will never have the soldiers' full support. 
   In 1986, Secretary of Defense Casper Weinberger declared this month the ``National Month of the Military Child.'' Every year since, events at military bases, forts and other installations across the Nation have been held to celebrate the military family, replete with lots of lofty rhetoric but not enough true attention to their needs. 
   Two bases in my own district, Fort Belvoir and Fort Myer, hold annual events providing military kids the chance to be distracted a bit by just being a kid with other kids in similar situations. But the Congress needs to step up. 
   Today I am glad to join with my colleagues, particularly with my colleagues who will speak here today, to offer this resolution officially recognizing the month of April as the National Month of the Military Child, and dedicating the Congress to pay more attention to the children and the spouses of our soldiers. 
   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle, Representative Issa and Walter Jones of North Carolina are bipartisan sponsors for this effort. I thank them for their support and leadership. 
   This resolution is just a small way that Congress can recognize the sacrifice these youngsters and their families are asked to make, but it is an opportunity to commit ourselves to doing much more. 
   Specifically, the resolution joins the Secretary of Defense in honoring military children, recognizing that they too share the burden and are making a great sacrifice in protecting our Nation. 
   I would also like to take the opportunity to thank the organization Kids Serve Too. It is in my congressional district, and is dedicated to the needs of military families everywhere. It was created by military families to support other military families. Kids Serve Too sponsors activities and events for military children. It is represented in the gallery today specifically by Tricia Johnson and her daughters, Cat and Claire, and her sister, Kathleen Murphy. 
   Madam Speaker, military families and their children deserve our heartfelt appreciation for their sacrifice. Today we honor them and their sacrifice and thank you for bringing this resolution to the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Speaker, General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker are understandably trying to put a positive spin on the Iraq war. But the reality is that this has been the worst military fiasco in American history. But one of the questions I would like them to answer is how, when the Iraqi government has over $56 billion of revenue this year, they have the gall to ask the American taxpayer for another $170 billion? 
   They have $40 billion in reserve that they have gotten from oil being over $100 a barrel. The American taxpayer is paying more than $3.30 a gallon for gas, and yet Iraq wants another $170 billion? They have got $10 billion in reconstruction funds. Yet we are going to continue to pay for all their needs? But that is what we are doing. We are paying for everything from military training, all the way down to garbage pickup, with American taxpayers' money, when they have got tens of billions of dollars that they choose not to spend. 
   This is a disgrace, Madam Speaker. This policy has never been worthy of the sacrifice of our military families, let along their loved ones in uniform.

   Madam Speaker, the Select Intelligence Oversight Panel will bridge the current divide between the oversight  and the funding of our Nation's intelligence community, and it will make a significant long-term contribution to the safety of the American people. 
   The robust and lawful collection, analysis, and integration of intelligence on our enemy's activities is one of the most powerful tools in the battle against terrorism. But over the last several years, this Congress has been reluctant to ensure that this powerful tool is, in fact, used to its fullest capability. 
   It is time for Congress to fulfill its oversight responsibility by undertaking hard-nosed assessments of the intelligence community's operations. This oversight panel will be in the position to make these tough and needed assessments, and based on these conclusions, to make recommendations that will enable the intelligence community to deliver the highest level of performance. For example, our human intelligence assets must be able to infiltrate developing global terrorist networks. The exodus of long-serving professional agents from the intelligence community must be reversed, and a new generation of analysts must be recruited. 
   The Inspector General within the Directorate of National Intelligence must be empowered to identify waste, fraud, and abuse whenever it occurs throughout the intelligence community. 
   Madam Speaker, Speaker Pelosi's proposed panel will, in fact, improve the operations of the Nation's intelligence community and, in so doing, will advance the security of the American people. That is why this proposal should be passed overwhelmingly by the Congress.

   Just a few points about Rachel Carson and Silent Spring and the profound transformational effect that that book had on our society. 
   She was a Federal employee. She worked for the predecessor of the Fish and Wildlife Service. She was recognized, even as a child, as an outstanding writer. But she saw something that she knew was wrong, and she dedicated her life to changing the future for subsequent generations of Americans and really changed the world in terms of its view of pesticides. 
   At that time it wasn't just that pesticides were being poured all over farms but in our own residential neighborhoods. I can remember, I am old enough to remember, the big clouds of pesticides, and we would run in and out of them, and we would follow the pesticide truck on bicycles, and we had no idea this was poisonous stuff that was being put into our lungs, our atmosphere. And yet at that time the pesticide industry came up with a doctor, he was on television, everybody watched him as he said that she was absolutely wrong. There was no substance to her allegations; that if people  listened seriously to her, it would cause widespread disease and poverty all over the world.     
   And he said that the scientific evidence shows that there is no harm to these pesticides, these toxic chemicals. One might refer to that when we look at some of the other trailblazers who had the courage to speak up, despite those who too readily condemn them because they are making a profit from current conditions. Climate change, endocrine disruptions and the like. She had the kind of courage and intellect and goodness of spirit to change the world. I am very pleased that she is getting a little recognition from the Congress today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from Virginia for yielding to me. 
   As the sponsor of this legislation, I also want to thank the Democratic leadership for bringing it to the floor, because, Madam Speaker, sexual violence is an epidemic in this country, it is a threat to our public health and our public safety that demands our attention. One in six women and one in 33 men in the United States will be sexually assaulted during their lifetime. This is the highest rate of any country publishing statistics on sexual assault. A woman is raped in this country every 2 1/2 minutes. We must do more to stop that. Responding to sexual assault must start with prevention. 
   The roots of sexual violence are cultural. A study of American high school students found that the majority of girls and three-quarters of boys thought that forced sex was acceptable under some circumstances, including when a woman had had past sexual experiences or when a boy spent a lot of money on the girl. Statistics like this make it tragically unsurprising that 70 percent of assaults are perpetrated by someone that is known by the victim.     
   Fifty-five percent of rapes, the majority of rapes, occur in the home of the victim or a friend, relative or acquaintance. 
   We must begin with prevention, because the consequences of sexual violence are so severe and because it is a crime whose impact is felt disproportionately by those least able to protect themselves: the young, the disabled,  the impoverished. In addition to suffering the physical effects of these terrible acts of violence, a third of victims suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder, a third seriously consider suicide, and 13 percent actually attempt it. While we hope and work for a day when sexual violence might be eradicated completely from our society, we must also deal with the consequences of these crimes, working to provide assistance to victims and aggressively prosecuting offenders. 
   National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month is dedicated to increasing the public's understanding about sexual violence in our society. This effort can help communities support rape and sexual assault survivors, victims and their families, as well as the individuals and agencies that provide rape crisis intervention and prevention services throughout the year. 
   More than 1,000 rape crisis centers nationwide educate their communities about the prevention of sexual violence and provide services to victims. In Virginia, for example, these centers serve approximately 3,000 victims of rape every year. In my district, the SARA Program at the Alexandria Office on Women supports survivors throughout their healing process, through hotline counseling and support groups and innovative programs like ``Living Out Loud,'' a performing arts program for survivors of sexual violence looking to find new joy in life after recovering from rape or sexual assault. The person who founded that is an inspiration to everyone and brings back lives that have been so profoundly and adversely affected by this experience. 
   Madam Speaker, National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month is a chance for us to pause and consider the enormity of the impact of these crimes on our society and the status of our efforts to end it. I commend these public health, social services, and law enforcement professionals working in our communities to respond to sexual violence and those educators and advocates working to prevent it, and I encourage my colleagues to stand with us in rededicating ourselves to efforts to end these crimes on our streets, in our schools and in our lives.

   Now, think about this: This is a tremendous boom to Iran and Iraq. Iran will gain enormous wealth and political influence. Iraq will get even more revenue than the $72 billion they're anticipating this year. They got $100 billion over the last couple of years, much of it our money. 
   And yet Americans have already contributed over half a trillion dollars to Iraq's economy. Within the next couple of weeks, we'll appropriate another $170 billion. Iraqis are getting a surplus of oil revenue from us and yet we are paying to pick up their garbage and train their security forces when they've got surpluses they don't even know what to do with.

   What we are about to do now is to give the President a blank check to continue this war until the end of his term, to continue what has gone down in history as the worst foreign policy fiasco in American history. Nobody in their right mind can argue that this war was thoughtfully planned or responsibly executed, and yet we are going to give him a blank check. We will look back on this day and people will ask, why? 
   Well, I want to thank Mr. Obey, I want to thank Mr. Murtha, the Out of Iraq Caucus, and the majority of my colleagues. We did the right thing. History will record that. But this is a very sad day for us. When you think that 4,000 young men and women have given up their lives, tens of thousands seriously wounded. For what? For a nation that will wind up far more loyal to Iran than it will be to the United States, to a nation that in fact is allowing young people to roam the streets with guns and forcing school girls going to school having to wear their veils. A repressive society, what will become a Shiite theocracy. 
   Sure, there is less violence. But that is because we have ethically cleansed most of Baghdad. There is less violence because the Sunni warlords have taken time off from shooting American soldiers to ridding themselves of al Qaeda in Iraq because Muqtada al-Sadr has decided to take a 6-month hiatus from shooting us. But all of this is going to come back. We see no end in sight. This is a very bad day, and we ought to vote ``no.'' It is the responsible thing to do.

   Ed Brooke, as Ms. Norton has made clear, grew up in D.C., graduated from Dunbar, Harvard University, and then, of course, went on to be the editor of the Law Review at Boston University and got a Bronze Medal for his service in the military. 
   But I got to know Ed Brooke from a different perspective. In fact, Terry Lierman, who is now the chief of staff to our majority leader, and I were on the Appropriations staff when Ed Brooke was the ranking Republican. And what he did is incalculable in terms of school busing, in terms of women's reproductive rights, in the area of opening up federally-subsidized housing particularly, but housing throughout the Nation to all. 
   Ed Brooke was a temple of justice. His intellect was unparalleled. But what he exuded was a certain class, a dignity that just transcended partisanship. He was able to work with some of the, frankly, most narrow-minded Members of the Senate to get them to take votes that were the right thing to do. And he took very little credit for it. That is why this is so appropriate, to give him credit now, because he made a profound difference in the course our country took 30 years ago. 
   He would sit there in his calm, measured tone. He would explain why it is right to open up all of society and all of our economy to everyone who was willing to work hard and obey the law. 
   Ed Brooke was a model that all of us should look to for leadership. He was an extraordinary person. This is an extraordinary action we are taking today, but it is for someone who fully deserves it. 
   Again, I thank my colleagues here, and I thank the Congress for making this happen today. 
   I will yield the remainder of my time to Mr. Frank.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Virginia. (IRAQ AND OUR TAXES -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Speaker, yesterday our constituents filed their tax returns, but I wonder how many American taxpayers realize that the average tax return will be consumed in less than half a second in the Iraq war. When we grant the President the additional $100 billion he is asking in emergency funding for Iraq, we will be spending $5,000 a minute and $12 billion a month in a lost cause. 
   The American taxpayer is still paying for Iraq's garbage collection, their schools, their health clinics and their roads. When the Iraqi people themselves are running a surplus. They have almost $70 billion in accumulated surplus now. 
   The last couple of years, they have had $100 billion come in from oil revenue, and they budgeted it at about $55 a barrel. It is now about $112 a barrel. They are generating an enormous surplus that they don't know what to do with, and a whole lot of it is being stolen. 
   And yet we are paying still to collect their garbage. There is something wrong with this picture and the American taxpayer needs to stand up and speak out about it with a full measure of outrage.

   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, the Republican Party and the President will make it clear today to the American people that they own this war; hook, line and sinker. 
   The President and his Republican colleagues will be successful today in continuing the Iraq war, but this is a pyrrhic victory at best. The Democratic leadership is allowing this bill to pass because, unlike the President, they will not leave our troops unprotected in battle. It is our troops and their families that are the only ones being asked to make any sacrifice in this war, and this President's policy is unworthy of their sacrifice. 
   The only sacrifice requested of the rest of us has been to go out and spend our tax cuts at the mall. Meanwhile, the Iraqi parliament is preparing to take the summer off, probably using some of the missing $9 billion to sunbathe along the Mediterranean. Our soldiers risk life and limb to secure their country, which is in the midst of a civil war, and they go on vacation. Ask yourself if you think this is a war worthy of our soldiers' sacrifice. 
   We Democrats will do everything, legally and legislatively, to bring our troops home as soon and as safely as possible. That is our pledge to the American people, and we will keep it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, the words ``never again'' ring hollow today. It was exactly 3 years ago that we declared that what was happening in Darfur was genocide, and yet we have basically stood on the sidelines for these last 3 years. Lots of words, but no meaningful action. 
   What we said was that we would deny the Government of Sudan access to oil revenues and extend American business sanctions on Sudan. But we haven't done either in any meaningful way. Hundreds of thousands of people, innocent people, killed; millions made homeless while we have sat on our hands. 
   Oil accounts for 70 percent of Sudan's total exports. And do you know that 70 percent of Sudan's oil profits fund their military? And China buys much of their oil. 
   In fact, China is Sudan's largest trading partner. We could have enormous leverage over China if we chose to use it, but we choose not to. So when the Chinese Premier goes over to Sudan, instead of telling him this is wrong, he offers to build more palaces for President Bashir. Let's get serious. Let's not allow genocide to continue in the 21st century.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Chairman, 5 years ago, when we passed the Freedom to Farm Act, we were promised that it would clean up the subsidy programs that really dated back to the era of the Depression. It didn't. In fact, in many ways it made matters worse. I don't think we can wait another 5 years before we have fundamental reform. 
   The fact is that back in the 1930s, 25 percent of our population lived on farms. Today it's less than 2 percent. Today, corn, cotton, wheat, rice and soybeans count for 90 percent of our government commodity payments, and yet it leaves fruits and vegetables, which represent two-thirds of farm sales, ineligible for support. The largest farms that comprise only 3 percent of the total farms get the vast majority of crop subsidies today. 
   It just seems to me that it's time for fundamental reform that more fairly distributes the benefits of this program to all of America's deserving farms and families. That's why I support the Kind amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Chairman, I oppose this amendment, which is nothing less than an attack on the nation's most trusted source of reproductive health services and information. The Pence amendment would single out Planned Parenthood for exclusion from the Title X program, at odds with the principles repeatedly articulated by the United States Supreme Court. 
   Planned Parenthood is the nation's leading reproductive health care provider. The vast majority of services that Planned Parenthood provides are services to prevent unintended pregnancies, and test and treat for sexually transmitted infections, as well as breast and cervical cancer screening. 
   The vast majority of Planned Parenthood patients have incomes at or below 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level, women who are four times more likely to face an unintended pregnancy. For many women, and especially those in rural areas and underserved communities, Planned Parenthood is their only source of health care. Title X helps 575 Planned Parenthood clinics to provide over 3 million women with family planning services each year. 
   Madam Chairman, if we are to reduce the number of abortions in this country, as Mr. Pence clearly desires, we must get serious about prevention. Each year publicly funded contraceptive services help women prevent 1.3 million unintended pregnancies, which would otherwise result in 533,800 births, 632,300 abortions and 165,000 miscarriages. In the absence of publicly funded family planning, the number of abortions each year in the United States would be 40 percent higher than it currently is. In fact, from 1980 to 2000, Tide X clinics helped women prevent nearly 20 million unintended pregnancies, nine million of which would have ended in abortion. By restricting Title X, Mr. Pence's amendment would likely increase the number of abortions, particularly among our teenagers. 
   We should oppose Mr. Pence's amendment because it is an inhumane attack on the quality of life of low-income women in this country, but moreover, we should oppose it because it does not make good public health sense. Gutting funding for family planning will never bring us towards a day with fewer abortions, it will only increase the devastating costs imposed on society by unintended pregnancies among young women and teenaged girls.

   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Virtually every American has been impacted in one way or another by this deadly disease. More than 3 million women currently live with breast cancer. Each year tens of thousands of our wives, our mothers, our daughters will die from it. One of our colleagues, Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis, was just taken before her time from breast cancer. 
   Unfortunately, despite medical advances, breast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death among American women. In the United States, one in seven will develop the disease during her lifetime. But still a cure remains elusive. Congress hasn't given up the fight. H.R. 1157, the Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act, and H.R. 715, the Annie Fox Act, are two bills that would bring crucial Federal support to two key areas of breast cancer research: research into environmental causes of the disease, and research into the causes of the disease in young women who tend to develop more aggressive forms of it. 
   Additionally, in this year's Defense appropriations bill, $127.5 million was approved by the House for breast cancer research.  
   Women all over the country are organizing to raise national awareness. The Alexandria, Virginia Walk for Breast Cancer Awareness this Saturday is a prime example of the activism which is bound to make a difference in our daughters' lives.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the centennial of James Madison University. 
   Established in Harrisonburg, Virginia, by the Virginia General Assembly in 1908 as the State Normal and Industrial School for Women, the school's first student body was made up of 209 students and 15 faculty members. In 1938, its name was changed to Madison College in honor of the fourth President of the United States, James Madison. In 1966, the university became a coeducational institution, and in 1976, the university's name was changed to James Madison University. Today, the university enrolls nearly 17,000 students and employs 3,000 full-time and part-time faculty and staff. 
   In addition to its expansion in physical size dramatic and student enrollment, JMU has experienced dramatic growth in academic prestige and popularity over the past 20 years. For the 13th consecutive year and 17th time, James Madison University ranked as the top public, master's-level university in the South in the highly regarded annual survey on academic quality conducted by U.S. News & World Report. JMU also had the highest graduation rate--80 percent--among both public and private colleges in the South. Last spring, a record 16,050 students applied for 3,300 spots in the 2007-2008 freshman class. 
   James Madison University is also notable for encouraging its students to engage in the global community. According to the Institute of International Education, JMU ranks second nationally among master's-level institutions for the total number of students studying abroad. With 65 of its alumni serving as Peace Corps volunteers in developing countries, JMU also ranks second in the nation among medium-sized colleges and universities for graduates currently serving as volunteers with the U.S. service program. 
   Over the past 100 years, James Madison University has grown from a small technical college for women into a thriving academic institution that exemplifies the full promise of a public university. Throughout its growth, JMU has maintained its core mission of providing a terrific education and producing well-rounded alumni prepared to contribute to society, while at the same time fostering an inclusive and high-spirited atmosphere that complements its beautiful location in the Shenandoah Valley. 
   Madam Speaker, it is truly an honor to have James Madison University in the State of Virginia and to recognize its 100 years of achievement. I ask all my colleagues to support this resolution and to congratulate the impressive achievements of James Madison University.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank my very good friend from Texas. 
   Mr. Speaker, human trafficking is one of the greatest human rights tragedies of our time. The passage of this legislation will bring thousands of victims of slavery out of the shadows and prosecute those that would take advantage of voiceless souls for a marginal profit. 
   One of the key provisions in this legislation is the prevention and punishment of diplomats who abuse their servants. As many as 50,000 women and children, according to the Department of State, are trafficked into the United States annually and are trapped in slavery-like situations, including forced prostitution. 
   Currently, no government agency tracks instances of forced domestic labor at the hands of diplomats. Last year, the State Department issued about 2,000 domestic worker visas. In the plush residences of diplomats, servants' passports can be withheld. Many are paid as little $1 a day and suffer emotional and physical abuse. While the Department of State has indicated that some diplomats are asked to leave because of domestic abuse, it is unclear how many are prosecuted. 
   We are redefining our policies on human trafficking, and I would hope that with these new provisions we are able to crack down on this loophole that makes it too easy for diplomats to abuse their domestic servants. 
   Diplomats currently hide behind diplomatic immunity. This should not be the case when it comes to serious crimes such as human trafficking. They abuse domestic servants, and it is increasingly hard to prosecute them. This has to change. This legislation will help prevent future instances of domestic servant abuse in diplomatic residences. 
   So I look forward to these new provisions being implemented by the Department of State as they attempt to eliminate all forms of slavery, and I thank both committees for getting this legislation to the floor and urge everybody to vote for it.

   The District of Columbia is home to over 570,000 residents. It has a larger population than Wyoming, which is represented by an at-large member in the House and two Senators. 
   The men and women of the District of Columbia pay their taxes, both to the Federal Government and the District. They salute the American flag at Nationals, Wizards, Caps and Redskins games. And they serve or have served in the Armed Forces. D.C. is home to over 44,000 veterans. In Iraq and Afghanistan, four brave men have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. 
   Yet despite being an integral part of the fabric of our Nation, D.C. continues to be denied a vote in Congress. 
   Today we are considering compromise, bipartisan legislation coauthored by my friends and colleagues Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton and Representative Tom Davis. From his position on the Government Oversight Committee Congressman Davis has spent considerable time and attention on issues affecting the District. And there is no stronger advocate for her constituents than the gentlewoman from D.C. 
   I compliment the bill's sponsors for crafting a thoughtful approach and a clever compromise that grants Utah an at-large representative to balance any potential partisan division. It keeps this proposal bipartisan and improves its prospects for favorable Senate action. I hope the White House will rethink its current concerns and join our bipartisan coalition to affirm the District's right to a vote. 
   Some who oppose this legislation have stated that it raises constitutional concerns. But, as was stated in a recent op-ed by the Republican D.C. Councilwoman Carol Schwartz, no less conservative scholars than former solicitor general Kenneth Starr, former chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3996, the Temporary Tax Relief Act of 2007. This bill will bring relief to tens of millions of hardworking American families, including nearly 100,000 in my district alone. 
   It makes responsible, sensible changes to the tax code to make it more efficient and more equitable, changes that are sound both morally and economically. Most importantly, H.R. 3996 will be the first tax relief bill of this millennium that did not increase the deficit. 
   This bill would lower the tax burden on 95 percent of the people affected by it--which is about as close to perfect as we're able to get with the tax code. I'd like to commend Chairman Rangel and his staff for their work on this excellent bill, which I am proud to support today. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are at something of an impasse. The President's budget assumes the revenue next year from a vast expansion of the AMT, and the President has offered no alternative to either eliminate the AMT or patch it, likely in recognition of the immense cost to the treasury. Yet nearly everyone agrees that we must pass some form of AMT relief this year and that we must do it soon. The Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation have spelled out specifically what the cost of a one-year AMT patch would be. It cannot, whatever tooth fairies we might wish to believe in, be accomplished for free. 
   What we seem to disagree on is how to reconcile these two truths. We don't have many choices, Mr. Speaker, and other Members are correct in pointing out that many of them are difficult. The consequences of choosing wrong, however, are far too drastic for us to avoid confronting the problem head on. 
   If we are to pass an AMT ``patch,'' we can do one of three things: we can cut benefits in Social Security and Medicare to comply with Pay-Go, we can raise additional revenue to comply with Pay-Go, or we can waive Pay-Go and continue financing tax cuts by increasing the federal deficit and the national debt. That is, we can just irresponsibly pass the buck to our children and grandchildren. 
   Mr. Speaker, I do not think it would be possible for me to oppose waiving Pay-Go in sufficiently strong terms. As the gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. Capuano, told us yesterday, this Administration has increased U.S. government debt by an average of $15,644.93 per second since they took office. 
   Pretending that sexual activity among teenagers does not exist will not reduce the number of new sexually transmitted infections; it will not reduce the number of teenage girls who become pregnant; and it will not reduce the number of abortions performed every year. 
   I want to thank Chairman Obey for including language in this Conference Report to ensure that programs will not be funded that are medically inaccurate. I hope that in the future, we can continue to work together to ensure that our children receive high quality, science-based, age-appropriate sex education that is medically sound and free from ideological or religious bias. Despite my concerns about this program, Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this important bill and urge my colleagues to do the same, so that we can get needed funds to these critical programs as soon as possible.

   Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. Capuano, told us yesterday, this administration has increased U.S. Government debt by an average of $15,644.93 per second since they took office. 
   This money does not exist merely on paper; it is real money, which we are borrowing from countries whose interests are contrary to our own, countries like China that have accumulated sovereign wealth funds at alarming rates over the past 6 years. And we are leaving this legacy of fiscal wreckage to our children, and our children's children, mortgaging away their future at a rate of more than $15,000 per second. 
   Since 2001, China's accumulation of foreign reserves, mostly U.S. dollars, have increased from $46.6 billion to $1.066 trillion--that is, every new dollar we borrow makes us ever more dependent on China--which has profoundly different strategic aims than we do. 
   The idea that we should not pay for this AMT fix is unconscionable. The idea that we should sacrifice the futures of our children and our grandchildren in order to have our cake and eat it too, to continue giving enormous tax preferences to the richest of the rich in this country is morally bankrupt and fiscally unsound. 
   Mr. Speaker, even if we accept that there should be a distinction between the taxation of labor and capital income, income received as payment for the service of investing other people's money is not capital income under even the loosest of possible understandings. 
   The idea that a hedge fund manager earning $500 million a year should be taxed at a lower rate than his secretary, who earns $40,000 a year is preposterous in both moral and economic terms and should embarrass us all. 
   This bill is about making a choice between what is right and what is easy. I applaud Chairman RANGEL for standing firm in the face of overwhelming pressure to do the easy thing, for demanding that we pass a bill which is true to our principles. We were not elected to make easy choices--we were elected to do right by our constituents, their children, and their children's children. I am proud to support this bill today, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of this important bill. PEPFAR-funded programs have provided life-saving assistance in the fight against HIV/AIDS, and I welcome any expansion of this assistance. Additionally, I am pleased that we have removed the ``hard earmark'' requiring 33% of all prevention funds be spent on abstinence-only until marriage programs. Studies by GAO and the Institutes of Medicine found that the one-third earmark undermines successful HIV prevention efforts by limiting flexibility in developing countries. However, I continue to be concerned about any funds being directed towards unproven, ineffective programs using the ``abstinence-only'' approach. I worry that the new ``balanced funding'' requirement may cause mission directors and public health officials to be anxious about doing what they think Congress wants, instead of what is needed in the field. Public health experts on the ground are the ones who can best determine the mix of prevention activities, especially since what works for one culture may be disastrous for another. Even in our own country, young people who take part in abstinence-only education are less likely to use condoms. With 15,000 new HIV infections every day, the need for additional resources is clearly tremendous, and I'm extremely supportive of the goals of this important legislation, and I continue to believe that our highest priority should be funding science-based, comprehensive efforts to prevent HIV.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007. Truly, we face a health care crisis in this country--in the richest country on Earth, 46 million Americans do not have health insurance, including 9 million children. Today's bipartisan, bicameral compromise is not a perfect solution to that problem but is a decisive, strong step towards covering uninsured kids and fulfilling our moral obligation to our children. 
   In my home state of Virginia, the CHIP program currently provides coverage to 137,642 low-income children each year; 171,642 children in Virginia remain uninsured, and the CHIP Reauthorization Act will help us cover 74,200 of these children. The CHIP Reauthorization Act will ensure that these children have access to high quality health care, including the preventative services that children need to be healthy and successful in school and later in life. This bill will provide dental and mental health benefits on par with medical and surgical services--truly ensuring that the whole child's health is provided for. 
   The CHIP Reauthorization Act does this without increasing the deficit, by increasing the Federal excise tax on cigarettes. In my view as chairman of the Congressional Prevention Caucus, an increase in the Federal tobacco tax is sound public health policy. It provides a reliable revenue source to offset the costs of expanding coverage to low-income children and it will reduce health care costs in this country by reducing the prevalence of chronic disease. 
   This bill also addresses a serious problem arising from the implementation of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. Opponents of this responsible, common-sense, humane adjustment claim that language in the 2005 Deficit Reduction Act, DRA, that imposed harsher citizenship verification requirements on state Medicaid programs, is the only barrier protecting taxpayer dollars from being spent on healthcare for illegal immigrants. Madam Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. 
   First and foremost, existing Federal law and provisions in the CHIP Reauthorization Act prevent Federal funds from being spent to provide benefits for illegal immigrants. Section 605 
   specifically states that ``nothing in this act allows Federal payment for individuals who are not legal immigrants.'' Illegal immigrants have never been eligible for Medicaid, and nothing in the CHIP Reauthorization Act would change that fact. 
   Secondly, the DRA requirements have overwhelmingly failed to save taxpayer dollars. Instead, they have imposed substantial additional costs on taxpayers while reducing health care benefits available to poor children. Wait times have skyrocketed, and measures to streamline the application process have been rendered impossible. 
   Third, these draconian requirements, which are far stricter than those employed by other government programs, have caused tens of thousands of U.S. citizen children to lose health insurance coverage. In Virginia, there was a net decline of more than 11,000 children enrolled in Medicaid during the first 9 months of implementation. Kansas has seen a net decline of 14,000 children. The Virginia State Medicaid Office has identified a total of two undocumented immigrants during this period. 
   The debate about reauthorizing SCHIP should be about the public health and improving the health of our children. In a recent survey, 90 percent of parents applying for Medicaid for their children indicated that they have no other health coverage available. Allowing State flexibility in citizenship verification is sound public health policy that would enable thousands of American children access to vital  health services to help them live better, healthier, and more productive lives. Twenty-four Senators, twelve Governors, and fifty-one other House Members joined me in requesting that this important provision be included. I thank the Committees for including this provision, and for working with our Republican colleagues to improve the provision and ensure that SCHIP and Medicaid serve the low-income American children they were aimed at. 
   Reauthorizing SCHIP is sound public health policy--research shows that children who have access to health insurance are substantially more likely to access key preventative services, miss fewer days of school due to illness, get better grades, and continue to have superior outcomes later in life. Moreover, the financial benefits of covering children vastly outweigh the costs--one need only compare the cost of a visit to a primary care provider to the cost of a night spent in the emergency room to see this. But above all, covering all our children is a moral imperative--it is the only possible humane, responsible course of action. I urge a yes vote on the underlying bill, and furthermore, would urge the President, in the strongest possible terms, not to veto this vitally needed, responsible legislation to cover the most vulnerable members of our society: our children.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Virginia. (POST OFFICE BOX 1142 RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, from 1942 through the end of the Second World War, a top secret military intelligence service operated clandestinely on the shores of our own Potomac River. At Fort Hunt Park, along the GW Parkway, a secret installation operated silently in the shadows of our Nation's Capital. 
   Known only by its mailing address, P.O. Box 1142, the men and women at this post provided the military intelligence that helped bring an end to World War II and gave the United States an early advantage in the Cold War. 
   P.O. Box 1142 was an interrogation center. Throughout the war and its aftermath, the post processed and interrogated nearly 4,000 of the most important German prisoners of war. 
   The men who performed the interrogations were drawn from across the country. The shared attribute is that they all spoke fluent German to be able to interact with their captives. Many were Jewish, to ensure their loyalty to America's mission. And most had friends and family battling on the front lines against Nazi Germany. To them, the war was personal and would impact their lives forever. 
   Despite these circumstances, their interrogations never resorted to torture, used violence, or implemented cruel tactics to obtain the vital information required to support our Nation at war. Instead, their most effective interrogation technique was to start a dialogue to develop trust with their captives. They all talked with their captives, played card games, took walks, discussed their lives, and ultimately obtained the necessary information from their captives. Despite the apparent simplicity of these methods, these interrogations resulted in the discovery of most of Germany's secret weapons programs. 
   P.O. Box 1142 learned about research to develop the atomic bomb, the jet engine and the V-2 rocket, all technologies that became essential informational components in waging the Cold War. The detainment and interrogation of high-ranking German officials, such as Reinhard Gehlen, who ran the German intelligence operations, advanced our military intelligence operations well beyond the Soviet Union's capabilities. 
   In advancing the Nation's interests and uncovering vital secrets, the interrogators at P.O. Box 1142 never resorted to tactics such as sleep deprivation, electrical shock, or waterboarding. Their captives were never sexually abused, humiliated, or tortured. They never resorted to the methods that have recently branded our Nation so negatively. As a result of the war on terror, I'm afraid that America is now haunted by lasting images of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay. The current intelligence community can learn from the men of P.O. Box 1142. For all our sake, I hope it's not too late. 
   Despite the vital work that the interrogators at P.O. Box 1142 performed, their activities remained closely held secrets by those who worked at the post. Many of these men never told family or loved ones. It wasn't until park rangers from the GW Memorial Parkway uncovered declassified documents and met former officers of P.O. Box 1142 that the operations that occurred at Fort Hunt Park during World War II became known. 
   Under the encouragement of the National Park Service, these park rangers identified veterans of P.O. Box 1142. They conducted professional oral history interviews. The deeper the park rangers dug, the more obvious it became they had discovered a remarkable story that had remained unrecognized by the officers because of their oath of secrecy. 
   After 2 years of work, the National Park Service decided it was time for the men of P.O. Box 1142 to finally be acknowledged. On October 5 and 6, the National Park Service held the first-ever reunion of the veterans of P.O. Box 1142 at Fort Hunt Park. The veterans raised the American flag in the post's original flag pole setting and memorialized the grounds. 
   Today, I'm proud to play a small part in giving justified credit for the tremendous work performed at P.O. Box 1142. Along with my northern Virginia colleagues, Congressmen Tom Davis and Frank Wolf, I'm introducing a long, overdue resolution to honor the men of P.O. Box 1142. 
   Mr. Speaker, I extend my appreciation to these veterans. The Nation owes a great debt to them for their sacrifice to our Nation during a time of war for their pursuit of critical intelligence, while maintaining the highest level of integrity and America's moral values, and for their intrepid actions that have, until very recently, gone unacknowledged.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Virginia. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairman and his staff for including the Moran-Shays amendment in the manager's package of the College Opportunity and Affordability Act. For some time, Mr. Shays and I have been concerned with maintaining the strength of our Nation's public service. This amendment lays an early foundation for a greater Federal role in encouraging and facilitating public service. 
   The Moran-Shays amendment will bring together the experts in the field of public service to study how student loan debt affects the decisions of graduates of postsecondary and graduate education programs to enter into public service careers. Specifically, the study assesses the current challenges to recruiting and retaining well-qualified public servants, evaluates existing Federal programs and whether additional Federal programs could increase the number of graduates who enter careers in public service, and recommends pilot programs, including the establishment of a public service academy, to encourage careers in public service. 
   The new century has brought immense challenges that require strong and prepared public institutions. On the eve of the retirement of the baby-boom generation, our Nation presses for a new generation of teachers, firefighters, Federal employees, and other civil servants to fill the void they will leave. 
   Young Americans are answering the call. According to the Higher Education Research Institute, two-thirds of the 2005 freshman class at institutions of higher education expressed a desire to serve others, the highest rate in a generation. 
   Yet, an impediment to public service is the increase in college tuitions and debts, making it difficult for graduates to pursue careers in the public sector. These future public servants are potentially overburdened by the debts of college and university loans, forced to choose private sector jobs over public service opportunities. 
   By providing students with a federally funded education, the stress of debts would be eliminated, and their commitment to the public service sector for at least 5 years could lead to lifelong service. 
   I have joined with Representative Chris Shays and Senators Hillary Clinton and Arlen Specter to introduce the U.S. Public Service Academy Act. Modeled after the military service academies, this academy will provide a 4-year, federally subsidized college education for more than 5,000 students each year in exchange for a 5-year commitment to public service, including fields that will most need a new generation of leaders, such as public education, public health, and law enforcement. We are encouraged by the support the proposal has gained so far, as nearly 100 bipartisan cosponsors in the House of Representatives have joined in this effort. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Moran-Shays amendment will continue to make the case for Federal intervention into promoting public service, including possibly a public service academy. I thank the committee for including the study in the manager's amendment, and I urge passage of the College Opportunity and Affordability Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Virginia. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from New Jersey. 
   I rise in support of this bill. I can't believe the argument in opposition to this bill, that we should continue to stay the course, because this is the policy that has led us in the wrong direction for four straight years. This has been the worst foreign policy fiasco in American history. 
   Now we're being told that we're there to fight al Qaeda. There were no al Qaeda in Iraq when we went into Iraq. Saddam had nothing to do with 9/11. Now there are about 5,000 there out of a population of 26 million. 
   We have trained hundreds of thousands of Iraqis. Many of them we've given them more training than we've given our own troops. 
   This policy is not worthy of the sacrifice of our troops and their military families. It's leading us down a dead-end street. It's time that it was changed. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are told that we need to train the Iraqis more. All we are doing is equipping and training them in order to kill each other in a civil war that I'm afraid is going to be inevitable.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Virginia. (GENERATIONS INVIGORATING VOLUNTEERISM AND EDUCATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I would like to take a minute to recognize an enduring legacy of John F. Kennedy--the Peace Corps--in recognition of its 47th anniversary this year. It is an honor to serve with the likes of my colleague and friend Chris Shays and others in this body and the others who serves our country in the enhancement of citizen diplomacy. I hope all Americans will join us in supporting and expanding this enduring commitment to convey our values as a Nation. 
   As Fareed Zakaria wrote: ``We must begin to think about life after Bush--a cheering prospect for his foes, a dismaying one for his fans (however few there may be at the moment). In 11 months he will be a private citizen, giving speeches to insurance executives. America, however, will have to move on and restore its place in the world. To do this we must first tackle the consequences of our foreign policy of fear. Having spooked ourselves into believing that we have no option but to act fast, alone, unilaterally and pre-emptively, we have managed in six years to destroy decades of international good will, alienate allies, embolden enemies and yet solve few of the major international problems we face.'' 
   The London Financial Times last December reported that the U.S. has suffered a significant loss of power and prestige around the world in the years since the beginning of this century, limiting our ability to influence international crises, according to an annual survey from a well regarded British security think-tank. The 2007 Strategic Survey of the non-partisan International Institute for Strategic Studies' picked the decline of U.S. authority as one of the most important security developments of the past year--but suggested the fading of American prestige began earlier, largely due to its failings in Iraq. 
   One of our most special and effective citizen agencies of public diplomacy is the Peace Corps. Think of this--more than 187,000 volunteers have served this venerable legacy of former President Kennedy, serving in 139 countries--where they bring our values to other peoples, and bring understanding and appreciation of other cultures back home. 
   The greatest gift of the Peace Corps and other civilian programs is not just that ordinary Americans share their values and our culture with other peoples, but also that when volunteers return, they bring greater understanding and appreciation of other cultures. 
   Foreign policy is not just what we do, but also who we are. America as a place has often been the great antidote to U.S. foreign policy--and it should be again. Mr. Zakaria writes that ``When American actions across the world have seemed harsh, misguided or unfair, America itself has always been open, welcoming and tolerant.....'' 
   At the end of the day, our openness is our greatest foreign policy. We have succeeded not because of the ingenuity of our government, but rather because of efforts like this unique program to keep ourselves open to the world--to 
   sending our people out across the countries of the world to share our unique culture, our goods and services, our ideas and inventions, our people and cultures. This openness, this civilian diplomacy, has allowed us to make friends across boundaries. It will be central to our place as a nation in the future. 
   This week, as we celebrate National Peace Corps Week, we honor the more than 190,000 volunteers who have served in 139 developing countries since President Kennedy's call to service in 1961--and I honor 44 of my constituents currently serving our country in places as diverse as China, Mali, Azerbaijan, Macedonia, El Salvador, and Namibia. This can be lonely and demanding service, but service that can create enduring friendships and values that transcend boundaries and cultures. 
   Today, more than 8,000 Peace Corps volunteers around the world are currently providing training and education in 74 countries. These volunteers each donate their time and skills for over 2 years, in order to make a difference in the world and to promote understanding between cultures. By offering their valuable skills and showing a passion for helping others, they show the world that Americans value learning and cross-cultural exchange. 
   Volunteers work in areas of education, health and HIV/AIDS, business development, environment, agriculture and youth, and must often be creative and flexible when living and working in new cultures and learning new languages. The resulting experience is rewarding for all involved, and it highlights the importance of cooperation and involvement between cultures around the globe. 
   When volunteers return home and share their overseas experiences with their communities, the Peace Corps helps Americans as much as the people in developing countries. From recent college graduates to doctors with decades of experience, volunteers choose to use their valuable skills and education to help people all over the world, but their work affects their lives long after returning home. 
   This week we remember the dedication and passion of Peace Corps volunteers, young and old, current and returned. We thank them for their service, and encourage more Americans to volunteer with the Peace Corps.

I congratulate Chairman MILLER and Chairwoman MCCARTHY and Ranking Members MCKEON and PLATTS on their work toward this day and moving us closer to finally reauthorizing the Corportation for National and Community Service. 
   There are many noteworthy programs in the GIVE Act, including Senior Corps and AmeriCorps, which give countless Americans the opportunity to volunteer. Today, I would like to bring attention to a new and very promising program that I have worked to include in the GIVE Act. This new part of the law will provide grants to non-profit organizations to encourage increased volunteer, community, workforce, and educational participation in older adults. 
   Recent research shows that Americans in the second half of life--regardless of income, educational level, or race--want to explore options for the next stage of life, including service opportunities, obtaining new training, retooling existing skills, pursuing educational interests, and exploring flexible work. 
   This initiative is a timely and necessary way to help the large U.S. `boomer' generation make the transition to a new productive life phase by providing support and community connections for ongoing learning, development, and contribution to society. Similar programs currently function as an initiative of Civic Ventures and are a proven success. 
   I am hopeful that we will be able to bring a program to my district to assist those that are in a transition period, whether they have lost a job, are looking for a career change, or would like to move into a volunteer role in the community. 
   Mr. Chairman, again I thank the leadership of the Education and Labor Committee and its excellent staff for assisting in securing this program authorization and in moving the GIVE Act forward.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Virginia. (RECOGNIZING AND COMMENDING EFFORTS TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT AND HELP END THE WORSENING HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AND GENOCIDE IN DARFUR, SUDAN -- (House of Representatives - October 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. I thank my friend and colleague from Tennessee (Mr. Tanner). 
   Mr. Speaker, the intent of this resolution is to recognize the outstanding work of the school, community and faith-based advocacy groups who, through their moral commitment and tireless efforts and countless hours of volunteer service, have helped bring needed attention to the genocide occurring in Darfur. Their efforts reflect the true spirit of Americans and bring hope to those who are facing historic atrocities halfway around the world. 
   I want to particularly commend the students who are fueling this nationwide movement, urging action to stop genocide by educating their peers and holding us, their elected officials, accountable.     
   And hold us accountable they have. I recently met with students from an organization whose primary goal is to form a nationwide anti-genocide coalition. This organization has more than 700 chapters, provides students with creative and effective organizing materials and policy and advocacy training. Recently, in my home State of Virginia, several outstanding students from the New School of Virginia held a 3-day conference where they educated fellow students about the genocide in Darfur. 
   I was so moved by their sincere and energetic commitment to ending that genocide, I invited the students to Congress, where they were led by Semhar Araia and Lia Parada of my staff. These high school students briefed Members of Congress on their efforts to put pressure on the Government of Sudan to stop the genocide. Having given their peers numerous briefings on the situation in Darfur, these students took it upon themselves to ask poignant, pressing questions of our colleagues. Their message was clear: help us save Darfur. 
   Having learned that villages have been razed, women systematically raped and branded, men murdered, and food and water supplies destroyed, they are determined to make a difference, and to continue speaking up until their government does the right thing. 
   Now, we hear slogans from our President like, ``not on our watch,'' and we believe that he is sincere when he says that. But our society continues to be witness to a crisis as devastating as Rwanda. Our youth can't understand why it continues today, after years of knowing what has been going on, tens of thousands have died, hundreds of thousands are displaced and living in refugee camps. More than 2 million people have been driven from their homes. 
   And over the last few years, we've seen major changes in U.S. foreign policy with respect to the ongoing crisis in Darfur, but a far more aggressive response is still needed. 
   On July 22 of 2004, Congress declared that the atrocities unfolding in Darfur constituted genocide. On September 9 of that year, former Secretary of State Colin Powell stated that ``genocide has been committed in Darfur and that the Government of Sudan and the janjaweed bear responsibility.'' 
   On April 18 of this year, President George Bush asserted that the United States has a moral obligation to help end the genocide in Darfur. But it still goes on. 
   Had it not been for the grass-roots effort to pressure the administration and other national governments on this humanitarian crisis, I doubt we would see the United Nations African Union peacekeepers in Darfur. 
   But we have got to do so much more. The mission is not complete. Just last month, on September 29, an estimated 1,000 members of a heavily armed Darfur rebel group overran a base in Haskanita, which is occupied by the African Union Mission. This ambush resulted in intense fighting that killed 10 peacekeepers and wounded many others; 50 soldiers are still missing. According to U.N. estimates, in the aftermath of the brutal attack, 15,000 civilians had to flee the area to neighboring towns or the wilderness. 
   The effort and resources put into resolving this conflict pale compared to what the President has requested for Iraq. Clearly, there's so much more that we as a Nation could be doing to end this crisis. The humanitarian situation is not improving. African Union peacekeeping forces are limited to only 7,000 troops. As evidenced by the attack on Haskanita, it is unlikely that their efforts alone will ensure any real meaningful progress. We've got to keep  pressuring the Sudanese Government and build support for a larger peacekeeping force. More Americans need to speak out day in, day out, like these students are. We cannot continue to allow the raping, the massacreing, the displacement of people to continue. These students are asking us to hear them, to act, and to bring to bear the strength of the nations of the world to address this conflict. 
   That's why I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution that recognizes those who have selflessly devoted themselves to raising awareness of the crisis in Darfur.

   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. I thank Mr. Royce for bringing up this issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's terribly important, it's all about man's inhumanity to mankind. Here China envisions itself becoming a superpower in the 21st century, hosting the world's Olympics. 
   We, in the United States, are buying tens of billions of dollars of goods from China. China has the opportunity to take its place among the nations of the world that matter, that do the right thing, that lead us into the future. What a terrific opportunity for China to show that it has a moral fiber, that it knows right from wrong, that it is not an amoral totalitarian state. 
   It knows, beyond any shadow of a doubt, the horrific conditions within which the North Korean people exist today, barely surviving. Yet, out of total desperation, when they are able to escape North Korea, do the Chinese help? No. They make it worse. It's as though they have escaped from some purgatory into hell where they get beaten up by the Chinese and then sent back to North Korea, probably to be executed. 
   This is a situation that just cries out for people around the world to speak up. I appreciate the fact that Mr. Royce has given us that opportunity in the House of Representatives today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, greed is the accelerator that drives a capitalist economy. But unless you are willing to tap on the regulatory brakes once in awhile, you are going to crash. We learned that 75 years ago, and now we are learning it again. But now the average American household is being asked to cough up about $5,000 to bail out Wall Street. That is not fair. Nor will the plan that we are being given prove to be effective. 
   What we need to do is to deal with the underlying mortgages, to restructure those mortgages, rather than force the taxpayer to be buying securities that they wouldn't buy in their own good judgment. The taxpayer cannot be held holding the bag. 
   What we need to do is stay in session until we can get it right, until we can prove to our constituents that what we have done is responsible and fair. We cannot vote this week on a $700 billion package, when we really don't know what is responsible and fair.

We wish we could do far more than we are able to on the horrific situation in Darfur.     
   But I also want to express my support for the work of an international nongovernmental organization, the International Commission on Missing Persons, otherwise known as the ICMP. The ICMP is an organization whose work in Bosnia, Iraq, Vietnam and the tsunami-affected areas has brought relief to thousands of families with missing relatives resulting from arm ed conflict and natural disaster. This commission, which was established in 1996 from the Dayton Peace Accords, has received U.S. Government support in the past and is widely acclaimed throughout the international community. But is in desperate need of funds in Iraq today. 
   I would strongly urge the committee to consider this organization for possible congressional support in this year's conference or in future appropriations.

   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, what we should be doing here is eliminating the gag rule. But that is not what we are doing. All that this amendment does is to allow family-planning organizations to receive free donations of contraceptives and condoms. 
   Now, instead, the opposition wants to prohibit even this, even though you suggest that you are for family planning. You would never do this to the women of America because they have control over their lives. But the women of the Third World don't have control over their lives, and you know that. 
   What is going to happen without access to contraceptives is that 52 million unwanted pregnancies will occur, and there will be almost 30 million abortions as a result. Where is the sense in that? 
   We have got to find a way for women to control their lives in the Third World. The fact is a vast majority of women in the Third World don't have any control over when the sex act is performed. That is not their choice. Most of them are married and most of them are in faithful relationships irregardless of their husband's conduct. They are overwhelmed by the number of children they have to provide for. But you want to deny them the ability to control the number of children in their family? 
   Not to pass this amendment i s punitive. This is punishing of those women. It is wrong. It is immoral, in fact. This moderate amendment certainly should be passed by this Congress in the 21st century.

   Mr. MORAN of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Fiscal 2008 State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Act and to express my appreciation for the significant increase in funding for trade capacity building. 
   This bill raises the Federal appropriation to $214 million, $87 million more than the administration requested. 
   Regardless of one's position on trade, helping our trading partners, particularly those in developing countries, with the financial assistance to improve enforcement of their labor and environmental laws is a good thing. 
   I would encourage the State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee to consider holding a hearing to assess how these funds have been effective at building capacity in these developing countries. 
   I think there is a good story that should be told. 
   Looking forward, however, we have several free trade agreements that we will be asked to consider in the next few months, Peru, Panama, Colombia, and Korea. 
   Three, Peru, Panama and Colombia, are with developing countries that are eligible to receive trade capacity assistance. 
   And while none of these agreements is a done deal, Colombia appears to be the one with the greatest level of concern. 
   A number of our colleagues are rightly concerned about Colombia's record on human rights and the alarmingly high number of labor leaders that have been killed in recent years. 
   Given this concern, I would like to see this appropriation clarify that some portion of the $214 million should go specifically to the Colombian Government, the attorney general's office, which is charged with investigating these killings and bringing the perpetrators to justice. 
   The attorney general has is no easy task. 
   President Uribe's effort to disband the paramilitary groups and bring about a peace agreement with the insurgents has made progress, but it has also overwhelmed the attorney general's office and the courts with a backlog of petitions to adjudicate. 
   Thousands of cases of former paramilitary soldiers and insurgents must be investigated before any seeking amnesty can be pardoned. 
   Only those proven innocent of any human rights abuses are granted amnesty. 
   I understand that the killing of labor leaders is being investigated, but the progress is slow and complicated by competing demands to clear the backlog of requests for pardons and amnesties. 
   I think Colombia would welcome our financial assistance to expedite the investigations into human rights abuses and killings of labor leaders. 
   I also think an offer of assistance would be a tangible demonstration of our willingness to help them address our concerns. 
   I encourage you to consider this request when you begin your discussions with the Senate on a final conference agreement.
