<DOCNO>Mr. TIERNEY. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIERNEY. Madam Chairman, it is the policy of the United States to encourage the practice and procedure of collective bargaining. It is the policy of the United States to protect the exercise of workers of full freedom of association. It is the policy of the United States to protect their self-organizing and their ability to designate representatives of their own choosing. 
   You wouldn't think that were true to listen to what we are hearing from the other side. It is the best man-bite-dog story we have heard, and the irony is not lost when people stand up there professing to care about the workers on this, while all the while, the National Labor Relations Act, section 7, protects those rights, and section 8 prohibits a variety of practices, and is not doing a very good job of that. 
   It would prohibit employers from interfering with or coercing or intimidating or discriminating against employees in the exercise of their rights. It has not been successful in that fact at all. 
   These protections have not been enough. The reality is when employees want to try to organize a union, one out of every four get fired illegally. Fired. Twenty-five percent of the people for the union activity. Their remedy? Go to court for years and years, and then if you are successful, you might get rehired, you might get some back pay, but, of course, you would have to offset that with whatever you earned in the meantime. Too many employers think that is a pretty good deal, a risk worth taking. 
   In 2005, 31,000 workers received back pay because of illegal employer discrimination. That should do away with any thought that this is just a minor problem. Over three-quarters, 78 percent of employers in organizing drives forced their employees to attend one-on-one meetings against the union with their own supervisors. There is no ``truth squad'' in there and nobody making sure what they say is fair and balanced. Ninety-two percent of employers force employees to attend mandatory captive audience meetings, again, the union, and three-quarters of employers in organizing drives hire consultants or union busting firms to fight the organizing drive. How naive would we have to be to think that those union busters are in there to make a fair and level playing ground? 
   The fact of the matter is employers have also been notorious in dragging out the initial negotiations, for years. That is not good faith bargaining as it is supposed to be protected in that Act. They are making a mockery of the National Labor Relations Act, unless we have this bill take effect. 
   If this were internationally, if we were looking at elections, we would expect that people would be able to have a playing field. We would expect there would be some protection against being pressured to support one particular position. We would expect that there would be some protection against a direction that you vote for a specific candidate. But that is not what is happening here. 
   Madam Chairman, let me tell you that what we are doing here is simply altering the playing field a bit back to fairness. We have had, for years, the ability that you could either have an election, or you could have an ability to sign a majority of people that you wanted. At some point, a few decades ago, they changed that dynamic and said we are going to let the employer veto that choice. 
   We are rebalancing this here. We are going to give the choice and the ability to balance back to the worker, so they can choose whether they want an election to indicate their ability to organize or whether they want a majority of people to sign a card. They want that fair process. We need it because their ability to do that protects them, and that is what we should be about.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this measure supports the designation of May 5 to May 9, 2008, as National Charter Schools Week and recognizes the growing charter school movement in our Nation. 
   Since their inception in 1991, charter schools have grown by leaps and bounds to address various needs of our Nation's public school students. Diverse charter schools across the country offer innovative instruction. 
   With site-based control and flexibility, charter schools can make timely decisions about how to structure the school day, which curriculum best suits the needs of their students and, additionally, charter schools may form important partnerships with parents and the surrounding community. 
   This week charter schools across the country will celebrate the ninth annual National Charter Schools Week. This year's theme, ``Growing Excellence,'' encourages charter schools to share their successes as part of the effort to reform public education in our country. 
   Today there are almost 4,300 public charter schools operating in 40 States. Their combined force serves over 1.2 million students, and 61 percent of charter schools report significant waiting lists. These waiting lists of nearly 365,000 students nationally are enough to fill over 1,100 new charter schools. Between 300 and 400 new public charter schools open each year, and nearly 150,000 new students enroll in charter schools annually. 
   The growing charter school movement is said to be providing opportunities for many historically underserved communities. Nationally, it is said that charter schools disproportionately serve minority and low-income students. It is reported that 58 percent of charter school students are minorities, and 52 percent qualify for free and reduced-price lunch, and many charter schools are able to achieve impressive academic results. 
   H. Res. 1168 expresses support for National Charter Schools Week and recognizes the charter school movement's 16-year history providing public education options based on innovation, flexibility and community partnerships. 
   The committee urges our colleagues to pass this resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the recipients of the El Dorado Promise scholarship. 
   The El Dorado Promise scholarship is a tuition scholarship which allows all students who graduate after attending all 4 years of high school in the El Dorado Public School District to attend any accredited 2- or 4-year college or university. While the enrollment in the El Dorado Public School District has decreased over 15 consecutive years, the establishment of this scholarship has seen enrollment in the district significantly increase. This scholarship program has also increased the number of students going to college after graduating high school by 20 percent. 
   Mr. Speaker, these numbers are very impressive and I commend the students who have taken advantage of this wonderful opportunity. 
   As you know, many students are struggling to pay the rising costs of tuition across the country. Additionally, students are graduating with more debt than ever before, and are working harder and harder to pay back their college loans. This growing college crisis has serious implications not just for students and families, but also for our Nation's economic future. In order to maintain our economic leadership in the world, we must make aggressive investments in our current and future workforce. 
   Scholarships and grants similar to the El Dorado Promise scholarship, such as Georgia's Hope Scholarship, and California's CAL Grant continue to help students achieve their goal of going to college and alleviate the debt burden they carry after college. 
   Once again, I congratulate the recipients of the El Dorado Promise scholarship, and I thank the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Ross) for offering this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Senate 2929, a bill to temporarily extend programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965. 
   At the beginning of February, the House took the next step in the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act in passing H.R. 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act. 
   Now we find ourselves in the near final phase of completing the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act as we work towards a compromise bill with the Senate to ensure that the doors of college are truly open to all qualified students. It's our goal to ensure that a final bill encompasses the major issues addressed in H.R. 4137, including the skyrocketing college prices and needlessly complicated student-aid application process and predatory tactics by student lenders. 
   The bill under consideration today, S. 2929, will extend the programs under the Higher Education Act until May 31, 2008, to allow sufficient time for final deliberations on the two bills reported out of the respective chambers. While the process of reauthorizing the Higher Education Act may be coming to a close, I would like to underscore that this does not mean that we will complete work on higher education altogether. 
   The committee intends to continue to address issues as needed, which include not only overseeing the proper implementation of the College Cost Reduction and Access Act and the rest of the Higher Education Act, but also, for example, ensuring availability of student loans during this challenging credit market, which the House acted on last week in passing H.R. 5715. 
   It has been nearly 10 years since the Higher Education Act was last reauthorized, and I believe that Members on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers are anxious to complete work on a compromise bill in this Congress, and we believe it can happen. 
   I look forward to completing this work with the respective Members on behalf of our Nation's hardworking families and students. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIERNEY. (WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIERNEY. Mr. Chairman, as we discussed already here, whistleblowers play a key role in holding government accountable, and this legislation takes the important and long-overdue step of providing whistleblower protections for Federal workers who specialize in national security issues. 
   This amendment was carefully crafted to clarify the process by which national security whistleblower information, that is, information which may evidence a violation of law, rule or regulation of gross mismanagement, fraud, waste, or abuse is shared with executive branch officials and Members of Congress. It specifically addresses information possessed by whistleblowers involving intelligence sources and methods. And in those instances that is information that is customarily provided to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. It also makes clear that information of concern relating to the Department of Defense Special Access Programs, or SAPS as they are currently called, should be reported to the Armed Services Committee and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. 
   Overall, this clarifying amendment strengthens the bill by ensuring that current and former employees of the intelligence community, the FBI, the military and other national security elements that possess sensitive classified national security information receive adequate protections against reprisals under the law. Further, it will better ensure the protection of classified sensitive information at issue in many of these cases. So I urge my colleagues to support what I believe is a sensible amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. TIERNEY. Mr. Speaker, we are prepared to accept this motion, and assume that means we will have unanimity on final passage. 
   This appears to track President Clinton's executive order, and it is, in fact, current law. To that extent, we have no difficulty in accepting it. 
   The motion to recommit seems to extend the coverage of the Whistleblower Protection Act to whistleblowers who report violations of President Clinton's guidelines of religious exercise and religious expression in the Federal workplace. 
   The guidelines apply to all civilian executive branch agencies, officials, and employees of the Federal workforce, they specify which religious expressions by covered employees, and under what circumstances, are permitted or may be regulated or prohibited. 
   The guidelines were issued by President Clinton to clarify how to address the sometimes difficult situations in the workplace where an agency must balance the free expression rights of Federal workers with the rights of other workers and the obligation of Federal authorities not to engage in the official promotion of religion. 
   By providing greater clarity, the guidelines have helped to avoid conflicts in the Federal workplace over the balance between religious expression and the obligations of the Federal Government to the Constitution, other employees and the general public. 
   With that, as I said, it seems to track that executive order; and if it does, we are happy to accept it.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIERNEY. (EXPANDING AMERICAN HOMEOWNERSHIP ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIERNEY. Madam Chairman, this amendment seeks to assist those individuals who are eligible borrowers that have been unfairly impacted by a statutory change to HUD's upfront mortgage insurance premium refund policy. 
   Under the HUD program, borrowers pay an upfront mortgage insurance of 1.5 percent of their FHA loan amount, and if they repay that loan, the borrowers may be due refunds of the prepaid insurance. 
   However, back in 2005 when Congress passed a Consolidated Appropriations Act, it included language directing that, for mortgages endorsed for insurance on or after the date of enactment, which was December 8 of 2004, borrowers would not be eligible for refunds on their prepaid insurance. 
   I have heard from constituents in my district, and I am sure there are constituents in other districts as well, who closed on their mortgage prior to December 8, 2004, but regrettably have been prevented from receiving their refund because HUD did not endorse their loan until after December 2004. These constituents reportedly were not adequately informed by their lender about the potential revisions to the refund policy because the lenders themselves were not informed by HUD of the change until January of 2005. 
   I have heard from one family, for instance, who is seeking to buy a home in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and found themselves harmed by this provision. Although they seemed to do everything right in their own front, they were closing on their loan in November 2004, the family was prevented from receiving a refund that totaled almost as much as $5,000 because HUD endorsed their mortgage on December 10, 2004, and their lender never informed them of that consequence because, as I mentioned, the lender didn't learn it until December 2005. It certainly seems that it was an unintended consequence of the provisions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005. 
   Also worth noting is that in response to a letter that was sent by Chairman Frank and me to the HUD Secretary, Alphonso Jackson, it was indicated in his letter that he did not support the changes to the refund policy in their Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005. 
   This amendment makes a meaningful first step toward helping certain eligible borrowers, many of whom are low-income families who have played by the rules in pursuing their dreams of homeownership. 
   Madam Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. TIERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for acknowledging me. I am happy to rise in support of this bill here today. A conversation I heard a short while ago from my colleagues that there are some people in America who are taking welfare and don't need to have public assistance to go on to college are probably not thinking of the same America that I am thinking of. 
   I am thinking of the America where college costs have gone up 41 percent after inflation, and that is just for public higher education. I am thinking of the America where parents are working two jobs on many occasions, the students are working, and they still can't afford the cost of a public higher education. 
   I am thinking of the America that has not raised the value of a Pell Grant for many, many years, and we have a chance here to do just that. I am looking at a bill and supporting a bill that in fact will raise the Pell Grants, is going to lower the interest rate on student loans, both of which are necessary for many, many families in this country. I am talking for businesses as well as families. This is a chance not just to help the individuals, but to help our economy. 
   We all are very happy to talk about the need, to really have the college-educated populace out there so we can be competitive globally. This is our opportunity to put our money where our mouth is. This is a good piece of work. I congratulate the chairman for getting this through and look forward to passing this bill in the whole House.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIERNEY. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am glad to be able to rise today in support of this increase in the minimum wage. We should all be a bit ashamed of the fact that it has been 10 years since we have had the last increase. Every year low-wage workers are left behind while CEOs get more and more money. This is not some valid exercise of a well-oiled free enterprise system. This is a disgrace, and most Americans are repulsed by that fact. 
   Some people here are trying to make the case today that there is some benefit of a full-time worker making $10,700 a year, leaving a family of three $6,000 below the poverty level. There can be no benefit, Mr. Speaker, in that condition. 
   Let us be clear. Raising the minimum wage is going to dramatically improve the lives of millions of Americans, whether Milton Friedman agrees or not. When you make $4,400 more a year than you made in the past year, full-time year-round workers with a family of three can afford a year's worth of groceries. They can afford 1 1/2 years of heat and electricity. They can afford 9 months of rent, and they can afford the full 2-year tuition for a community college degree for a parent or a child. That is how we get Americans on the prosperity ladder. That is how we give them opportunity. 
   There are those that argue that the increase in the minimum wage is going to hurt the economy. I suggest that that is not true at all and that rhetoric doesn't comport with reality. 650 economists say otherwise; reality says otherwise. The fact of the matter is that the Fiscal Policy Institute reports that States with a higher minimum wage than that have added jobs to the retail industry. 
   We have to move in the right direction with this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIERNEY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, in the last session, the Democrats did, in fact, file a bill that would have done a lot of things to make colleges more accountable and accessible. Unfortunately, that is not the bill that was moved through Congress, and very little of it got discussed or was paid attention to in the committee. 
   This year, we hope to refile bills along that way and work in a bipartisan manner so those larger issues will have that opportunity, and we intend on doing that. In the meantime, this is a down payment. It is a down payment on the need to make college more affordable and accessible by cutting the interest rates on student loans, as has been described. 
   We have more to do. We want to increase Pell Grants. Mr. Keller said that, and he is right. Last year, of course, the majority of then Republicans had a wonderful opportunity to do that. Instead, they decided to cut a net of $12 billion, basically to help the powerful and the privileged. They are busy trying to make sure that people have an incentive to get into a loan market for which no incentive is needed. 
   In fact, there will be very little impact on lenders with the way they are paying for this particular bill. They will digest that very readily and still make a handsome profit. As Mr. Kind from Wisconsin said, there is every opportunity for us to do more direct loans and to recapture more money, to give further Pell Grants and campus-based aid like student work-study. 
   We need to get States to reinvest more in education. They are falling off the cliff since 2001 in terms of their investment. We have a good bill that we will file and hopefully have the help of the Republicans. We will address that situation to get them back into the game. 
   We need to allow more tax deductibility for tuition so that families have a break. And moving forward, if we are serious about how much education is required, given the nature of the workplace, given nature of the competitiveness of the international arena, we need more college students. 
   There was a day when 8 years of school worked well for the agricultural era. Then it went to the industrial age where 12 years of school was necessary. We are beyond that now. For technology and other reasons, we need people to have more than 12 years; that means college, whether 2 years or 4 years. That means making sure that kids know they can get into college and afford to pay for it, with Pell Grants, with work-study, they still need loans. 
   I don't know where the gentlewoman from North Carolina, what her college was, but if she knew the rest of the country, they need to borrow, they need a break in their loans. We are happy to provide that here today.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIERNEY. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIERNEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, this amendment follows a series of hearings with eminent physicists and security experts all testifying, as well as reports from the General Accountability Office, the Congressional Research Service, and others on the status of our weapons programs and their costs, together with an evaluation of the threats realistically facing the United States. 
   The amendment seeks to ensure that we have appropriate resources directed to address our most urgent risks, our most pressing national security priorities. We seek to reallocate $996 million, just under $1 billion, to nonproliferation programs and initiatives aimed at countering weapons of mass destruction and terrorism, to support our wounded warriors and their families, included critical suicide prevention programs, and to cover the National Guard and Reserve shortfalls, especially in connection with homeland security activities. 
   Mr. Chairman, as you know, governing means choosing. Our amendment allows members to consider the importance of increasing funds for our most serious threats, those being nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and materials and national security programs. Slightly reducing the missile defense program's $10.1 billion budget to meet these needs is, we believe, the right choice and the right balance. 
   The pressing national security threat of our time is asymmetric action, some terror-based group attempting to introduce to United States soil some aspect of weapons of mass destruction. Our national intelligence experts and I think other experts all agree on that. And it is common sense to know that such threats won't come from al Qaeda or other groups through sophisticated intercontinental ballistic missiles. In fact, the CIA said in 2000, and I quote, ``The United States territory is probably more likely to be attacked with weapons of mass destruction from nonmissile delivery means, most likely from nonstate entities, than by missiles. September 11 only underscores the susceptibility to asymmetric attack. 
   Mr. Chairman, we just don't seem to be getting that message. In 2005, the–9/11 Commission gave the United States Government a ``D'' with respect to our efforts to secure weapons of mass destruction, calling this, and again I quote, ``The greatest threat to American security,'' and that it should be, and I quote, ``the top national security priority of the President and the Congress.'' 
   Our amendment leaves intact funding for defenses for our troops that they might rely upon for protection against short-range and intermediate missiles. The reductions are solely made from high-risk long-term research projects and from systems from which there currently is not a pressing threat. 
   Experts note that with respect to the long-range programs, realistic operational tests have yet to be successfully conducted so as to provide any appreciable belief that they would operate efficiently. We have plenty of funding left then for research and development, but we decrease funds that would be putting procurement and deployment ahead of capability. We have spent $150 billion, Mr. Chairman, on this program already, an amount that exceeds more than our country spent on the Manhattan Project and the Apollo Program. 
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that assuming that the Missile Defense Agency continues its present course, the taxpayers will spend an additional $213 billion to $277 billion between now and 2025. Mr. Chairman, we simply seek to allocate our resources so as to provide the best defense that we need currently facing the threats that we realistically expect might be directed at this country. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   The comments that the gentleman makes about Israel being susceptible to attacks and missiles is also very interesting, but he is talking about short- and medium-ranged missiles. My amendment doesn't address short- and medium-ranged missiles; it addresses intercontinental ballistic missiles, long-range missiles which have never been operationally or realistically tested. All I am saying is, let's put our research and development monies into the future where that may take us on those long-range programs, and leave the money that we have for the short- and medium-ranged ones for those threats that might realistically exist.

With respect to the testing records that the gentleman from Alabama just read, I hope that they've read the amendment. But I certainly appreciate the fact that they understand what it is we're talking about here. 
   But conflating the tests for short, medium and long-range is not going to be effective in addressing the amendment that is before the House. The amendment before the House is dealing strictly with the long-range for that, and those testing results are not reflected accurately by the statement that was just made. 
   So we're not talking about Aegis, we are not talking about THAAD, we're not talking about Patriot attack systems. We're talking about intercontinental ballistic missiles. Those tests have not been done operationally, they have not been done realistically, and they have not been done successfully to show that there's any efficient way that those are going to be successful. All of the testimony by all the physicists and all of the experts who came there indicate that clearly.

   Mr. TIERNEY. I yield myself the balance of the time. 
   Mr. Chairman, again, it's all very interesting what we hear for comments from our colleagues. But the interesting part of this is it does matter whether it's short and medium-range or whether it's long-range. The short and medium-range, some of the testing has, in fact, been effective and does lead us to believe and experts to believe that there might be an effective defense against those. 
   But the experts look at the long-range system and they say, you know, we are procuring and we are deploying way ahead of our capability. These do not work. There has been no realistic operational testing to indicate that they would. There have been sporadic tests that have been successful on some aspects of it. There have been a number of tests that have been abject failures on a large part of it. 
   The fact of the matter is, if we're going to have defense, it should be smart defense. We have spent $150 billion so far for nothing, nothing in terms of that long-range missile system and its effectiveness. 
   You want to spend another $217 billion to $250 billion in the next several years when we have other pressing needs, the ones that the Congressional Budget Office, the General Accountability Office, the 9/11 Commission, our own common sense tell us are the more likely threats to this country, some asymmetric threat, some weapon of mass destruction by a terrorist group, or some short-range or medium-range missile coming in our direction. That's what we should be defending against. 
   We can still test, we can still have research and development and testing for the long-range, but that would mean cutting it back substantially so we're not deploying and not procuring ahead of the game, so that we don't find ourselves owning these things, having them deployed and fielded and have to retract all of it and start over again, having a false sense of security, and having things on the ground that only need to be redone, at huge, huge cost. None of that adds to our security. It ignores the real security needs of this country that should be put first and foremost. 
   This is the sensible thing to do. I urge the House Members to support this amendment and let us move forward in a more secure way in this country. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIERNEY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, the other body has not acted, in my opinion, this humble Member's opinion, in a way that warrants great respect of the American people. It has done not just violence to the fourth amendment and violence to our civil liberties; it has eviscerated them with the bill it has sent over here for action. 
   The American people have a right to expect more from us. This is the Protect America Act of 2007. The American people expect to be protected and to be secure, not just against terrorists and other foreign threats, but also to be secure in the rights established in the Constitution of the United States, to know that we are standing up for the Constitution and fulfilling our pledge and our oath of office. 
   This bill does not do this. It purports to provide security, but it certainly doesn't provide any protections for our constitutional rights and civil liberties. We should have done better, and we could do better. 
   This administration took the Secretary of State and sent him to the U.N. on a mission which everyone ended up being ashamed of. Now they have sent the DNI, I fear, over here to make an agreement and find a bill that he can live with, under the premise that when he said he would, the President would sign it. Well, the conversations he had, he indicated that our bill strengthened the security of this country. But after a conversation with the White House, that was withdrawn, and now we end up with a bill that does not protect our civil liberties. 
   The fact of the matter is, Mr. Speaker, we can do better and we should do better. This bill starts off with the words ``notwithstanding any other law.'' That assumes that notwithstanding the Constitution, notwithstanding the fourth amendment, notwithstanding our civil liberties they are giving the authority to a President, a Director of National Intelligence, and an Attorney General, any Attorney General, to make decisions that should be made by a court, that should at least be reviewed by a court. 
   We have provided in a Democratic alternative a way to secure that protection and the security of this country, while still protecting our rights. The White House saw an opportunity to roll over that into a bill that is going to be I think regretted by everyone in this Chamber if they pass it, and it should be regretted in the Senate for what they did.     
   We are not doing this country any favors. If we think we are going to correct this in 120 days, when you give up your securities, when you give up your rights under the Constitution, it is not likely you are going to regain them. 
   As somebody said earlier tonight, your civil liberties don't go in a loud noise and a clap of thunder and the curtain coming down; they go quietly with whispers and into the darkness. That is what is happening with this bill, Mr. Speaker. We will all regret it. 
   We should pass a bill that secures this country, certainly and gives us all of the intelligence that needs to be intercepted, but we should do it in a way that doesn't sacrifice our civil liberties and the fourth amendment and our Constitution.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIERNEY. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, today I rise to highlight one aspect of the Energy bill that is before the House today, that's the provision essentially incorporating the Green Jobs Act of 2007, which had previously been passed by the House Committee on Education and Labor. 
   Let me begin by acknowledging and thanking Speaker Pelosi for making this issue, ``the green workforce development,'' a priority in her environmental agenda. 
   My cosponsor, HILDA SOLIS of California, is appreciated for her work in ensuring that a broad cross section of workers get in at the bottom floor of this growing industry. 
   This innovative proposal, ``green jobs,'' will make $120 million a year available across the country to begin training workers for jobs in the clean energy sector. 35,000 people per year can benefit from vocational education that will provide for them secure employment in this country. 
   Until now, the United States has not really had a coherent strategy to address the growing labor shortage and demands of these green and clean energy sectors. This bill, this particular provision, will help a broad cross section of workers get into these growing industries. 
   Green-collar jobs can provide living wages and upward mobility. For some, they will create a way out of poverty, even as they help improve our environment and buttress our national security by lessening reliance on foreign oil. 
   We've passed legislation to increase science, technology, engineering and math teachers, to educate more engineers and scientists. Now we have the chance to make sure that those who do not have degrees or do not choose to go to college can also support a family and contribute to their communities. Urban youth, retired veterans, struggling farmers, and displaced workers from our manufacturing sectors can all get training through this proposal. 
   They will help meet a growing labor need as America seeks thousands of green-collar workers to install millions of solar panels, to weatherize buildings and homes, to build and maintain wind farms, and more. These jobs are energy saving, air quality improving, and carbon cutting, and they're all local. They mostly cannot be outsourced to other countries. Solar panels and wind farms need to be built here. Buildings to be retrofitted to save energy have their foundations in U.S. soil. 
   Today, we can join Speaker Pelosi and the many numerous advocacy organizations that have worked hard to develop and expand the concept of green jobs, making sure that the benefits of a cleaner and greener economy are shared broadly at all income levels. 
   Special acknowledgement goes to the Ella Baker Center's Van Jones, whose passionate expressions have been liberally borrowed here and whose personal energy has greatly advanced this idea. 
   The return in energy savings helped by green jobs can be enormous. The positive impact on lives from rewarding employment can be priceless. Mr. Chairman, this provision of the clean energy bill can help provide America with the working muscle, practical experience and training, and industry-specific intelligence to change our Nation's future. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the entire bill, being mindful that the Green Jobs Act of 2007 contributes specifically to this appeal.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIERNEY. Mr. Speaker, over history, and particularly since 1970, we have been able to find balance of getting the necessary intelligence collection and also having the protection of our liberties and our constitutional rights; through wars, in fact through the Cold War, which are much more severe existential threats than we see today, to a Cold War where we had nuclear powers that we thought were ready to attack us. We didn't know when and we didn't know to what degree. We never found it necessary to totally abdicate our constitutional rights and privileges. It is unnecessary for us to do that. It is shameful that some think that now is an opportunity for us to do that. 
   The legislation before us today allows us to, in timely ways, collect all of the intelligence we need. It allows us to do it before a court order in cases of emergency. It allows us to do it without delay. It allows us to have provisions for oversight. It allows us to do everything to protect this country and it protects our civil liberties. 
   We have a situation with phone companies now wanting immunity. They've always had immunity. The question is did they go for it. Did they have a court order or did they have the proper certification? Why won't the White House let all Members of Congress see that? It would answer the questions if they saw the documents. 
   All Members of Congress should see the Presidential order and discuss whether the breadth and scope was so breathtaking that they would rush to make sure that courts intervene to make sure we had the constitutional protections there and make sure that we saw the memos that were there for legal justification and whether or not they weren't farcical in some respects and make sure that we saw what went on between the companies and the administration. 
   If the companies think that they have reason to believe that, despite the fact that they didn't take advantage of their immunity provisions, they still have a claim of defense, we've provided a way for them to go to court so they can make that case. Going forward, they have immunity and a way to protect themselves in the past. 
   Let's get over the nonsense and pass this law.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from California for yielding me this time. 
   We are told over and over again in committee hearings from experts and scholars of all natures that we could close 50 percent of the achievement gap  that we see in our country if we have effective preschool, prekindergarten programs. Head Start is just that kind of a program. 
   We see over and over again the evidence showing us it has a positive economic and social impact across this Nation, particularly in its comprehensive nature, the fact that it deals with education, deals with health issues and social implications. 
   The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, my State, 80 percent of 3-year-olds are still not enrolled in prekindergarten or Head Start programs. We need to be expanding this program for all of the good things it does because we need to take advantage of that opportunity to close that gap. 
   One of the ways that we are going to do that is to attract quality teachers. I am glad to see in this bill that Mr. Sestak has filed an amendment to provide up to $10,000 in loan forgiveness for college graduates who commit to teach in the Head Start field. We have raised the standard of the teachers that we want, requiring them to meet a certain grade. That means we are going to have to pay people in order to go into this profession because it is still going to cost them considerably to get that degree. If we are going to do that, we have to step forward. I think Mr. Sestak's idea, which we have been talking about in the higher education reauthorization bill for some time, is one way of doing that. Loan forgiveness for early education teachers over a period of years will allow us to have that program meet the pinnacle that we need it to reach. 
   For this and many other reasons, I think this bill is a good bill and deserves our attention and our support. I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIERNEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member McKeon. This was a cooperative effort, a bipartisan effort for sure focusing on access and affordability. 
   There's a partnership in education, higher education in particular, between parents and children, entire families, levels of government at both the State and Federal level, and the institutions. The families for too long have seen their share of that partnership go up and up in tuition and fees. 
   This Congress dealt with the reconciliation bill last year, putting $20 billion additionally in for Pell Grants, reducing the cost of loans. We needed to ask these institutions to step up to the plate, and we've done that in this bill. They have incentives to keep their tuition low and the incentives go to more aid to the students. They're going to be held accountable by being required to report any reasons for tuition increases. 
   States are going to have to maintain their investment in higher education so they can't supplant their responsibilities with either the money from the Federal Government or by charging students more in tuition and fees. If they do, they won't get access to a program. So they have that incentive to move forward. 
   We restore the integrity and accountability to the student loan programs, we've provided loan forgiveness for people, and all of this focuses, Mr. Speaker, on families and makes that partnership work. 
   I support the bill and ask my colleagues to do the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIERNEY. (NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIERNEY. Madam Chair, the amendment I and my colleague, Rush Holt, are offering this evening is really quite simple. It reduces the $8.1 billion specified by the Missile Defense Agency by approximately $1 billion and takes a modest but necessary step in refocusing on missile defense policy. 
   I think we should make no mistake about it, we have spent $107 billion since the days of the Reagan administration on missile defense. We have had years of unanticipated cost growth, unacceptable schedule delays, and unaccountable management by the Pentagon. 
   It is time for a change in that policy. It is time for a change in how we address ballistic missile defense. We have plenty of other priority national security matters and more pressing homeland security needs to address. 
   How much longer can Congress continue to acquiesce and authorize billions of dollars in funds for this deeply flawed system? 
   The Pentagon continues to build before testing; it is a recipe for waste. We can tell my colleagues that if the status quo continues, the Congressional Budget Office projects the total cost for missile defense will peak in the year 2016 at about $15 billion per year, excluding cost risk. 
   If you add in cost risk, the CBO knows that the Pentagon's projected investment needs for missile defense might go to $18 billion. We are going to hear from others here that North Korea, Iran, and China have the potential for proliferation of missile technology, and all of that is not sufficient reason for opposing this amendment. The fact of the matter is that argument would rest on the false assumption that the current system could actually defend this country against those risks. It can't because it doesn't work. It continues to not be able to work because it lacks operational testing that is realistic. That hasn't occurred, and it does not look like it is likely to occur any time soon. 
   We know and understand the threats confronting this country, and a $1 billion cut in the Missile Defense Agency, the way it is done here, will certainly not compromise our national security. And, in fact, by forcing the Pentagon to test before it builds, it will actually make sure that we don't have false securities. 
   This Congress should not continue to acquiesce in the authorization on this deeply flawed system. We have to come to terms with certain stubborn realities and have the courage to change course. 
   We are not alone in thinking this way. There were seven reports issued last year from nonpartisan groups, the Government Accountability Office, the Department of Defense Inspector General, the Congressional Research Service, the Congressional Budget Office, the Pentagon's Director of Operational, Test and Evaluation, all arrived at the same conclusion: ``Change in this program is imperative.'' 
   Our amendment will focus on high-risk, longer-term research programs and target those initiatives that simply do not warrant immediate congressional support. It reflects the views of the conferees to last year's defense authorization bill who wrote that they ``believe that the emphasis of our missile defense efforts should be on the current generation of missile defense capabilities.'' 
   I would now like yield to my colleague, Mr. Holt.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIERNEY. (EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING WITHHOLDING OF INFORMATION RELATING TO CORRUPTION IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIERNEY. Mr. Speaker, the fundamental issue before us on this resolution is whether or not this institution, the Congress, is going to absolutely carry out its oversight responsibilities and demand that the executive branch provide to us materials we need to make reasonable determinations as to whether or not there is an extent of corruption in Iraq with respect to what is going on there, but also whether or  not our State Department and other agencies are doing all they should do to build up the capacity of the Iraqi Government to be able to combat corruption. 
   In December 2006, and again in July of 2007, the United States Embassy in Iraq produced two reports that weighed on those issues, corruption in the Iraqi Government, and would have shown us some capacity of whether or not the United States was doing enough about it. They were marked ``sensitive but unclassified.'' And they were widely distributed within the United States Government and they were even posted on the Internet. 
   In September, the Oversight Committee requested copies of those two documents. But rather than provide them in their unclassified form, the State Department decided to retroactively classify them, in essence, keeping them from public view or from public debate. 
   The State Department classified these documents only after the committee requested that they be produced. And they gave this task to an official who told the committee he had never in his life been requested to review for classification before. 
   Incredibly, the State Department then retroactively also classified key portions of a Government Accountability Office report that was issued to the Oversight Committee at a public hearing on October 4. Now, David Walker, the Comptroller General, testified in open session that this Government Accountability Office report addressed corruption in Iraq and the failure of the United States agencies to properly support capacity-building efforts in Iraqi ministries. This is not about just deciding how much corruption there was in playing that. It's about deciding whether or not there had been sufficient capacity-building efforts in Iraq ministries to prevent corruption. 
   Mr. Walker issued the report, copies were handed out to the press, and it was posted on the Internet. But after the hearing, the State Department classified those portions of the report that addressed Iraq's commitment or a lack of commitment to fighting corruption. And yesterday, the State Department claimed in a letter to Congress that they classified the Government Accountability Office report prior to official publication, but, in fact, when we checked with the Government Accountability Office, they said that was not true. The State Department reviewed this report before it was released. They confirmed that it contained no classified information. It was not until after the report was released at the public hearing that the State Department retroactively classified it. 
   Secretary Rice may not want the public to know what the Government Accountability Office found when it investigated whether the Maliki government is committed to fighting corruption, or they may not want the public to know whether or not the government is actually working hard enough to build the necessary capacity to stop and check corruption in Iraq. But it's a gross abuse of the administration's powers to retroactively classify these findings and the findings of the State Department's own embassy officials and to do it retroactively. 
   Classification cannot be allowed to happen primarily because people think they're going to be embarrassed, whatever government may be embarrassed. Congress has to exercise its prerogative here and do the proper oversight for the protection of our troops and of the public's interests. 
   Testimony was that some $18 billion in corruption was occurring in Iraq, and that was without going into the oil ministry, where significant further corruption was believed to happen. Testimony was that monies from that corruption were going to fund militias, who in turn were placing their focus on targeting United States troops. 
   It is imperative that this Congress investigate whether or not, through review of these documents and other sources, we are making enough efforts to build the capacity in Iraq to make sure that that corruption stops and that our troops, our men and women in service, are not being targeted through corruption. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is an important matter. This is the prerogative of this House. This should not be about partisan politics or protecting the home team. This should be about making sure that we protect our troops and the public interest.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIERNEY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, for some time now, for months, the administration has been contending that it needed relief from a warrant obligation to intercept communications between a foreign agent and a foreign agent. But we all know that doesn't apply. You don't need a warrant in those situations. So it has long been our contention that that wasn't needed and we did not need to approve the administration's sweeping request for the authority to tap every American citizen based on that premise. We offered legislation to just clarify that fact, and the Republicans voted against it, and the administration turned it down. 
   Now, last week, the DNI came forward and informed us of a critical collection gap in electronic surveillance. So we went to work again and met with the DNI to try to resolve and identify just what it was and negotiate a resolution. We did that despite the fact the administration has been withholding documentation that would help us do that. 
   But now the President has started to politicize it. He took to the airwaves and began pressing for essentially warrantless surveillance and searches on all Americans' phone calls, e-mails, homes, offices and personal records for at least 3 months and probably a lot longer than that by virtue of heading all the way through the appeals process. 
   He also sought authority to search concerning a person abroad. Didn't even have to target a person abroad, a foreign person. In other words, the search did not have to be directed in that direction, just concerning a person abroad. 
   It would also authorize any search inside the United States if the government can claim it concerns an al Qaeda or affiliate. 
   And it also sought authority for the Attorney General to authorize surveillance into and out of the United States with a court review only to determine that the procedures of the Attorney General clearly were erroneous; and, even if they found that, it was only advisory, apparently, because there was no remedy. No review or audit by a Department of Justice Inspector General to see how this was implemented. No sunset provision forcing review. Essentially an indefinite suspension of our constitutional rights and our civil liberties. Based on the word of this Attorney General? This one? And this President? 
   Intercepts United States citizens without finding a foreign agent is involved; rather, only that the conversations were believed. By this Attorney General? To concern people that were involved with al Qaeda? For any foreign intelligence, not just those related to terror or al Qaeda-related. No clerk, no judge, nobody in the balance to review this. No sunset. 
   The rule of law is still critical in this country. It is exactly when the government thinks that it can be the sole fair arbiter that we most need a judicial system to stand in and strike the balance. Even after our leadership agreed to do what the DNI mostly wanted, this administration still turned it down, still was on TV, still politicizing this effort. 
   Let's tell the President that we don't need a politician right now in the White House, we need a leader, somebody to stand up and draw this country together, somebody to make sure that we get the intelligence we need, that knows how to say ``yes'' when the DNI's requests are done. 
   The President went on TV saying that when the DNI told him that the deal was acceptable, that the war would work, he would accept it. Well, when the DNI talked to Democrats and leadership and said he was fine with what they suggested, a change would work, he went back to the White House and instead we got this sweeping law. 
   Let's make our Constitution work. We can have security and our civil liberties.

   Mr. TIERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, some of us on this side of the aisle are not at all upset that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have chosen to debate this particular issue. We hope it goes on forever and that the American public is tuned in to watch just what motivates that side of the aisle. 
   The fact of the matter is that the debate that they are having is between them and the White House. When people ask that the Speaker come down to present a case as to why there should be protection of the Speaker of the House, they miss the point that the people motivating that are the White House, who decided after 9/11 that the Speaker of the House, then a Republican, Mr. Hastert, should, in fact, have the kind of the security that Americans would expect for the person who is two heartbeats away from the Presidency of the United States and that the President in this instance is consistent in that, in believing that no matter what party is holding the Speaker of the House position ought to also have that protection. 
   I don't think that they can propose a safer way to get the Speaker from Washington to California and back so that she can conduct the considerable responsibilities of her position and get back to do those in a timely fashion other than to fly back and forth. 
   But because some of my friends on the other side of the aisle apparently still don't understand it and don't understand whom they are debating with, and I understand that sometimes it is difficult to understand what is coming out of the White House, but just one more time so that even they can get it, I would like to yield to my colleague from Tennessee and ask him to read once again the other side of the debate as presented by the President of the United States in his own words.

   Mr. TIERNEY. I thank the chairman. 
   This is all about access and affordability. It is foremost in people's minds, whether you speak to people in the business community, you talk to academics or elected representatives or families and students, they are talking about opportunity for individuals, talking about the national economic security of this country and our need for innovators, for leaders, for people in the science, technology, engineering and math fields, and in business we are talking about global competitiveness, the need to have people with more than just a high school degree in order to lead our businesses and fill our jobs. 
   This bill addresses these concerns, and it builds on last summer's college cost reduction bill which put $20 billion in over the next 5 years, additional Pell Grants to get more students into college, and reduction of loan interest  rates so students will be able to afford those loans they were forced to take. 
   This present bill speaks to cost containment. It has a provision in there for public higher education, for maintenance of efforts. This is a partnership between the Federal Government, between families and the students that are involved, and States. This maintenance of effort will no longer allow States to supplant their obligation by taking Federal aid or raising tuition and fees. They will have to step up to the plate on a rather modest level required in order to get the benefit of getting aid that other people would get. 
   This bill also has a provision for all universities and colleges that if they keep their tuition and fee increases below the higher education price index, then they will be rewarded for additional grant money on their campuses to distribute among Pell student recipients; and if they make the promise over 5 years and keep it, they will get additional bonuses as well. 
   We have a ``service pays'' provision in there for people that are going into public service jobs, from prosecutors to teachers going into difficult areas, to health care and public health people, loan forgiveness of up to $10,000 to smooth their way on that basis, alternative paths to teaching. For those people that are in mid-career and decide they want to teach, we have offered partnerships to make that happen to enhance our Teacher Corps. We have endowment information so we can find whether or not the public policy of allowing people to not pay taxes if they donate to schools actually has a result of going into education. 
   All of these things are important. This is a good bill. We respect the fact that it came out of committee in unanimous form, and we look forward to support on the floor.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIERNEY. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIERNEY. Madam Speaker, in just a few weeks, America will begin its fifth year in the Iraq conflict. In that time, 3,117 members of the United States military have died, and over 23,000 American soldiers have been injured. $532 billion has been appropriated by Congress or requested by the administration. 
   You only need to talk or read letters from many of the returning military personnel or their families to understand that the mission in Iraq is unclear and the goals remain undefined. Our men and women are not certain if they are fighting Sunnis or Shiites, and often it depends on where they are in order to determine the answer to that dilemma. In essence, our military personnel are in the midst of a civil war, the flames of which were fanned by centuries-old animosities. 
   This week Congress has been addressing a resolution that reiterates its support for the troops and states clearly its opposition to escalation. 
   The first point could easily go unspoken. After all, we are exercising the very freedom of speech and debate that our Constitution requires, the public demands, and our men and women in uniform serve to protect. 
   The second point of the resolution speaks to the clear determination, as evidenced on November 7, 2006, that America does not support the President's planned escalation of this conflict. 
   Three previous troop buildups have already proven unsuccessful. In the first, from November 2004 to January 2005, troop levels in Iraq increased by about 18,000 troops. They did that in advance of the Iraqi elections held on January of 2005, and the number of daily attacks by insurgents rose to 61 from 52 the previous month, an increase of 17 percent.  
   On the second troop buildup, from June 2005 to October 2005, troop levels increased by approximately 21,500, and the number of daily attacks by insurgents in October of 2005 rose to 90, from 70 just 2 months earlier, an increase of 29 percent. 
   And the third troop buildup occurred from May 2006 to November 1 of 2006 when U.S. troop levels in Iraq increased by approximately 17,500 troops, and the number of daily attacks by insurgents in October of 2006 rose to 180, from 100 just 4 months earlier, an increase this time of 80 percent. 
   Now the President says he want to change course, but once again he proposes to only stay the course as he seeks to send in more personnel, and we still wait for the Iraqi forces to stand up. 
   Madam Speaker, 132 of my colleagues and I exercised the correct judgment in October of 2002 when we voted against the war in Iraq. We recognized then that this administration's claims that Saddam Hussein posed an imminent and direct threat to the United States were hyped up and many rightly foresaw that an American occupation of Iraq would, as one colleague recently said, be of undetermined length, of undetermined cost and undetermined consequences. 
   Tragically, this administration was not deterred. It has been flat wrong on pretty much all of its pre-war and subsequent judgments with respect to Iraq, with its questionable use of intelligence, its failure to plan, and its failure for far too long to protect our troops once they were there. 
   We knew then what has become painfully obvious since, that rather than open a new front and destabilize a new area in Iraq, we should have secured Afghanistan and addressed terrorism at its source as it was embodied by Osama bin Laden and others. The proposed escalation is not the answer. 
   Why, after such a debacle and such a dismal record, would this administration even think to follow the advice of the same people that got us into this situation in the first place? 
   The proposed surge or escalation is as baseless as was going into Iraq in the first place. 
   The latest National Intelligence Estimate, even that part that is unclassified, which I would imagine or speculate certainly puts the administration's best foot forward, states that even if violence is diminished, Iraq's absence of unifying leaders makes a political reconciliation doubtful. 
   Not enough capable Iraqi troops are showing up to fight. Not enough armed vehicles are available to protect the new American deployments. The State Department cannot recruit enough civil officials to manage the latest push to turn up the electricity in Iraq or to help with reconstruction. 
   And so Congress must, and I think they are going to this week, pass a resolution that reiterates our support to our troops and opposes the escalation. That action, I sincerely hope, will be followed by action which will prohibit the use of Federal funds to increase the number of troops above the number existing in Iraq on January 9, 2007. 
   The large majority of Americans are waiting for action by this Congress to insist that we begin redeploying our troops from Iraq and complete that redeployment as quickly as possible in a measure done in months, not years. 
   In essence, this week's action should be the beginning of a relatively short process, culminating in the redeployment of American troops from Iraq, and energizing diplomatic efforts and international efforts to stabilize that nation and ensure its security, while it provides for a platform to redirect the necessary attention to the unfinished business of Afghanistan and focus, Madam Speaker, our efforts on terrorism, both short term and long term. 
   I urge my colleagues, Madam Speaker, to support this resolution and take what I expect will be the first step in charting a new course in Iraq.

   Mr. TIERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, today I rise to ask support fo r a rather straightforward budget-neutral amendment that will meaningfully contribute to our campaign against international terrorism and serve the long-term national securities interests of the United States. 
   My amendment would provide an additional $75 million for basic education programs directly reaching Pakistani children through the U.S. Agency for International Development or provided through local and international nongovernmental organizations offering reliable and effective basic education ser vices. In doing so, the amendment serves long-term United States national security interests by helping to give Pakistani children an educational alternative to extremist, jihadi-teaching madrassas. 
   I am pleased that the Chair of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee has agreed to accept this amendment. In their bill and committee report, the gentlewoman from New York and the rest of the members of the committee have recognized the importance of basic education assistance to our country's long-term nation al security interests. This amendment would complement and build off of those important efforts, and I thank the gentlewoman from New York for her willingness to work with me and accept my amendment. 
   The 9/11 Commission described a ``generational struggle'' against international terrorism, stressing the importance that any offensive efforts ``be accompanied by a preventative strategy.'' They also noted, ``It is hard to overstate the importance of Pakistan in the struggle against Islamic terrorism'' and urged the United States Government to support in Pakistan ``a comprehensive effort that extends from military aid to support for better education.'' Unfortunately, we have not yet gone far enough in that regard. 
   In December of 2005, the 9/11 Commission's Public Discourse Project gave the United States Government a D grade for not doing enough to support secular education. It noted, ``United States assistance to Pakistan has not moved sufficiently beyond security assistance to include significant funding for education efforts.'' And just a few months ago, our own State Department concluded, ``Pakistan remains a major source of Islamic extremism.'' 
   This is precisely the time that we should be spending substantially more on education, where we should be broadening and deepening our relationship with the Pakistani people with aid that reaches directly into the Pakistani homes. 
   This amendment is an important first step in this endeavor by providing an extra $785 million infusion for basic education dir ectly to Pakistani children, an extra $75 million that would come on top of Pakistani education funding already in the bill and what we have provided for before. 
   This amendment provides this additional $75 million for basic education by reprogramming existing funds within the Economic Support fund account; $50 million of the total $75 million will be drawn from that part of the Economic Support fund that provides direct budgetary support for the Pakistani Government. 
   Over the last several years, the Pakistani Government has been receiving hundreds of millions of dollars per year in a cash transfer. This amendment would ensure that $50 million of those funds be reprogrammed to ensure they reach Pakistani children and not simply be handed over to the Pakistani Government without direction. The other $25 million of the $75 million total would come from the nonbudgetary support component of the Economic Support fund. 
   All of us hope to support the Pakistani people in their efforts to achieve a stable, prosperous and free nation. But our national security interests here are much more acute. Will we be safe over the next 5, 10 or 20 years as thousands of more young people learn jihad at extremist madrassas instead of learning real-world skills to become productive citizens in their communities and in our shared world? 
   When asked about this amendment, former 9/11 Commission Vice Chairman  Lee Hamilton responded, ``Increased U.S. funding for basic education provided by the Tierney Pakistan Educatio n Assistance Amendment will send a powerful message that we are committed to a better future for young Pakistanis and to supporting alternatives to radical Islamic education. Sending this kind of a message is hugely important to the future of America's relationship with the people of Pakistan and our efforts to combat radical Islam.'' 
   It is past time to heed the 9/11 Commission's warning by fighting terrorism at its source, by stopping the process of extremism before it can begin, by helping the childre n of Pakistan to have an alternative to extreme madrassas. That should be at the core of our long-term national security strategy, that is what this amendment is all about. 
   Again I thank the gentlewoman from New York for accepting this amendment. I look forward to working with her to see that this additional funding for basic education programs directly reaching Pakistani children is retained in conference.

   Mr. TIERNEY. Mr. Chairman, if the chairwoman will yield, I want to again say I was in Pakistan at the same time that you were, approximately, and you witnessed, as did we, exac tly what you are talking about. This is a great effort, to be able to go in the right direction, to put in public education as an alternative to the madrassas. 
   I thank you for the fine work you have done, and your committee as well. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Tierney). 
   Th e amendment was agreed to.

   Mr. TIERNEY. Mr. Chairman, at this time I want to talk about an amendment that I would have offered but won't do so because I understand it's subject to a point of order. 
   Pakistan is scheduled to have crucial parliamentary elections in the fall of 2007 and the early winter of 2008. My amendment would withhold a portion of military aid to Pakistan unless those elections occurred and were free, fair and democratic. 
   Specifically, the amendment would have withheld $175 million out of a total of $250 million that's allocated under this bill for foreign military financing in Pakistan. These funds would be released when the Secretary of State determined, giving due consideration to the credible, independent judgment of reliable agencies that elections in Pakistan were free, fair and democratic. The amendment also asks that all steps of the election process, from voter registration on through vote tabulation, be reviewed in reaching any such judgment. 
   This amendment would send a powerful message to the people of Pakistan about the importance the United States places on the democratic process. Instead of just talking about the importance of democracy and saying that all peoples of the world should have these rights, the amendment quite literally would give Congress a chance to act consistently with its word. 
   Since the coup in which he rose to power 8 years ago, President Musharraf has taken some positive steps, but his record is, at best, mixed, especially recently. Today, President Musharraf is fighting the most serious challenge to his 8-year dictatorship. The United States is supporting him fully, and I guess that means that the message from the United States to the Pakistani public would seem clear: The Bush administration sees the war on terrorism as topping everything, even support for democracy. 
   On March 9, President Musharraf suspended Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who was apparently seen as threatening to President Musharraf's plans to consolidate his power. That triggered street protests demanding Musharraf's resignation, followed by a government-led crackdown on lawyers, the opposition political parties, and the media. Thousands of lawyers nationwide have led marches joined by women's groups, journalists and opposition politicians. 
   The roots of this crisis go back to a blind bargain that Washington made after 9/11 with a general and the army that had, up until then, been the main patrons of the Taliban. The administration ignored Musharraf's despotism in return for his promises to crack down on al Qaeda and the Taliban. Now, despite $10 billion in U.S. aid to Pakistan since 2001, that deal is shattered. 
   In December of 2005, the 9/11 Commission's Public Discourse Project issued a report card noting that Musharraf has made efforts to take on the threat of extremism, but has not shut down extremist-linked madrassas or terrorist camps. 
   Taliban forces still pass freely across the Pakistan-Afghani border and operate in Pakistani tribal areas. These border groups gained political legitimacy last year when President Musharraf signed a series of dubious peace deals with the Pakistan Taliban. 
   Extremist madrassas remain, and the extremism only becomes more pervasive and dangerous. Madrassa students are burning books, CDs and DVDs. Women in Islamabad have had acid doused in their faces for their failure to wear burkas, and have been harassed for driving cars. 
   The military has refused to put a brake on their extremism. As terrorism author Ahmed Rashid said, Musharraf promised the international community that he would purge pro-Taliban elements from his security service and convinced the Bush administration that his philosophy of ``enlightened moderation'' was the only way to fend off Islamic extremism, but Pakistan today is still the center of global Islamic terrorism. Our own State Department concluded the same thing several weeks ago. 
   Mr. Rashid is correct in saying that instead of confronting this threat, the army has focused on keeping Musharraf in power. In trying to spook the West into continuing to support him, he exaggerates grossly the strength of the Islamic parties and warns that they might take over his nuclear-armed country.     
   Mr. Chairman, the fact is the United States would be far safer if we supported a truly representative Pakistan government that could marginalize the Jihadists rather than placing all of its eggs in a Musharraf basket. A better outcome for all would be that everybody participate in free and fair elections, and we should act in favor of democracy with those policies.
