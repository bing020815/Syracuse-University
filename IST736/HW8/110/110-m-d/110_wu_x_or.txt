<DOCNO>Mr. WU. (HOUSING PACKAGE IMPORTANT TO BOOST ECONOMY AND STABILIZE MARKET -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, the housing crisis has devastated millions of American families who have lost their homes, but the crisis doesn't end there. Experts predict that housing foreclosures could reduce overall economic activity by over $160 billion this year thanks to sharp declines in real estate, the construction industry, and in consumer spending. 
   The slump in the real estate market is hurting manufacturers, construction firms and other businesses that have been forced to lay off thousands of workers. Ending the foreclosure crisis is vital to the American economy, our economic recovery, and to Americans who are hurting. And that is why it is so important that this Congress pass the bipartisan housing package that we are presenting this week. It reported out of the Financial Services Committee by both Republicans and Democrats and sent to this floor for our consideration. 
   Mr. Speaker, serious problems with subprime mortgages have pushed the housing market into its worst slump in decades, weakening the economy and making American families less secure. The package of bills we are presenting today will help stabilize the housing industry and give the American economy the boost it so sorely needs. And I urge every Member of the House to support these much-needed bills.

<DOCNO>Mr. WU. (WHY SHOULD WE OPEN LAND FOR DRILLING WHEN BIG OIL ISN'T EVEN DRILLING WHERE THEY HAVE LEASES -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. Madam Speaker, it is no wonder that the only Republican solution to our record high gas prices is more drilling. Who would expect anything less when two former oil executives occupy the White House? 
   The problem is that this has been the Republican energy plan for the last 7 years. It was created in secret by Vice President Cheney and oil executives. And it is responsible for the record high oil prices that we all face at the pump today. 
   Republicans claim that we could lower the price at the pump if we would only approve more and more drilling leases. That is their rhetoric. Here are the facts. Oil companies do not need new areas to drill. They need to focus on areas that are already opened to them. Of the 42 million acres of Federal land currently leased by oil and gas companies, only about 12 million acres are actually being drilled to produce oil and natural gas. 
   Madam Speaker, if the Republican claims about more drilling are correct, why aren't they demanding Big Oil explore drilling on the 30 million acres of Federal land that are already open to them but that they refuse to explore?

   Mr. WU. Madam Chairman, I rise as a cosponsor in support of H.R. 6063. 
   When NASA was born in response to the launch of Sputnik, many Americans were scared of what it meant for  Russia to have space capabilities. Congress' passage of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 created NASA and marked the beginning of the space race between America and Russia. 
   Just 11 years after NASA was created, and only 9 years after President Kennedy threw a cap over the wall, the United States landed the first humans on the Moon. Since then, NASA has had its share of its successes and challenges, but in the end NASA is an example of what can be accomplished when the President and Congress share a vision, a common vision, and when funds are devoted toward that vision. 
   As Speaker Pelosi says, ``a budget is the tangible embodiment of our values, of what is important to us and what is not.'' We are considering this bill 50 years after the creation of NASA. We are at a singular point in time, the space shuttle will retire soon. And while we develop the next generation crew exploration vehicle, we will, for the first time, rely on other countries to take Americans to space. In the meantime, more and more countries are developing space capabilities. To keep us in the game, this bill provides an extra $1 billion to accelerate the development of the next crew exploration vehicle and shorten the American space flight gap. 
   Space has become more competitive. Where we only competed with Russia, we will soon compete with several countries to maintain our leadership in space. This bill includes a provision to ensure that the United States leads an international cooperation initiative with these countries promoting the peaceful exploration of space. 
   Today, NASA is funded at a much lower percentage of our GDP than when it was first created. At a time when other countries are aggressively investing in their space capabilities, Congress needs to send the message that it continues to support NASA and its mission by providing the appropriate and necessary funds. This bill does just that. And I want to commend Mr. Udall, Chairman Gordon, and Ranking Member Hall for a very strong bill, and I urge its passage.

   Mr. WU. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to build international trust and confidence in human space flight. 
   For decades, the United States and Russia were the only countries that had viable human space programs. In recent years, a number of countries have entered space or have expressed their intent to do so. This amendment recognizes the new playing field in space and includes a sense of Congress that the President of the United States should invite other spacefaring nations and soon-to-be spacefaring nations to participate in a long-term international initiative under our leadership. 
   My amendment would add a sentence to this sense of Congress that the United States should engage in confidence-building measures that advance this long-term initiative. With more countries in space, we need to ensure that space will not be used for hostile purposes. 
   I commend Chairman Udall for proposing a long-term international initiative that will work toward that end. Confidence-building measures will encourage short-term actions that advance the long-term initiative for international cooperation in space. The United States and Russia engaged in confidence-building measures when Apollo 18 and Soyuz 19 connected in space. My amendment encourages similar actions between the United States and other members of the international space community. Actions like these will encourage the peaceful exploration of space. 
   I urge adoption of the amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WU. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of scientific integrity at NASA and everywhere else in this Federal Government. 
   Earlier this month, the Inspector General at NASA released a report regarding allegations that NASA suppressed climate change science and denied media access to a NASA scientist. As recent news reports have documented, this report came from the revelation in 2006 that an administration official had intervened in communications between climate change scientists and the press for political purposes. 
   The report acknowledged that from the fall of 2004 through early 2006, the NASA Public Affairs Office managed the topic of climate science ``in a manner that reduced, marginalized, or mischaracterized climate change science made available to the general public through those particular media over which the Office of Public Affairs had control.'' 
   The report also found that these actions were inconsistent with NASA's mandate and purpose to allow ``the widest practical and appropriate dissemination of information concerning NASA's activities and results.'' 
   My amendment expresses the sense of Congress to reiterate the original intent of NASA's responsibilities. We are at a singular moment in time when climate change constitutes the challenge of our generation. Let us not fail. Let us base climate change information on science, not ideology. 
   This amendment is about far more than climate change. I believe scientific integrity should be held as a value throughout NASA and throughout our government. The safety of astronauts who are sent to space is dependent on sound science. We should not compromise scientific integrity for political gain or private profit. We should not compromise it in any situation. My amendment sends a message that Congress rebuffs the attempts of those who would marginalize science for the sake of ideology or politics. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WU. Again, on behalf of my good friend and colleague, Mr. DeFazio, I am presenting this amendment. 
   When the President announced his new vision for the Nation's space exploration program on January 14, 2004, he proposed a new human exploration vehicle to return to the Moon by 2020 and to leverage these lunar efforts to send a human mission to Mars. 
   After Mr. Bush unveiled his plan in 2004, a congressional subcommittee requested that the Congressional Budget Office perform a budgetary analysis of NASA's New Vision For Space Exploration, as this program was titled. The report was released in September of 2004 and concluded that NASA's long-term projections only included a 2 percent increase for inflation. 
   NASA's budget has undergone radical changes since the President's vision was announced in 2004. NASA's budget requests for aeronautics has been reduced by over $200 million. NASA's budget requests for science programs, including climate research, have been reduced by over $300 million. In stark contrast during the same period, overall funding requests for NASA have increased by over $2 billion. 
   Since the President first proposed his new ``vision for space exploration,'' we have spent more than $600 billion in Iraq, over $120 billion on Hurricane Katrina, and the Federal deficit has grown by over $2.4 trillion. 
   Mr. DeFazio's amendment will direct the Congressional Budget Office to update its 2004 budgetary analysis of the President's plan. This makes fiscal sense. It will give us a more complete picture of the budgetary hurdles the project will face and a more accurate assessment of its long-term costs.     
   Congress needs to continue to analyze the project as it moves forward and be mindful of its effect on other important NASA programs. If anyone claims that they believe that the report will be duplicative of previous GAO reports, the fact is that GAO hasn't done a true cost estimate of the program, but, rather, done risk assessments of the program. Budget and cost estimate analysis is something that the Congressional Budget Office usually handles, not the Government Accountability Office. 
   The GAO has done some high level budget analysis, but CBO will be able to give a much more detailed report. On Mr. DeFazio's behalf, I urge adoption of his amendment, and reserve the balance of my time.

   My good friend and colleague from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) has, with his usual vigor, many reasons why a Congressional Budget Office report is appropriate under these circumstances. I have not delivered some of those more pointed arguments, and join with the gentleman from Florida to urge adoption of this amendment for both purposes of fiscal prudence and in the interest of our space program in which we have such a strong common interest.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and passing of a great man and a gentleman, Harold ``Hal'' Hart. He was a teacher, a father figure, a mentor and friend to thousands across Oregon and thousands scattered indeed around the world whose lives go on as a testament to the goodness that Hal instilled in others. 
   A resident of Portland, Oregon, for most of his life, Mr. Hart lived a life that others could only dream of. Married to his high school sweetheart, Sally, and blessed with five daughters and eleven grandchildren, he never missed an opportunity to see the good in others. Nor did he miss an opportunity to bring out the best in others. 
   An attorney with an unabashed respect for the law, Mr. Hart worked tirelessly to mend the shattered lives of young people. He was seen by judges as the ``go to'' lawyer when a child was in need of help, working pro bono to aid countless adoptions, custody cases and child support cases. When asked why he cared so much and gave so much in this cause, he would say that everyone has the right to a happy childhood. 
   Outside of his professional life, Mr. Hart continued to give of himself. The founder and coach of Lincoln High School's Constitution program that won 13 consecutive Oregon State championships, including three national championships, and eight top 10 national finishes, he not only pioneered law-related education programs in the Portland metropolitan area, indeed, in that endeavor he was the Johnny Wooden of his field. One of his proudest moments, it was said, was when his students were given the opportunity to present their winning remarks to the U.S. Supreme Court, Members of the Senate, and to then Vice President Al Gore. Hundreds of his students have moved into the legal, teaching, government and service professions. 
   A noted softball coach who established girls' softball at Ainsworth Grade School and Lincoln High School, Hal Hart was coaching a women's team up to the last week of his life. He was  also a lifelong musician who supported himself through high school, college and law school playing clarinet and saxophone. As an adult, he played countless fundraisers with his jazz combo and the Providence Hospital Stage Band. 
   While Mr. Hart quietly went about helping others, never asking for anything in return except that those that he helped be good people, he was recognized by countless organizations for the works that he did. The effect of Hal Hart on his community and on the lives of those who knew him cannot be overstated. He was loved by his teams and beneficiaries, respected by his adversaries, and he will be universally missed.

   Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the trailblazing accomplishments of the Mercury 13 women, whose efforts in the early 1960s demonstrated the capabilities of American women to undertake the human exploration of space. The Mercury 13 women were Myrtle Cagle, Geraldyn ``Jerri'' Cobb, Jan Dietrich, Marion Dietrich, Mary Wallace ``Wally'' Funk, Jane Briggs Hart, Jean Hixson, Gene Nora Stumbough Jessen, Irene Leverton, Sarah Lee Gorelick Ratley, Bernice ``Bea'' Trimble Steadman, Geraldine ``Jerri'' Sloan Truhill, and Rhea Hurrle Allison Woltman. 
   All of these Mercury 13 women were accomplished pilots with commercial ratings or better and at least 2,000 hours of flying time, and they passed the same rigorous physical and psychological tests that the original Mercury 7 astronauts underwent. The Mercury 13 women were prepared to continue their service to America's space program, until they were informed that their testing program was cancelled. 
   While the former Soviet Union flew the first woman in space in 1963, it was another 20 years before the United States flew Dr. Sally Ride as the first American woman in space in 1983. 
   Mr. Speaker, I seek support for H. Res. 421 to honor the Mercury 13 women pioneers and to encourage young women to follow in the footsteps of the Mercury 13 women in pursuing careers of excellence in aviation and astronautics as well as in engineering and science. 
   Times do change. I spent a chunk of my time last week at home during recess handing out space camp scholarships. At every stop, it wasn't clear whether the winner was going to be a boy or a girl; and the enthusiasm for space seemed to be relatively equal between the boys and the girls in the classes where we made such awards.     
   In an aside, I would like to welcome China as a new nation among space-faring nations. There is an old Chinese saying, as there always is, that women hold up half the sky, and this recognition that American women have been participating in space long before 1983 is very, very appropriate at this point in time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and accomplishments of one of our heroes of the American space program, astronaut Walter Schirra, known as Wally Schirra. In his 84 years, spanning 1923 to 2007, Captain Schirra took great risks on behalf of his country, including while serving in the Pacific during World War II.     
   During the Korean War, Captain Schirra served our country as an exchange pilot with the 154th Fighter Bomber Squadron and flew 90 combat missions and downed at least one MIG fighter. 
   In April of 1959, Wally Schirra was selected by NASA as one of the original Mercury 7 astronauts. On October 3, 1962, he became the third American to orbit the Earth when he piloted his Sigma 7 spacecraft on a six-orbit mission that lasted 9 hours 13 minutes and 11 seconds. 
   As a brand new American who had just been in this country for a year and about 8 years old, I remember that, and I just remember that as one of the signal moments that I indeed had come to a country where anything and everything was possible, and Wally Schirra and others of the Mercury 7 group demonstrated that to America and to the world. 
   Wally Schirra went on to pilot the Gemini 6A mission in 1965, which involved the first attempted rendezvous by two manned spacecraft in Earth orbit, and he made his third and final mission in October, 1968, as commander of the first manned Apollo mission, Apollo 7. 
   During his career as an astronaut, Wally Schirra was the only astronaut to fly aboard all three generations of our late sixties-early seventies spacecraft, the Mercury, the Gemini and Apollo spacecraft. His outstanding service to the U.S. space program is marked by several awards, including the Distinguished Flying Cross, Air Force Medal, NASA Distinguished Service Medal, and induction into the National Aviation Hall of Fame. 
   Wally Schirra was a tireless advocate for discovery and spent his later years helping to connect children with the amazing possibilities that a career in space exploration can offer. 
   Mr. Speaker, today, I seek the support of this Chamber to honor the life and accomplishments of astronaut Wally Schirra, to express condolences on his passing, and to recognize the profound importance of astronaut Schirra's record as a space pioneer and a long-time contributor to NASA's mission of space exploration, scientific advancement and education in the United States. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is only fitting that this Chamber honor Wally Schirra's achievements, and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I and other Members of the Science and Technology Committee have been working on the issue of health care IT for several years. The genesis of this legislation, H.R. 1467, was a roundtable I held in Oregon in August 2005. This roundtable was followed by an Environment, Standards and Technology Subcommittee field hearing on health care information technology in February of 2006. Representative Reichert of Washington chaired the hearing, and our current ranking member, Mr. Hall, also had staff in attendance. 
   One of the common issues raised at both of these events was the lack of trained people who are experts in both health care and in information technology. Despite the Federal focus on developing a national electronic health care record system, there is no systematic plan for the training of current and prospective professionals in both health care and IT. Without this specialized training, the technology can sit on health care provider's desks as a box, cold and unused rather than as an integrated system of health care doing what it should do. 
   The need for individuals to manage health care IT is expected to grow 49 percent between 2000 and 2010, and nearly 75 percent of health care organizations indicate there are not enough qualified applicants for these positions. 
   I would like to point out that the Science and Technology Committee has a history of developing specific and specialized training and research programs for IT professionals. 
   During the 107th Congress, the committee became concerned that the lack of specialized computerized training for IT students and professionals was a contributing factor in the lack of decent computer security practices and software. As a result, the committee developed and moved H.R. 3394, the CyberSecurity Research and Development Act which subsequently became Public Law 107-305. 
   The bill under consideration today, H.R. 1467, consists of four components. It authorizes the National Science Foundation, NSF, to award research grants for innovative approaches enhancing health care informatics. I want to make clear that this provision builds upon existing NSF activities. 
   It authorizes NSF to support multidisciplinary health and medical informatics research centers to perform research and to train qualified health care informatics personnel and professionals. 
   Next, it authorizes NSF to establish a grant program to improve undergraduate, master's and certificate programs in health care informatics. The goal is to increase the number of students and the quality of training in their field. This program allows both 4-year and 2-year institutions to participate as well as allowing for the development of continuing education curricula. 
   Finally, it authorizes NSF's Advanced Technology Education Program which focuses solely on 2-year colleges to support improved education and technical training for health care informatics. 
   H.R. 1467 is a bipartisan product of the Science and Technology Committee. Ranking Member Hall and I introduced this bill in the last Congress. In this Congress, we introduced this legislation, along with Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Gingrey of the Technology and Innovation Subcommittee. 
   I have spoken to Dr. Gingrey about health care IT, and he knows from his firsthand experience the challenges involved in integrating IT into health care settings. 
   We all recognize the benefits that an integrated health IT network could provide in terms of improved patient care, safety, privacy and potentially cost savings. However, investment in physical infrastructure and technology alone is not enough. We need research and training programs for health care and IT professionals in order to use and design the system well. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WU. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York. 
   As cochair of the House Community College Caucus, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 334, a bill that recognizes the goals and ideals of National Community College Month; and I thank Congressman Brad Miller, the gentleman from North Carolina, for his leadership and for introducing this legislation. 
   Almost 50 percent of undergraduate students are enrolled in community colleges. It is the tradition of community colleges to serve nontraditional students. Many students work either part-time or full-time while they take classes. Others are seeking job training to allow them to better support their families. Some are returning to the workplace after a few years, and some are single parents. Increasingly, many are high school students who attend community college before a 4-year institution. This saves them, and frequently taxpayers, tuition, fees and financial aid dollars. In other words, we have no sector of education that serves a wider spectrum of our citizens every day. 
   As we look to what this new century holds for us, we know that employers seek people who not only are well versed in science and technology concepts but are also adept at learning through experimentation, inquiry, critical examination, and discovery. In other words, employers are seeking a highly trainable workforce, rather than just a highly trained workforce. 
   Community colleges are at the forefront of this effort. They are a cornerstone of our system of undergraduate education, particularly in mathematics and the sciences. As we all know, these areas of study are ever more critical for our Nation and our State to maintain an economic edge in the global economy. 
   I strongly support this resolution and urge my colleagues to do so as well.

   Mr. WU. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 5819, this SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act. I want to commend Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez and the gentleman from Ohio for their fine work in the Small Business Committee to bring a strong bill to the floor. I also want to recognize Drs. EHLERS and GINGREY and Chairman Gordon of our Science and Technology Committee for their leadership on this issue. 
   SBIR and STTR are integral to our innovation agenda. Small companies are where a lot of innovation happens, and we need to support these companies to remain successful in the competitive global economy. At more than $2.3 billion a year, SBIR and STTR comprise the largest single source of Federal funding for private sector technological innovation. These funds help fund companies to turn federally funded research into new jobs, products, and services. However, SBIR and STTR were created more than 20 years ago, and we need to restructure both programs to respond to the new global innovation environment. 
   Last week, the Technology and Innovation Subcommittee marked up H.R. 5789, the Science and Technology Innovation Act of 2008, which also reauthorized SBIR and STTR. I am glad to see that many of the provisions from H.R. 5789 were included in the subject bill, H.R. 5819. 
   I thank Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez for working to include provisions that the Science Committee thought were critical to the continued success of SBIR and STTR. 
   Prior to coming to Congress, I practiced technology law for a number of years, and I helped a number of applicants through the SBIR application process. I can tell you that it is a long and arduous process and that frequently, grant sizes were not adequate. The bill we are considering today includes many updates which can fix some of the problems that I saw in the private sector, such as increasing the set-aside by one-half percent, increasing the award sizes, allowing for agency flexibility and granting awards, and addressing venture capital participation in the SBIR program. 
   Again, I want to thank the chairwoman for introducing this good legislation which improves upon existing programs that are vital to the development of innovative technologies. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. WU. It has been delightful to be working with the majority on the SBIR/STTR bill. 
   The minority has chosen to make this into a debate about energy prices. A professor at Stanford University estimates that oil prices should be at about $60 a barrel. The chairman of Exxon, I understand, says that oil should be at about $55 a barrel. And I think the only reason why oil is at twice that price is because of an unnecessary war and a Republican Congress which permitted Exxon to speculate in the energy market.

   Mr. Speaker, I don't know how we got on the subject of gasoline prices because we're here to talk about SBIR and STTR. But if we want to talk about the price of gasoline, I think that the reason why we have $4-a-gallon gasoline is because this administration got us into an unnecessary war in Iraq and that drove up the price of gasoline at least $2 a gallon. So if you want to talk about gasoline, let's talk about the war in Iraq. 
   Now let's return to the subject of SBIR and STTR. The last time that we authorized either one of these problems, the SBIR program, was in the 106th Congress. The bill was marked up by the Small Business Committee and discharged by the Science Committee. I would note that the bill was not even referred to a subcommittee of the Science Committee. The bill then proceeded to the floor under a suspension of the rules. And we all know that as a suspension bill, there was absolutely no opportunity to offer an amendment to the underlying legislation. 
   Again, the last time that we authorized STTR, which was in the 107th Congress, the bill was marked up by the full Small Business Committee and discharged by both the Subcommittee on Environment, Technology, and Standards and by the full Science Committee without any Science Committee markup. The bill then proceeded to the floor under a suspension of the rules, and again there was absolutely no opportunity to amend the bill.

   Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, last night big, rich tobacco companies killed health care in Oregon for little poor kids. Now we in Congress must and can do better for our entire Nation. 
   But Republican leaders refuse to allow bipartisan negotiators to reach a compromise that would give 10 million American children the health care they need and deserve. The Republican leaders' refusal to negotiate only highlights their continued opposition to health care for the children of low-income working families. 
   Unfortunately, President Bush also remains unmoved by the health care needs of our children. The President has routinely refused to meet with congressional leaders, even to discuss the children's health care insurance program. 
   While President Bush works against children's health care, Republicans and Democrats will continue to work together to identify a compromise that will afford health care to 10 million American children. A bipartisan majority of us realize just how important it is to ensure that children have access. The health care of the 10 million American children and over 100,000 children in Oregon is simply too important to ignore.

<DOCNO>Mr. WU. (MAJOR ARTHUR CHIN POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, the history of America is the history of ordinary individuals who rise to extraordinary challenges and who volunteer their service in times of dire need. I rise today to recognize one such American, Major Arthur Chin. 
   Arthur Chin was born in Portland, Oregon in 1913. As a young man, he helped form a flying club, the Chinese Aero Club, a group of Chinese Americans who trained to fly fighter aircraft. He grew very concerned about Japan's invasion of China's northeastern provinces in 1931, and he volunteered to serve in the Chinese Air Force in 1932. Although he was safe at home in Oregon and did not need to do this, he saw the threat of fascist invasion and  the need to face it down, and he volunteered himself to face this challenge, not only to China, but to the world. 
   After receiving advanced fighter training, Major Chin was ultimately assigned to the 28th Fighter Squadron, and he saw his first aerial combat in 1937, four years before America entered the war. Soon he was credited with having shot down his first enemy aircraft of the war. Though he and his comrades were almost always outnumbered, Chin and his fellow aviators fought valiantly, and by mid-1939 he had downed five enemy aircraft, making him one of the first American fighter aces of the Second World War. 
   But Arthur Chin's heroism was not without personal sacrifice. He was shot down three times, and on December 27, 1939, he was badly burned when his Gloster Gladiator took enemy fire and exploded. Chin spent the next years of his life enduring a painful recovery in hospitals in China, India and the United States. 
   After America entered the war, he returned to service in 1944 as a major in the United States Army Air Force. Major Chin spent the remainder of the war flying desperately needed supplies from India to China over the Himalayas, the air route now known as ``the hump.'' For his extraordinary service, Arthur Chin received numerous medals and awards, including the Distinguished Flying Cross.     
   After the war, he returned to his native Portland where he raised a family and worked for the postal service in Beaverton. Arthur Chin passed away in September of 1997, and following his death he was honored as one of the first inductees into the American Combat Airmen's Hall of Fame. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is altogether fitting that we should recognize Major Arthur Chin, both a former postal worker and a genuine war hero, with a post office named in his honor. It is an appropriate memorial to an individual who courageously answered the call of duty, whether at home or abroad, and who returned home to continue serving his country as a postal worker. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill.

The three reasons are our presence in Iraq, instead of lowering the price of oil, it increased the price of oil; the permission from Wall Street to speculate on a purely financial basis in commodity futures; and the third reason is the lowering of the value of the U.S. dollar. Two of those policies are intentional policies, and the third policy was passed by the Republican Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   For the past week, the world has been shocked and saddened by the aftermath of the horrendous earthquake that struck the Chinese Sichuan Province last Monday, May 12. Chinese news reports now confirm that the 7.9 Richter scale magnitude earthquake has claimed the lives of over 40,000 people.     
   The number of fatalities climbs higher each day as the full scale of the devastation unfolds. Chinese authorities estimate that, despite strenuous rescue efforts, in the end as many as 50,000 people could have perished from the earthquake and its aftermath. 
   Particularly heartbreaking are the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of children who were killed as their schools collapsed on them. These young lives were cut far, far too short, and it is so tragic that had the earthquake occurred just 2 or 3 hours later, or had the schools that the children were in  met applicable building codes, these young lives would have been spared. 
   We are all deeply moved by the images of parents overwhelmed by grief at the side of the limp, lifeless body of their child. As we speak, hundreds of parents are sifting through the wreckage with desperate hope that their child may still be alive under all that schoolhouse rubble. 
   Rescue workers continue to work tirelessly, day and night. Stories of heroism and miraculous survival are interwoven with tales of loss and devastation. 
   Doctors and nurses tend to injured victims around the clock, as hospitals handle many times their normal number of trauma injuries. 
   This earthquake is the most devastating natural disaster to strike China since 1976, and sadly, as major aftershocks continue to hit the area, the turmoil continues. 
   Just yesterday, Chinese media reported that more than 200 rescue workers were buried and killed by mudslides while they were repairing roads in Sichuan Province. 
   While the 1.3 billion people across China unite in grief for 3 days of mourning, it is fitting that this body expresses our deepest sympathies for the people of China. With this resolution, we offer our condolences to the people of China as they cope with this awful tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are with them. 
   House Resolution 1195 also vows the full support of the House of Representatives to the people of China and expresses our confidence that they will succeed in coming together to help those in need and overcome this terrible disaster. 
   Finally, the House also extends its condolences and support to members of the Chinese American community here in the United States who have relatives and friends in the affected areas of China. 
   I urge strong support of this resolution, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in doing the same. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WU. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership and always caring about the people of China. 
   I include the following news article from the Portland, Oregonian:  
   Boeing May Be the Ticket for Relief Supplies; China Quake--New Jets Are Scheduled for Delivery, and Oregon Agencies Hope Their Aid Can Hitch a Ride  
   Oregon aid agencies aim to piggyback on Boeing's booming sales to China, loading earthquake-relief supplies in new jets being delivered to Chinese airlines. 
   Managers of Medical Team International are negotiating to send $470,000 worth of supplies that Mercy Corps would help distribute to earthquake victims in China. A Boeing spokesperson says the aircraft manufacturer has entered similar deals in the past, but rarely in urgent response to humanitarian disasters. 
   Boeing and the relief workers are reviewing 15 aircraft that have been ordered by Chinese airlines, said Barbara Agnew, spokeswoman for Tigard-based Medical Teams International. The jets are scheduled for delivery to six Chinese cities, she said. 
   ``None of these destinations are actually hubs that are near the disaster site,'' Agnew said. ``So they're going back to specific airlines and saying, `Would you be able to take this cargo to a closer hub?' '' 
   The Boeing deal is one of several the humanitarian organizations are feverishly negotiating as disaster estimates grow in both China and cyclone-hit Myanmar. The aid agencies are forming partnerships to overcome government restrictions and other obstacles in the two countries. 
   Mercy Corps plans to load items ranging from school kits to rubber gloves in Portland for delivery in Seattle to DHL International. The global delivery company plans to fly the supplies for free to Bangkok, Thailand, for distribution in Myanmar and perhaps China, also providing warehouse space. 
   DHL is also working with Mercy Corps on a charter flight to carry pharmaceuticals from the United States to China. ``Something like this would be impossible for us to do on our own,'' said Susan Laarman, a Mercy Corps spokeswoman, saying the charter otherwise could cost as much as $1 million. 
   In Myanmar, where the government has kept foreign relief workers out of hard-hit areas, Portland-based Mercy Corps expects to team with Merlin, a British organization already working inside the reclusive country. As with the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004, Mercy Corps will most likely launch cash-for-work programs, paying local people to repair roads, clear debris and rebuild houses. 
   Already Mercy Corps has helped Merlin secure boats to carry emergency medical kits to Myanmar's Irrawaddy Delta, which took the brunt of the May 2 cyclone. Four Mercy Corps aid workers have managed to get into Myanmar--also known as Burma--but not beyond the capital, Yangon or Rangoon. 
   Michael Bowers, Mercy Corps Northeast Asia regional program director, departed Portland on Monday for Chengdu, China. There, too, the agency plans to team with local organizations. 
   ``We think we'll focus particularly on youth and vulnerable women who may have been affected by the earthquake,'' said Bowers, adding that Chinese officials were easing access. ``The authorities in this disaster took a pause before they went down the road of Burma.'' 
   Medical Teams International has no relief workers in either country yet, but a doctor on its staff plans to depart Wednesday for Myanmar. The first choice of the organization, formerly called Northwest Medical Teams, would be to send one of its volunteer medical-worker teams to Myanmar. 
   ``The numbers are just speaking so loudly in Myanmar,'' Agnew said. 
   Myanmar is hardly a big aircraft buyer, but China is a giant Boeing customer, which could work in the aid agencies' favor. Boeing forecasts that China will require 3,400 new airplanes worth about $340 billion over the next two decades. 
   But arranging on short notice to pack antibiotics, bandages and pain relievers into new airplanes is a complex project, requiring sign-offs by numerous managers even within Boeing. Chinese customs inspectors also must approve the unusual shipments.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. I want to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Bishop) for his leadership in education. I rise in support of this temporary extension of the Higher Education Act and also rise to associate myself with the remarks of the gentleman from Florida. Our hearts and prayers go out to Senator  Kennedy, his family, friends, and many supporters around the country, and look forward to his return to the other body as the lion of the Senate, with teeth and claws and roar completely intact. 
   I also look forward to the new Higher Education Act, which we are close to completing in conference with the other body, and the many provisions that my colleague from New York referred to. I just wanted to point out three. One is a substantial expansion of financial aid, especially to the neediest students in America. Second, a late but very appropriate recognition of the role of community colleges in higher education, and in particular the encouragement of articulation agreements between community colleges and their peers and 4-year colleges. 
   What articulation agreements would basically permit would be students to seamlessly go between community colleges, and between community colleges and 4-year colleges, because what we have found in Oregon is that students study and learn in a different way today, so that someone may take a class at a community college in the morning, work, and then take a class at a 4-year college at night. We want that system to work for the students and want the institutions to work together so that students do not need to fill out two financial aid forms, two entrance forms, and multiple other forms. These articulation agreements are very, very important. It's a little bit technical. But it will serve the modern education need very, very well. 
   Finally, I want to point out one area addressed by this higher education bill, and this is a topic on which my office has received the most mail of any topic that we have worked on in my decade in Congress, this is mail from all around the country, from college students, and that is the textbook fairness pricing issue. 
   Sometimes you will find a book in the college book store here selling for $150. If you go on Amazon U.K., you will find the same textbook being sold, in English, the same textbook in the U.K. for $50. In this Internet era, with a highly motivated, highly educated consumer group, namely college students, this kind of pricing unfairness just can't stand the test of either fairness or propriety anymore. 
   We have some minimal provisions in the House version of the higher education bill to bring some fairness, some openness to college textbook pricing. Currently, students are cooperating, professors are cooperating, bookstores are cooperating, but the textbook industry is fighting this particular provision very, very hard. I just want to say that we will not give up on this issue. We will insist on the House language because college students who can make a difference, who will make a difference, will insist upon this. 
   We look forward to the new version of the higher education bill and support this temporary extension.

   Mr. WU. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Chairman, first of all, I would like to recognize the leadership of the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Mitchell) for working diligently on this important piece of legislation, for reaching across the aisle and working with the gentleman from Georgia, and for his leadership in shaping this important piece of legislation. In fact, it was, indeed, through efforts like this that Congress first formed the United States Fire Administration in 1974 because of then reports that there are over 12,000 deaths each year in this country, and over 300,000 fire injuries. And through the hard work of the USFA, and others, we have been fortunate to see that number drop dramatically. 
   We are now a much safer Nation thanks to improved awareness of fire safety practices, increased use of smoke detectors and sprinklers, and other fire safety measures. Still, about 3,000 people die each year of fires, and 10,000 more are injured. We also still see too many firefighters die in the line of duty. And I want to recognize Mr. Pascrell, the gentleman from New Jersey, for his diligent work over many years to decrease that unconscionable number. 
   We have a lot more work to do. The USFA supports local fire departments in a variety of ways. It offers training and career development to thousands of mid-level firefighters, fire chiefs, and other emergency management officials. 
   USFA is a great way for the Federal Government to help coordinate efforts for local firefighters. USFA also develops fire education and awareness curriculum material to be used in training citizens across the country. It aims these messages at groups which suffer the highest fire casualties, such as the young and the elderly. 
   While Congress is working to reauthorize and build on this program, the President, unfortunately, is cutting the budget for USFA. Indeed, the President's fiscal `09 budget cuts USFA by more than 5 percent. 
   As firefighters learn to respond to new issues, such as fires and the wildland-urban interface, terrorist events and harmful materials incidents, we need to provide sufficient funds to train and prepare them for these situations. 
   Firefighters risk their lives every day so that they can protect ours. Passing this legislation is one way that we can not only show, but tangibly demonstrate our deep appreciation. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the underlying bill. I again recognize the leadership of the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Mitchell).

   Mr. WU. Mr. Chairman, again, I would like to recognize the leadership of the gentleman from Arizona for working so hard on this important legislation, this legislation which was developed in regular order in both subcommittee and full committee. 
   The gentleman from Georgia, my ranking member, we held hearings last October at the subcommittee level, and then we had a full committee markup, and the bill was drafted in full consultation with both majority and minority members and majority and minority staff. 
   Much has been made of the work that will be done on the wildland-urban interface and the fuel loads and the biomass loads there, and the hazardous  materials, and that is very, very important. 
   I also want to draw attention to the sections of the bill that directs the USFA to educate local fire departments about voluntary consensus standards for firefighters health and safety. And many fire groups, especially the National Association of Firefighters, very strongly believe that adherence to these standards can help reduce the number of firefighters who die each year in the line of duty.     
   This bill has been endorsed by the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the International Association of Firefighters, the National Volunteer Fire Council, the National Fire Protection Association, the International Association of Arson Investigators, the North American Fire Training Directors, the International Fire Service Training Association, and the Congressional Fire Services Institute; and I would like to specifically thank all of the firefighters from home in Oregon who helped me with this legislation in shaping it and bringing it to this point on the House floor. 
   And with that, I would again like to commend the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Mitchell) for his leadership on this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. I thank the gentleman from Arizona. 
   Mr. Speaker, for thousands of years, a village stood at Celilo Falls on the Columbia River, which today is the boundary between the States of Oregon and Washington. 
   Celilo Falls was known to Native Americans as a center for gathering and trade in the Pacific Northwest. It was so important that some have even called Celilo Falls the Wall Street of the West. Lewis and Clark described it as a great emporium where ``the neighboring nations assemble.'' 
   Artifacts suggest that tribes as far away as Alaska, the Great Plains, and the Southwest of the United States came to trade at the falls for salmon and other goods. The trade was so extensive and the number of tribes who came to Celilo was so extensive that the number of languages spoken developed into a trade jargon known as Chinookan, and it was used among the people conducting business at Celilo. 
   Celilo Falls was also known as a great salmon fishery. Salmon were both sacred to and provided economic wealth for the tribes who fished in the area. Thousands gathered to fish and trade along the river. 
   Fifty years ago, Celilo Falls changed forever. In 1957, the Dalles Dam was completed a few miles downriver from Celilo. Once the dam was completed and the flood gates closed, Celilo Falls was inundated in just 6 hours. 
   The Dalles Dam was constructed to provide hydroelectricity, irrigation, and to enable navigation. The dams along the Columbia and other rivers created numerous benefits for the Pacific Northwest. The slack water created by the dams provided easy and safe river navigation upriver to deliver goods to the inland Northwest. Today, barges can travel as far as Lewiston, Idaho, because of the navigable waters created by the dams. 
   However, the benefits created by the dams changed a way of life for the tribal peoples who were the first inhabitants of the Columbia River Basin. While some may not remember Celilo Falls before the Dalles Dam was completed, its effects remain fresh in the minds of many of the tribes of the Pacific Northwest. Recently, the 50th anniversary of the flooding of the falls was acknowledged by these tribes. This event both mourned what was lost and celebrated what remains today, tribal stories and culture, a way of life. Attendees included tribal officials and tribal members throughout the Pacific Northwest, nontribal members, and various Federal, State, and local governmental officials. The attendees reflect the relationship of the various groups who now work together to manage the river for all those who live in and visit the region today. 
   This resolution seeks to acknowledge and commemorate the flooding of Celilo Falls. I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me the time. 
   And with just a minute or two of time, one of the saddest moments, one of the two saddest moments in my relatively brief career here in the United States House was when this Chamber acted at the President's request to cut $12 billion from college financial aid. That occurred the day after a State of the Union Address where the President talked about American competitiveness. 
   Today, we take a bold step in rectifying that error. And I just want to refer a moment to the other saddest day of my thus far 8 years in the House of Representatives, and that was the decision in this Chamber to go to war in Iraq. 
   Those were the two saddest moments in my congressional career: Begin a war in error, and now perpetuating a pride. But at least today, at this moment, we are having an opportunity to rectify, in my view, the other great error that we committed during my time in this Chamber, and that is the $12 billion cut that the Education Committee passed, the prior majority passed in this Chamber, and that went into effect without a necessary 60-vote majority in the Senate. 
   Now, we can propose this greatest increase in college financial aid. We may or may not have the votes for cloture in the other Chamber, but this is the right thing to do. This is the right thing to do. It will make America more competitive. It will help individuals, and it will help our society, and we will rectify the errors we have made in the past one by one.  
   I rise in support of the College Cost Reduction Act. 
   Affordable access to quality post-secondary education is the best tool available to ensure success and the kind of career that can support a family. It is also critical that American students have the education that will help them remain competitive in an increasingly global and knowledge-based economy. 
   The College Cost Reduction Act provides a major funding increase to assist students and their families achieve the goal paying for college, and much more--at no new expense to taxpayers. It provides tuition assistance to undergraduates who commit to teaching in low-income communities or high-need subject areas. It rewards those who serve their communities--first responders and law enforcement officers, for example, by providing loan forgiveness to those that serve others. 
   Perhaps most importantly, the bill provides a major help to students in my home state of Oregon. The bill expands Pell Grant eligibility, and the maximum Pell Grant scholarship is increased over $500. This means nearly 70,000 Oregonians could benefit from the bill. This translates into $194 million dollars in aid to Oregon students and families over five years. 
   College costs have skyrocketed over the past decade. 
   The College Cost Reduction Act is instrumental in helping more Americans achieve their dream of a college education. I strongly support this bill, and urge my colleagues to do so as well.

   Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, 4 years ago, this administration took America to war in Iraq without adequate evidence. Since that time, the administration has not listened to the American people, it hasn't listened to our professional military, and it certainly hasn't listened to this Congress. 
   It was said of a prominent businessman in downtown Portland that he never listened to anybody and that if he was ever drawn in a cartoon he would be drawn without ears. 
   Now, this President has listened to some people, the so-called Vulcans in the White House, the ideologues. But unlike the Vulcans of Star Trek, who made the decisions based on logic and fact, these guys make it on ideology. These aren't Vulcans. There are Klingons in the White House. But unlike the real Klingons of Star Trek, these Klingons have never fought a battle of their own. 
   Don't led faux Klingons send real Americans to war. It is wrong.

<DOCNO>Mr. WU. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, I have a statement which I will submit for the RECORD, but I want to speak for a moment from my personal experience. 
   I have owned a business. I have met a payroll. But I have also worked for relatively low wages. I have worked in decommissioned ships that were both extremely hot in the hold and also filled with asbestos. I have worked in a dog food factory. But my real minimum wage job was as an assistant dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant owned by friends of my parents. I saw how hard those full-time workers worked. 
   I was an assistant dishwasher, and I saw how the full-time dishwasher got his fingers burned, how the cooks got their hands cut. And they worked for minimum wage just like me, but I was a teenager. And I came home to my parents' home. I said to my parents, Those people work awfully hard, and they deserve more. We ought to have a union. I never got to go back to work at my parents' friends' restaurant. 
   There are times when there is unequal bargaining power, when there are market failures, and there is a very legitimate role for the public sector and for joint action. 
   I ask my friends on the other side of the aisle whether they would roll back the 40-hour work week. I ask my friends if they would roll back worker safety provisions and roll back child labor laws. Your time has passed a century ago. It is long due to pass an increase in the minimum wage.  
   I rise in strong support of raising the minimum wage. 
   We tend to assume that employment is the solution to poverty. And in the past we have enacted legislation that reflects our commitment to training and placing individuals into jobs. While I strongly support efforts to increase employment, a job is not the complete answer to poverty. Far too many families who work full time still live below the poverty line. In fact, since the late 1970s, the number of full-time workers who live in poverty has doubled. 
   The reason for this is our low minimum wage. In 1996, after a 5-year freeze, Congress enacted legislation to raise the minimum wage from $4.25 an hour to $5.15 an hour--still well below the value of the minimum wage at its in peak in 1968 at $8.49 in 2005 dollars. Now, 10 years have passed without an increase in the minimum wage. Meanwhile, the number of Americans who live in poverty has increased by 5.4 million during the Bush administration. 
   Today, a minimum wage worker working full time earns only half the poverty level for a family of four. A single parent working full time at the current minimum wage cannot support one child above the poverty threshold. 
   More than one-quarter, 26 percent, of the 13 million workers who would benefit from a minimum wage increase are parents. Sixty percent of these workers are women. 
   History has shown that a minimum wage increase does not decrease employment or increase inflation. In fact, in the four years after the last minimum wage increase passed, the economy experienced its strongest growth in over three decades. Yet a minimum wage increase does raise the wages of low-income workers in general, even those who earn more than the minimum wage, the ``lifting all boats'' effect of an increase in the minimum wage. It moves working families out of poverty. 
   Unfortunately, the Republicans leadership has resisted all efforts to increase the minimum wage. 
   The Fair Minimum Wage Act, of which I am proud to be an original cosponsor, will raise the minimum wage to $7.25 over a 2-year period. 
   It is time to raise the minimum wage. No one should work full time jobs, or even work multiple jobs, and still live in poverty.

<DOCNO>Mr. WU. (COLLEGE STUDENT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5, the legislation to lower student loan interest rates.  
   According to the Department of Education, two-thirds of undergraduate students will take out a Federal student loan this year to help finance their college education. 
   As tuition costs swell and grant-aid fails to keep pace, students and their families are increasingly turning to loans as the primary mechanism to finance a higher education. While student loans make the college dream a reality for millions, they all too often turn into a nightmare of debt. 
   Over the past eight years the typical student loan debt has more than doubled to approximately $19,000. In addition, 39 percent of all student borrowers now graduate with unmanageable debt levels. Too many student borrowers struggle to make their monthly loan payments, and many must forgo savings, public service careers, and home ownership. 
   Borrowing for higher education should be a sound investment for the future, both for the student, and our society. Yet, today we are asking far too many students to mortgage their future at too high a cost. 
   I am proud to support this legislation which will help ease the burden of student loans. H.R. 5 will cut the interest rate for subsidized student loans in half to 3.4 percent. For a student with $13,800 in student loans, this will save them $4,400 in interest over the life of their loan and will help make the college dream a viable reality for countless students. 
   I have been working in Congress to do just that. I have been pushing for legislation that will not only make student financial aid more flexible for students but also ease the financial burden of student loans. 
   For instance, I have been pushing for passage of the Student Loan Interest Full Deductibility Act, which would allow eligible taxpayers to deduct the full amount of their student loan interest and would remove the current income cap limiting the deduction. Current law only allows for $2,500 to be deducted, even though many students pay thousands more each year in student loan interest, and phases out this deduction if a taxpayer's income is greater $50,000 a year. 
   I have also been advocating for the Community College Partnership Act, which would create partnerships between community colleges and four-year institutions to encourage students to continue their education at a college or university. This is based on an Oregon idea where colleges noticed their students were taking classes in non-traditional ways. Students would take classes at a community college in the morning, go to work, and then take 
   another class at a different campus at night, or vice versa. However, in order to create such a class schedule, the students had to deal with two sets of administrations, two sets of paperwork, and two sets of financial aid. In order to encourage more of these students to continue and complete their studies at the 4-year institution, Portland State University partnered with neighboring community colleges to make this transition seamless through dual enrollment programs in which enrollees' class credits, financial aid, and administrative paperwork seamlessly transfer between the schools. The Community College Partnership Act expands on this idea by establishing a competitive grant program to encourage or expand similar partnerships throughout the United States. 
   Finally, I am proud to be investigating the high price of college textbooks. Recent news reports have exposed what has long been experienced by students and college bookstores: often the exact same college textbooks that American college students are required to buy for class are sold overseas for less than half the price. This situation does not meet the test  of fairness and common sense, and it is especially troubling when one considers the skyrocketing cost of higher education in general and of college textbooks in particular. It is increasingly common for students to pay in excess of $1,000 per school year for textbooks and supplies alone. Last Congress, I was successful in getting the Government Accountability Office to investigate the high price of college textbooks and the disparity of prices between textbooks sold in the United States and overseas. The GAG report unmasked the problem of rising prices of college textbooks. Given this, Congressman BUCK MCKEON and I commissioned the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance to further study the problem and to develop solutions. 
   Again, I am pleased to support H.R. 5 today because it will help address the rising cost of college. We are at the dawn of a new economy--one that is based on knowledge. A higher education is more important than ever in this economy. We must work on policies that not only improve access to a higher education but also makes this education more affordable. That is what H.R. 5 is about, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I offer an amendment to invest further in renewable energy by creating a university based research program for biomass energy research. The amendment authorizes funds for competitive grants to support research at institutions of higher education to use trees killed by disease or insect infestation for biomass energy. 
   Priority will be given to research institutions in low-income or rural communities, those that already conduct research in this field, institutions which can enter joint ventures with Indian tribes and those institutions located near forests killed by massive disease or insect infestation. 
   Mr. Chairman, we must capitalize on America's universities for research and renewable energy. My amendment will harness universities as a resource to advance our renewable energy portfolio. 
   The amendment also ensures grants will be distributed throughout the United States. If fully funded, at least a dozen universities could be selected from the pool of university applicants. 
   In the Pacific Northwest, the unfortunate incidence of disease and insect infestation in our forests can be mitigated by turning dead trees into renewable energy. By targeting universities in rural and low-income communities, we create needed jobs and help develop those jobs in communities which frequently have felt neglected in our pursuit of pro-environmental causes. 
   Dead trees can be an opportunity to create clean, renewable energy, generate jobs and protect our healthy forests by using our dead and dying ones for biomass energy. I urge my colleagues to support this research program. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   However, the United States quickly responded. In just 84 days scientists built the Explorer I satellite that would begin the next 50 years of space exploration. Scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory collaborated under the leadership of Dr. William Pickering to manufacture what would become Explorer I. On January 31, 1958, the United States launched its first satellite into space. Once in orbit, the satellite collected data on cosmic rays. The scientific data was important, but the beginning of our space program was also important for the assurance it provided Americans. Explorer I signaled we would not fall behind Russia in space. 
   Today we continue to rely on scientists, engineers, and mathematicians to solve the pressing problems of our day. These innovators continuously rise to the challenges we as a Nation face. Explorer I stands as a milestone in space, and foreshadowed what we would achieve in just 50 years. 
   Today, the United States remains a leader in space: landing humans on the moon; exploring our solar system; and gaining a better understanding of our land, oceans, and atmosphere. We must continue to reach for new goals in space. By doing so, we continue our leadership of this world and lead humanity to a brighter destiny.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the conference report on H.R. 2272, the 21st Century Competitiveness  Act of 2007. I was pleased to have served on the conference committee that produced this conference report, and it is the result of a 6 months or more longer process that began on the House side with a series of bills in the Science and Technology Committee. 
   I especially want to recognize the leadership of Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall, and on the subcommittee which I chair, Dr. Gingrey, for their leadership and cooperation in producing this bill, and also the very hardworking staff who helped produce this bill. I frequently said that you don't have to be a rocket scientist to be on the Science Committee, but you need to be a rocket scientist to be on the Science Committee staff. 
   These many bills were ultimately packaged into H.R. 2272, which reflect a bipartisan consensus in the House on the immediate actions and funding we need to keep American innovation strong. 
   The conference agreement before us today preserves the key provisions of H.R. 2272 and lays the foundation for benefits that will be reaped by our children: good jobs, strong economic competitiveness, and a better quality of life. 
   I want to talk specifically about title III of the conference agreement, which reauthorizes the activities of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST. NIST's mission is to promote innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards and technology. The new technologies that are producing global winners in the 21st century, including nanotechnology, advanced manufacturing and information systems, rely on tools developed by NIST to measure, evaluate and standardize. These tools are enabling U.S. companies to innovate and remain competitive, which is why NIST's mission has never been more urgent than it is today. 
   This conference agreement puts NIST's budget on a 10-year path to doubling as an investment in the future of American innovation. It substantially increases the NIST lab budget to enable it to expand its work in new technical areas, and it funds the completion of current laboratory construction projects in both Boulder and Gaithersburg. 
   Title III also places the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, MEP, on a 10-year path to doubling. The MEP is a proven and highly successful public-private partnership that provides technical assistance to small and medium-sized manufacturers to improve their productivity and competitiveness. A fully funded MEP will go far to reinvigorate our manufacturing sector, which has lost almost 3 million jobs since 2001. 
   Title III also responds to changes in global competition by establishing the new Technology Innovation Program, TIP, to replace the old Advanced Technology Program. TIP will help small, high-tech firms with big ideas cross the technologic valley of death by providing them with limited cost-shared funding to develop technologies that address critical national needs either alone or in joint ventures. 
   If you support American jobs, maintaining our economic competitiveness and a high standard of living, you should support the conference report on H.R. 2272.

<DOCNO>Mr. WU. (FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, last year 1.5 million American households entered foreclosure, and this year the number of American families in danger of losing their homes could be as high as 2 million. These foreclosures could reduce overall economic activity by $166 billion this year as the effects of the mortgage crisis spill over into other sectors of the economy. 
   In my State of Oregon, the foreclosure rate among subprime borrowers increased by 28 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007. Over 5,000 Oregon families are currently in foreclosure, more than half of whom hold subprime mortgages. 
   But this debate is not about facts and statistics. If it were, it would be over by now. By requiring that the holders of debt take a haircut down to 85 percent of current market value, we are  sharing the pain. By requiring that people who are working in order to be eligible for this program are paying at least 35 percent of their income in order to be eligible, we are exercising responsibility. 
   What this debate is really about is a matter of values. The values being expounded on the other side of this debate are absolutely astounding, and nothing illustrates it better than a movie I love, ``It's a Wonderful Life.'' George Bailey was the hero of that movie, and he was dealing with a hard-hearted old man named Mr. Potter. Mr. Potter said to George Bailey as he was trying to save American households, ``Have you put any real pressure on these people to pay their mortgages?'' 
   And George Bailey relied, ``Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.'' 
   ``Then foreclose.'' 
   George Bailey answers, ``I can't do that. These families have children.'' 
   ``Not my children,'' said Mr. Potter. 
   Well, what we hear from the other side is: not my children, these folks are irresponsible, throw them out. 
   We clearly have the upper hand in this debate.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the CHAMP Act and the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP.  
   This bill will cover the nearly 11 million children who fall into the gap between Medicaid and private insurance. 
   Not only will the CHAMP Act provide health insurance for millions of additional children, but also the peace of mind for millions of families who work hard to provide all of life's essentials for their families. 
   For my state of Oregon the passage of the CHAMP Act means many of the 107,000 uninsured children will have access to health care. 
   And while the legislation before us today is a suitable and necessary short-term solution, the long-term need remains: America is falling short of our moral obligation to provide all children with access to health care. 
   Access to health care is not only a struggle for those with the lowest incomes; it now also is a struggle for those we have traditionally considered middle-class, and therefore should be able to afford health insurance. 
   Since 1965 Medicare has ensured our Nation's senior citizens have access to health care. That success should be extended to cover our youngest citizens. I am developing new legislation will do just that. 
   My MediKids legislation would provide access to comprehensive health care for all children and expecting mothers. Every child would be automatically enrolled at birth. But parents would retain the right to choose to enroll their children in private plans or others such as SCHIP or Medicaid. 
   MediKids also would act as a safety net. If parents have a lapse in other insurance, a common concern and constant worry among many families, MediKids would provide coverage. 
   America has the best health care in the world, but fewer and fewer families can actually afford it. We should not make our children, and their parents, wait any longer. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the legislation before us, but to continue to work toward a long-term solution for today's and tomorrow's youngest citizens.

But in the time that I have been here, in 8 years, the solvency of Social Security has been increased by approximately 8 years, and that increase is because of American economic growth. It was projected at 34 years of solvency. It is currently projected at 42 years of solvency, and that  is based on conservative, conservative estimates. The reason why there has been that increase in the solvency period of Social Security is because of economic growth. 
   There is nothing more important to the American economy and our competitiveness than the legislation that we are considering today. 
   The motion to recommit which the gentleman offers would fundamentally gut this legislation and prevent us from investing in the most productive of technologies, a traditional role which the Federal Government has played to support research and early-stage development, not commercialization, but early-stage development. By prohibiting those activities with this cap, what in essence would happen is our rate of economic growth would be slackened, our ability to manufacture jobs would be decreased.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1868, the Technology Innovation Manufacturing Stimulation Act of 2007. This bill authorizes programs at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, for fiscal years 2008 through 2010, and strengthens American innovation. 
   For most Americans, NIST is not a household word. But since its creation more than 100 years ago, NIST has made major contributions to public safety, industrial competitiveness and economic growth. Beginning in the 1900s, when it set standards for fire hydrants that have saved countless lives, to the 1950s, when it developed the world's fastest computer, helping usher in the information age, to its groundbreaking work on the technical aspects of the collapse of the World Trade Center on 9/11, NIST has served the public interest in ways that far exceed its public fame. 
   Today, NIST's mission focuses on promoting innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement, science, standards and technology. This mission has never been more urgent. The recent National Academy of Sciences report coauthored by Norm Augustine, ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' warns that we face major challenges in the global marketplace and recommends that we ``ensure that the United States is the premier place in the world in which to innovate.'' 
   H.R. 1868 helps implement that recommendation by putting the NIST budget on a 10-year path to doubling as an investment in the future of American innovation. The bill increases the NIST research budget, funds key areas such as biologics, health care IT and nanotechnology. It funds the construction of a high performance laboratory at the Boulder, Colorado, campus, and upgrades the Center for Neutron Research in Gaithersburg, Maryland. This enables world class engineers and their scientists to have world class facilities for their work. 
   H.R. 1868 also addresses problems in the American manufacturing center, which has lost almost 3 million jobs since 2001. It expands the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, or MEP, a proven and highly successful public-private partnership that provides technical assistance to small and medium-size manufacturers to improve productivity and to remain competitive in a global marketplace. 
   It also establishes a competitive and collaborative grant system for MEP  centers, industry groups, and nonindustry partners, to undertake manufacturing technology research. Manufacturing is a major source of high skill, high-paying jobs, and this bill will go far to reinvigorate our manufacturing sector. 
   One of the biggest stumbling blocks to innovation is the technology so-called ``Valley of Death,'' the gap between angel funding and measurable venture capital, the lack of adequate private venture capital for early stage, high-risk, high-reward technology development. Almost 20 years ago, Congress created the Advance Technology Program, or ATP, to address this gap. 
   Today, the ``Valley of Death'' remains, but the global innovative environment has changed. H.R. 1868 responds to this by replacing ATP with the Technology Innovation Program, or TIP, which would provide limited, cost-shared grants to small and medium-size firms and joint venture to pursue high risk, high-reward technologies, with potential for broad public benefit. 
   TIP also acknowledges the vital role that universities play in the innovation cycle by allowing them to fully participate in TIP. H.R. 1868 is a bipartisan bill and incorporates good ideas from both sides of the aisle. It has been endorsed by TechNet, SEMI, the American Small Manufacturers Coalition, the Association of American Universities, the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges, the Alliance for Science & Technology Research in America, whose members include the National Association of Manufacturers, the Business Software Alliance and the American Chemical Society. It also enjoys the support of dozens of other organizations, companies, and individuals. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. WU. (HONORING THOR HESLA -- (House of Representatives - January 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. Madam Speaker, America has lost a great public servant. Thor Hesla died in Kabul, Afghanistan last night, a victim of the Taliban. 
   That Thor should pass at the hands of religious extremists is perhaps one of the great ironies of life because he was such a strong proponent of the humane, human virtues in life. He worked in tough places, tough jobs in America, in Kosovo, in Afghanistan, always promoting peace, democracy, and the general public welfare. He worked so many hard, dangerous jobs, and he was such a colorful person that he was larger than life. And I guess there are some of us who came to believe that the bullets would always go around him, and in his own particularly human way, Thor had become a touch immortal. 
   I owe him a deep debt of friendship and gratitude. He was my 1998 campaign manager, and we won a hard-fought campaign under his leadership. But that was the least of it. It was what he did afterwards. His friendship, his support, and his wise advice, which I was sometimes wise enough to accept, that was what for me set him apart and built our deep relationship. And I believe that there are hundreds of people across this country and perhaps thousands of people around the world who similarly feel this bond of friendship and this debt of gratitude to Thor. America and the world are better for his life and his work. 
   Earlier, I used the word ``victim'' in connection with Thor; and I misspoke, because Thor was no one's victim. He chose his life, he chose his work, and he chose Kabul. 
   Because of events earlier during the recess, I had an opportunity to speak with my son about life and its end. And while there are many ways to live well, to live a good life, there are few, if any, good ways to pass on. But if there are any, it is to pass on in the company of friends and family or to pass on for a cause. Now, Thor wasn't with his family in Atlanta or here in Washington, his sister, his brother-in-law, his nieces, or his parents; but he was with a family and a circle of friends, the family of those who care, the friends of those who care for others and who care to risk for others. He died in the cause of bringing some small measure of peace, prosperity, and democracy to those who are in dire need of those things. 
   So tonight we mourn, we remember, we celebrate the life of Thor Hesla. America has lost a fine public servant, but he is now a public servant for all  those in all the ages who care to remember those who care and sacrifice for others.

<DOCNO>Mr. WU. (IMPROVING HEAD START ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this legislation. 
   Head Start has proven its ability to improve the lives of disadvantaged children. Numerous studies have demonstrated that children who attend Head Start come to school more prepared than children who do not participate, and that these effects last over a period of years. 
   I have personal experience with the program--my wife, Michelle, was a Head Start teacher for 7 years in Oregon. In her classes, I saw the children of janitors and security guards. 
   Their parents worked in the sparkling towers of downtown Portland, but they themselves never got to visit downtown, except in their Head Start field trips. 
   The Improving Head Start Act makes several needed changes to current law. It ends the use of the National Reporting System--a flawed testing system that has tested over 500,000 4-year-olds, despite strong opposition by child development experts. 
   The bill also improves current law by making clear that Head Start agencies must establish and maintain a formal structure of shared governance with parent policy councils. This will codify in law that parents have the ability to shape and share a role in the success of their local Head Start program.  
   Finally, the bill authorizes $7.35 billion in funding for the program in FY08--an increase of over $400 million from this year's level. 
   Oregon's Department of Education reports that, as of January 2007, 43.2 percent of eligible children cannot participate in the program due to lack of funding. Head Start is a highly successful program, and it ultimately costs all of us when those eligible cannot participate.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. I thank the gentlewoman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule for consideration of H.R. 1868, the Technology Innovation and Manufacturing Stimulation Act of 2007. H.R. 1868 is a bill which will bolster innovation and our manufacturing base and enhance national economic competitiveness. 
   The bill was ordered reported by a unanimous vote of the Committee on Science and Technology on April 25, 2007. The bill puts the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, on a 10-year path to doubling as an investment in our innovation future. 
   H.R. 1868 is a comprehensive authorization bill for NIST's Scientific and Technical Research and Services, Industrial Technology Services and Construction Research Facilities accounts. NIST has not had a comprehensive authorization bill since 1992. 
   I want to highlight that H.R. 1868 is a bipartisan product of the Science and Technology Committee. I worked closely with Ranking Member Hall and with Dr. Gingrey. I want to thank Dr. Gingrey for coming to the floor and speaking on behalf of this bill and rule this morning. I worked closely with Dr. EHLERS in developing this legislation. They were original cosponsors of the bill. 
   We adopted several amendments at the subcommittee and full committee markup, and we have a stronger bill as a result of this bipartisan effort. 
   This bill has been endorsed by TechNet, the Alliance For Science & Technology Research in America, the American Small Manufacturers Coalition, the American Association of Universities, the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges and dozens of other organizations, companies and individuals. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee has crafted an appropriate rule, and I would urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. WU. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4137, HIGHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the rule and the conference report. This bill contains many excellent provisions that will help Oregon and, indeed, all American families better afford college. 
   For example, the legislation increases the Pell Grant from the current $5,800 per year ultimately to $9,000 per year, and it makes it available for year-round education. It streamlines the Federal student aid application process, restores integrity and accountability to the student loan industry, and encourages colleges to better manage tuition and price increases. 
   There are two provisions that I am particularly proud of and supportive of in the bill. One is a provision intended to make textbook prices more transparent and manageable. This is something that I have been working on for over 5 years. It provides students with advance information on textbook pricing so they can better plan for expenses before each term begins. It assists faculty by ensuring that they have complete information on textbook pricing before making purchase decisions, and it requires textbook publishers to provide combined or bundled educational products separately for purchase. 
   This bill also establishes a program for low-income Asian American students in title III of the bill. Through the new program, grants will be made available to eligible institutions where at least 10 percent of the student body is Asian American and low-income. And this will have a significant impact on the aspirations of all Americans, and this has been an aspiration of the Asian American community for a long time. 
   I strongly support this conference report and urge the other Members to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. WU. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. Fanaticism, George Santyana famously said, is ``redoubling your effort when you have forgotten your aim.'' 
   Let us measure our efforts against our aims in Iraq. After great effort, Saddam is dead. After long effort, we have established there are no WMD. We have eliminated Iraq as a threat to its neighbors. We have achieved the President's Iraq war aims. 
   Why are we sending 21,000 more troops there, rather than redeploying all our troops out of Iraq? Because we have forgotten our aims. Now we referee a civil war between the peoples of Iraq. The President admitted as much in his State of the Union, saying ``This is not the war we entered but the war that we are in.'' 
   The use of force resolution we passed in 2002 nowhere authorizes our participation in an Iraqi civil war. It has, therefore, expired. The President must come back to Congress for reauthorization if he wishes to war further in Iraq or to extend the war to Iran. 
   The fact that we are in a civil war is backed up by our own national intelligence estimate, as well as my conversations with soldiers who served, serve or who will serve in Iraq. 
   I share with you a typical comment: ``I joined the Army, and I will go as many times as they send me. But I will tell you what. These folks have been killing each other for 1,000 years. They are killing each other today and may kill each other for another thousand years. I just don't see what good we are doing there.'' 
   This loyal soldier deserves our support and our protection. 
   John Murtha's efforts to craft an emergency supplemental appropriations bill to protect our troops is commendable. No soldier should be repeatedly deployed to Iraq without being rested, retrained and ready. To do so otherwise is an abuse of our citizen soldiers. It is a criminal dereliction of duty. It is an abuse of power. 
   The Constitution gives Congress the express power to regulate the military. We must exercise this responsibility and stop the abuse of our troops by building thoughtful guidelines into our defense appropriations bills. 
   Some want us to believe that we must either stand aside and let the President have his way or use the blunt axe of cutting off all funding for the Iraq war. Not true. Not only does the Constitution give to Congress, not the President, the power and responsibility to regulate the military, there is ample precedent to support Congress's authority in wartime. 
   In the 19th century, Congress went so far as to require President Andrew Johnson to obtain the signature of General Ulysses S. Grant to any of the President's military orders before it could become valid. The President obeyed. 
   President Truman was forced in the Youngstown Steel case to recognize that his powers as Commander in Chief were severely limited when they undermined congressional decisions. Even though a steel strike seriously affected our ability to fight the Korean war, the Commander in Chief could not act independently of Nation's laws. 
   President Bush needs to learn that we are a Nation of laws and that no one in America is above the law. He needs to listen to the American people. He should heed our professional military, rather than shop for a convenient opinion. 
   The American people understand the challenges in Iraq are political and that no amount of military force can retrieve the situation. Only the Iraqis can solve the problems of Iraq. Our staying merely delays their day of full responsibility, and that is why this Iraqi government asked us not to escalate until, like our own generals, they were browbeaten into submission by President Bush. 
   We must end this war with a minimum of domestic recrimination, a maximum of motive and opportunity for the many peoples of Iraq to solve their own problems without genocide, one last chance to win the war in Afghanistan, the last known mailing address of Osama bin Laden, and we must begin the long task of rebuilding America's foreign policy on its traditional bipartisan basis. 
   We must forsake fanaticism and never forget our national aims. 
   My colleagues, this President has never had the authorization from Congress to enter a civil war in Iraq. Our mission is done. Bring the troops home.

<DOCNO>Mr. WU. (HONORING LOCAL AND STATE FIRST RESPONDERS, AND THE CITIZENS OF THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST IN FACING THE SEVERE WINTER STORM OF DECEMBER 2 AND 3, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. I thank the gentlelady. 
   Mr. Speaker, between December 1 and December 3, the States of Oregon and Washington were battered by an exceptionally severe storm. One wind measurement instrument clocked at 129 miles an hour before it blew over, and I am told by a helicopter pilot that the U.S. Coast Guard measured winds up to 150 miles an hour. This is the first time that the National Weather Service used the term ``hurricane'' in connection with a storm outside of the tropics or subtropics, certainly as far north as latitude 45 where we are. We set an unfortunate record. 
   We have frequent storms in the Pacific Northwest, but what set this one apart is that while the typical winter storm may bring winds of 70 or 100 miles an hour for a few hours to coastal Oregon, this storm brought sustained winds of 85 to 100 miles per hour for 24 hours and gusts up to 130, 150 miles an hour. Entire swaths of trees were uprooted or snapped off. Homes were flooded. Twelve to 14 inches of rain fell in a 24-hour period in some parts of the coast range, and both Interstate 5 and the main Amtrak line on the west coast were closed for a period of time. 
   The folks who live in the coast range and on the coast were especially hard hit. But we are a hardy people who live in this paradise, and people took care of themselves. They immediately reached out to their neighbors. They helped each other, pulled together as a community, and we got through this together. 
   Unfortunately, several people perished, many people were injured. And many people went without heat or electricity or telephone service, were cut off from the world and were cut off by landslides on the roads, also, in addition to the loss of communication. But people got through this together in the great tradition of America and the great tradition of the Northwest and of Oregon. 
   I would like to especially commend the local and State first responders, the Oregon National Guard, the United States Coast Guard, the Oregon Red Cross, and the good works of the State of Oregon in facing this very, very severe storm. Even during the torrential rain and the winds, the good citizens of Oregon and Washington came to one another's assistance. There are people who told me that they knew that someone was trapped in a home, and they went in to get them even though there were shingles and pieces of glass flying through the air hard enough to stick into the side of homes. And one person went into a home where a piece of sheet metal was flapping in the wind, knowing that if that sheet metal came off that it would become a dangerous projectile, but he went in to get the resident out. 
   City Councilor Mark Kujala of Warrenton stayed by the phones for 24 hours to take calls and answer calls so that people would not feel isolated and cut off, so that they could get some information. KMUN in Astoria, Oregon, because there was a severe storm a year ago, prepared for this by putting up a propane tank. And even though a tree fell on its roof and damaged the structure severely, KMUN stayed on the air all through the storm and gave the people of the north Oregon coast a sense of connection to what was happening in the outside world. And I want to commend the amateur radio operators, the folks who kept parts of the  local telephone system operating, and others, for keeping our communities together through the darkness, the cold, and the isolation when most of the phone lines went down. 
   The immediate efforts of first responders as well as local and State officials are to be applauded. And I want to express a special thanks to the U.S. Coast Guard. The Coast Guard lost all of their communication. They lost their Internet. They lost their telephones. They lost their cell phones. They were down to VHF radio, 1950s technology, to communicate with other first responders and themselves, and yet, they went out and picked people off the roofs, went into homes. One of the rescuers went into a home that was flooded up to chest level and the lights were still on in the room where this disabled individual was located, and yet this rescue swimmer went in there with the electricity on and got the person out and into a rescue helicopter. 
   The National Guard performed heroic efforts. Camp Rilea became a safety shelter, kind of a dry safe harbor for the people of the north coast. They distributed generator fuel to so many people who were trying to run their own generators when the power went down, and at one point they were down to their last 30, 60, 90 minutes of fuel. But then they got resupplied and were able to help continue to keep other folks' generators working. And the radio station in Seaside had their antenna blown down, but they got right back up the next day when it was safe to get the antenna back up and get a generator going and kept folks informed. 
   I have tried to work closely with Governor Kulongoski, and he has been terrific through this entire episode. It was a Sunday-Monday storm, and I couldn't get a phone call through to folk in the area until Wednesday night, but Governor Kulongoski toured the area Tuesday afternoon and was on the phone with me Tuesday afternoon to tell me some of the things that were needed. The Governor and I work hard to make sure that both the State and the Federal components of recovery and prevention for the future, that we do our jobs, that we have not too much government but all the government that we need to keep Americans safe, to enable us to pull together in times of crisis and need. 
   Life is uncertain in the paradise that we call the Pacific Northwest. It has sometimes been referred to as the land of fire and ice. We have regular storms, periodic fires, and rare huge earthquakes and tsunami. To paraphrase an author of the region: We are always searching for hardy people to match this challenging land. And I think that we do have those people. 
   Life in the paradise we call home may be uncertain, but we know that we are a match for it and we shall meet the challenges together. A long road of recovery lies ahead, but like the pioneers of old, we will bring everyone to the finish line together. No one will be left behind. No one will be forgotten. I want to salute the citizens of the Pacific Northwest, the first responders, and everyone else who came from the region to help out in our time of need. Thank you.

<DOCNO>Mr. WU. (SOWING THE SEEDS THROUGH SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 363, a piece of legislation that is desperately needed to enhance tomorrow's scientific research. 
   We all know what it's like to start out on our own--the uncertainty of your financial footing, but with great faith in yourself and your ideas. Imagine that feeling on an exponential scale and that might be how a young, talented researcher feels as they work on a cure for autism, or traumatic brain injury for our troops, or a new source of cleaner, renewable energy. 
   The field of research is high-risk and high-yield, and the federal government is right to invest in research that benefits us all. H.R. 363 will help ``sustain and strengthen the nation's traditional commitment to long-term basic research ..... to maintain the flow of new ideas that fuel the economy, provide security, and enhance the quality of life,'' as prescribed by the National Academies report, Rising Above the Gathering Storm, that has been the focus of our work in the Science and Technology Committee, and mentioned many times today. 
   Young researchers are the key to innovation, as they are more likely than established researchers to shift paradigms, break with tradition, or bring new ideas to a discipline or to a combination of disciplines. The early-career awards outlined in this bill reward young researchers for engaging in high-risk/high-reward research that is likely to be transformative or highly innovative. The establishment of a presidential innovation award is designed to identify and recognize people who develop the unique scientific and engineering innovations in the national interest at the time they occur. This bill doesn't simply seek to fund all science; it focuses on fostering the most innovative elements of the scientific enterprise. 
   I would also like to thank Chairman Gordon, as well as Ranking Member Hall, on their hard work on this legislation, and the bipartisan manner in which the Science and Technology Committee is run to produce such substantial legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 362, the 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act. 
   I would like to thank Chairman GORDON, as well as Ranking Member HALL, on their hard work on this legislation, and the bipartisan manner in which the Science and Technology Committee operates to produce such substantial legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, this legislation will come to the aid of America's need for more school teachers in our nation's classrooms. In their much referenced report, Rising Above the Gathering Storm, the National Academies found that 68 percent of U.S. 8th grade students received instruction from a mathematics teacher who did not hold a degree or certification in mathematics; in 2000, more than 85 percent of students in grades 5-9 were taught physical science by a teacher lacking a major or certification in the physical sciences. 
   Also, U.S. 15-year-olds ranked 24th out of 40 countries that participated in a 2003 administration of the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) examination, which assessed students' ability to apply mathematical concepts to real-world problems. These figures could spell disaster for America's competitiveness in the fields of science, technology and innovation. 
   By amending and expanding the Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program at the National Science Foundation (NSF) which will go to universities that build model programs for recruiting students into teaching, H.R. 362 will move us down the road to improving the strength of our math and science teachers, while actively recruiting new teachers. 
   Our future lies in our students, and their ability to think critically, and ask thoughtful, insightful questions lie in the strength of their schooling. The un-bias nature of scientific inquiry and the natural beauty of math help students build their questioning and logic skills. 
   It is imperative that our students are taught by teachers whose strengths lie in conveying these concepts and inspiring young minds not only to go into the science and technology fields, but also to open their minds to be inquisitive in the world.

<DOCNO>Mr. WU. (BAINBRIDGE ISLAND JAPANESE AMERICAN MONUMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 161, to expand the Minidoka Internment National Monument to include the Nidoto Nai Yoni Memorial, which commemorates the Japanese Americans of Bainbridge Island, the Japanese Americans of Bainbridge Island, Washington, who were interned during World War II. 
   On February 19, 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt signed an executive order which forcibly removed approximately 120,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry from their homes, their friends, and their communities. They were incarcerated by this government for their ancestry. Just over 1 month after the executive order was signed, 227 Bainbridge island men, women, and children were sent to internment camps. They were the very first Japanese American families in the United States to be incarcerated. 
   We in the Pacific Northwest would like to think that we live in a better part of the country, in a part of the country where things are the way they ought to be. But sometimes the way we want things to be is not the way things happen or reality. Because these Japanese Americans were taken from their homes in the heart of the Puget Sound. They were sailed to Seattle. They were loaded onto trains for a 3-day journey to Manzanar, a concentration camp in California's Mojave Desert. These Americans were the very first Americans to be so detained, and the last of the detainees were not released until October of 1946, 4 1/2 years after the signing of the executive order and over a year after the end of World War II. 
   But this chapter of our history did not end there. Upon release from the internment camps, Japanese Americans could not return to the lives that they had led before the tragic and misled executive order. I would like to submit further information about General DeWitt's decisions and recommendations, and I will do that at a different time, but during the period of internment, they had lost their homes, their businesses, and their livelihoods. 
   By commemorating Japanese Americans who were so detained, we ensure that this sad episode in our history will never be forgotten and hopefully not repeated, because we need to learn from the mistakes of the past. 
   Thirty years passed before the executive order was formally rescinded in 1976. In 1988, a Presidential apology was issued internees. 
   This is not an abstraction. This is not a theoretical debate. The Military Commissions Act passed by this Congress on September 30, 2006, potentially puts American citizens at risk of military detention. That is a plain reading of the Military Commissions Act. It was hotly debated between the then chairmen of two committees and this Member. It has been commented upon to a limited extent in the national press. 
   But I think that a fair reading of the Military Commissions Act would show you that if a person is just walking down the street and is detained by military authority for whatever reason, and we are not talking about aliens in Afghanistan, we are talking about someone walking down the streets of Portland, Oregon, or in Bainbridge Island. What could potentially happen to that person? 
   The better course under the Military Commissions Act is that they are subject to military justice, a very limited review by a military tribunal, and the end of that appeal road is the Secretary of Defense. That is actually the better course. 
   Now, I have to point out that there are 25 detainees in Guantanamo who, after 5 years of detention, have not had their first review yet; and I say that is the better course because the course that is actually more troubling under the Military Commissions Act is that if there is not a review, there is no appeal. There is no appeal to a civilian court. There is no habeas corpus, a doctrine which has served Anglo American societies well for almost a thousand years. 
   This memorial, which H.R. 161 helps us remember, is not an abstraction. It was real suffering for the Japanese Americans, for the Americans who were incarcerated. But it is also a reminder that, as was said of the executive order much later, when actions are taken by this government in an atmosphere of hysteria, great injustices can be perpetrated; and we need to be careful in our era lest we be put in a position to issue an apology decades from now.  
   Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii passed under martial law, the writ of habeas corpus was suspended, and the military police took several hundred suspected spies and saboteurs of Japanese extraction into custody. But the very size of the Japanese community in Hawaii (nearly half the territory's population), and its vital importance to the islands' economy, foreclosed any thought of wholesale evacuation. The mainland community, however, was proportionately much smaller (in California, barely 1 percent of the population), more economically marginal and socially isolated, and long buffeted by racist pressures. The mainland Japanese for the most part kept warily to themselves, many of them toiling with exemplary efficiency on their family fruit and vegetable farms. Insular and quiescent, they were also internally riven by age and legal status. Their elders, the forty thousand first-generation immigrant Japanese, or Issei, were generally over the age of fifty and debarred from citizenship by the Immigration Restriction Act of 1924, a statutory impediment that perversely exposed them to the accusation that as non-citizens they were poorly assimilated into American society. A majority of their children, the eighty thousand second-generation Nisei, were under the age of eighteen. Born in the United States, they were also citizens. Alien and citizen alike, the peculiarly vulnerable Pacific Coast Japanese community was about to feel the full wrath of war-fueled hysteria. 
   Curiously, no clamor for wholesale reprisals against the mainland Japanese arose in the immediate aftermath of the Pearl Harbor attack. The Los Angeles Times soberly editorialized on December 8 that most of the Japanese on the Coast were ``good Americans, born and educated as such,'' and serenely foresaw that there would be ``no riots, no mob law.'' General John L. DeWitt, chief of the army's Western Defense Command, at first dismissed loose talk of mass evacuations as ``damned nonsense.'' He condemned any broadside assaults on the rights of the American-born Nisei. ``An American citizen, after all, is an American citizen,'' he declared. Individual arrests were another matter. Government surveillance, ongoing since 1935, had identified some two thousand potentially subversive persons in the Japanese community. Along with fourteen thousand German and Italian security risks nationwide, they were quietly rounded up in the last days of 1941. But those individual detentions stopped well short of wholesale incarcerations. ``I was determined,'' Attorney General Francis Biddle wrote, ``to avoid mass internment, and the persecution of aliens that had characterized the First World War.'' 
   In fact, the immigrants whose loyalty had been questioned during World War I had then been freshly arrived and seemed to many observers unarguably alien. But by 1941 those older European groups were settled communities, well assimilated, their patriotism as well as their political loyalty actively cultivated by Roosevelt's New Deal. Though a surprising six hundred thousand Italians--more than 10 percent of the entire Italian-American community--remained Italian citizens and were automatically labeled ``enemy aliens'' after Mussolini's declaration of war, Roosevelt instructed Biddle to cancel that designation in a joyfully received announcement at Carnegie Hall, shrewdly delivered on Columbus Day 1942, just weeks before the congressional elections. 
   The Japanese were not so fortunate. As war rumors took wing in the weeks following Pearl Harbor, sobriety gave way to anxiety,  then to a rising cry for draconian action against the Japanese on the West Coast. Inflammatory and invariably false reports of Japanese attacks on the American mainland flashed through coastal communities. Eleanor Roosevelt's airplane, en route to Los Angeles on the evening of the Pearl Harbor attack, was grounded in the Midwest while the first lady telephoned Washington to check a radio message that San Francisco was under bombardment. Painters at Stanford University blacked out the skylight of the library's main reading room so that it could not serve as a beacon to enemy pilots. Carpenters hammered up dummy aircraft plants in Los Angeles to decoy Japanese bombers away from the real factories. Athletic officials moved the traditional New Year's Day football classic from the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California; the game was played instead in North Carolina, presumably safe from Japanese attack. Japan's astonishing string of victories in the Pacific further unsettled American public opinion. Hong Kong fell on December 2, Manila on January 2, Singapore on January 25. 
   The release at the end of January of a government investigation of the Pearl Harbor attack proved the decisive blow. The report, prepared by Supreme Court Justice Owen J. Roberts, alleged without documentation that Hawaii-based espionage agents, including Japanese-American citizens, had abetted Nagumo's strike force. Two days later, DeWitt reported ``a tremendous volume of public opinion now developing against the Japanese of all classes, that is aliens and non-aliens.'' DeWitt himself, described by Biddle as having a ``tendency to reflect the views of the last man to whom he talked,'' soon succumbed to Rumor's siren. He wildly declared to an incredulous Justice Department official that every ship sailing out of the Columbia had been attacked by submarines guided by clandestine radio operators near the river's mouth. When evidence of actual attacks failed to materialize, DeWitt invoked the tortured logic that the very absence of any sabotage activity on the West Coast proved the existence of an organized, disciplined conspiracy in the Japanese community, cunningly withholding its blow until it could be struck with lethal effect. In February the respected columnist Walter Lippmann alleged that military authorities had evidence of radio communications between ``the enemy at sea and enemy agents on land''--a charge that FBI director J. Edgar Hoover had already advised Biddle was utterly without foundation. A radio technician from the Federal Communications Commission reviewed DeWitt's ``evidence'' of electronic signals and declared it hogwash. All 760 of DeWitt's suspicious radio transmissions could be accounted for, and not one involved espionage. ``Frankly,'' the technician concluded, ``I have never seen an organization [the U.S. Army's Western Defense Command] that was so hopeless to cope with radio intelligence requirements. The personnel is unskilled and untrained. Most are privates who can read only ten words a minute. ..... It's pathetic to say the least.'' 
   But by this time facts were no protection against the building gale of fear and prejudice. ``Nobody's constitutional rights,'' Lippmann magisterially intoned, ``include the right to reside and do business on a battlefield.'' Lippmann's colleague Westbrook Pegler echoed him less elegantly a few days later: ``The Japanese in California should be under armed guard to the last man and woman right now,'' Pegler wrote in his widely read column, ``and to hell with habeas corpus until the danger is over.'' Unapologetically racist voices also joined the chorus. ``We're charged with wanting to get rid of the Japs for selfish reasons,'' a leader of California's Grower-Shipper Vegetable Association declared. ``We might as well be honest. We do. It's a question of whether the white man lives on the Pacific Coast or the brown man.'' Prodded by such sentiments, in early February 1942 DeWitt officially requested authority to remove all Japanese from the West Coast. It was impossible he claimed, to distinguish the loyal from the disloyal in the peculiarly alien and inscrutable Japanese community. The only remedy was wholesale evacuation. The same man who had said a month earlier, ``An American citizen, after all, is an American citizen,'' now announced, ``A Jap's a Jap. ..... It makes no difference whether he is an American citizen or not. ..... I don't want any of them.'' 
   At the Justice Department several officials, including conspicuously Edward J. Ennis, director of the Alien Enemy Control Unit, as well as Biddle's assistant James H. Rowe, struggled to quell this irrationally mounting fury. Rowe denounced Lippmann and Pegler as ``Armchair Strategists and Junior G-Men'' whose reckless charges came ``close to shouting FIRE! in the theater; and if race riots occur, these writers will bear a heavy responsibility.'' Attorney General Biddle informed Secretary of War Stimson ``that the Department of Justice would not under any circumstances evacuate American citizens.'' But at a fateful meeting in the living room of the attorney general's Washington home on the evening of February 17, the gentle and scholarly Biddle buckled. Facing off against Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy and two army officers, Ennis and Rowe argued heatedly that DeWitt's request for evacuation orders should be denied. Unknown to his two subordinates, however, Biddle, new to the cabinet, unsure of his standing with Roosevelt, and overawed by the Olympian figure of Stimson, had told the secretary of war by telephone earlier in the day that he would not oppose DeWitt's recommendation. When this became clear, Rowe remembered, ``I was so mad that I could not speak. ..... Ennis almost wept.'' Even Stimson had grave misgivings. ``The second generation Japanese can only be evacuated,'' he wrote in his diary, ``either as part of a total evacuation, giving access to the areas only by permits, or by frankly trying to put them out on the ground that their racial characteristics are such that we cannot understand or even trust the citizen Japanese. This latter is the fact but I am afraid it will make a tremendous hole in our constitutional system to apply it.'' Despite his own reservations and the sputtering opposition of the Justice Department officials, Stimson advised the president that DeWitt should be authorized to proceed. The cabinet devoted only a desultory discussion to the matter. On February 19 Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066. It directed the War Department to ``prescribe military areas ..... from which any and all persons may be excluded.'' No explicit reference to the Japanese was necessary. When Biddle feebly objected that the order was ``ill-advised, unnecessary, and unnecessarily cruel,'' Roosevelt silenced him with the rejoinder: ``[T]his must be a military decision.''

   Mr. WU. Madam Speaker, I, for one, welcome this opportunity to engage in a debate with my friends across the aisle about who truly stands with the American consumer versus standing with Big Oil. 
   Over the weekend, the average price for a gallon of gas hit $4 per gallon. It's $4.50 per gallon at the pump closest to this debate. These outrageous prices are taking their toll on all of us, and the average American driver now pays more than $2,200 per year for gasoline, up from about $1,400 a year in 2001 at the beginning of the Bush administration. 
   Since January 2007, when this Democratic Congress came into the majority, we have been committed to changing the Nation's energy policy so we can lower prices at the pump. Last year, this Democratic Congress passed the landmark law that will make cars and trucks more efficient, which will eventually save American families somewhere between $700 to $1,000 each year. We have followed this up this year by passing bills cracking down on price gouging by Big Oil.

<DOCNO>Mr. WU. (MARKING THE 225TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TREATY OF PARIS OF 1783 -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his many kindnesses. 
   Thomas Jefferson once said that ``no two countries upon Earth have so many points of common interest and friendship'' as the United States and the United Kingdom. Indeed, our two nations share values, traditions and a common commitment to democracy, human rights and the rule of law. 
   I introduced House Resolution 1063 to mark the 225th anniversary of our diplomatic relationship with the United Kingdom, which began with the signing of the Treaty of Paris of 1783. This treaty formalized the peace between the United States and Great Britain following our Revolutionary War. 
   In September of 1782, Benjamin Franklin, along with fellow peace commissioners John Adams and John Jay, began formal negotiations for an end to hostilities between Great Britain and the de facto independent United States of America. 
   After 2 months of negotiation, Britain and France and the United States reached a preliminary peace agreement. The following September, the parties met in Paris and signed what would become known as the Treaty of Paris of 1783. Since that time, Britain and the United States have come to be friends, allies and economic partners, a relationship that advances, enriches and inspires both sides of the Atlantic. 
   As with all old sayings, it is the exception which proves the rule. For the old saying that great powers have only interests, not friends, the relationship between the United States of America and the United Kingdom is the exception which proves the rule. 
   Recently I joined several of my colleagues in Congress and with members of the British Parliament for extensive discussions. It was a productive and thought-provoking exchange of ideas. I believe we can learn much from the experience of our British counterparts. One example would be dealing with the challenge of global climate change. 
   I also believe our own knowledge and expertise can be of continued value to our friends in the United Kingdom. One example of that would be their expressed interest in the Death with Dignity Law which we passed in the State of Oregon. 
   After two centuries, we can still learn from each other, prosper together, and jointly promote a better world. 
   So it is fitting that we should mark with special approbation the 225th anniversary of the treaty that began our relations with the United Kingdom as independent States. For over two centuries, our two nations have stood together in peace and war, in prosperity and hardship. Together we have faced two world wars, the Great Depression, the Cold War, terrorism, and triumphs and tragedies too numerous to recount. 
   Please join me in marking the genesis of our diplomatic relationship with the United Kingdom by supporting House Resolution 1063. I thank the Speaker of the House for the House consideration of this resolution today, and I urge swift passage of H.R. 1063.

   Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, and some of the things I  want to talk about are personal and some are of a public policy nature. 
   I never cease to admire the courage of my parents in bringing our family to this country, to a new country, a new language, a new culture. And interestingly enough, I have never been really able to say that to them in person across the kitchen table, and it's easier for me to say it right here on the House floor. 
   There are other lessons that are important, and one of them has been referred to earlier, the internment of the Japanese Americans during World War II. It is not an old, cold, dead issue. We passed the Military Commissions Act just before the 2006 elections. It substantially restricted habeas corpus for all Americans. And just as we apologize to Japanese Americans for the internment during World War II, someday we'll be apologizing for actions taken under the Military Commissions Act. 
   So some of the lessons learned from the Asian Pacific American experience are positive ones, and others are cautionary ones that we should continue to remember.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Technology and Innovation Subcommittee and a cosponsor of the bill, I rise in support of H.R. 2850, the Green Chemistry Research and Development Act of 2007. I want to commend Dr. Gingrey for his work on this bill. 
   Partnerships with universities, non-profits, industry and the Federal Government are important for the chemical industry's success. The transfer of technology from federally funded research to industry helps promote innovation, which helps the United States remain competitive in a global economy. 
   Federal support of green chemistry can produce many benefits. First, companies will be able to produce more products less harmful to humans and the environment. Second, businesses will benefit from the facilitation of green chemistry research by the Federal Government and the subsequent transfer of technology to the private sector. 
   This bill presents opportunities to reduce impact on the environment while assisting our domestic industry to find new products through innovation. 
   Recently, Columbia Forest Products, a company in my district, received an award for an innovation in green chemistry. The company produces interior plywood products. In collaboration with Oregon State University, Columbia Forest Products has created a soy-based product to use for its production of plywood, instead of traditional urea-formaldehyde resin. 
   H.R. 2850 will help create more opportunities for universities and companies to partner in green chemistry innovation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. WU. Madam Chairman, this year's farm bill creates an education program to give college students an opportunity to participate in policy oriented internships to promote and further develop agricultural biofuels from biomass. I commend the Chairman for incorporating this program into the bill. 
   The biofuel industry has experienced rapid growth in recent years. Global climate change, and an unstable foreign oil supply, requires the United States to develop alternative energies. To do this, the United States must create leaders in alternative energies. We must recruit the best and brightest across the Nation to participate in the program. 
   My amendment makes the eligibility criteria fair and opens the door for more qualified students to apply. 
   As currently written, the program reaches only five specific states. It is important that Congress does not shut out qualified universities and students. 
   My amendment would expand the program to qualified universities that have fields of study related to the biomass and biofuel industry. Schools with programs in chemistry, environmental sciences, bioengineering, natural resources and public policy would be eligible to participate in the internship program. 
   This amendment will not add any additional cost to the bill; it will only make the internship more competitive. 
   Congress needs to provide all students who are studying relevant fields the opportunity to gain practical work experience and to contribute to America's move to greater energy security. As we continue toward that goal, this program will prove invaluable. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. Mr. Chairman. I would like to commend my new colleague from Texas, the Chairman of the Energy and Environment Subcommittee, Mr. LAMPSON for his great work on this bill, and also Chairman GORDON for his leadership on alternative fuels. 
   We rely on fuel everyday. While the market is awakening to its ability to sell alternative fuels like E85 or biodiesel blends many of these new fuels have compatibility issues with the existing delivery systems in place in America. Fuel depots, fuel pipelines, fuel trucks and local gas stations are not truly ready to ship, store, or sell these fuels to consumers. 
   These fuels can cause corrosion of tanks and pipelines, clog filters, and pose danger of thermal and oxidative instability. The cost of replacing or building new infrastructure is sometimes infeasible for fuel suppliers, frequently small business owners. 
   H.R. 547, The Advanced Fuels Infrastructure Research and Development Act, meets the needs of fuel shippers and suppliers so they can I use alternative fuels in existing infrastructure. It directs the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to research and develop new technologies and methods such as fuel additives, blend stocks, and easier tank reconditioning methods that would allow fuel retailers, shippers, and storers to use alternative fuels in existing infrastructure, significantly reducing costs both for businesses and consumers. 
   The bill also directs the DOE and NIST to develop affordable, portable, quick and accurate ways to test the sulfur content at pump stations to make sure it complies with EPA regulations of 15ppm, and directs NIST to develop a physical properties data base and a set of standard reference materials for alternative fuels, which is not unlike the ones that currently exist for standard fuels. 
   If we are truly serious about bringing alternative fuels to consumers, we need to make sure that we can store, deliver, and retail these fuels with the same efficiency and safety as we deliver traditional fuels. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 547, and again want to recognize the leadership of Chairman LAMPSON and GORDON for bringing this important legislation through the Science and Technology Committee, and Speaker PELOSI for bringing this legislation to the floor as part of her efforts to stem global warming.

This May marks the 29th time that America has recognized and celebrated the many contributions and achievements of Asian Pacific Americans. 
   America has reached greatness in part by the accumulation of ideas from those with varied heritage and backgrounds. In particular, Asian Pacific Americans have made profound contributions to the arts, education, science, technology, politics and athletics. Asian Pacific Americans have played an active and crucial role in the development of the United States, from linking the coasts of the nation with the transcontinental railroad to bringing the world closer through development of the latest Internet technology. 
   This year, Congress will be debating and voting to reauthorize No Child Left Behind and the Higher Education Act. As a member of the Education and Labor Committee as well as the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, I am working hard to ensure that the Asian Pacific American community not only has a seat at the table of these debates, but also a strong voice to shape the national conversation. 
   The Asian Pacific American community remains and always will be an integral and vibrant part of American society. As we take part in the celebration of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, I urge everyone to participate more deeply in the civic life of our nation. Asian Pacific American civic engagement will help to define our collective future and ensure that we move forward with determination and unity. Let us work together to build bridges and strengthen our great nation's diverse communities.  
   I encourage Congress and the American people to spend the month of May absorbing the legacy, culture and achievements of the Asian Pacific American community.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. I thank the gentleman from Arizona. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the creation of a Columbia-Pacific National Heritage Area. I have worked closely with my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Baird), to introduce H.R. 407 to study the feasibility of a national heritage area at the mouth of the Columbia River between Oregon and Washington. 
   Like the river itself, the journey to get to where we are has been lengthy. In 2001, I took the initial steps with Mr. Baird and with the help of the National Resources Committee and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Souder), and we were able to expand Fort Clatsop National Historic Monument and extend it to the sea. 
   Next, Congressman Baird and I together created Oregon's and Washington's newest national park, the Lewis and Clark National and State Historical Parks. No one person could have accomplished the many steps to this point. I thank the hard work of the Natural Resources Committee, Congressmen Baird and Souder, Oregon State Senator Betsy Johnson and former park superintendent Chip Jenkins. 
   I would especially like to thank all of the local citizens, such as Astoria's Cindy Mudge who has put tremendous time and effort into the heritage area. The history that shaped this part of our Nation should be preserved and celebrated. 
   Here, where the Columbia, the great river of the West, meets the ocean, strong men and women have left their indelible imprint for millennia. Native cultures, such as the Clatsop Nehalem, Chinook and other Indian tribes, were joined by the Spanish, Russians and British. Lewis and Clark began an American tie to the river, and Americans of diverse descent, including Americans of Scandinavian, Chinese and other heritages, together built the history of the region. 
   This is the way that America was or should be, a close-knit community where everyone, from the Indians to Lewis and Clark to Scandinavians to Chinese, were and are welcome; where work, and not parentage, determines one's worth. 
   From forestry to fisheries, the land and waters have provided. Today, human hands provide for the future. We are trying to build a college to help create the education and research-based economy of the future. Here also are the helping hands of the Columbia River bar pilots who since 1846 have guided ships across the Columbia River bar, and the United States Coast Guard, who faithfully protect local and international commerce on the roughest, toughest water in the world. 
   The mouth of the Columbia River presents layers of history and culture like an ancient buried city, except that the river rolls on today. Unlike the Hudson or the Mississippi, we do not have a large city at the river's mouth to preserve its stories and heritage; an act of Congress shall do so. 
   I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 407 and note that the opposition which has been expressed comes from an organization which is not within the historic study area.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2272 is the culmination of a year-and-a-half-long bipartisan effort by members of the Science and Technology Committee to pass a package of competitiveness bills in response to recommendations in the 2005 National Academy of Sciences report, Rising Above the Gathering Storm. H.R. 2272, the 21st Century Competitiveness Act of 2007, is simply a package of five bills, each of which already has passed the House of Representatives by an overwhelming majority over the last 2 months. 
   We created a single bill as a basis for initiating discussions with the other Chamber on a comprehensive competitiveness bill that we could send to the President for his signature this year. 
   The five bills rolled into H.R. 2272 are H.R. 362, the 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act; H.R. 363, the Sowing the Seeds through Science and Engineering Research Act; H.R. 1867, the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2007; H.R. 1868, the Technology Innovation and Manufacturing Stimulation Act of 2007; and H.R. 1068, to amend the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991. 
   I want to thank Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall of the Science and Technology Committee for their bipartisan leadership on this bill and, in particular, on the 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act. 
   I also want to thank the ranking member of the Technology and Innovation Subcommittee, Mr. Gingrey, and the Chair and ranking member of the Research and Science Education Subcommittee, Mr. Baird and Mr. Ehlers, for all of their hard work on the NIST and NSF bills. 
   I also want to thank all of the members of the Science and Technology Committee on both sides of the aisle for their contributions to these bills and for helping to move every one of them expeditiously and unanimously through the committee. 
   I especially want to thank the staff of the Science and Technology Committee on the majority side, Jim Wilson, Dahlia Sokolov, Colin McCormick, Mike Quear and our chief of staff, Chuck Atkins; on the minority side, Amy Carroll and Mele Williams. And  my friend from the other side may have additional names to add to that list. 
   Let me spend just a moment reminding my colleagues why we introduced this bill and why we urge support today. 
   In 2005, the National Academies assembled a blue-ribbon committee of national leaders in academia, business and government to address concerns about national prosperity in the global economy of the 21st century. The Academies' report was titled Rising Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future. 
   That report cataloged a number of worrisome indicators about the U.S. position in an increasingly competitive world and provided recommendations to enable the Nation to maintain its competitiveness. The core recom-mendations are as follows: Recruit and train highly qualified science and math teachers; sustain and strengthen the Nation's traditional commitment to long-term, basic research; make the United States the most attractive setting in which to study and perform research so that we can develop, recruit and retain the best and brightest minds; ensure that the U.S. is the premier place in the world in which to innovate. 
   The bill before us today goes a long way in addressing all of those recommendations. 
   H.R. 2272 puts and keeps the National Science Foundation and the NIST research labs on a 10-year path to doubling their projects. 
   The bill helps to train thousands of new teachers and provide current teachers with content and pedagogical expertise in their area of teaching. 
   The bill expands programs to enhance the undergraduate education of our future science and engineering workforce. 
   The bill expands early career grant programs for outstanding young investigators at both the NSF and the Department of Energy. 
   The bill strengthens interagency planning and coordination for research infrastructure and information technology. 
   Mr. Speaker, in this increasingly competitive world, where jobs are rapidly being outsourced and we are importing more high-tech products than we are exporting, now is the time to act. Now is the time to strengthen our support for the creativity, innovation and talented workforce that makes the United States unique and gives us our edge. 
   The day our universities are no longer the most sought after in the world, the day we see a brain drain because our best and brightest young scientists and entrepreneurs can't get the funding to do their research and technology development here at home, the day that our innovation is outsourced, that is the day that truly concerns me. 
   H.R. 2272 is a key piece of the innovation agenda to make sure that that day never comes. It has the support of many businesses, professional associations and higher education groups and has already been passed in its five pieces by an overwhelming majority of Members of the House on both sides of the aisle. 
   Mr. Speaker, I once again want to thank Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall and all the members of the Science and Technology Committee for their hard work on this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2272. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. WU. (NATIONAL NANOTECHNOLOGY INITIATIVE AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. I thank the gentleman and the chairman for his leadership on this issue and for the bipartisan manner in which this bill has come to the floor, and rise in strong support of the National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2008. It is very, very fitting that we are continuing efforts to support nanotechnology research and development given the economic and societal benefits that we are just beginning to realize. 
   Federally funded research and development has long served an important purpose in our economy, spurring the creation of new services, new products, and, most importantly, new jobs. The new products and technologies that are often the byproducts of basic research enhance our daily lives in many, many ways. It is estimated that the fruits of nanotechnology research will have a multi-trillion dollar impact on our economy within the next several years. 
   The bill before us today provides the seed corn for an industry that will be a crucial part of our future economic success and competitiveness. My home State of Oregon is a leader in nanotechnology. The Oregon Nanoscience and Microtechnologies Institute, ONAMI, is a public-private partnership that supports academic research and technology transfer of nanoscience. Research supported by ONAMI has already yielded companies that are developing a low-cost method of removing heavy metals to purify water, new manufacturing technologies, and a system to allow patients with kidney disease to undergo dialysis at home. Continued support of nanotechnology research allow these and other breakthrough technologies to come to market. 
   I want to cite a couple specific key provisions, including provisions relating to green nanotechnologies and those that encourage the commercialization of nanotechnology research. 
   Several institutions in the State of Oregon have been leaders in green nanotechnology research. These funds will help these universities and others explore ways to create environmentally friendly or at least benign nanotechnology products. And this is very, very crucial to acceptance of nanotech. 
   In addition, there are provisions in this bill that encourage other Federal programs to support commercialization of nanotechnology research to help turn research insights into tangible useful results. Congress has already passed legislation to support programs that advance our innovation agenda, and it is fitting that nanotechnology would be funded by these programs. The relevant programs include the Technology Innovation Program, or TIP, which provides grants to companies and universities conducting high-risk, high reward research, and the Small Business Innovative Research and Small Business Technology Transfer programs, which provide funds to small high-tech firms conducting innovative research that is relevant to Federal agencies' missions and that may have significant commercialization potential. 
   Again, I want to commend Chairman Gordon and the ranking member for drafting a strong bipartisan bill, and urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

And yet the Republican response is, drill that 4 percent; it will solve our problems. We have 4 percent of the world's oil reserves. Drill  the reserve and that will solve our problems. The numbers are the numbers.

<DOCNO>Mr. WU. (PUBLIC LAND COMMUNITIES TRANSITION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. I rise in strong support of H.R. 3058, and I want to thank my good friend and colleague, Mr. DeFazio, for his hard work and tireless work on this issue. 
   Almost exactly 100 years ago, Congress passed a law creating a partnership with rural counties with a high percentage of Federal land, and Congress realized that because the Federal lands were off-limits to the counties for development and they would never contribute to the tax base, that these counties should be compensated for permanent loss of any tax revenues. The law allowed a percentage of the revenue produced from Federal land resources to be returned to the county. Counties were then able to use these funds for public safety, public schools, and public roads. 
   Over the years, because of changes in Federal forest policy, the revenue for Federal lands has decreased and Federal lands are still off limits for development, and this leads many counties in the American West with dramatic decreases in the tax base. 
   In 2000, we passed the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act in order to provide a stable base of funding to the affected counties. But that act has not been reauthorized and the Federal payments are scheduled to end June 30. This is a very, very serious issue in Oregon and across the American West, where counties have already, in preparation for this date, in preparation for future budgets, begun to issue pink slips. They have issued pink slips to police, firefighters, teachers, and other essential personnel. It is not an exaggeration to say that Oregonians may have their lives endangered because of these cuts, if they take place. 
   The bill that my good friend and colleague from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) has submitted would provide an extension of payments through fiscal 2011 to counties that previously received these payments. And to maintain fiscal responsibility, the bill is fully paid for with offsets, and it reduces payments to counties by 15 percent each year, asking all to make sacrifices.

<DOCNO>Mr. WU. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WU. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and of the conference report. 
   I was honored to serve on the conference committee. It was a good team effort. And as anyone in team sports knows, it takes a good offense and a good defense to make a good team. This bill takes important steps toward building a good defense, and good defense today is more important than ever because our offense has miscarried so badly. 
   There we were pursuing Osama bin Laden literally to the ends of the Earth, to Tora Bora, when this administration steered us off that course and into the cul-de-sac of Iraq. 
   This bill will build a better defense because we need it more than ever. We need this bill not just as legislation but as a reminder to carry forth with the oversight that this Congress has traditionally exerted. 
   The jurisdiction of my subcommittee and of the Homeland Security Committee over the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office is more crucial than ever as that body chooses technologies to protect this Nation going forward. 
   Eternal vigilance is the call for the day, and I am committed to exerting that vigilance going forward from this day.
