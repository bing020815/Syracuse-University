<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. The President offers a very simple Medicare fix: Seniors pay more. Taking a bigger cut from our seniors and our disabled individuals for their drug benefit premiums is hardly a true fix. 
   You know, down in Texas, Mr. Speaker, we have steers that have been cut. They've been fixed. They've been fixed for all time, and that's the kind of fix that I think these Republicans have in mind for Medicare. 
   Contrast the President's fix on Medicare this week with the President's veto on Medicare last week. These Republicans are so eager to privatize Medicare, they're willing to spend $1,000 of taxpayers' money every year for every person that they can get to leave traditional Medicare. By our overriding the President's veto, we saved billions of dollars in unnecessary waste. But there are tens of billions of dollars of additional waste right there in the system. And you know what? They deserve a Texas-type fix. They need to be fixed and removed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. The Medicare actuary's own reports show that that this $1,000 waste per person per year that the Republicans insist on, that kind of waste, tens of billions of dollars of waste, does not produce any quantifiable benefit, any quantifiable saving  through this failed Republican experiment in privatizing Medicare. 
   Improving Medicare's finances requires more than a trigger like the President talks about to extend it for a year. We need a willingness to pull the trigger on Medicare waste that these Republicans have plugged in with these unnecessary subsidies that cost more and deliver less. 
   I say it has something to do with the energy bill, and they're right. These seniors have been drilled by the Republicans for the last 7 1/2 years. Drill here, drill now. These seniors get drilled when they go to the gas station. They get drilled when they go to the grocery store. What this resolution is about is preventing the President from drilling them on their Medicare also. 
   Let's approve this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. DOGGETT. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, while the Bush Administration's reaction to  the economic downturn was to continue whistling ``Don't Worry, Be Happy,'' we were at work on a prompt response. But today's stimulus is far less effective than it could have been and should have been because those who doubted that we needed to do anything insisted on supporting only action that would give one of every $3 to corporate America and would delay until this summer giving any assistance to ordinary working families. 
   And now there is even an effort to add tax cut rebates to this bill for multi-millionaires. That is hardly ``stimulus'' unless they decide to increase their tips to the butler or the limousine driver. 
   Although the risk of recession is very real and it requires a bipartisan response, let's be very clear: this danger did not result from any bipartisan cause. 
   Like the Republican mythology that tax cuts pay for themselves, this downturn had its genesis in the wrongheaded notion that markets can do no evil, whether the subject is environmental protection or economic stability. They think the only desirable action is for the government to get out of the way. Well, the Bush Administration got way out of the way, and as a result we had overzealous lending and sometimes fraud in the subprime market while the Bush Administration stood by. 
   We wouldn't need a $150 billion stimulus today if they had done their job. Whatever we do here, it can still be a stimulus without letting go of the pay-as-you-go rule and adding to our soaring national debt. 
   Borrowing too much is what helped create this Bush economic mess. Borrowing even more can make it even worse. Political expedience should not trump sound fiscal policy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, this resolution has rightly earned a place on this uncontested Suspension Calendar. So long as it is not misinterpreted as suggesting that Congress supports a long-term troop presence in Iraq, it merely generates another report that does no harm and not any significant good. 
   We know that, in addition to the blood of the brave, President Bush is hemorrhaging money as fast as he can get it, $3 billion every single month, building toward a price tag of $1 to $2 trillion on this tragedy. 
   The Senate version of Senators Kerry and Clinton has a better approach in demanding cost estimates on each alternative redeployment and in asking that one of these redeployments occur by the end of next year. 
   Our problem in Iraq is not a lack of reports, but a lack of the collective will in this Congress to initiate the change in course that President Bush will never undertake on his own. And I hope we have the courage of our troops, the courage to take that action as soon as possible.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, most folks think of ``CAFE'' as a place to eat. Well, our cars and our trucks have been eating too much energy and emitting too much pollution for far too long, while our planet and our pocketbooks take a beating. Fuel efficiency standards have not been increased since 1975 when Paul Simon began singing ``Still Crazy After All These Years.''     
   Well, it is still crazy that 32 years later fuel economy standards have not been increased and we cannot get more miles per gallon despite both our dangerous overdependence on foreign oil and the growing threat of global warming. We need 21st-century fuel economy standards for 21st-century vehicles. And thanks to this bill, many of those vehicles will be fuel-efficient, plug-in hybrids, following the lead that we have taken with the Plug-in Partners campaign in Austin, Texas. 
   Texans alone will save $2 billion at the pump when these standards become fully effective. And consumers across America will save billions more from the requirement in this bill that utilities generate at least 15 percent of their energy from renewable energy. Keep in mind that even Governor Bush signed a renewable energy portfolio in Texas, and Texas is currently ahead of the country on this issue. 
   A green light for green energy encourages a new generation of job-creating innovation that we can export to the world--reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and, maybe even more importantly, fossilized thinking that we have heard so much of here this morning. 
   This bill will reduce the threat of both global war and global warming.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, today's bill certainly does not do enough for America's children; but even too little is too much for President Bush, who seems intent on doing for America's children what he did as Governor for the children of Texas, condemning more and more of them to suffer without health insurance. 
   As Governor, Mr. Bush refused to lead for Texas children. Our children's health insurance was late, very late. And once we got it, he did all he could to see that as few children as possible were covered, even though the Federal Government was picking up almost 75 cents of every dollar of the bill. Texas has actually refused about $1 billion of Federal money to help our children. And by insisting on such neglect from the start, Mr. Bush has ensured that Texas has the proud record of being number one of all the 50 States in having the highest percentage of children with no health insurance. 
   Now in alliance with the nicotine peddlers opposing this bill, once again President Bush's greatest concern is that too many children will get insurance coverage. He actually demands that some children must wait an entire year with no insurance at all before they are eligible for CHIP coverage. 
   Why doesn't the child of a waitress, the child of a construction worker, the child of one of the many workers at a small business that can't afford to provide health insurance to their employees, why doesn't that child deserve a healthy start in life? Painful earaches, a strep throat, a cavity, they deserve swift treatment, not waiting. As President Bush so disdainfully said last month, just take them to the emergency room. It's that kind of indifference, combined with his record in Texas, that demonstrates indifference to the needs of our children and their health insurance as nothing new for our President. But if he prevails today, the number of children who will suffer without adequate health insurance will be even bigger than Texas. 
   He calls this approach compassionate conservatism. I think most Americans would just call it ``cheatin' children.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, as an active member of the Congressional Caucus to Fight and Control Methamphetamines, and a sponsor of this bill, I am pleased that early in this Congress we are addressing a killer that strikes fear in the hearts of parents and exacts great cost from our communities. 
   Over 10 million Americans age 12 and older are reported to have tried methamphetamine. In 2005, in Texas alone, some 250-plus meth labs were seized. Their dangers are not limited to the criminal manufacturers of this wretched drug or the consumers of this poison. Rather, these highly toxic labs represent a much wider threat. Even the remains of the illicit production of a meth lab can, by themselves, produce life-threatening injuries, death, and destruction of property. 
   Our votes today supporting the Methamphetamine Remediation Research Act are votes to protect our families, our neighborhoods, and support our law enforcement organizations as they attack the destructive impact of meth labs. We must continue to work with local, State and Federal law enforcement to ensure that we are combating this scourge at every level--that our local officials have the technology, the funding, and the support they need to detect these labs, close them down and clean them up. 
   I applaud the leadership of Chairman Gordon and all those who have worked on this piece of legislation. We took some action last year and there is much more action which is necessary, but this is a very important next step in our efforts against meth.

<DOCNO>Mr. DOGGETT. (NATIONAL SILVER ALERT ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for his help and leadership on this measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6064, the National Sliver Alert Act, which I authored and on which we have had very good bipartisan cooperation. I appreciate the statement, the concern and cooperation of the gentleman from Florida who has recounted a very serious incident that occurred in his State, and I appreciate the leadership of the gentlewoman from North Carolina. We merged our proposals in committee and have reauthorized through this legislation the National Center for Missing Adults. 
   Our seniors, who have worked a lifetime building families, giving back to their communities, deserve dignity and respect in their retirement years. And when some of them are unable to care for themselves, they need our support. There is no silver bullet to providing that support, but one meaningful way of helping is through the national Silver Alert system that this measure would establish nationwide. 
   Silver Alert is a public notification system triggered by the report of the missing senior with dementia or other mental impairment, similar to Amber Alert which has worked so successfully to find missing children, where we rely on postings on the highways, radio, television, and various forms of media to broadcast information about missing persons, to locate them, and bring them safely home. 
   Sixty percent of those with Alzheimer's wander away from home at some point during their disability. If not found within 24 hours, up to half will suffer serious injury or death. Only 4 percent of those who leave home are able to get back without some assistance. Silver Alert provides that assistance. 
   Responding to this need, 11 States, including my home State of Texas, have already enacted such programs, and another five States are seriously considering State legislation. 
   While this is successful and important, we believe that every American should have the benefits of Silver Alert and that all States can benefit from learning about best practices that are occurring around the country.     
   The National AMBER Alert law, which Congress approved in 2003, has provided the national leadership to coordinate State programs, link States to resources and best practices, and fund the technology and improvements necessary to assure the best assistance that we can provide. 
   National Silver Alert will do much the same, coordinating from the Justice Department with the Federal Communication Commission, the Department of Transportation and the Administration on Aging to avoid duplication of efforts. This is a voluntary program that will help States initiate Silver Alert programs and sustain those that are already underway. 
   In short, coordination saves lives. Reuniting missing seniors with their families requires a rapid, united response. What's missing from efforts to locate missing seniors is sufficient Federal support, and this bill closes that gap. 
   With National Silver Alert, communities can use and build on existing resources to help keep our seniors safe. And as the population of the United States ages, more and more seniors will need this kind of support. 
   Since its inception in Texas last September, Silver Alert has been invoked 52 times. Forty-eight of the missing seniors were located safely, and 13 of these recoveries were directly attributable to Silver Alert. 
   One of these successes involved an 85-year-old man in my district in Austin. He left his home in Austin, drove south to San Antonio, then turned around and drove back, all the way through Austin to Dallas, a total of 325 miles. If it had occurred, instead of on I-35 in Texas, if it occurred here in the Northeast, he would have traveled through seven States. 
   He was finally located in a parking lot at a department store late at night in Dallas. The responding officer had heard about the Silver Alert, knew there was a missing person from Austin in a dark green Buick. They were able to connect him back, after some treatment for dehydration, and get him back the next morning to his family in Austin.

<DOCNO>Mr. DOGGETT. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, let me assure the gentleman that after 12 years of Republican misrule here in the House, it will take much more than 100 hours to undo the damage. Today is a first step toward energy independence. It is certainly not the conclusion of what will be a long process that will involve all Members of this House. 
   We began this 100-hour legislative agenda with ethics laws to clean up this Congress--and it sure needed cleaning up--and we conclude it today with this effort to clean up our environment and clean up our tax code. Although modest, the CLEAN bill is truly a breath of fresh air. 
   Our oil and gas giants are experts at drilling holes. They drill holes into our earth to get the resources that we need, but they have also been pretty fortunate in drilling holes into our tax code and comingup with tax break after billion dollar tax break. 
   Allowing Big Oil to convert valuable public assets to private gain also exploits public resources, but we should not also exploit the American taxpayer. Leases should be set at a fair market rate. 
   Under the former Republican Leadership, Big Oil's best prospecting was not in Texas, not in the Gulf of Mexico, it was right here on the floor of the House and in secret meetings with Vice President Cheney. They prospected in Washington and they never came up with a dry well. It was one gusher of tax benefits and special privileges after another. 
   Now, we finally have an opportunity to rewrite a genuine energy policy. We don't just end unreasonable tax breaks in this bill--tax breaks that I think even most of my Republican colleagues, will admit were unjustified--but we use the proceeds of those tax breaks to focus on renewable energy, on energy independence. 
   We now begin moving toward using our all-American ingenuity for what could be a job creation program of new leadership in energy technology, in clean energy. That is our objective. This CLEAN bill is an important start to restoring fiscal discipline and embarking on genuine energy independence.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, you would think there would be no disagreement that support for our troops which begins on the battlefield shouldn't end there, yet some Senate Republicans deleted from this very legislation an important provision authorizing eligibility for below-market affordable home loans of up to $325,000 through our Texas Veterans Land  Board for our Texas veterans. These are the servicemen and women who served in Iraq and in Afghanistan and over the last 30 years who are excluded from the current program. 
   Today we say once more to these Senate obstructionists, stop and remember that those who fight to keep our homes safe deserve a fighting chance at homeownership. This bill is truly a way to honor our vets, not only with our words, but with our deeds; in this case, deeds to a home. When our vets are willing to pay the ultimate price for our freedom, we can afford the price of correcting this disparity. 
   This bill also prevents the expiration of existing group health insurance guarantees for mental health coverage. While maintaining this protection is very important, what we really need is prompt approval of full equity in all health insurance coverage so that mental health services are not treated differently from physical health services. Whether it is a broken leg or a broken spirit, folks need affordable access to professional care that includes treatment for addiction and depression. I salute our colleagues Congressman Kennedy and Congressman Ramstad in their bipartisan effort for mental health parity, including addiction and depression. Let's get it done in 2008. 
   Approval of today's bill encourages equity, equity in covering veterans whenever they have served, and at least a little equity in mental health coverage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, today we take an important step forward in developing a comprehensive 21st century trade policy, recognizing that the benefits of trade cannot be measured solely in the volume of commerce that crosses international borders. A modern trade policy considers the impact of trade on workers and the environment, and this pact does that. Yet we have not fully achieved the goal of effective safeguards, and I believe that we are taking a step in the right direction; we're just not quite to the final destination. I believe it is better to approve this agreement as a step of genuine progress than to reject it. 
   This agreement includes unprecedented action to prevent illegal logging that is decimating rainforests in South America. For the first time in this agreement, environmental infractions can be enforced with something that is  more than a mere parking ticket. That's what was done in prior agreements where governments wrote fines to themselves no matter how great the environmental degradation. And today, finally, we have recognition in this trade agreement of the importance of multilateral environmental agreements that have been totally disregarded in previous trade pacts. 
   So this is real progress. But I am pleased that our chairman and the Trade Subcommittee chairman have recognized that there is more work that we can do and there are plans to conduct hearings, the first ever hearings in the Ways and Means Committee, on the environmental effects of trade as well as on the investor-state provisions. 
   While our legislative intent is unequivocal regarding the agreement's preamble that ``no foreign investors have greater rights than do American citizens,'' the potential harm to our health, our worker safety, and our environmental laws from abuse of investor-state provisions demand the removal of outmoded and flawed language that keeps cropping up in these agreements and should not appear in future agreements. 
   Acknowledging that we are making real progress with this agreement is really a recognition of just how far behind we have been. After years of total indifference to the concerns of workers and the environment, this agreement addresses those concerns, and almost any change represents progress. Today we move forward, and eventually together I believe that our ultimate goals will be fulfilled.

   No meaningful limitation on outrageous executive pay; like the war, there is no shared sacrifice; only rewards for the greedy and more burdens for the needy. 
   No complete bar on American taxpayers having to bail out the Bank of China--and the entire world. 
   No guarantee taxpayers will not be overcharged for buying toxic debts that no one else wants. 
   No guarantee taxpayers get a fair share in future profits of those who are bailed out. 
   Yes, every one of these concerns receives cosmetic attention in this bill. Not even Avon or Mary Kay can compete with the cosmetics in this bill. It's 100 pages--much better indeed--but three pages of what Secretary Paulson would do and 97 pages of what Secretary Paulson could do, plus excuses for approving most of his three pages.

Madam Speaker, as one of those who voted against President Bush's bailout proposal, I want to express my continued interest in working together to address the Nation's current financial challenges. I do not oppose reasonable steps to intervene in the economy so long as all the burden is not placed on the taxpayers. 
   I recommend that the House promptly approve a resolution calling on the Administration to exercise authority it already possesses to ensure that our financial markets continue to function properly. 
   The FDIC should utilize its emergency powers to immediately raise the limits on federally-insured accounts at all banks. The Securities and Exchange Commission should review and consider suspension of current accounting rules on the valuation of mortgage-backed securities. And the FDIC should consider relying on the net worth certificate approach that it utilized during the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s. 
   These are not just my ideas, rather, they are ideas recommended to the Congress by William Isaac, President Reagan's former Chairman of the Federal Deposit and Insurance Corporation. That approach, and others that were not considered last week, should be considered now to ensure that our financial markets continue to operate.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. This debate underscores the genuine change, the new direction that we are charting here in Washington. We are beginning to rein in these endless Republican deficits. The old Republican way of budgeting doesn't just crunch numbers, it crunches people. We are concerned not only about the fiscal deficit but the ``opportunity deficit'' that occurs in communities across this country when all the members of the community are unable to contribute their full God-given potential, when young people are unable to pursue higher education, when families are denied health care, when veterans are denied the services that they have earned.     
   There are two fundamental ways in which the Democratic approach to tax relief differs from our Republican colleagues. First, we believe it is possible to target tax relief to working, middle-class families without letting the super-rich piggyback along and claim most of the benefits. 
   Second, we say if tax relief is worth having, then pay for it. Instead of going to our grandchildren and borrowing from our grandchildren, we say go to the Grand Caymens. How about going to all those giant corporations that have dodged their fair share of taxes by going offshore and asking them to bear a little of the burden of our national security? So we provide the tax relief that our middle-class families need, but we do it in a fiscally responsible way. 
   Some people have imaginary friends. These Republicans have imaginary demons about what might eventually happen with taxes. This budget is a welcome return to reality, fiscal reality, and responsibility. 
   To those who are at home and are trying to determine who is right about these Republican claims of the demon of tax relief, I think we need only turn to a bipartisan group like the Concord Coalition, which looked at the budget, having no axe to grind except an axe used for cutting to achieve fiscal responsibility, and it said no tax increase will result from this budget.

   That infamous Republican earmark, that Bridge to Nowhere up in Alaska, it carried a hefty price tag, $223 million. Well, what President Bush is now asking Americans to do is to pay for the equivalent of 4,500 Alaskan bridges, a $1 trillion gold-plated, diamond-encrusted bridge to Wall Street. 
   And our job here in Congress is to ask, is this just another Bridge to Nowhere, and ask why is it that the party-goers don't have to pay for the party? Why should American taxpayers and future generations of Americans  have their future mortgaged to pay for a party they never participated in?

   Mr. DOGGETT. Perhaps the sixth time will be the charm. This is the sixth time that this House has approved this legislation to encourage more renewable energy, more solar energy, more wind energy, and provisions that I authored that will encourage plug-in hybrid vehicles and geothermal heat pumps and will promote small business development of biodiesel. 
   American innovation can fuel new jobs and increase exports abroad. We can put more green where it really counts, in the wallets and in the purses of the working families of America. 
   The choice is ours. We can either run this new economy that is less dependent on fossil fuels, or we can get run over by it. 
   Now, really this is not a House/Senate dispute. This is about the Republicans taking the renewable energy bill hostage. Their approach boils down to this: They absolutely refuse to let us take America forward into a less fossil fuel-dependent economy unless we borrow the money to do it. 
   We all know what the George Bush approach has been for 8 years. ``What, me worry?'' Well, his philosophy is ``just swipe the debt on the national credit card.'' Just borrow a little more money, whether it's the cost of the Iraq war, or it's $700 billion for a Wall Street bailout. ``Don't worry, it's a free lunch. What, me worry? No, just put it on the credit card.'' 
   And that's what they're saying this morning. They will not let us move forward with renewable energy and a new green economy unless we borrow more money. How much more money do they think the American people can stand to borrow? 
   Under President George Bush we have added almost $4 trillion, more than all the presidents before him put together borrowing from foreign sources. And they want us to borrow even more before they will allow us to do what the American people want, and that is, to look to the future. 
   If this George Bush bailout proposal has taught us anything, it is the danger of over-borrowing.

   Mr. DOGGETT. With heavy hearts, the thousands of Texans who participated in memorials to Lady Bird Johnson, especially those who filled the streets of Austin, Dripping Springs and Johnson City, attest to our affection and respect for her compassion, warmth and leadership. And with unusually heavy rainfall this year, Texas is literally alive with her legacy, the beautiful wildflowers along our roadways, and filling the photo albums and scrapbooks with children smiling in a bed of bluebonnets or Indian paintbrush for one family after another.  
   She knew a better America was one that gives all of its citizens an opportunity to succeed. And with the reauthorization this year of Head Start, more young Americans can access quality early education, ensuring that no child starts behind. 
   When my predecessor, Representative Jake Pickle, spoke on this floor after the death of President Johnson, he said that Mrs. Johnson was her husband's ``wisest adviser'', and that her daughters, Lynda Bird and Luci, had brought ``so much credit to their family and to our country.'' 
   Of her many gifts, perhaps her most meaningful legacy is her spirit of giving that lives on in her children and grandchildren. In Austin, her daughter Lucy and her grandchildren, Catherine Robb and Nicole Covert, among others, give their time, support and leadership to causes such as SafePlace, Seton, the University of Texas, and the Children's Medical Center Foundation. 
   Mrs. Johnson promoted native species. They have strong roots and improve and beautify our land. The same, and more, can be said of the human legacy that she leaves.

<DOCNO>Mr. DOGGETT. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, the last time the real value of the minimum wage was this low, Elvis was singing ``Heartbreak Hotel.'' But these days it is poor working folks, who have the heartbreak when the minimum wage is not even close to being a living wage. 
   We need to take the minimum for wages and raise it, because there is no maximum for prescription drugs, for tuition, for a visit to the doctor, for filling up a tank of gas. Meanwhile, if the gap between the rich and the poor in this country continues to widen the way it has under the Bush Administration, we will soon have the economic features of a third world country. A CEO earns in two hours what hardworking people earn on the minimum wage in an entire year. 
   As Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., told workers in 1968, ``It is a crime to live in this rich Nation and receive starvation wages.'' And it is a great wrong to deny the nearly one in five workers in Texas who will get a raise as a result of this bill. 
   A rising tide does not raise all boats if some of them are anchored to the floor by Republican ideology. The kind of objections we have heard today is why it has taken so long to do so little. 
   After ten years of doing nothing for the hardest workers, let's approve at least this modest increase.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
   Across America, our Nation's young people are burdened with this President's misplaced priorities. With the debacle in Iraq, many of our young people actually give their life or their limb, and with the soaring national debt combined with the personal debt for the cost of going to college, many of our young people find that their future is already mortgaged. 
   Escalating costs for tuition, the textbooks, for the cost of gasoline to get to and from school and work, they all impact who can afford the opportunity of higher education. 
   It was Thomas Jefferson who urged public support of higher education, wanting the youth of all of our States to, ``drink from the cup of knowledge.'' But today, those students, thirsty for knowledge, confront too often a parched, unwelcoming desert of financial need and debt; and the last Republican Congress just made matters worse. 
   This bill represents a constructive step forward in making the dream of attending quality institutions a reality. It is a reality that will be there, now available, for 47,000 students each year in Texas who choose not to get a higher education because of financial barriers. 
   It lends a hand to working parents who want to earn a degree and provide a better life for their children. 
   It lends a helping hand to a young person who is the first in her family to see the inside of a college classroom. 
   And it lends a hand to middle-class Americans who struggle to save for college while their cost of living continues to increase. 
   A skilled, productive workforce is an investment in our future. We cannot afford to leave higher education unaffordable to so many of our neighbors. 
   Pass this bill because our youth are worth the investment

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, some refer to this as a bridge fund connecting monies from one year to the next to finance this Iraq war. 
   A bridge is built to overcome an obstacle, and the obstacle here is George Bush. Granting this President 50 billion more dollars without reasonable restrictions to end this war is just building another bridge to nowhere. 
   Today, instead, we use this funding to build a bridge that brings our troops home by beginning a safe, orderly, phased redeployment from Iraq. 
   The President can no longer defy our Constitution as the sole ``decider.'' America has decided that he's wrong, dead wrong, too many deaths wrong, and it's elected representatives in this Congress are now declaring ``no more blank checks.'' 
   Despite the sacrifices of our troops in this deadliest year of the war, this surge has failed completely to achieve its purpose of political progress. ``Retreat,'' you say; you've had a 5-year retreat from political reality. Progress, you say; not in Iraq, not in political reconciliation; progress, perhaps only in your self-defeating propaganda as you repeatedly waved your ``mission accomplished'' banner. 
   The continued cost of this war in hemorrhaged blood and $3 billion of taxpayer money every week is not acceptable or sustainable. 
   Mr. President, no more ``cut-and-run''. We will not cut these reasonable restrictions from this legislation, and we will not run from your veto threat.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, on this historic day, the sun is shining brightly in Washington outside and today, finally it is shining inside this great Capitol building. 
   Normally, a New Year's resolution is a list you write for yourself. But the ethics package that we Democrats are now adopting was written by the American people at the ballot box in November. This January resolution is possible only because of the November revolution by voters who were, quite frankly, revolted by what they saw going on here in Washington. 
   Under Democratic leadership, ``Spring Cleaning'' is getting an early start here in January. We ban lobbyists-sponsored junkets and gifts and the use of corporate jets from jet-setting lobbyists like the tobacco company that even took one Member of Congress on a special flight to his criminal arraignment. 
   In Congress, an earmark too often is a secret means for a Member to funnel Federal dollars to special projects. Some are worthwhile, some are dubious. 
   When I talk about earmarks to my rancher friends down in Texas, they have a different earmark in mind. It is the mark you put on an ear of your cattle to identify them. By their very nature, earmarks are public, designed to identify ownership. I think we need some of that Texas thinking here in Washington. If earmarks can identify a steer, we are now able, through this new package, to know who is ``steering'' earmarks of federal tax dollars to some unworthy cause. 
   Ethics reform, of course, is not an end in and of itself. The goal of reform is to improve the substance of the work that we do here. It is to ensure that the priorities in Washington are genuinely the priorities of hard working families in San Marcos, Bastrop, Kyle, and many other communities across our country. 
   Because fiscal security is national security, we are also working to cut the ballooning federal deficit with pay-as-you-go budgeting; barring new spending provisions or tax changes that would increase our soaring national debt. 
   Our reforms seek to curb the cost of corruption. It is a cost that has been borne in the pocketbooks of our seniors who pay too much for drugs because of a drug bill that was designed by the pharmaceutical manufacturers, instead of designed to help those who needed help most. 
   It is the cost of corruption that is reflected in no-bid contracts in Iraq and in the aftermath of the Hurricane Katrina debacle. And it is reflected in the price that the jobless, the homeless, and the hopeless are paying for the corruption within this administration. 
   Mr. Speaker, accountability, so long lacking from this administration and the House leadership begins today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise as an enthusiastic supporter of the legislation that has been prepared by the gentlewoman from New York. Credit card abuse is rampant, and her legislation helps us to correct some of the most egregious abuses. 
   I have just come from the Subcommittee on Health on which I serve. It's well known that the number one item in terms of credit card debt is for medical bills and that health care costs are the number one cause of personal bankruptcy in this country. 
   When we wrote the bankruptcy bill a few years ago, what began as a reasonable reform to deal with problems with debtors became an entirely one-sided piece of legislation that ignored these rampant abuses in the credit card industry. So it's appropriate here, under new leadership and a Democratic Congress and the leadership of the gentlewoman from New York, we are finally belatedly addressing some of these abuses. 
   But all of this will be for naught unless this measure becomes part of the great Wall Street bailout that the President has proposed. Once again, the proposal being advanced from this administration, not unlike our old debate about the bankruptcy laws, is all one-sided: give to those who cause the problem, give taxpayer money to those who cause the problem, and let those who cause the problem decide how that money is distributed. It's all one-sided. 
   If such a bill in any form is to be passed--and I think there's great debate about the wisdom of approving anything in this area of the type that has been advanced--but if such a measure is to be approved, it is essential that we do just a little bit for the consumers who have been entrapped, in many cases, with massive amounts of credit card debt. And incorporating the modest but very important reforms that the gentlewoman from New York has advanced into this legislation is absolutely essential. 
   We need not negotiate just over the unsatisfactory proposal that was advanced by the Treasury Department.

   Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, a few months ago, President Bush accurately diagnosed the problem he just dumped in the lap of Congress: ``Wall Street got drunk, and now it's got a hangover,'' he said. 
   Mr. President, you gave them the keys to the liquor cabinet by failing to enforce our laws, and now you are really demanding that Americans who didn't get invited to the party must pay for everything destroyed in the drunken brawl. 
   These late-night negotiators have not asked the President, ``where do we find $700 billion?'' It is time to demand that the bailout supporters outline the revenue measures necessary to pay for it, and the place to begin is with those who enriched themselves as Republicans removed the cop from the corporate beat. 
   We need an alternative to just raising the credit card limit, an alternative to more irresponsible borrow-and-spend policies from a President who has borrowed more from foreigners than all previous presidents in American history put together, and who seems determined to continue to mortgage America's future.

<DOCNO>Mr. DOGGETT. (LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, today, we belatedly honor the Education President by affixing his name to the Education Building. 
   President Johnson began as student Johnson, a Blanco County farm boy going to college in Hays County, Texas, at Southwest Texas State Teachers College. It was a time when he remarked that ``poverty was so common we didn't even have a name for it.'' 
   He borrowed $75 to get his college education, which is one of the reasons he appreciated the need for strong student financial assistance programs. And he even took leave there at Southwest Texas, as it later became known, in order to teach school and earn a little money to stay in school. 
   Recently, we dedicated an LBJ museum in San Marcos to commemorate his years as a student there, recognizing that now Texas State University continues to provide quality higher education to students across the State, Nation and globe. 
   President Johnson continued his involvement as President with students. One of my own most memorable experiences as a university student was going with a small delegation of university student leaders to meet with President Johnson in the residence at the White House and having an opportunity to ask him questions about the important work that he was doing in Washington. 
   In 1994, I had the good fortune to be elected to represent the congressional district that Lyndon Johnson once served in this House, having served in the State Senate before that time. 
   With his own premature passing, we lost the opportunity to have his continued involvement in Texas, but we have been blessed, as other speakers have noted, with the active involvement of the woman we know only as ``Lady Bird,'' who continues now, even at this point in her life, to make public appearances and support causes for education and other good deeds in the Central Texas area. 
   Similarly, we are blessed that his commitment to education is reflected in the work of his daughter, Luci Baines Johnson Turpin, and his granddaughter, Catherine Robb, who are active participants in our Central Texas community. This family recognized that, as President Johnson said of the NATO alliance many years ago, ``There are no problems we cannot solve together, and very few we can solve by ourselves.'' 
   The importance of working together is true, whether our objective is to provide more children an education, guarantee seniors' retirement security or protect our veterans with the coverage that they earned and deserve. 
   As we name this building to honor President Johnson, I think that we share his commitment to the least, the last, and the most in need. All of us welcome this measure as a fitting tribute to a man who did so much for this country, so much for education, and so much to improve the quality of life for all Americans.

<DOCNO>Mr. DOGGETT. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H. CON. RES. 312, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, some folks think that President Bush's term ends on January 20, 2009. Many Americans have a big red circle or a happy face on their calendar already on that date, or perhaps on their key chains, and their watches that tick down ever so slowly, backwards toward that happy time. 
   But while President Bush may be gone from the White House in 314 days, this administration and its congressional enablers have done so much damage that generations of American families will be footing the bill for their fiscal recklessness, with compounded interest, long, long after President Bush retires to Texas. This administration has consistently chosen to sacrifice long-term fiscal stability on the altar of political expediency. They have offered the ``free lunch'' plan, the ``pain-free'' solution to almost every challenge that our country has encountered. And the greatest sacrifice that they have demanded at a time of national peril for most Americans is to tell them to ``go shopping''. 
   Well, this administration has now created a record $3 trillion of additional national debt on its own during the Bush years. What would even just one of those trillions of dollars of debt have accomplished had it been expended in a more appropriate manner? 
   One trillion, that's millions of public school teachers; that's health care for hundreds of million children; that's university scholarships for millions of students. And in Iraq, this administration this week, every week, week after week, month after month, year after year, $3 billion. With the cost of the war in Iraq in 2 weeks, we could pay for the entire cancer budget of the National Institutes of Health for a year. Showering tax breaks on the richest, the most privileged few, while hemorrhaging $12 billion every month in Iraq, this administration has created more than a Federal deficit; it has created deficits, opportunity deficits, for millions of American families. 
   The administration's failure to address our educational needs means that there's an opportunity deficit, that millions of young people are not able to achieve their full God-given potential because of the lack of support at both the public education level and for student financial assistance. 
   The failure of the Bush administration to address our health care problems means a health care deficit for millions of American families, the largest single cause of personal bankruptcy in America today, the health care crisis. 
   And the failure of the Bush administration to address our energy deficit, that is a deficit that every American feels at the pump when they get all their money taken out of their pocket and shifted over to some tyrant in an oil-producing area. The cost of the Bush administration's budget approach, their fiscal failure, is felt the most by those, who are least able to bear it: our students, our uninsured, our minimum wage workers, the elderly, and small business owners. 
   This Democratic budget attempts to bail out, to bail us all out. But it's mighty hard to keep this country afloat and keep our families afloat when the administration is still so busy drilling holes in the bottom of the boat. 
   I urge support for the rule and support for the Democratic budget as the best hope we have to do that in this difficult time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DOGGETT. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY CONSERVATION TAX ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, with the passage of the energy bill just approved and the passage of this energy bill today, we move America in a historic direction, a new direction on energy, not just away from our overdependence on fossil fuels, but away from our overdependence on fossilized ideas like those that have dominated this House for the last 12 years. 
   One of those fossilized ideas is that it is okay to keep borrowing from our grandchildren. So today the reason that we hear talk about higher taxes on a bill that is basically revenue neutral, that doesn't borrow from our grandchildren and doesn't raise significant new revenues, but rather restricts and evaluates our tax credits to determine how they can be most effective, is that they don't understand this new kind of thinking. 
   Just as they favored foreign corporations over farmers last week, today they favor fossilized energy over new energy and energy independence. 
   You know, going green is not just about securing a healthy planet to raise our children. It is creating opportunities for jobs and economic development in biodiesel and in renewable energy like solar and geothermal power. New technologies bring new opportunities. A new class of jobs are being created, neither blue collar nor white collar but green collar jobs of many types from green energy. 
   It is a matter of recognizing that some boondoggles come along, like where a oil company decides it will drop a little dab of grease in its petroleum byproducts in order to claim a renewable biodiesel tax credit and destroy a new emerging industry like our biodiesel companies and our biofuels companies that are helping us become energy independent. 
   So this is a bill about jobs and about evaluating the oversubsidization of a fossil fuel industry and moving to new energies, biodiesel, recognizing the power of solar power, plug-in hybrids, recognizing that we can become the leaders in the world in green jobs, green collar jobs. This bill offers us a chance to lead on green energy, not become green with envy as other countries leap over us.

   Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, we know, first of all, what is not in this motion to recommit. What is not in this motion to recommit is anything about the exciting new opportunity with plug-in hybrids. This has been deleted from the bill with this motion to recommit. 
   We know, as the gentleman from Washington is just saying, that what those who have worked so hard in solar power have requested, an 8-year extension so we can get the investment. We heard from investment bankers saying you need that kind of dependability in order to get the money that solar power needs to expand particularly throughout the South and Southwest. That will not be available under this Republican proposal. 
   But what is in this proposal? Well, after all of the very strange comments that have been made about denying mom an opportunity to drive an SUV, the same tax on Hummers that is in our proposal is in their motion to recommit. Look at the bill. Look at the scoring from the Joint Committee on Taxation for the motion to recommit at page 2, line 7, and you will see exactly that same matter.     
   In fact, after all the talk about how we don't want taxes on the petroleum industry, when I look at their proposal, I find almost $1 billion in taxes on gasoline that they are proposing in their motion to recommit. 
   When I look at the line just above that in the same scoring document, I find almost $1 billion that is proposed by them in a tax on coal. 
   Now, there may be a need to do that at some point as we build our energy future here. 
   But everyone who votes for their motion to recommit, they need to understand today that they are voting for about $1 billion in gasoline taxes and almost $1 billion in taxes on coal, all at the same time they are denying our renewable industries what they need in wind and solar. They are denying them the dependability necessary to attract private investment to let those industries grow. 
   You know, we have so much fossilized thinking that we must overcome if we are to combat the real threat of climate change that endangers our country, that is perhaps our greatest long-term national security challenge. It's certainly a challenge to our health and our future. 
   And we also have to address the need for a new energy future that does not leave us dependent on foreign sources of energy. We have ample solar power here, we have great potential in this country, if we are willing to make the hard decisions to not be bound by the ideas of the past and move to the future. 
   You can do that today by rejecting this motion to recommit. When you reject the motion to recommit, you will also be rejecting about $1 billion in taxes on gasoline, about $1 billion in taxes on coal.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, with this veto, President Bush has once again failed to safeguard our families. 
   And what is this ``waterboarding'' that the President so readily embraces? It sounds a little like a cousin of skateboarding or snowboarding. But, in fact, it is a new name for an old water torture in which a human being is drowned. The drowning is controlled to force a response, but waterboarding is simply a euphemism for torture by drowning. 
   Now, President Bush is not the first Texan to think of this and to believe that horrific wrongs can justify drowning of the culprit. An earlier Texas waterboarder is not in the White House; he was sent to the Big House. A Texas judge said that this waterboarding Texas sheriff put law enforcement ``in the hands of a bunch of thugs'' that would ``embarrass a dictator.'' The sheriff was sentenced to 10 years. That judge was right, and this administration is so very wrong. 
   America seems to have been sentenced to 8 years of Dick Cheney, who claims that such water torture is a ``no brainer.'' ``No brainer''--that sounds like a good way to describe how so many of this Administration's policies have been made. 
   Torture is no proper tool in the arsenal of democracy. Torture is foreign to our values, foreign to our history, foreign to our religions, foreign to our laws, and it is foreign to our international commitments. There can be no compromise, no middle ground. We must have zero tolerance for torture. 
   If we abandon our American values, we lose who we are. We lose our identity. We lose our pride as the greatest Nation in the world. And if the Administration and its apologists continue forcing America to abandon the rule of law and our long commitment to human dignity, we will lose the war. 
   The use of torture, which President Bush's veto endorses, is not only un-American; it is ineffective. That is one reason why the Army Field Manual prohibits its use even when our military is in harm's way. As General David Petraeus, our commander in Iraq, wrote to his troops last year: ``Beyond the basic fact that such actions are illegal, history shows that they also are frequently neither useful nor necessary.'' 
   I say follow our generals, not the Cheney ideologues, not the apologists. Override this veto.

It is often said that we should honor our vets not only with our words but also with our deeds. Well, today we expand the opportunity for each vet to obtain a deed for their home. As veterans paid the price to build our great democracy, we can afford the price of building a foundation for their home ownership.

With this bill, scientists' hands are freed to find cures for Alzheimer's and ALS, for cancer and MS and Parkinson's and much more.

   How cruel to block hope for those suffering from lingering diseases that slowly drain away life and happiness and energy. 
   Publicly-funded, responsible stem cell research is coming. It is just a question of how many lives are lost first, of how many families will still be suffering before we here in Congress are able to secure the votes to pry open the politically inspired restraints that this administration has imposed on expediting the cures and the treatments long awaited by so many who are afflicted and those who care for them.

   Mr. DOGGETT. Surely if Lance Armstrong can overcome mountains in France, we can overcome the mountains of obstructionism and of excuses to provide our children and our seniors the health coverage that they need. 
   By including significant portions of two Medicare bills that I filed, today's legislation supports grandparents as well as grandchildren. All seniors would get preventive care, and many of the 3.3 million poor seniors not receiving any help today would get the extra help for which they qualify. 
   Today, those seniors most in need are often least aware that help exists. We must identify and notify those entitled to extra help with prescription drugs and simplify the application process. 
   We also ensure that drug coverage is not lost by our seniors who saved a small nest egg or receive help and groceries from their children--behavior that we ought to encourage, not punish.     
   Importantly, we mandate that patients suffering from cancer, AIDS, and mental illness receive access to life-saving medications. Without this protection, vulnerable patients are held hostage by ``cost cutting decisions'' by private insurance companies. 
   While Lance inspires us to live strong, we can ``vote strong'' and improve the lives of children, seniors, and Americans fighting to get well again. Approve this important legislation.

   Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, of course, that letter is one of many endorsements of groups coming together because they know that today they are improving health care for our oldest Americans and our youngest Americans. 
   Unfortunately, my home State of Texas has the distinction of being number one in children with no health insurance, largely due to the indifference of then Governor George Bush who responded too late and too little. His indifference to the health crisis now is hardly surprising given his indifference then. 
   The Republican prescription drug plan, the largest entitlement increase in recent history, is a study in how to let Medicare ``wither on the vine'' at the time they inject waste, fraud and abuse into the system. 
   Now Republicans are using every available obstructionist tactic to block our reforms, to curb their own excesses, such as their lavishing billions on big insurance companies. Despite their professed interest in controlling entitlement spending, only two of their 21 committee amendments would have reduced spending and the vast majority would have increased spending on borrowed money. 
   Their sermons about Medicare insolvency are betrayed by their insistence on undermining it, and their silly claims of ``socialized medicine'' are belied by the bill's endorsement by the American Medical Association and the AARP. 
   Approve this rule and afford seniors and children the health care that Republican obstructionism would deny them.

   Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I commend Warren Buffet on his confidence in American business, but his recent combined investment in Goldman Sachs and General Electric was not a charitable donation. He is not purchasing toxic securities; he is buying preferred stock. Why should American taxpayers get anything less? Why does he buy the preferred, and we buy the leftovers? 
   I share my neighbors' concerns about the impact of some in Washington hitting the panic button on their retirement, their home, or their business. But when markets are poisoned, you demand the best antidote--Not yield to another of President Bush's take-it-or-leave-it demands.

   If the President had listened to the generals, we would never have invaded Iraq in the first place. Each day of this unnecessary tragedy demonstrates the wisdom of General Schwarzkopf's warning that we would become ``like [a] dinosaur in a tar pit.'' 
   Had he listened to the generals, the President would have deployed enough troops to get the job done. But instead, he rejected the advice of General Shinseki, and allowed the violence to spiral, and unguarded weapon heaps became IEDs. 
   If the President had listened to the generals, he would now be redeploying our troops instead of sending more, inadequately protected, for longer, repeat tours of duty. 
   Had the President listened to the generals, our veterans would be getting the quality care that they have earned and they deserve. 
   But in this Administration, generals who disagree with the President earn a new title: Retired.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe our Republican colleagues are correct. This Congress spoke with one voice on the war on terrorism, and we continue to do so. Indeed, if President Bush had pursued the war on terrorism and the perpetrators of 9/11, instead of getting diverted to Iraq, which had nothing to do with 9/11, then when he hoisted that ``Mission Accomplished'' banner four years ago, it would have had meaning. 
   Instead, we have a burn rate of $10 billion every month in Iraq, $14 million every hour, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, every week, every month of the year. More importantly, the real burn rate is in the loss of more than 3,300 American lives, brave men and women over there fighting for our country; 96 percent of those deaths, almost all of them, lost their life after President Bush declared ``Mission Accomplished.'' 
   Today, the President can veto our attempt to secure a safe, orderly, phased redeployment of our troops from Iraq, but he can't veto reality. Our troops are coming home. It's just a question of what price is paid in blood and money before that happens. 
   The President talks about listening to the commanders and the generals. I wonder if he was listening to General William Odom, the former National Security Agency Director, last Saturday when he said the President has let the Iraq war proceed on ``automatic pilot, making no corrections in the face of accumulating evidence that his strategy cannot be rescued.'' 
   If the President had listened to the generals, we would never have gone into Iraq in the first place. It was General Schwarzkopf who said, we would become ``like [a] dinosaur in a tar pit.'' 
   If he had listened to the generals like General Shinseki, if he had insisted on going into Iraq, he would have sent enough troops to get the job done and not turned over all those weapons dumps to be converted into IEDs. 
   If he had listened to the generals, he would have provided our veterans with the health care that they have earned and deserved instead of subjecting them back here to the facilities and care they found in the United States.

   Mr. DOGGETT. The Republicans charge that we want to help so many children with no insurance and that we want to allow them so much time to reconsider their indifference. We plead guilty as charged. 
   This President? It's like the book title, Dead Certain but also Dead Wrong. 
   The only question is how many children will be dead or will suffer with disease and disability until enough Members of this Congress are willing to stand up to the President and stand up for children. 
   President Bush has ideological blinders. He is never around the children of the working poor, the child who sobs with an earache, the child who moans as a result of an abscessed tooth, who has no antibiotics for a strep throat, and the poor parent who lacks the ability to do something about it. 
   The President's veto today is neither sound fiscal policy nor good medicine, and his solution that these Republicans embrace of ``just go to the emergency room'' is neither compassionate nor conservative.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, this debate is not nearly so much about fossil fuels as fossilized thinking. Conceivably there was a time in this country when federal tax policy that was ``of, by and for Big Oil'' meant dependable energy for our families. But now that approach of overreliance is as outdated and ill-conceived as eight-track tapes and President Bush's ``Mission Accomplished'' banner. 
   Today's legislation would mean more renewable energy production, more solar energy, more wind energy, and provisions that I authored to encourage plug-in hybrid vehicles and geothermal heat pumps. And we don't borrow the money to pay for this renewable energy policy as the spend-and-borrow Republicans always insist. We pay for the measure by asking Big Oil to share just a tiny part of the tax subsidies that they have received for decades with these emerging renewable energy sources. 
   One of the new tax loopholes that we close in this bill would otherwise have allowed Big Oil to claim a dollar for every gallon that it produced by simply dropping a little dab of grease in petroleum, ironically a provision intended to assist biofuels companies to help us achieve energy independence. And the cost of this modest increase in addressing these unjustifiable tax breaks for Big Oil is so small that I doubt it will even warrant a footnote in the astronomical earnings report of ExxonMobil. 
   The charge made here today that the price of gas will go up if this bill passes is ludicrous. Does anyone here remember the price of gas going down when the oil companies got this unjustifiable tax break? It didn't go down a dime. And this charge comes from the same crowd that stood idly by while the cost of gas at the pump skyrocketed and did absolutely nothing.     
   Of course the biggest subsidy of all for our fossilized foreign energy police is the military presence that we must maintain in foreign lands, places as volatile as the petroleum underneath them. We need real change in our energy policy that will bring us closer to a solution for both global warming and global war. I am proud that the City of Austin, Austin Energy, and people throughout Central Texas have taken a leadership role to move us in that direction. 
   The bill we have today is green. It is a green light to green jobs and a green environment. And the only folks that are seeing red today are those whose padded profits compel them to block the door to progress that this legislation would open.

<DOCNO>Mr. DOGGETT. (END THIS ENDLESS WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, on this unfortunate day 5 years ago, a majority of this House enabled President Bush to proceed with his tragic ``go it alone'' war. He was dead certain then, and he was dead wrong then. He is dead certain today, and once again dead wrong. As a result of his choices, we approach now some 4,000 Americans whose lives have been lost, perhaps as many as another 30,000 who have been disabled. 
   Our Treasury, of course, has been disabled of what is scheduled to be probably a trillion or more dollars out of our Treasury that could have been spent right here at home on more causes that would have touched and protected the American people, their health care and economic security. 
   After this 5 years, I think it is important to look back and realize that despite the position of the Republican leadership, the Republican administration, and most of the Democratic administration, that in this House that day 5 years ago, a substantial majority of House Democrats voted against this war that should never have been launched. 
   We say today that the best course for this country to pursue is a new course, a change of course, not just more of the same old thing as the President proposed in his escalation, as he has implemented in his escalation, but a genuine change in course. 
   We need to end this endless war in Iraq. We really already have a blueprint of how to do it, how to implement a safe and orderly redeployment. The United Kingdom, the only one of our allies to offer any substantial help in Iraq, is already redeploying and seems to be indicating that their troops will be out of Iraq next year. We need to join that coalition, the coalition of refocusing on priorities here at home, because what we have done in Iraq has not made our families safer. As one independent study after another has shown, what we have done there has made our families much less safe than had this adventure never been launched. 
   For the last 5 years, this administration has repeatedly presented us with false choices. Remember, there would be a mushroom cloud, perhaps, if we waited to find the smoking gun to justify the invasion of Iraq to find all these weapons of mass destruction that never existed. Now we hear the same old deadly course is the only alternative to a ``precipitous withdrawal.'' Well, I don't know of anyone who is  proposing a precipitous withdrawal. There are other reasonable alternatives. We believe that the better course, a new course, is a safe, orderly, fully funded, phased redeployment. The British already have this underway.     
   The British already have this underway. We can follow their example, and we can follow the leadership of the American people reflected in one study after another, that they want that kind of change in course. 
   The choice to redeploy or not is a decision about priorities. While it is true that the big cost of what we are doing there is measured in the blood of the brave, we are also hemorrhaging some $3 billion in Iraq expenditures right out of our Treasury, week after week, month after month. 
   The President vetoed the Children's Health Insurance bill, because even too little for our children seems to be too much for him. Half a trillion dollars for a war already that he chose in Iraq, but for the children of America's working poor, he brusquely tells us, they can just go to the emergency room. With millions of children uninsured, it is too soon to declare ``mission accomplished'' there, just as it was too soon for him to make that declaration years back and many deaths back in Iraq. 
   In Iraq and with the Children's Health Insurance Program, we believe that the President is on the wrong course and that we cannot afford to wait until he departs office to end this war and to end the indifference that he has shown toward our children. 
   This fifth anniversary then should be commemorated with thoughtful consideration of alternatives for new courses and new avenues to address the tremendous damage that has been done by this faulty policy of preemptive war. I believe that we need in these next few months to continue to focus on the wrongs that have been committed, the damage that has been done, and bring people together behind a genuinely new course that we have not tried before, and that is a complete but phased, safe and orderly, fully-funded redeployment of our troops that will protect our families, that will assure our Nation's security, and will not continue with the hemorrhaging that we have suffered these last many years.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. After having run the national debt up sky high, these Republicans clamor for another loan. ``Just give us another $50 billion for one more tax cut.'' And we Democrats are saying ``No, your debt addiction must stop today. You're way over your credit limit.'' 
   The Republican borrow-and-spend approach that we've had for the last 7 years may be easy politics, but it's mighty hard on an economy where the dollar keeps falling so that it's worth even less today than a Canadian looney. 
   In this bill, one way that we stop this Republican credit card borrowing spree is by adopting much of the Abusive Tax Shelter Shutdown Act, which I first introduced in June 1999. It combats tax shelters by denying a deduction for transactions that lack what is called ``economic substance.'' What that means is no more tax evasion by corporations that rely on what one professor described as ``deals done by very smart people that, absent tax considerations, would be very stupid.'' And it is very stupid to allow them to continue doing that. 
   When the corporate tax dodgers are made to pay their fair share, as this bill does today, everybody else who plays by the rules can pay less. And that's what this bill does. We stop corporate tax evasion; we stop corporate tax dodgers from shifting the tax burden to middle-class families, ensuring today both tax fairness and fiscal responsibility.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
   Responsible, pay-as-you-go government is a significant part of the new direction to which this Congress committed our country last January. Now is hardly the time to abandon that important commitment. 
   For 7 years, spend-and-borrow Republicans have seldom met a problem in this country that they didn't address by borrowing more money and incurring more public debt. Now, when America faces a credit crunch, they say ``get more credit.'' They insist on borrowing even more money to finance another tax cut. 
   Admittedly, under Republican rule, the AMT, the Alternative Minimum Tax, turned into the ``Aggressive Middle-income Tax.'' Republicans were so busy treating the Federal Treasury like an ATM to finance tax cuts for the wealthy few that they largely forgot about the need to permanently fix the AMT affecting the middle class. 
   We need that permanent fix that President Bush continues to refuse to support, but correcting and reducing the AMT can be accomplished in a fiscally responsible manner. We Democrats understand that discipline is required for fiscal responsibility. You simply cannot make a mountain of debt disappear, say, the way they erased the CIA torture video. 
   This bill pays for the AMT fix in part by adopting most of the Abusive Tax Shelter Shutdown Act that I first authored in June of 1999, but which year after year House Republicans have blocked. Indeed, they blocked it even after Senate Republicans approved the measure. 
   Today, we can stop corporate tax dodgers from shifting the tax burden to middle-class families, ensuring both tax fairness and fiscal responsibility.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. Let's be very clear about what is being postponed and who is doing the postponing. When this President exercised his second veto, he postponed our desire to see that children get the health care that they need. And tonight, when Republicans in this House and their nicotine-peddler allies stand in the way of the door at the doctor's office, millions of children are denied the care that they deserve. 
   This President's holiday season veto of our efforts to aid these ailing children is neither sound fiscal policy nor good medicine. And for the President to make the incredible statement that the children of the working poor should ``just go to the emergency room,'' that is neither compassionate nor conservative. With his ideological blinders, he just doesn't seem to see the children of the working poor who are up all night with an aching ear, an abscessed tooth, or can't get antibiotics for strep throat. Those are the challenges working families face who do not have access to health care. 
   A healthy body, like an educated mind, is an opportunity that all of our children should be permitted to share. For as long as the President and a minority of this House stand between children and the lifesaving, pain-reducing care that they need, we will work to overcome their intransigence, whether it takes one time in January or another time thereafter. We cannot yield to those who would block our children from the care they need.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, surely the smaller and less complex your business structure, the less complex your tax filings should be. But the tax code is so full of complexity that there is barely any room left for simplicity for even the truly Mom- and Pop-owned business or the couple who is trying to hold on to the family farm or ranch. 
   I am particularly pleased that this bill includes a provision to help husband and wife co-owned businesses that was taken from a bill that I co-introduced with the now Small Business Committee Chairwoman in the last Congress and reintroduced this Congress. My simplification provision has repeatedly been included in the Taxpayer Advocate's annual recommendations to Congress. Now it will hopefully become a reality. An additional benefit of this provision is to ensure equity for wives in these situations by giving both the husband and the wife credit for paying Medicare and Social Security taxes. 
   I also support the extension and increase of small business expensing, which allows small businesses to make significant capital investments--such as acquiring computer software or farm equipment--and deduct the total cost from income immediately, rather than depreciating them over extended periods of time. By reflecting the increasing costs of doing business, this provision will allow small business owners to build upon their all-American dreams. 
   As a result of this bill, many of the small Mom- and Pop-owned farms, ranches, and businesses that I represent in Texas will find tax season a little less taxing and a lot fairer. The Committee has shown restraint in drafting this bill. With the purchasing power of the minimum wage at its lowest level in 50 years, neither it nor these modest reforms to help small businesses should be held hostage to the endless appetite of some for another $8 billion plus in additional tax breaks.

<DOCNO>Mr. DOGGETT. (THE IRAQ WAR -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, the troop surge in Iraq has clearly failed. It has failed to achieve its purpose. The troop surge has failed not because of our troops, but because of the failures of politicians here in Washington and in Iraq. This President's surge has been as successful as the President's boast to catch Osama bin Laden ``dead or alive.'' 
   We now have three reports from entities at least somewhat independent from the Bush propaganda machine that confirm the obvious. The National Intelligence Estimate providing the thinking of the intelligence community that, instead of getting better, the situation in Iraq will get worse: ``The Iraqi government will become more precarious over the next 6 to 12 months.'' The Independent Commission on Security Forces concluded that the Iraqi Interior Ministry is ``dysfunctional.'' It is so bad that it cannot be fixed; they recommend that it be disbanded. The Government Accountability Office evaluated the surge, and it judged President Bush's policy using his own criteria with a clear ``F,'' a clear failure, a fiasco, a fatal flop, with only 3 of 18 benchmarks having been met. 
   Today, General Petraeus can cite whatever selective statistics that his political bosses may permit him to disclose, but the facts are that each and every month this year has involved more deaths of American troops than each month, including August last year. And despite the ethnic cleansing that has already displaced 3.5 million Iraqis, the increasing violence continues to inflict an increasingly deadly toll on Iraqi families. 
   What is life like for those Iraqis who survive? Almost half earn less than $1 a day; 70 percent lack access to adequate water; and 1/3 remain in dire need of emergency food aid. 
   When the surge was announced, the White House said ``wait until the summer.'' And as summer approached, the White House said ``wait until September.'' Well, now that this much overrated September is here, they cry ``wait until next year.'' 
   The only real mystery about President Bush's September decision has been what new excuse he would offer to justify staying the same old deadly course. And as the American people have seen through the duplicity of each and every other excuse, the President has returned to his original ploy: 9/11, coincidentally, just as we receive this report on the anniversary of 9/11. He claims that ``the same folks that are bombing ..... in Iraq are the ones who attacked us in America on September 11.'' That is false and he knows it is false. But fear with deception is all he has left to rationalize the pain of the many, the sacrifice of the brave, and the loss of $3 billion every single week. 
   As usual, this President is dead certain and dead wrong. What he seeks is war without limits, war without end. Under his direction, General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker propose a war that continues for probably another decade, the ``George Bush Trillion dollar, 15-Year War.''  
   Now Congress must respond to the President's propaganda surge with a truth surge, with a memory surge, reminding America of the repeated false cries of ``progress'' and phony excuses that have only brought our families more insecurity. Congress must learn from the courage continually displayed by our troops. Appeasement will not stop these wrong-headed Administration policies. More blank checks will only drain our national treasury while fueling more death and destruction that only endangers American families. 
   And so today we note the surge has failed, but we respectfully and sincerely thank General Petraeus and all of our troops who serve America and are doing their jobs. But we know we must do our job. It is long past time for Congress to act. Our best hope remains a safe and orderly, fully-funded, phased redeployment that begins immediately.

   Mr. DOGGETT. I thank the gentleman for his leadership. 
   ``Pay more, get less,'' that's the Bush Medicare plan. The President's veto  means that taxpayers get an opportunity to pay more unnecessarily to subsidize private insurers, while seniors and the disabled get less. 
   Each person in privatized Medicare costs American taxpayers $1,000 more each year than the cost for one relying on the traditional, more efficient Medicare system. Without change, $150 billion will be wasted on unnecessary subsidies to highly profitable private insurers. Even Medicare's only actuary reports absolutely zero quantifiable savings have occurred through private Medicare, and that savings will never occur through private Medicare as currently set up, a waste of $150 billion bestowed on the insurers. That's the waste that President Bush is so intent on protecting through his veto. We take some of that unnecessary waste and we use it to pay physicians who are working hard and ought not to have a cut in their reimbursement rates, and more importantly, for the many people around this country who rely on those physicians to care for them. 
   The Administration has refused time and again to offer us any legislative fix on this waste in the so-called Medicare Advantage plan, which is nothing but a disadvantage to American taxpayers and Medicare recipients. 
   Today, we must overcome this continued obstructionism of the Administration and its allies here in the Congress. We should reject wasteful corporate welfare, protect our physicians, and override this veto.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. I thank the gentleman and my colleagues for this resolution honoring our friend, Ann Richards. 
   Despite the great sense of loss that so many of us continue to feel, I must say that the wonderful gathering that we had last year in Austin for Ann Richards was about the most joyous memorial service that I have ever participated in. There was so much to celebrate about this person, about this life. 
   Ann came to Austin in the 1970s. She was a true life force. She became our County Commissioner and our State Treasurer before becoming Governor. And during most of my tenure in Congress, I had the good fortune to have her as a next-door neighbor. 
   She had a quick wit, but she also had a very warm smile. And it was her smile, her warmth, and her sense of humor that could win over even the most ardent foe. 
   She believed in straight talk. Her candor about her personal life enabled her to tell hard truths in her political life. And in her waning months, she faced her battle with cancer with the same fighting spirit and the same sense of humor that defined her life. 
   I think that there are two places not often the focus of reflecting on Ann Richards' life where her effect is particularly notable. One is in our schools. Until January, I represented Ann Richards Middle School in La Joya, Texas. I could see how those young people from a poor economic area were enriched by their contact with Ann Richards and the inspiration that she provided them with her continued participation long after she completed her tenure as Governor. And, now in Austin, we are starting the Ann Richards School For Young Women. Its purpose is one that Ann devoted much of her personal life to--inspiring and serving as a mentor for young women. And now, in this school, many middle school girls will find that they too can fulfill their dreams and fully participate in all sectors of our society.     
   A former teacher, Ann knew what a difference quality public education could make in the lives of young women and young men, and these institutions serve to remind us of what she accomplished. 
   But the second place is with her family. She has two daughters, two sons, who are active participants in the life of our community and of our country. I think that they speak volumes about the kind of mother and the kind of family person that Ann Richards is, and they continue to live the legacy that she established. 
   She set high standards and inspired countless Americans to do the same. Her loss means that all of us who share her values must redouble our efforts.

   This is an Administration that has desecrated our Constitution, debased our values and repeatedly undermined our freedoms. For a party that purports to hate Big Government, these Republicans sure do seem to love Big Brother. They demand unlimited Executive power and unrestrained authority to intrude into our everyday lives. Today, we dare to impose some limitations on one of so many examples of their callous disregard of our liberties. 
   If even former Attorney General John Ashcroft, sitting there in his hospital bed in intensive care, if even he could recognize the illegality of the surveillance that DICK CHENEY demanded, why shouldn't we in Congress be able to do the same? And if one telecommunications company had the courage to say ``no'' to this Administration's wrongdoing, why not the others? And why would we want to protect these corporate accomplices in the surreptitious destruction of our freedom from any accountability whatsoever?     
   Yesterday, we told this President ``no more blank checks for Iraq.'' And today we say no more unauthorized blanket surveillance of American citizens. Those of us who love liberty must stand up to this Administration's fear-mongering, to its continued leveraging of fear for its own political purposes. 
   As Mr. Cheney's current chief of staff once said and what many Americans now recognize is an irresponsible and unconstitutional expansion of Presidential power: ``We're going to push and push and push until some larger force makes us stop.'' 
   Well, today we must be that force. This Congress must stay ``stop.''

   Our Republican colleagues say today that, well, you don't have to borrow the money. Why don't you just cut spending? Well, that's the very question that we asked President Bush's representative when he came in front of our committee, and he stood there and he kind of scratched his head and said, I can't think of any spending cuts, nor have these Republicans offered a single spending cut to finance this $50 billion tax cut. 
   No, their approach is their old borrow-and-spend approach that they've used for the last 7 years. The debt goes up; the dollar goes down. We have the specter on the horizon of both inflation and recession, and they follow the same old broken policy. 
   I believe that they are holding taxpayers across this country hostage to force the Congress to borrow more money for yet another tax break. It does not make good economic sense, nor is it equitable.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, this pathetic excuse for a Medicare bill is made necessary by a Republican refusal to tackle waste, fraud and abuse. To fulfill an ideological dream, taxpayers are compelled to continue wasting billions of dollars to fund abusive private Medicare Advantage plans run by Bush administration buddies, rather than less expensive, more effective traditional Medicare. 
   And while doctors are rightly protected from a scheduled payment cut, how about the millions of poor seniors who are cut off from access to extra help for prescription drug coverage? As with so many battles in this Congress, where it is a contest between the poor and a well-financed special interest, guess who gets knocked out? 
   This shell of a bill actually means that millions of our youngest Americans will still be barred from access to the Children's Health Insurance Program, and, of course, it will enable my State, Texas, to maintain its dubious distinction of being number one, the number one State in the country with children who have no health insurance, due largely to the indifference of then Governor George Bush, now the ``vetoer in chief'' when it comes to children's health insurance. 
   This House had approved the CHAMP Act. Today, about all that remains of it, thanks to continued Republican obstructionism and one veto after another, is what could be called the CHUMP Act because it reeks of fiscal irresponsibility and social inequity. Something may be better than nothing, but this is barely something. In 18 months we'll correct it.

   Mr. DOGGETT. Yesterday's Senate vote for another blank check to President Bush for the Iraq war was as wrongheaded as the Senate's original 2002 blessing for that invasion, despite the strong opposition of most House Democrats. 
   Of course the Iraq surge has worked. Not the surge in Iraq. That surge has failed miserably, failed to achieve any of the political objectives, the benchmarks that the President set himself. No. The only surge that has worked is the propaganda surge here in Washington. Hemorrhaging more dollars and more blood into the sands of Iraq is not a formula for achieving success. 
   The taxpayers' price for Iraq is $3 billion every week of every month of the year. Take all the money that is used to research and seek a cure for cancer at the National Institute for Cancer, that is how much money we spend in Iraq in 2 weeks. But whether deaths are up or deaths are down, ``the Administration's consistent response is the troops cannot come home.'' 
   We need to learn from the courage displayed by our troops. My colleagues in this House need to learn from that courage and vote to limit any more funding in this war to a fully funded, safe, redeployment from Iraq that begins today.

If their points are clear and justified, I would want them to do that in front of the American people and not in a secret session, unless it in some way compromised the confidentiality and the classified nature of the material. 
   And that is why I am trying to be sure that if I come tonight, as I intend to do, to this session, and I hear an hour or 15 or 20 minutes of debate that has nothing to do with these classified materials, I want to know if I am going to have the right to raise a point of order that this is conducting the  public's business in secret and that we have been brought here under false pretenses. I assume that won't happen, but I want to be clear before going into this session what my rights are pursuant to the unanimous consent agreement. Because if the unanimous consent agreement does not protect that, then it would be appropriate, I suppose, at this time, to ask that the agreement be amended to provide something along those lines.

It is a very, very serious matter when we do the public's business in secret. That is why it has only been done three times since 1825. And it is a very bad precedent for this House to get into the business of conducting any of its business in secret, except, and Mr. Blunt appears to provide the exception, except under a circumstance where there's classified material on something as important as the security of our families. And so long as we have set out all the parameters of the meeting in the agreement, then I have no problem with it. But I don't want it to wander off in debate, which now my friend tells me I can't talk about afterwards, because I came to this secret session about something that maybe didn't need to be secret.

The only purpose of your requesting this secret session is to present to the House, or have others present, matters that you feel you cannot present in public concerning matters that are classified.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   There are 44 million seniors and individuals with disabilities who carry in their wallets or in their purses something that makes them unnecessarily more vulnerable to identity theft, and that is their Medicare cards. Apart from the Social Security card, itself, the Medicare card is the most frequently issued government document displaying a Social Security number. This practice invites foul play. 
   To protect both the savings and the peace of mind of Medicare beneficiaries, I've introduced with the assistance and the encouragement of my  colleague from Texas, the ranking member on the Social Security Subcommittee, Mr. Johnson, the Medicare Identity Theft Prevention Act. This bipartisan legislation would require Medicare to take the steps that private companies and that other government agencies have already taken to protect the identities of our seniors. 
   Every time a senior or an individual with a disability hands over a Medicare card, that person is handing over the keys of financial security. With increasingly sophisticated thefts by identity thieves, inaction is unacceptable. Seniors have saved and have built over their lifetimes their financial security and their reputations.     
   Their savings and their credit should not be put needlessly at risk if someone steals their Medicare card. Just as a doctor swears an oath to do no harm in practicing medicine, Medicare should make sure that it does no harm to the financial security and credit rating of its beneficiaries. The Medicare Identity Theft Prevention Act will help to ensure that the government better protects seniors from identity theft, denying thieves access to this critical data. 
   The private sector and government agencies, including the Veterans Administration and the Department of Defense, have begun to protect Social Security numbers from identity thieves. But Medicare has not yet taken appropriate steps to do this, hence this legislation. 
   Inaction jeopardizes the safety of millions of our seniors and individuals with disabilities. This legislation has the support of the Consumers Union, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, the National Silver-Haired Congress, and the Texas Silver-Haired Legislature, as well as the Elder Justice Coalition. 
   Seniors confront many threats to their retirement security these days. This bill is one way to prevent their falling victim to swindlers. I urge the adoption of the bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, I think our colleague from Texas. Mr. Johnson has done an excellent job of outlining the scope of identity theft. It's something we hear about every day and sometimes think it's about someone else in some other place until it strikes a friend or loved one. 
   We need to do a great deal to address identity theft. This is one small measure to encourage the folks at Medicare to begin to phase in a new type of identity marker for Medicare beneficiaries so that we will eliminate this particular source of the problem of identity theft. 
   I want to acknowledge Kathleen Black on Mr. Johnson's staff, Jackie Binder on mine, as well as our colleague, the chairman of the Social Security Subcommittee, who will be completing his last term here, Mike McNulty of New York, and also to acknowledge the great interest and help from our colleague Representative PAUL HODES of New Hampshire who filed similar legislation and then worked with us to get this legislation approved. He's unable to be here today, but he's been very concerned about the identity theft issue and has offered great help in fashioning this legislation. 
   And with that, Mr. Speaker, I believe the problem is clear. The small step we're taking through this legislation is clear, and I would move adoption of the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. I thank my colleagues for bringing this bill to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, today we honor a son of Texas, Sergeant Henry Ybarra III, born and raised in south Austin, and a member of the parish at San Jose Catholic Church. On September 11, 2003, he was killed in Iraq, the first of a number from our State capital in Texas to lose their life there. 
   I attended his rosary personally, joined by Marine Thomas Cruz, a member of my Congressional staff at that time. Today we honor Henry's sacrifice to our Nation by officially affixing his name to the post office on South Congress in Austin, the road that leads up to our State Capitol. 
   Henry long knew that he wanted to devote his life to service. His mother, Mary Jane, remembers it as early as age five. His father, a veteran of Vietnam, would find young Henry marching around in his dad's boots and cap. Henry wasted no time making that dream a reality, enlisting in the Army only months after graduating from Johnston High School. That father, Hank, is at this very moment still convalescing from both his own service in Vietnam and the impact of the loss of his son. We wish him continued progress in his recovery, and express our deep gratitude for what he has given personally to our country. 
   Henry's military career spanned a dozen years, earning numerous honors and awards. He met his wife, Lilian, while stationed at Fort Hood in Killeen, and his career took his family with daughters, Alyssa and Gabrielle, and his son, Henry IV, as far away as Germany. His commanding officer described Henry's easy manner and said, I wish I had a troop full of soldiers with his attitude and outlook on life. 
   As Pericles once spoke of ancient Athens, so it is with our democracy today: ``If it should appear great to you, consider then that her glories were purchased by valiant men, and by men who learned their duty.'' 
   With this bill, our Nation pays tribute to a valiant man, Staff Sergeant Henry Ybarra, and to all those valiant men and women who serve and have served under our flag. The veterans groups Tejanos in Action, the Catholic War Veterans Post 1805, the Knights of Columbus Council 10148, the American GI Forum, along with LULAC and other community organizations, have been strong supporters of the effort to memorialize Sergeant Ybarra by naming the South Congress station in his honor. 
   Tejanos in Action is a unique organization that addresses the needs of our Hispanic veterans, and by providing its services to our community, provides a meaningful tribute to Henry and others who have served our country. I salute Dan Arellano, the Commander of Tejanos in Action; Moses Salda&#241;a, who works closely with the Knights of Columbus at San Jose Church, and the Catholic War Veterans and all those who continue to serve and inspire our youth with their service. 
   Last year, I participated in the dedication of the Nicholas Perez Elementary School, as the Austin Independent School District recognized another brave son of south Austin lost in Iraq. Such memorials rightly honor men and women who have given their lives in service. They are daily reminders of both the valor of these young people and of our need to prevent war or its unnecessary escalation. With the death toll now rising towards 4,000 unique human beings tragically lost in Iraq, there may not be enough physical memorials to honor individually the sacrifice of all those who continue to fall. 
   For Sergeant Henry Ybarra and his friends and family, he will always be in their hearts. With this memorial naming, new generations will learn of Sergeant Ybarra's selfless sacrifice and be inspired by that service.

   Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, for over five years I have attempted to close a gaping loophole in the Lobby Disclosure Act that has permitted various lobbyists to form over 800 stealth or hidden coalitions to avoid the requirements of the act. That effort had been met with nothing but indifference. Finally we now have a new Congress and a new direction. 
   Under the legislation Mr. Conyers offers today, we incorporate the provisions of that Stealth Lobbyist Disclosure Act. Here is how it works: A lobbyist for an unpopular cause, like those who would avoid their taxes by renouncing their American citizenship and moving abroad, or by those who would deny climate change, instead of indicating who they actually represent, those lobbyists claim they represent a ``coalition'' of two or more individuals and avoid any indication of the true parties in interest. 
   When deep-pocketed interests spend big money to influence public policy, the public has a right to know. Even a little light can do a lot of good. If wealthy interests want legislators to sing their tune, the public has a right to know who is paying the piper. 
   Of course, President Harry Truman said, ``The buck stops here.'' But with stealth lobbying we don't know where ``here'' is or whose buck it is. 
   This stealth lobbyist disclosure provision helps close this loophole. The bill amends the definition of ``client'' to require the disclosure of the members of a coalition or association so that a small number of people or corporations can no longer operate under a shell group and destroy the intent of our lobby disclosure laws. Combining ``wealth'' with ``stealth'' is a recipe for unaccountable government. 
   After years of indifference, we have a new Congress dedicated to open government and the pursuit of the public interest. This rule and this legislation should be approved.

   Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, farm and ranch families deserve a safety net, and fiscal responsibility demands that we pay for it. We pay for this farm bill, every penny of it, and some of it is done by stopping one group of multinational corporations from dodging their United States tax liability. For too long they have enjoyed a free ride from these Republicans, at the expense of other American taxpayers. It is wrong, and we are putting a stop to it. 
   Our target is very narrow: No company headquartered in the United States of America will have its taxes go up one penny, nor will it have any significant impact on any foreign corporation with whom we have a tax treaty, as we do with most developed countries. Indeed, 90 percent of the revenue, according to the nonpartisan staff of the Joint Tax Committee, comes from companies that have tax hideaways with these countries down in the Caribbean that have no tax treaty and no corporate taxes or little taxes. And the remaining 10 percent of revenue from their proposal, most of it is going to be simply a matter of shifting taxes between countries in tax credits. 
   I have listened to these Republicans identify one company after another that they cried big crocodile tears about, and I haven't heard them identify a single company that is likely to have an increase in its taxes as a result of this proposal. 
   There are others hiding in the shadows that know they have no justified case. And they have some of their friends out front, including one company that I read an e-mail from yesterday saying they don't like my bill, but it doesn't affect them a penny. That is the people that own Ben and Jerry's. 
   Well, today the Administration may be teaming up with those willing to kill this farm bill by defending these foreign tax evaders, but that is not the tune they were singing 5 years ago when in this Treasury report they said ``an appropriate, immediate response, an immediate response, should address the U.S. tax advantages that are available to foreign-based companies because of their ability to reduce the U.S. corporate tax on income from their American operations.'' 
   Mr. Brady says Treasury did something about it? They sat on their rear and didn't do anything about it. And if you need any proof of that, gentleman, turn to the President's budget 5 months ago. He turned to this same source of revenue and all this job-killing tax proposal you are talking about. How many jobs did his $2 billion proposal that he put out here 5 months ago in February kill? Well, you haven't suggested there are any, because even this President, President Bush, admits there is a problem here that needs to be fixed, and this committee gets about fixing it. 
   You talk about jeopardizing 5 million jobs. What a lot of nonsense. That is all the jobs of all the foreign subsidiaries in the United States, the vast majority of which are corporations that are not touched by this proposal. 
   Your problem isn't jobs. Your problem is you never met a tax loophole you didn't like. You never met a tax dodger you didn't want to help. You have done a good job of doing it, and it is time we fix that. 
   I don't know why it is that a farm and ranch family in High Hill, Texas, or a drugstore on the main street of Bastrop, Texas, ought to have to pay higher relative taxes on their earnings than some multinational with a fancy CPA and a law firm and a hideaway in Bermuda. 
   It is wrong, and each of us must stand to choose between the two.

   Gimmicks? Gimmicks are what got us into Iraq in the first place. It certainly wasn't the ``war on terrorism.'' 
   You can make all of the excuses that you want for continuing to embed our troops in a civil war, but a vote today for the Iraq Redeployment Act is a vote to end endless war. It is a vote for a fully funded, safe, and orderly redeployment that allows us to refocus on the war on terrorism, which is a threat to our families, rather than the civil war in Iraq, which is not. 
   It is not the enemy that has us pinned down in Iraq today; it is this Administration's unwillingness to admit its mistakes and its lies. 
   The intervention in Iraq was this country's largest foreign policy blunder. Now it is time for Congress to intervene. With this war in its fifth year, for Congress not to act now is for Congress to become an enabler and an accomplice to the Administration's errors. 
   Vice President Cheney rightly complains about the Iraqis proposing to take a two-month vacation. But what is really at fault here is Mr. Cheney and this Administration's four-year vacation from reality. 
   ``Victory'' is improving our families' security. Pursuing policies contrary to that objective, committing the same error over and over again, that is defeatist.

   Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady. 
   When parts of Texas endure an extreme drought, the burden is felt most heavily by our farm families. A devastating lack of water left many of our counties parched. Sam Berry, a rancher from Lavaca County wrote me to say: ``After back-to-back bad seasons and with all my reserve hay gone, how much worse could it get''? 
   Well, as bad as that drought was down in Texas, it is nothing like the drought of understanding for the plight of farmers and ranchers here in Washington. They have faced indifference on top of indifference. 
   Federal disaster assistance dried up. I received similar pleas from farmers and ranchers like David Wagner in Lavaca County and others from Bastrop County and Caldwell County and Fayette and Colorado counties. The last Congress, with $10 billion to burn every month in Iraq, had nothing to offer these ranchers here at home. When our new Congress finally passed emergency help this March, that help was vetoed by the President. 
   The bill that we pass today is another attempt to provide much-needed assistance to these farmers and ranchers. 
   I know that ranching looks mighty easy over in the Oval Office when some over there seem to think that clearing out brush in August is vacation work. But for those for whom ranching is not a hobby, who have found that their fields turned fallow; for those like Pat Peterson of Red Rock whom high-priced hay means selling their best livestock, disaster endangers a life and a livelihood. 
   This spring, Texas has had some relief. But who is to say this wet spring will last, and it is not enough to make up for the last two really bad seasons that our farmers and ranchers have endured. Helping our farmers and ranchers now cannot guarantee them success, but it will go a long way in helping restore what has been lost and protect what remains. 
   I hope the House tonight will approve this bill and that the President will finally get behind the relief that his fellow Texans need so very much.

   Mr. DOGGETT. We are hearing the same old tired Republican borrow-and-spend rhetoric. They're all for our middle class tax relief and extension of important tax incentives; they just don't want to pay for it. They would rather borrow from our grandchildren. ``Borrow it, you'll like it.'' That's the misguided approach we've followed for 7 long years under this Bush administration. And look at the mess it has gotten us into: the dollar going down by the day, the specter of inflation and recession occurring at the same time. And now, because of our Democratic commitment to pay-as-you-go government, what we do in this bill is to reduce the revenues coming in by about $76 billion in mostly middle class tax relief over the next 5 years, and then replace those same revenues with another $76 billion. 
   It's balance. No new debt. And that is the type of fiscal responsibility that is anathema to our Republican colleagues and this administration. The best that they have been able to do is offer us more empty demands to just cut spending to pay for this legislation. President Bush sent his representative from the Treasury Department to our committee on this very bill, and we said, ``well, what specific spending cuts do you have to pay for this bill if you think that's the way to do it?'' And he scratched his head, and he couldn't think of a single spending cut, nor have our Republican colleagues sought any. Their approach is just more borrow and spend. 
   Let's be clear about it. Over the last 7 years, no one in this country has spoken louder about fiscal responsibility and cutting spending than President Bush, and no one in this country has done less about it. 
   Ole Rip Van Bush, he snoozed while the spending soared, and he just borrowed more and more with a happy face toward our children. 
   Today, we Democrats fulfill our pledge to stop making things worse so we eventually can be able to turn them  around. A vote for this bill today is a vote for middle-class tax relief, and it is also a long overdue vote to repudiate this Republican fantasy.

   As the gentleman points out so well, our objective here is to respond to the legitimate tax concerns of middle-class families, but to do it in a fiscally responsible way. No more will we borrow from our children and our grandchildren to finance tax cuts for the wealthy few now. 
   Mr. Chairman, I know, the gentleman from California, serving on the Ways and Means Committee, is very familiar with what we have gone through in this last 6 years of Republican borrow and spend policies. 
   I yield to the gentleman from California.

   Mr. DOGGETT. Let me say, I believe this is one of the most impressive, it can't be discounted as a Democratic group, because the gentleman is aware that the Concord Coalition is a bipartisan, nonpartisan group that has a Republican and Democratic co-Chairs. And they have said, again, in black and white, ``Thus, to be clear, the budget resolution does not call for or require a tax increase.'' It just demonstrates this imaginary demon that they have over here, which is about all they can unite around.

   Mr. DOGGETT. Of course, as the gentleman knows, that also jeopardizes our ability to preserve Social Security when you let that much debt and that much debt tax build up; and that is something else that we address in this resolution. We don't think when you talk about entitlements that just cutting grandma's Social Security check or reducing Medicare is the way to do it. We do need to come together on a bipartisan basis on entitlements. We could well have done that had President Bush not been so intent on privatizing Social Security. 
   But this resolution is well-rounded. That is why groups like the Concord Coalition have spoken out about it. And it is time now for the Republicans, like every child, to give up their imaginary demons and recognize they have done tremendous damage to our country in recent years. But if we work together on a bipartisan basis, it is possible for us to meet legitimate tax concerns, not increase taxes, and still meet the needs of our veterans and protect Social Security.

<DOCNO>Mr. DOGGETT. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, today's bill is a genuine prescription for lower prices for our seniors that should have been adopted a long time ago. Too often, our seniors hit the donut hole paying higher premiums with no drug coverage while the big drug companies run off with all the dough. 
   During my service on the Ways and Means Committee, at every opportunity, I have offered an amendment for the same purpose as the bill we have today, to negotiate to protect our seniors and our taxpayers. But due to the power of the mighty pharmaceutical lobby and some late night shenanigans that happened right here on this floor and kept the Congress up all night to serve the interests of the pharmaceutical interests under the old Republican Congress, for the first time in this unique situation, we tell seniors and individuals with disabilities the government won't help. 
   Indeed, I asked the Congressional Research Service to look at every statute on the federal books, and, boy, that is a lot of them. And they looked, and they were unable to find any language anywhere in any federal law like this that says to the government, you can't negotiate better prices for taxpayers and for seniors. 
   So, today we should repeal that unreasonable one-of-a-kind limitation. For these Republicans to come out here who passed legislation to deny the choice of the government to negotiate to help seniors and today declare themselves to be ``pro-choice'' takes great audacity. To harm our community pharmacists the way their bill has harmed community pharmacists and now come and claim they are on the side of the neighborhoods takes real audacity. But audacity is something that is never in short supply from these folks. 
   They ought not to be afraid to do something to help our seniors and disabled just because Big Pharma says ``no.'' Put seniors and taxpayers first. Break the stranglehold of the pharmaceutical lobby and enact this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. DOGGETT. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Chairman, I yield myself two minutes. 
   This is the time of year when millions of families all over the country are working with their high school seniors. The college applications are in, but now it is time to try to figure out how to pay for college and higher education. 
   The task of completing these complex forms for student financial assistance can be very daunting. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, as it is known, is 11 pages long. It includes more than 100 questions and it has three worksheets. The Secretary of Education has called it ``longer and more complicated than a Federal tax form.'' In trying to complete the current application, students would actually probably benefit from having gone to college to do the accounting necessary to be able to set foot in a college classroom. 
   As David Cay Johnston, a Pulitzer Prize winning author and New York Times reporter comments in his new book, ``Free Lunch,'' each year an estimated 1.5 million students decline to seek federal student financial assistance for which they are eligible because the form is too complicated. 
   A report produced by the Institute for College Access and Success supports the approach that is taken in this amendment, and it identifies about a third of the questions that it highlights in its report as being questions that could be deleted if we could simply get two bureaucracies to communicate with one another. 
   That is really all that this amendment is about, trying to make the forms less complicated by getting the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Education to communicate with each other and eliminate the confusion, to share data that is already available. This amendment would authorize the Secretary of Education to provide for the use of tax data that the IRS has available when the student aid form is due in February.     
   Under this proposal, students would not lose their ability to correct any information that the Department of Education gets that might not be accurate. 
   The access would be improved; the accuracy would be improved. And it works both ways: just as we want to be sure that no student eligible for aid is denied that aid, or as is currently happening, because of the complex form, we also want to be sure that no student ineligible gets that aid. 
   That's one of the reasons that the Bush Administration proposed something similar to what I am advancing, because they were concerned that about $350 million every year in assistance is provided and lost as a result of inaccurate information. So it will be a two-way street: get the information that is needed, minimize the confusion and the bureaucracy, and help more students obtain the opportunity to get a college education. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DOGGETT. I thank the gentleman for his comments and for the support and encouragement that he and his staff have provided us on this amendment. I also want to thank the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce for bringing this to my attention. 
   Austin is an area that has a very dynamic economy, and so much of our success results from the fact that our business leaders are enlightened and recognize that one of the best investments we can make is in our people. We have been concerned with a workforce shortage, with needing more highly skilled, highly educated people, and this is a measure that the Chamber identified as part of its ``20,010 by 2010'' initiative of trying to get college graduates from our area that can staff our many high-tech and other companies. 
   I salute Sandy Hentges and Drew Scheberle and the many other members of the Chamber staff and leadership for their work that led to this amendment. 
   Let me just say in conclusion, thanks for the bipartisan support for this measure. I hope only that with our measure, for which we have considered a variety of different versions during recent months while working with the committee, I just hope that both of the bureaucracies involved here will really heed this amendment and will move expeditiously because it will ensure more young people have an opportunity to obtain a college education and have the support they need, and it will also reduce the cost from those who are receiving assistance improperly. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time and urge adoption of the amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett). 
   The amendment was agreed to.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, we were reassured that ``progress'' was being made in Iraq 500 deaths ago, 1,000 deaths ago, 2,000 deaths ago, and 3,000 deaths ago. 
   Like the boy who cried wolf, this President cries ``progress.'' What progress? 
   With all this talk about benchmarks, I think it's time to get off the bench and bring our troops home now, with an immediate, responsible, and safe redeployment. 
   President Bush says as we approach five years of being in Iraq, he says ``listen to the generals.'' 
   Well, we've listened to them, and his top general says if we followed his course, if we stay his course, we'll be in Iraq fighting for another five to ten years. 
   Real progress would begin by adopting today's very modest proposal and moving forward united so that our troops are not caught up in a final disastrous position in Iraq, and that we responsibly redeploy to protect our families, rather than generating one generation after another of jihadists.

   Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, it is noteworthy that throughout this debate not one company anywhere in America has come forward and said ``if you pass this bill, you raise my taxes,'' because the vast majority of foreign companies and no American companies are impacted whatsoever. 
   Today, we must choose who to stand with. We choose to stand with the farm and ranch families that need this assistance and the small American businesses that are paying their fair share of taxes. We reject the notion that the only way you can lure a foreign company to come to America is to tell the foreign company that they should pay less taxes than Americans. It is a clear choice.

<DOCNO>Mr. DOGGETT. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. I thank the gentleman. 
   This debate is late, very late, thousands of deaths too late. This escalation scheme is an unmitigated disaster. 
   President Bush seems determined to continue to make the same old mistakes, just make them a little bit bigger; defying sound military judgement; defying the Iraq Study Group; defying the wishes of our allies and the Iraqis themselves; and, most particularly, defying the will of the American people. 
   This President continues to pursue a go-it-alone strategy in Iraq. Like most every problem that he has created, and there are many, he seeks only to pass it along to his successor, who we will elect next year--pass along in this case what is no doubt the most colossal foreign policy failure in American history. 
   The administration's top budget official told me in a hearing just last week that ``the best minds in the Pentagon'' see no need to fund this escalation, which has not yet really begun, for more than another seven months. In truth, our military has been so overstretched that it cannot sustain a prolonged escalation, even when it unfairly recalls inadequately supplied troops for a second, third, and fourth tour of duty. Little wonder that the Secretary of Defense, Mr. Gates, admitted last week that he is already looking for another plan after this escalation falls short. 
   This week, this House, we say ``stop the increase.'' And next, we must begin the decrease with a phased withdrawal from Iraq. We should not act precipitously, but we must move very expeditiously to extract our troops from the crossfire of the warring factions in this civil war quagmire. 
   To our troops, whose courage we honor today in this very resolution, we say to you, those of who you who are out there on the front lines today, we will do everything we can to protect you; but we will also be working as hard as we can to bring you home safely to your families sooner rather than later. 
   There is a better way to show support for our troops than just sending more of them to be killed. There is a better way than continuing to give this President a blank check for war funding. Unless we move forward to place firm limitations on the appropriations, we will leave this war-making President constrained only by DICK CHENEY's imagination. 
   The words of our adversaries in this debate have often been very short, but their true conflict is not really with us; it is with reality. They are in a losing war with the truth. Iraq has never been the central front in the war on terrorism. Like the alleged connection between 9/11 and Iraq, like the claim that Saddam's nuclear mushroom cloud was looming just over the horizon, this charge is but another falsehood foisted off on the gullible. 
   The central front on the war on terrorism was largely abandoned by President Bush in his ideological rush to invade Iraq. Vital resources and expertise that were needed to capture Osama bin Laden and the terrorists who caused 9/11 were cut in Afghanistan when President Bush ran into Iraq. The real war on terrorism suffered a major setback from which today it has still never recovered. That is the only ``cut and run'' that now endangers our families. Nor does this debate in the people's House embolden the enemies of democracy when we exercise democracy here in America. 
   To me, the terrorists seem mighty emboldened with their daily death and destruction that they wreaked across the Middle East long before anyone ever conceived this resolution. Frankly, it is the administration that is the terrorists' top recruiter. 
   As we predicted at the outset, this war is creating new generations of terrorists who view it as a war against all Islam. We cannot kill our enemies fast enough with the current policies creating more of them every day. 
   And now this President is stoking the flames of war with Iran. Ironically, that is the only country in the world to have directly benefited from his attacking Iraq. Widening the war to Iran with the macho slogan that ``boys go to Baghdad, but real men go to Tehran'' risks an even wider, even more destabling debacle that can eventually involve our families in a third world war. 
   Having failed entirely to learn any lessons from Vietnam, this administration seems to already have forgotten our experience in Iraq. Some here who profess to be conservative have been very liberal with billions of misspent taxpayers' dollars and very liberal with the blood of others in the sand of Iraq. 
   President Bush was absolutely correct when he personally declared his war in Iraq to be a ``catastrophic success.'' He has certainly been successful at creating one catastrophe after another in Iraq. 
   Our Nation is great enough with sufficient resources and creativity to change course, but each day we delay we sink further into a quagmire from which fewer and fewer choices remain. We must step back from the abyss

<TEXT>
   Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, we certainly do need a balanced, enlightened trade policy. But this debate is not about trade, it is about the guiding principle of the Bush Administration--arrogance--arrogance that has served our country so poorly. 
   This President, personally proclaiming himself to be a ``uniter, not a divider'' at the beginning, quickly transformed himself into the ``decider.'' And that lone decider has unleashed one divisive, disastrous decision after another on our land. Mr. Cheney's current chief of staff, he summed up this attitude very directly: ``We're going to push and push and push until some larger force is going to make us stop.'' Well today, our Speaker, backed up by this House, says ``Stop.'' 
   The go-it-alone, disdain for allies, dismissal of anyone who has a different point of view, has left this White House isolated. It has left us with a disastrous war, and now Mr. Bush's recession. 
   We'll secure a more responsible, enlightened trade policy, but we won't secure it until we trade it for a new President.
