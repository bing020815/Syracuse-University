<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (RELATING TO THE HOUSE PROCEDURES CONTAINED IN SECTION 803 OF THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT, AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, before the Democrats became the majority party in this institution, they waxed eloquent about fiscal responsibility. The now-Speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, the gentlelady said, ``It is just absolutely immoral, immoral for us to heap those deficits on our children. No new deficit spending.'' 
   And before he became the majority leader, the distinguished gentleman from Maryland said, ``There is no more single burden of responsibility more crucial to bear than tackling the deficit honestly and head on.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, that is what they said before they became the majority party. We have discovered, Mr. Speaker, their words were cheap. Their deeds are very expensive. 
   Since becoming the majority party 18 months ago, we have seen, under their watch, the Federal deficit double. 
   Mr. Speaker, under the Democrats' watch we have seen the single largest 1-year increase in the Federal debt. 
   Mr. Speaker, under the Democrats' watch we have seen the Federal Government's unfunded obligations go to the largest number ever, $57.3 trillion. 
   Mr. Speaker, under the Democrats' watch we have seen the largest Federal budget ever. 
   Mr. Speaker, under the Democrats' watch, just yesterday, just yesterday a blank check was given to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that ultimately could cost the taxpayer $5 trillion. 
   And not to be outdone, Mr. Speaker, today the Democrat majority turn off, turn off the Medicare trigger designed to save the program for the next generation. Again, Mr. Speaker, the Democrats' words were cheap. Their deeds are very, very expensive. 
   The trigger means that we begin the reform process in Medicare, and it also means that we will spend $178 billion, almost a 7 percent increase, over the next 5 years. And how do we reform it? 
   Mr. Speaker, we ask that this body put patients and doctors before personal injury trial attorneys. That is what we do. And we ask that maybe the upper income of our Nation be able to pay a little bit more for their prescription drugs. 
   Now, what happens, Mr. Speaker, when the Democrats do nothing? 
   Well, according to the General Accountability Office, ``The rising cost of government entitlements are a fiscal cancer that threatens catastrophic consequences for our country and could bankrupt America.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, join with us, put the next generation above the next election. Work with us to ensure that we can get better healthcare at a more reasonable cost. Do not get rid of this Medicare trigger that so many of us worked so hard to place in this valuable program.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in unenthusiastic support of this legislation. Perhaps it is a true sign of bipartisanship. I think if we were all honest with ourselves, we would say there was much about this legislation that disappoints us; yet most of us will support it. 
   Mr. Speaker, my own personal disappointment is I see very little economic stimulus in this so-called economic stimulus package. I see tax relief, income tax relief, for those who do not pay income taxes. I see tax relief for middle-income families, which is very important, very important, Mr. Speaker, at a time when their paychecks are squeezed with high energy costs, with high food costs, and high health care costs. But I don't confuse temporary tax rebates with economic growth. 
   Now, I did look closely, and there is some economic growth component of this legislation of which I approve. But ultimately, true growth doesn't come from temporary tax rebates. It comes from allowing entrepreneurs and families and capitalists to actually have their own capital to expand and grow the economy. 
   The last time our Nation was facing a recession, I went to a small factory in my district called Jacksonville Industries. They employed 21 people. They were an aluminum die cast business. Because of competitive pressures, they were on the verge of laying off two people. But because of the tax relief passed by this Congress, particularly expensing capital gains tax relief, they bought a new piece of equipment. And that new piece of equipment made them more competitive, and instead of laying off two people, they hired two new people. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I ask the question, surely middle-income families, I know they need help, but this package, I fear, is more akin to helping them pay one month's worth of credit card bills at a time when people are getting laid off at the local factory when, instead, what they really need to know is that their paycheck is preserved and that they have opportunities to even grow that paycheck and that their employer can become more competitive and give them more opportunities to advance and grow that paycheck. And, Mr. Speaker, unfortunately those components are sadly lacking. 
   If we wanted those components in the bill, the first thing we would do, Mr. Speaker, is try to prevent all of these scheduled tax increases on families and the economy that our friends on this side of the aisle have put in place. The second thing we would do, Mr. Speaker, is try to make our business tax rate more competitive with our international competitors. We have the second highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. That's what we need to do. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, many people here come with their theories. I come with evidence. If you look early on in 2003, if you look to the Reagan administration, the Kennedy administration, when you're faced with a recession, lower marginal tax rates, lower capital gains rates, and you will grow people's paychecks. That's the economic growth that we need.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I certainly thank him for his leadership in this area. 
   If I could paraphrase President Ronald Reagan, the closest thing to eternal life on Earth is a Federal program. And certainly the legislation that comes before us today helps prove this. 
   When TRIA was brought to the floor, and I, admittedly, was not here but I have read the Record, supposedly it was to be a temporary program at a time of great economic hardship to our Nation. 
   I just heard the gentlewoman from New York speak very eloquently on the subject. But I recall from the Record her own words: ``We are simply working to keep our economy on track with a short-term program that addresses the new terrorist threat.'' 
   Now we are being asked for a 15-year extension on what has already been a 5-year program. 
   The gentleman from Pennsylvania, who is now our chairman of the Capital Markets Subcommittee: ``We wisely designed the TRIA Act as a temporary backstop to get our Nation through a period of economic uncertainty until the private sector could develop models.'' 
   Now, maybe those on the other side of the aisle have a different definition of ``temporary.'' I was here to vote for the TRIA extension, and I voted for it. I thought that the market needed some time to develop. But let's face it. If we vote for this, we are voting for a permanent, a de facto permanent, huge government insurance program on top of those that we already have, none of which, none of which, are financially sound. 
   And we have to remember when we are hearing debate on the floor about how critical it is in the fight against terror that we have terrorism reinsurance. I believe terrorism reinsurance is important, but I think even more important in fighting terror is prevention, ensuring it doesn't happen in the first place. And yet we have Member after Member after Member on the other side of the aisle that would make it more difficult for our government to monitor the conversations of suspected terrorists. We have Member after Member on the other side of the aisle voting to assure that a portion of our intelligence budget, to paraphrase the former Director of the CIA, goes to spying on bugs and bunnies instead of terrorists. Prevention is what is key in the fight against this terror. 
   Now, of course, reinsurance is important, and, again, as I said, I voted for another extension. But to hear those on the other side of the aisle, they would say, well, there is no way that the market can develop this. I'm not sure I agree with that, and I know that the President's working group on financial markets doesn't agree with that. They say that the availability and affordability of terrorism risk insurance has improved since the terrorist attacks. Despite increases in risk retentions under TRIA, insurers have allocated additional capacity to terrorism risk, prices have declined, and take-up rates have increased. 
   And let me quote here from this working group: ``The presence of subsidized Federal reinsurance through TRIA appears to negatively affect the emergence of private reinsurance capacity because it dilutes demand for private sector reinsurance.'' 
   Now, the chairman, whom I certainly respect, and he is entitled to his own opinions, he doesn't believe the market could ever develop. Well, I would respectfully say to our chairman: How are we ever going to know? How are we ever going to know when you are giving away something for free that the market otherwise would charge for and all of the signs are there that the market can develop? 
   Some tell us this is a new risk that we don't know how to model for. Well, there was a time when the insurance industry didn't know how to model for airline catasrophes. They didn't know how to model for data processing collapses. And this is not the first time in our Nation's history that we have faced great threats. How did we model the Cold War when thousands of nuclear arms were pointed at us and somehow construction still took place in America? 
   Construction has taken place in New York based upon a 3-year extension, not a de facto permanent extension, but based on a 3-year extension with higher deductibles and with less government subsidy. 
   So I don't believe that building is going to come to a complete stop. But if there is a market failure, we could have worked on a bipartisan basis for something restricted that was temporary, dealing with nuclear, chemical, and biological, with large deductibles and large industry retentions. 
   Instead, we are going to create a massive new insurance program that threatens the taxpayer, another great threat to this Nation. We should oppose this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentlelady for yielding, and I certainly rise in opposition to this bill. I have no doubt that it is certainly good-hearted but it is certainly wrongheaded. 
   There is a great challenge in our housing markets today, but I come here with some interest and amusement to see how many of my friends on the Democratic side of the aisle bemoaned the Bear Stearns bailout by the Federal Reserve, only to come here and offer a bill that, ultimately, using the States and localities as a conduit, is going to bail out Wall Street. It's going to bail out the investors, the people who own these properties in the first place, the people who made bad debts. 
   I wish somebody would introduce a bill to bail me out of my bad debts. Perhaps next time I invest in real estate or the stock market or the commodities, somebody will come here and say, if I failed, we will get the taxpayer to come in and bail me out. 
   Second of all, it misses the point of what the true challenge is. The true challenge in our housing markets is a shrinking paycheck, and I know as much as our friends on the other side of the aisle wish to come and blame all the economic woes of our Nation on us, the truth is elections have consequences. They've been in charge of the economic policy of this Nation for almost 18 months now. And what have they done in 18 months? 
   Number one, they passed a budget that has the largest single tax increase in American history, largest single tax increase in American history. After 3 years fully phased in, it's going to be a $3,000 average burden on the American family. That shrinking paycheck causes people not to be able to pay their mortgage bills. 
   We know what's happened to gasoline prices, almost $4 a gallon. Shrinking paycheck. Now supposedly they were going to bring the price of gas down when they were elected. The American people know differently, and it's not just gasoline that's $4 a gallon. Milk. I've got a 6-year-old and a 4-year-old back home in Dallas, Texas. They drink a lot of milk. Milk's expensive. The cereal they like, it's expensive, all happening under their watch. A shrinking paycheck. 
   How are people supposed to afford their mortgage when they're having to pay historic high gasoline prices, historic high food prices and pay an extra $3,000 in taxes? Madam Chairman, that's the real challenge that America's families are facing now. 
   And here's another problem with this particular piece of legislation that I find. It ignores the greater crisis in America, and that is the spending crisis, the one that is ignored on a daily basis here. Already we notice that when the new Member from Louisiana was sworn in today, we all saw that he had his baby in his arms, and, I don't know, it might have been a 1-year-old or 2-year-old child, but that child already has inherited a debt of almost $200,000 because Congress after Congress keeps on spending money and sends the burden to future generations. 
   So, you know, what is it? It's $7.5 billion for grants here and $7.5 billion for loans there. Well, Madam Chairman, sooner or later we're talking about real money.     
   We're on the verge of being the first generation in America's history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living. And it's not just me that's saying it, it's the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of Management and Budget, the General Accountability Office. And yet again, the Democrat majority ignores that true crisis. 
   I also find it quite interesting that while the Federal Government continues to be awash in the sea of red ink in passing on unfunded obligations to future generations, that almost every State and municipality in the Nation is running a surplus.

   Mr. HENSARLING. So we're taking money away from a treasury that has none to supplement treasuries that do have some. We have a great challenge in our Nation. 
   And clearly predatory lending took place, I might add, so did predatory borrowing. And so we need to help people, but the way to help them when people are struggling to pay their mortgages is not to raise their taxes and force them to pay the mortgages of their neighbor, particularly a number of neighbors and Wall Street investors who speculated, who might have engaged in fraud. 
   But Madam Chairman, back to the States and localities. For example, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts spends $11 million a year on their Office of Tourism. If we're having a great housing crisis, maybe they could cut back a little on the tourism budget and help the people in need for housing.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Again, if this is such a great priority for the States and they're crying out for these loans and grants, why does the State of Massachusetts continue to spend $760,245 for pools and spray pools under the control of the Department of Conservation and Recreation? 
   Michigan, $9.4 million to enhance public boating access and dock facilities. I have no doubt, Madam Chairman, that this is important. But again, if we have a housing crisis, maybe the good people of Michigan could cut back a little on their boating access facilities. 
   State of Ohio. They apparently have a wonderful ``Discover Ohio'' tourism and marketing campaign, $8.2 million. Maybe they could use some of that money to assist the people in their State. 
   How about some of the municipalities? According to the Daily News, Los Angeles spends a half a million dollars, $550,000 to be exact, for calligraphers to decorate proclamations and honors. I'm sure that those proclamations are very handsome, but again, if we're having a housing crisis, maybe people in Los Angeles can cut back on the calligraphy to assist the people in need. And yet the Democrat majority--and the gentlelady from California who perhaps  is familiar with the calligraphy--has decided instead to take the money away from the Federal Treasury, help raise taxes on hardworking American families while they're trying to fill up their cars to take their children to school, to try to go to work, so that ultimately we're subsidizing Ohio tourism, L.A. calligraphy, water boating access in Michigan, and the list goes on and on. Surely we can find something that is more fiscally responsible and more creative than yet another grant and loan program to States and localities that ultimately bail out investors and Wall Street. 
   This is bad legislation. It should be defeated.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Chairman, I will yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, I thank the ranking member for his comments and again bringing up what is a very important issue here. And that is fundamentally what we have before us is a Wall Street bailout bill. Now we all know there are some very significant challenges in our housing markets. But the answer is not to be bailing out lenders. They may be good lenders who made bad bets, and maybe they are the predatory lenders that we hear so much about. This bill doesn't make any particular distinction. 
   The people who can stay in their homes, if they just get a little help, we need disclosure. We need to enforce the law against fraud. There has been a lot of mortgage fraud on the borrowers' side, on the lenders' side. 
   Most importantly now, Madam Chairman, we need to prevent the single largest tax increase in American history passed by the Democrat majority in their budget which means that people who are struggling to pay their mortgages are going to have to pay more taxes. 
   The rising fuel cost, that's happened under the watch of the Democrat majority; the rising cost of food happened under the watch of the Democrat majority. They've been in charge of the economic policy of America for almost a year and a half now. It is the shrinking paycheck of the hardworking American homeowner and taxpayer that's at the crux of this problem. 
   And so what this underlying bill does is take $15 billion of money away from the school teacher in Mesquite, Texas, struggling to pay his mortgage; the guy who works at the Pepsi bottling plant in Mesquite; the rancher out in Athens, Texas; takes money away from  them to bail out all of these bad investors who made these bad bets. 
   So you can't say that you were concerned about Bear Stearns and then all of a sudden turn right around and have this humongous Wall Street bailout bill. 
   My amendment is simple. Presently, you have a $15 billion bill, half of which are loans and half of which are grants. The purpose of the amendment is to turn this into strictly a loan program. Now, I don't believe in the purpose of the underlying bill. But, if you're going to bail out Wall Street and use taxpayer money, let's at least, at least try to make it a loan so that there is at least some chance, some chance that the taxpayer who's facing a $3,000-a-year increase in their taxes for a family of four over the next 3 years under the majority budget, that maybe, maybe they have some small chance of recouping some of that money from all of these cities and localities. And by the way, again, the last I looked, almost every single State and municipality in America is running a surplus.     
   Yet the Federal Government isn't, and so what does the underlying bill do? Hands out more grant money, more grant money on top of the $57 trillion of unfunded obligations that every man, woman and child in America already owes. Well, let's add some more grant money. 
   Well, if it's that important to States and municipalities, maybe they would want to fund it or maybe they could take the loan money and eventually pay it back so maybe the Democrat majority wouldn't have to raise taxes on the Federal taxpayers quite as much. 
   So, Madam Chairman, it's a very commonsense amendment. If you're going to do it, at least do loans and don't do grants. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HENSARLING. I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Well, first, I would say to my friend from Georgia and other friends on that side of the aisle, if loans are so bad, why are they in the bill in the first place? 
   Second of all, this bill does nothing to stop foreclosures, not a thing. Quite the opposite. Instead, it will increase foreclosures. 
   What you have is an incentive for these investors to no longer do a workout with the struggling family, but instead, I can get bailed out. I can get bailed out by the Federal taxpayer. This is a bill that will help banks, Wall Street and States and does nothing for foreclosed families. It certainly does nothing for the taxpayer, and if we have a liquidity problem, which we do, let's cut the capital gains tax rate and you will see capital come into this market. I urge adoption.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I've heard some very eloquent comments from my friends on the other side of the aisle about the pain the American people are feeling at this time. They speak with some credibility. They helped cause it. 
   After 18 months of being in control of the economic policies of our Nation, what do we have? We have gasoline approaching $4 a gallon, milk already over $4 a gallon, people struggling, struggling to put groceries on the table, and seemingly our friends on the other side of the aisle said that is unrelated to people trying to pay their mortgages and keep their home. 
   The biggest enemy that we have to the American Dream of homeownership is a shrinking paycheck. What has been done by the Democrat majority to shrink the paycheck? 
   Well, number one, they passed a budget that has the single largest tax increase in American history. Over a 3-year period, we will see an extra $3,000 tax burden put on a family of four while they're struggling to pay their mortgage payments. 
   We were told that somehow under their watch gasoline prices would come down. Instead, they have gone up. We see food prices absolutely unaffordable, and yet they see no connection to the home mortgage challenge that we have today. 
   Many of them have decried Wall Street bailouts, but what do they do? They bring a bailout bill to the floor, up to $300 billion of taxpayer exposure, and all a lender has to do is say, you know what, as long as he agrees to a 15 percent haircut, we will take his risk and put it on the taxpayers. When you're struggling to pay your own mortgage, you shouldn't have to bail out the speculators, those who engaged in mortgage fraud. You shouldn't have to bail out somebody else. There's a better way to do it, and it is not this humongous bailout bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I wish to join a number of my colleagues in congratulating the new Democrat majority for their work in the area of earmarks. We know that earmarks are perhaps a small portion of spending in this body, but they are a large portion of the culture of spending. And I certainly salute them for that work; but, Madam Speaker, I must reluctantly oppose this rule because of the so-called PAYGO provision which has been adequately pointed out is really a tax-go provision. 
   If PAYGO indeed lived up to its name, it would be worthy of support, but it is not. I fear that it is nothing more than false advertising. I listened very carefully to our new Speaker yesterday when I believe she said that there would be no new deficit spending under the watch of the Democrat majority. But as I look at this so-called PAYGO provision, I see nothing that deals with entitlement spending, which threatens to bankrupt future generations, our children and our grandchildren, with either massive debt or a massive tax increase. 
   Over half of our budget deals with entitlement spending. There is nothing that deals with that. It doesn't deal with baseline budgeting. Now, most Americans don't know what that is, it is inside baseball, but it is an accounting concept that would make an Enron accountant blush. It puts in automatic inflation for government programs, yet we don't call it new spending. And yet there is nothing in this so-called PAYGO provision dealing with that. And we don't even have a statute. 
   It is also false advertising, Madam Speaker, because it doesn't live up to what the Democratic majority advocated when they were in the minority. We have a rule; we don't have a statute, the rule that will end up being waivable. We don't have the sequester mechanism of earlier PAYGO. We don't have the wedding with the discretionary caps that we had. And, indeed, what we have is a subterfuge here. What we have is a Trojan horse for more tax increases on small businesses and American families that threaten the jobs of Americans, and we must vote this down

   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, let nobody make a mistake about it. I know the Democrats are trying to cast this as a debate about insuring poor children. That's false. We have Medicaid. We could reauthorize the current SCHIP program now in the snap of a finger, but that's not what this is about. 
   Instead, this is a debate about who will control health care in America. Will it be families and doctors, or will it be government bureaucrats? This is a proxy fight for the Democrats to take that first step towards socialized, government-run health care in America. That's what this is all about, and there should be no mistake about it. 
   We've got a program for children that insures adults. We've got a program ostensibly to help the poor that can subsidize people making $82,000 a year, and they're going to do all this with a huge tax increase on smokers, and we're going to need 22 million new smokers in 10 years just to pay for it. 
   If this bill passes not today not tomorrow but at some time, the children of America will suffer. If this program passes, and I hope all the mothers of America are paying very careful attention to this, because if this passes, in the years to come they won't wait minutes or hours to see a doctor of their choice. They will wait weeks and months to see a doctor chosen by a government bureaucrat, and that doctor will not be the doctor of today. It will be somebody who is less competent, less able to take care of their child, and that's what this is all about. 
   If you care about the children, reject this bill tonight.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank my dear friend for yielding. 
   I rise in opposition to this rule. I find it somewhat ironic that apparently Members have 5 days to insert something into the Record, yet we have less than 24 hours to actually read a 300-page bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, maybe some people are confused about the debate. Those of us who have plowed through this bill are not. Make no mistake about it, this is a government-run, socialized health care wolf masquerading in the sheepskin of children's health care. 
   This is only the first battle in this Congress over who will control health care in America. Will it be parents, families and doctors? Or will be it Washington bureaucrats? That's what this debate is all about. 
   As one of my colleagues, the gentlelady from Oklahoma (Ms. Fallin), said, and I'll paraphrase, the Democrats now want to turn over your health care, your family's health care to the same Federal Government that can't get you a passport, that can't keep illegal immigrants from crossing our border, and could not competently render aid after Hurricane Katrina. And that's who they want to give your family's health care to. 
   Now, again, the Democrats claim this is all about insuring low-income children. That debate is false because they know, Mr. Speaker, Medicaid takes care of the children at the poverty level in the current SCHIP program, takes care of the working poor. And today, the Democrats know they could get overwhelmingly bipartisan support if they would reauthorize that, but that's not what they're bringing to the floor. They're bringing us a program that will insure adults, insure families making up to $62,000 a year and in some cases $82,000 a year. And they do this by taxing working poor, by a massive tobacco tax that primarily falls upon families with less than $30,000 in income. That's right, Mr. Speaker, they're going to tax the working poor to give subsidies to those making up to $82,000 a year. 
   In order to finance this program, the Heritage Foundation has concluded they're going to need 22 million new  smokers over the next 10 years just to fund this program. 
   The Congressional Budget Office said that in effect they will also in this bill take family-chosen health care plans away from 2.1 million families and stick them with a government-run plan instead. They're taking children off of family-chosen health insurance and putting them in government-run plans. 
   Every American child deserves access to quality, affordable, accessible health care. They deserve the kind of health care that we in Congress and our children enjoy, but that's not what they're receiving here. Instead, in a matter of years, when mothers in America have sick children, they will wait weeks and months to see a marginally competent doctor chosen by a Washington bureaucrat that may or may not do anything to help their children. That's not the way it ought to be in America. We can do better. 
   Defeat this rule. Defeat this bill.

   Now as the ranking member said, Mr. Buyer from Indiana, we all support an increase in GI benefits. But do you want to do it in such a way that the Secretary of Defense and the Commander in Chief says compromises our all-volunteer Army? I am the son, I am the grandson, I am the brother of veterans. I honor these people. But to harm our all-volunteer Army is not the way to do it. 
   And then we have heard lectures about well, we have to pay for it. Well, why yesterday did this body hand out Federal subsidies to millionaire farmers and then today turn around and try and tax them. A tax on small businesses is the way we're going to pay for this? It's absurd.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I certainly understand the passion behind this debate, for I, too, have friends and loved ones who have been stricken with debilitating diseases who are longing for hope. 
   But in listening to the debate, Mr. Speaker, I fear not one in 100 understand what it is truly about. This is not a debate on whether stem cell research is legal in America. It is. It's not even a debate on whether or not embryonic stem cell research is legal in America. It is. It is not even a debate on whether the Federal Government will be permitted to fund embryonic stem cell research. It does, to the tune of roughly $40 million a year. 
   What this debate is about, Mr. Speaker, is whether or not, going forward, should taxpayer funds be used to destroy what many consider to be human life for research purposes. And this is especially, especially highlighted when we know that there are ethical alternatives and promising alternatives, such as adult stem cells, umbilical blood cord, amniotic fluid and, today, headlines, banner headlines all around the Nation about the promise now of skin cells. Let's fund stem cell research, but let's fund it ethically. And, Mr. Speaker, when this body takes on such profound issues, let's always err on the side of life.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to thank him for his outstanding leadership on the issue of fiscal responsibility, coming to the floor and offering this series of amendments. 
   I do want to thank the chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member. Certainly relative to many other appropriations bills that we have seen and will see on this floor, relatively speaking, this is a more fiscally responsible bill. 
   But we can never forget that this is not our money; this is the people's money. And every time we are increasing some aspect of the Federal budget, we are taking it away from some family budget. We are taking it away from some family that had a dream of having a down payment on their first home. We are taking it away from some family who was putting that money away for college tuition for one of their children. 
   So contrary to the debate we hear and the rhetoric about cuts, what this amendment does is say, you know, let's lead by example. In the big scheme of the Federal budget, I know this isn't a huge amount of money. But when you think about having to save us from the single largest tax increase in history that the Democrat majority put in their last budget, shouldn't we lead by example? Is this apocalyptic vision that we hear, is this going to happen if we give the legislative branch the same money they had last year? Somehow there are families all across America who are having to make do on the same income they had last year. 
   Now, again, relative to other bills, this is more fiscally responsible. But it comes down to a simple choice: Do you want to put us on the path for the largest single tax increase in American history that would impose $3,000 of additional tax burden on American families, or do you want to put us on the path of fiscal responsibility? We should support the gentleman's amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Well, I thank the gentlelady for yielding, and I want to thank her for all the great communications work that she does for the conservative caucus in Congress, the Republican Study Committee. Thank the gentleman from California, our Budget and Spending Task Force chairman for the excellent work he does in helping bring this debate to the American people. And you know, the gentlelady is so right. This debate really reduces down to a very fundamental issue. Do you want more government and less opportunity, or do you want more opportunity and less government? 
   People in this institution need to remember that every time they vote for more money for some government program, they are taking money away from some family program. 
   In many respects, Mr. Speaker, this isn't a debate about how much we are going to spend on health care or how much we are going to spend on education. It is a debate about who is going to do the spending. Republicans want families to do the spending. We want small businesses to do the spending. And yet, our friends on the other side of the aisle, the Democrats, they want government to do more of the spending. 
   Now, as I am fond of saying, people are entitled to their own opinions, but they are not entitled to their own facts. As a member of the Budget Committee, I just came from a hearing earlier this morning on our annual budget that was quite instructive. We heard accusations of massive tax cuts. 
   Well, it is kind of interesting, because when you look at the record, when we have provided tax relief to the American people, guess what? We have ended up with more tax revenue. We have the greatest amount of tax revenue that we have ever had in the history of the United States of America. And in 2004, after the pro-growth tax relief, tax receipts were up 5.5 percent. Well, how did that add to the deficit, Mr. Speaker? 
   In 2005, tax receipts were up 14.5 percent. Well, how did that add to the deficit? In 2006, 11.8 percent. And now in the first quarter of the first quarter of 2007, they are up approximately 7.2 percent. 
   Now I am not here to tell you that every time you engage in tax relief, you get more tax revenues, but, guess what? Facts don't lie. 
   You are entitled to your opinion. You are not entitled to your own facts. When you allow small businesses and American families to keep more of what they earn so that they can save and invest and create more jobs, guess what? They go out and do it. So that is myth number one that somehow by allowing American people to keep more of what they have earned, that somehow that is adding to the deficit.     
   The deficit has dropped. The American people are not overtaxed. Government spends too much. 
   Now, we have another myth in the debate that I heard in the Budget Committee this morning, and that is talk  about all the massive budget cuts. Well, Mr. Speaker, people have to be very careful. I took the liberty of looking up the word ``cut'' in Webster's dictionary. It means to reduce. Ninety percent of the time somebody in Washington talks about cutting a budget, what they mean is that the budget isn't growing quite as fast as I want it to grow, and so, therefore, that is a cut. I mean, that is like somebody's child coming up to him and saying, Dad, I would like an extra dollar a week in allowance. And you say, Well, you know what? Maybe you deserve an increase in your allowance, Daughter. I will give you 75 cents. And they say, Gee, Dad, that is a 25 percent cut. I wanted a dollar extra a week, and you are only giving me 75 cents. Well, the point is you are getting 75 cents more. 
   So we are going to hear the usual misleading rhetoric about all these budget cuts. But guess what? Since President Bush came into office, and I know we will hear about this one, total antipoverty spending is up 41 percent, one of the most dramatic increases in the history of America. That is assuming that you think that somehow government is ultimately going to solve this problem. And if you look at almost every major budget area and don't just look at what has happened under the Bush administration, as long as Republicans have been in control of Congress, look for the last 10 years, you can see energy up almost 200 percent; education spending, elementary and secondary education, 100 percent. So, again, you are entitled to your own opinions, but you are not entitled to your own facts. That simply does not equate into a cut. 
   So we will have increased debates as we go through and talk about this budget. But what is most exciting is that because of the economic progrowth tax relief provided by a Republican Congress, we have over 7 million people who now have paychecks who used to not have paychecks. We have one of the highest levels of homeownership in the history of America. We have the highest stock market we have had in a long time. And these people want to raise taxes on the American people.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (REPUBLICAN STUDY COMMITTEE -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I certainly thank the gentlelady for yielding, and I especially thank her for her leadership. She was one of the prime architects of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights that was unveiled today in the United States Capitol. It is a very bold concept that we have, and that is that taxpayers, taxpayers ought to have rights that will be as respected and as revered as those that are enshrined in our United States Constitution. 
   Now, why is this so important? Just within the last 2 to 3 weeks, we have heard reports now from the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of Management and Budget, the Government Accountability Office, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the Secretary of the Treasury, every single person, or every single department that is in charge of either the monetary or fiscal policy of our government have all come to the same conclusion; and that is the number one challenge that we face, the number one fiscal challenge that we face in America is the out-of-control spending represented by what we call entitlement spending. 
   Now, our friends on the other side of the aisle, they don't want to do anything to help reform entitlement spending. They don't seem to want to work with us to find better, smarter, more accountable ways to deliver health care and to deliver retirement security at a more reasonable and affordable cost. So what that means is, there will be a tax increase, yet another tax increase on the American people. 
   Now, immediately, they have their sights on the tax relief that was passed in the last few years, the tax relief that has now created over 7.5 million new jobs in America; 7.5 million more people are working now because of the economic growth due to that tax relief. They want to do away with that. 
   We have the highest home ownership we have ever had in the history of America, home ownership, part and parcel of the American dream, and thanks to this tax relief, we have that. Household net worth is up. The unemployment rate is lower than it was in the average of the 1990s, the 1980s, the 1970s, and even the 1960s. All of this is due to tax relief. 
   But our friends on the other side of the aisle, they want to take it away. They would take the working poor and increase their taxes 50 percent. They would take away the 10 percent bracket, bring back the 15 percent bracket. They bring back the marriage penalty, the marriage penalty. Tomorrow, if you fall in love, you get married, you pay higher taxes. The list goes on and on. Now, that is bad enough, but that is just what would happen immediately if we don't have a Taxpayer Bill of Rights. 
   More importantly, as time goes by, just to pay for the government we have today, the government programs which are on automatic pilot to grow exponentially, if I remember my 8th grade geometry, it's not growing like that, it's not growing like that, it's growing like that. These programs are growing exponentially. What is going to happen is, as time goes by, the children and grandchildren of our families, they will be facing a tax increase of almost double their present taxes. 
   Again, let me restate that, double taxes. The average American family today pays about $20,000 a year combined in their Federal income taxes and their payroll taxes. People who are viewing this debate now, their children, their grandchildren, are going to be facing a crushing tax burden of almost $40,000. 
   Again, don't take my word for it. Go to the Web site of the Office of Management and Budget. Go to the Web site of the Government Accountability Office. 
   The Comptroller General, I guess you would call him the ``chief green eyeshade guy'' for the Federal Government, our key actuary, has said something along the lines, and this is a paraphrase, that we stand on the verge of being the first generation, the first generation in American history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living. 
   Mr. Speaker, my wife and I have a 5-year-old daughter and a 3-year-old son, I am not just going to sit idly by and allow that to happen, allow that to happen. We have to have a Taxpayer Bill of Rights today to save the taxpayers of the future from this crushing burden. Shame on us if we do nothing, if all we do is look to the next election and not the next generation. 
   That is why it was so important, particularly having the help of the gentlelady from Tennessee in helping craft this Taxpayer Bill of Rights, four very fundamental principles that are so important to the future of this 
   country. 
   Number one, and probably the most important principle, every taxpayer ought to have the right to have their Federal Government not grow faster than their ability to pay for it. What a radical concept to think that if your family budget grows 3 or 4 percent, why should the Federal budget grow 7, 8 or 9 percent? 
   Ultimately, we cannot sustain that growth rate, because every time, every time we balloon the Federal budget, we are putting the family budget in a vice. That means there are families all over the Fifth District of Texas, that I have the honor of representing in the hallowed halls of Congress, some family in the Fifth District of Texas, now they are not going to be able to send a kid  to college because there is a plan, they don't have any rights as taxpayers, and their taxes are going to get increased 50 to 100 percent. 
   Some family in the Fifth District of Texas will not be able to enjoy their version of the American dream, express their entrepreneurial spirit and start their first small business. Some family in the Fifth District of Texas, they are not going to be able to get the proper, long-term care for an aged parent, all because Uncle Sam will take more taxes, more and more taxes, just to pay for the programs we have today. 
   So we believe that every taxpayer ought to have the right to have their Federal Government not grow beyond their ability to pay for it. The Federal budget should not be growing faster than the family budget. 
   Second of all, we know how important Social Security is to our seniors. Not only am I a father, I am very happy that I have parents who have Social Security. It is part of their income. It is a very important program. 
   But every taxpayer who pays into Social Security ought to have the right to know that their Social Security taxes will be used only for Social Security. We know if we don't reform that program, if we don't take it away from big spending liberals in Congress, they are just going to blow it on something else. That is not right. 
   Every taxpayer should have the right, should have the fundamental right, who pays into Social Security, to have that money go to Social Security. 
   Third, the Tax Code is wrong. It is unfair, it is complex, it is unconscionable. It ought to be pulled out by its roots and thrown away. Every taxpayer should have the right to a fair and simple Tax Code, one that they can understand, one that they don't have to employ an army of lawyers and accountants to explain to them, a Tax Code where, if you call the IRS, you shouldn't get five different answers just because you talk to five different people about a problem. 
   They ought to have a right to a Tax Code that, due to its complexity, doesn't send jobs overseas. 
   It is time to sunset the Tax Code. We want to sunset the Tax Code in 3 years and force this body to replace it with something that will be fair, something that will be simple. 
   Winston Churchill once said that Americans will usually do the right thing once they have exhausted every other possibility. It is time to exhaust the other possibilities and help force this Congress to do the right thing and scrap the Code. 
   Fourth, the fourth right of the conservative movement in the House, the Republican Study Committee, we believe that every taxpayer ought to have the right to have their Federal Government balance the budget. Families all across America have to balance their budget. Why doesn't the Federal Government balance theirs and balance it without raising their taxes? 
   Of course, we can balance the budget if we double their taxes, if we take away their hopes to send a kid to college, if we take away their hopes to start a small business, if we take away their hopes of providing long-term care for an aged parent. Sure, that is one way of balancing the budget, but there is another way. It is for Members of Congress to actually do the hard labor of prioritizing all the Federal expenditures and getting there and reforming ancient programs that are no longer fulfilling their mission, or maybe they already have. Maybe they have already achieved success. 
   It wasn't too long ago that I figured out that we were still paying for Radio Free Europe. I don't know how many people who are listening to the proceedings this evening remember Radio Free Europe; it served a very vital role in helping win the Cold War. But if I remember my history properly, the Berlin Wall came down in 1989. We should have given everybody at Radio Free Europe a great party, given them a great bonus check and used that money to help shore up Social Security. 
   President Ronald Reagan once said the closest thing to eternal life on Earth is a Federal program. So we have to decide, what is the priority around here? We need to balance the budget. 
   The easiest thing Members of Congress do is, they say ``yes'' to some constituency today, and then they just go ahead and send the bills to a future generation. Just by leaving government on automatic pilot they are sending bills to future generations, because we know again, if the Democrats on the other side of the aisle will not work with us to reform out-of-control, runaway entitlement spending, again, our children and grandchildren are going to face a doubling of their taxes. That is unconscionable, absolutely unconscionable. 
   So we, the conservatives within the House of Representatives, represented by the Republican Study Committee, believe that taxpayers deserve four fundamental rights: a right to have a government grow no faster than their ability to pay for it; they should have the right that every single penny of their Social Security tax dollars goes to Social Security; they ought to have the right to a fair and simple Tax Code; and they should have the right to have the Federal Government balance the budget so that they don't end up paying half of their tax burden for previous generations. 
   So I am very happy that 100-plus members of the Republican Study Committee have come together to embrace this Taxpayer Bill of Rights. It is a very exciting concept, and one, Mr. Speaker, that legislation will be introduced in the weeks and months to come, that we will be talking about from coast to coast, north to south, east to west, that we believe will capture the imagination of the American people so that finally some amount of fairness and some amount of rationality can come in, because if we say ``yes'' to everybody who walks in our office today with their hand out, we end up saying ``no'' to our children's future.     
   And, again, I don't want to be a part of the first generation in America to leave the next generation a lower standard of living. That is not the American way. That is not the American dream. There is a better way, and it is called the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. 
   And with that I would be happy to yield back to the gentlelady.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   First I want to thank the chairman of the committee. I especially want to thank the ranking member, my friend from Kansas, for all their good work on this bill. I know a lot of good work went into this. 
   For one, I am still concerned that our overall spending levels in growing this bill are roughly twice the rate of inflation, I think 7.6 percent over the President's request. But I know a lot of good work has gone into this. 
   My amendment specifically would ensure that none of the funds in the bill would go to fund the Clover Bend Historic Site in Clover Bend, Arkansas, which, again, is one of the earmarks that is place in the bill. I don't mind admitting before this House that I am not a huge fan of earmarks. I am certainly not here to say they are all bad. Many are worthy. Many do good things. 
   But too often, as I look at the earmarking process, too often we see a triumph of the special interest over the public interest. Too often we see a triumph of seniority over merit. Mr. Chairman, up until recently, too often we saw a triumph of secrecy over transparency. 
   I will be the first to admit that this particular amendment and earmarks, in general, are a very small portion of the Federal budget. But, Mr. Chairman, I fear they are a very large portion of the culture of spending in this institution. 
   Mr. Chairman, I've been a veteran of several of these earmark debates. They tend to follow several different lines of argument. Typically a Member will come to the floor to defend his earmark and say he knows his district better than anybody else. That is true. They typically come to the floor. They will say, well, good things can be done with this money. 
   I am prepared to concede both of these points. I know the Member who offered this project knows his district better than I do. I know good things could be done with this money. 
   But let's put this expenditure in context, Mr. Chairman. We still have a deficit. It is declining, but we still have a deficit, which means that until we balance the budget, we are raiding the Social Security trust fund. In addition, spending is exploding. Look at what is happening in entitlement spending, which threatens to bankrupt future generations. Right now, we are on a fiscal path to either double taxes on the next generation or to have little Federal Government besides Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Yet, as I look around, almost every single State in the Union is running a surplus. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, I ask myself a simple question. There are a number of earmarks submitted in this bill. Again, I am sure good things can be done with this money. But can we continue, given this context, to fund earmarks of this type simply because, one, we have done it before, simply because we are creative and we can think of these things, simply because it is a good project? 
   I am not here to necessarily say it is a bad project. But given the entitlement crisis, given the fact that our Democratic colleagues in their budget resolution voted for the single largest  tax increase in American history, I just ask myself this question, is it truly a priority? Not is it bad, not is it wasteful, but is it truly a priority? Because every time we plus up some Federal budget, we are having to lower some family budget. 
   Again, I know the gentleman from Arkansas knows his district better than I do, but I know my district better than he does. Taxpayers from the Fifth District of Texas are going to have to help fund this particular earmark. 
   Mr. Chairman, I just fear that if we end up saying yes to everyone's program today, it is just a matter of time before we end up saying no to our children's future tomorrow. It is a small step. It is a small earmark. I understand this. But if you are going to lead, you need to lead by example. This is one small step we can take for fiscal sanity. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would restrict funding for the St. Joseph's College theater  renovation located in Indiana. Again, I want to follow up on some of my earlier comments and address comments that the chairman made. If he was listening to my earlier comments, I started out complimenting much of what I see in the bill, and to the extent I see a reduction in the number of earmarks, I take that to be a very good thing. 
   But I was elected by the people of the Fifth District of Texas, and with all due respect to all of my colleagues, I yield my voting card to no one or my judgment to no one. So I am not here to impugn the judgment of the chairman, but I may have different concerns, and the people of the Fifth Congressional District of Texas may have different concerns as well. 
   I believe that historical preservation is a very good thing, but I know that much of the funding that has come from the Save America's Treasure program, what started out ostensibly geared toward Betsy Ross and the Declaration of Independence, has ended up funding so many other different projects. 
   Do you know what? I have got a lot of worthy historical and cultural projects in my own district, in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas. I am just not sure, at a time when Members, many who have come to this floor and said they would not raid the Social Security trust fund; as long as we are running a deficit, and we are doing that; recently the Democrat majority in their budget resolution voted to increase the debt ceiling; in their budget resolution, they voted for the single largest tax increase in history; all I question is, given all that background, government will be paid for. Sooner or later, government will be paid for, either by this generation or the next. 
   So I am not saying these are necessarily bad projects, but I do question whether or not, given the context, particularly the entitlement spending crisis that is looming, if they are truly a priority. Clearly they are a priority in the mind of the chairman, and I sincerely respect his opinion, but they are not necessarily a priority to me or the people of the Fifth District of Texas. 
   In my district, I have the Grand Saline Salt Palace. It sits on top of one of the largest salt mines in the entire United States of America. It is a very unique museum, actually made of salt. They give away free salt samples so people won't go and lick the walls. This is something that is unique in America, but is it truly a priority that we should have Federal funding for? I don't necessarily think so. 
   Now, there has been a debate in this body before about the history of the hamburger. Well, in the State of Texas, they say the birth of the hamburger was in Athens, Texas, which happens to be in the Fifth Congressional District that I have the honor of representing. It was invented in the 1880s by Mr. Fletcher Davis at 115 Tyler Street in Athens. Maybe that is something that is worthy of Federal expenditure to preserve this. 
   The Texas State Railroad that takes people on an old steam locomotive throughout beautiful Piney Woods of east Texas has been in existence since the 1800s. It has some funding challenges. It is something that I think is worthy of preservation. But, again, given the context of the largest tax increase in American history, given that people are still raiding the Social Security trust fund, it is not something I personally feel comfortable coming to this body and requesting that we use Federal funds for these purposes. 
   These are great historical and cultural locations within my district, but I am not sure they rise to the occasion to meet the National Treasures Act language, particularly when, again, all this spending has to be paid for. 
   So, I understand that people are experts on their district, that they want to defend their projects. But, again, it is taxpayers from, among other places, the Fifth Congressional District of Texas, that are having to pay for all this. Therefore, they start to lose their American treasures, their ability to buy a home, their ability to send their children to college, their ability to start a new business. I am still working to preserve those American treasures, and that is why I submitted this amendment, and I urge its adoption. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prohibit funds in the bill from being used for Maverick Concert Hall preservation located in Woodstock, New York. I think the committee report provides $150,000 for this particular local project. 
   Again, the debate that I want to present now is similar to one I presented on some of the other earmark funds. I do want to address some of what I have heard earlier in the debate. 
   I would like to make it very clear to the chairman of the committee and to all my colleagues, I do not question the right to spend this money. I don't question the right of this body to expend these funds. I simply question the wisdom of expending these funds given that the Nation continues to run a deficit, given that we have a looming entitlement spending crisis. The Comptroller General of America has stated we are on the verge of being the first generation in American history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living. 
   I question the wisdom of the expenditure, given the fact that we just had a budget resolution passed, against my vote, passed against, contrary to the debate I offered on the floor, that would present the largest tax increase in American history, an average of roughly $3,000 per American family. 
   Now, I heard one gentleman early on, in defending his particular earmark, say it was a small amount of money. Relative to the Federal budget, I am sure it is a small amount of money. But for those of us who have consistently throughout our careers come to this floor to debate protecting the family budget from the Federal budget, to come to this floor and debate more freedom and less government, you got to start somewhere. 
   I don't understand the argument. It is either, well, this is such a small amount of money, why are we bothering, or I hear the argument sometimes, it is such a huge sum, we can't do that. That would be Draconian. 
   I kind of feel like, well, especially since I have small children and I read them bedtime stories, it is kind of like Goldilocks and the Three Bears. Either the porridge is too cold or it is too hot. When is the amount just right? 
   I heard one of the earlier speakers talk about responsibility to future generations. I agree. I spend a lot of time thinking about future generations. Again, I am the father of a 5-year-old daughter and a 3-year-old son, and I know everybody in this body loves their children and loves their grandchildren. But I think a lot about the debt and the tax burden that is going to be passed on to future generations. And, again, I fear that although earmarks represent a small portion of the Federal budget, they represent a large portion of the culture of spending that has now led to over $50 trillion of unfunded obligations in the Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security programs alone. 
   So, where do the steps, the baby steps towards fiscal responsibility, start?     
   I just believe again that with this looming entitlement crisis, that we need to do more. We need to set even a higher standard. We need to set even a higher bar for the expenditure of these funds. And I am sure these are interesting and worthy sites, although I haven't visited them. I am not sure if they are worthier or are more interesting than many of the sites in my own district. 
   Again, I start to think about the people who will have to pay this. I think about their American treasure. I think about a guy named Bruce in Garland, Texas, in my district. And when I asked him what is this tax increase going to do, and it is going to be a tax increase or debt that is going to pay for these earmarks, he said, ``Congressman, in my particular case, an additional $2,200 in taxes would cut into the finances I use to pay for my son's college education. I really believe that given more money, Congress will spend more money, so that is not the answer. A control and reduction of spending is what is needed.'' 
   And so I think about Bruce in Garland and about all of the Bruces in Garland. You are talking about $100,000 here and $100,000 there, and to paraphrase the late Everett Dirkson, pretty soon you're talking about real money. 
   When we are helping each other out, let's think about future generations who are going to end up paying for all of these earmarks. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prohibit funds in the bill from being used for the Bremerton Public Library Restoration Project in Bremerton, Washington. The supplement to the committee report provides $150,000 for this project. 
   According to a 2001 article in the Kitsap Business Journal, restoration of the building previously received a $100,000 grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. An equal amount was provided by the local government. The building is described in the same article as being a unique art deco style building. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has an endowment apparently of over $30 billion, and as of April 2007, the State of Washington was projected to have the eighth largest surplus in the country at $1.23 billion. 
   So, again, I question not that good things can't be done with these Federal funds, not that this is not a project worthy of preservation and restoration, I simply question the wisdom again of using Federal taxpayer funds on such a project given the background. And I will respectfully disagree with the gentleman who spoke before me, the gentleman from New York, given the largest tax increase in history. He may not believe it is the largest tax increase in history, but The Washington Post, not exactly a bastion of conservative journalism wrote: ``And while House Democrats say they want to preserve key parts of Bush's signature tax cuts, they project a surplus in 2012 only by assuming that all of these cuts expire on schedule in 2010.'' 
   It may be an expiration to the gentleman from New York, but to the people of the Fifth Congressional District of Texas, it smacks of a big tax increase. 
   And as I look at all of the different projects that have been brought forth tonight, I just ask myself a question: Is there any good project back home that apparently is not worth a Federal subsidy? If we say ``yes'' to all of these projects today, I fear we will be saying ``no'' to our children's future tomorrow. 
   Again, where is this money coming from? Government will be paid for. Either you are increasing taxes on the American people through the largest tax increase in American history, or you are going to pass on taxes even further by not doing anything to reform entitlement spending. That is the real fiscal tragedy. That is where the real scandal is. It is in the $50 trillion of unfunded obligations and not one word, not one word, Mr. Chairman, in the Democrat budget about what to do in entitlement spending. 
   Instead we have, again, local project after local project after local project. Maybe we have fewer than we had last year, and I assume the chairman is accurate when he says that and I salute him for that. But still, given the fact that the Federal Government is spending roughly $23,000 per American family, the largest level since World War II, given that the Democrat majority, over the course of 5 years, is about to impose a $3,000 increase in taxes on those same families, and given that we still have a Federal deficit that I have fought against since I have been here, often battling with my own party leadership, something I wish some of the people on the other side of the aisle who espouse a similar philosophy, I wish they would raise their voices occasionally. 
   Again, I would like to say that as worthy as many of these projects are, America's true treasures are the treasures to be found in the family, those dreams that are discussed around the kitchen table. That dream of launching that first small business, that dream of being able to finally send the first child to college. That dream of actually being able to afford the health care premiums to make sure that the family  is well. Those are America's true treasures, and those are the treasures that I am trying to preserve. 
   We have to go further in changing the culture of spending and not expending funds for any purpose simply because we think of it or because we say good things can be done. Better things can be done when the taxpayers keep their own money.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for leading this Special Order this evening. I thank him for his leadership on behalf of the people of New Jersey and behalf of the people of New York. The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett) never loses an opportunity to fight for the family budget. 
   And we know that families are struggling during this Christmas season; we know that their energy bills have increased. We know the price at the pump is high. Home heating oil for those, particularly in the Northeast, not in my part in the country in Texas, they face challenges there. They face challenges in trying to deal with their health care costs. 
   And what is the answer of this new Democrat majority? Well, it is the same answer as all Democrat majorities: tax more and spend more. 
   I am unacquainted with any society in the history of the world that somehow has taxed its way into prosperity. And, ultimately, more spending leads to more taxation; and this is a Congress that continues to spend more and more and more. Already, the Federal Government is spending on average over $23,000 per family of four, Mr. Speaker. And this is the highest level, the highest level since World War II on an inflation-adjusted basis. And yet this Democrat majority wants to spend even more of the people's money. 
   Earlier in the year, in their budget they had the single largest tax increase in American history that, when fully implemented over a 5-year period, is going to add $3,000 per year for an average family of four. 
   Now, I wonder, Mr. Speaker, what will that extra $3,000 in taxes taken away from American families to be given to the Federal Government, what is that going to do to the hopes and dreams of the average American family? How is that going to help them fill up their F-150 pickup trucks? How is that going to help them pay their home heating oil bills? How is that going to help them send a child to college? Well, the answer is that it is not. 
   Often, when we are having spending debates in the Nation's Capitol, Mr. Speaker, we are not really debating how much we spend, but we are debating who is going to do the spending. Is it going to be American families? Are they going to be allowed to keep what they have earned, what they have worked hard for? Are they going to be able to keep the bread on their table? Or are they going to have to give even a larger share to Washington? Notwithstanding the fact, notwithstanding the fact that they are already paying on average $23,000 per family of four. 
   Now, when you come to the floor of the House, you often hear our Democrat colleagues decry how we are not investing in this budget function or we are not investing in this budget function enough. Well, people are entitled to their own opinions; they are just not entitled to their own facts. And if you look over the last 10 years, for example, the international affairs budget has increased 130 percent; the energy budget, 293 percent. Now, transportation, 71 percent; health, 79.4 percent. And the list goes on and on. And in that same 10-year period, the family budget has grown by about 34, 35 percent. And so you have government on average growing over twice the rate of the family budget, and inflation over that same period has been just a little over 2 percent. So if you wanted to keep the same government that you had, you would have grown it at 2 percent a year; and, instead, it is being grown at closer to 6 to 7 percent. 
   Ultimately, American families will not be able to pay this bill. More and more taxes are being imposed on them. And so every time one of our Democrat colleagues comes to the floor to suggest another great new government program to be added to the other 10,000 programs, Federal programs that are already on the books, it puts pressure on the family budget. And, again, it is not fair to their dreams, their hopes, their aspirations for their families, on top of this $3,000 a year increase to the average family of four that will be phased in over 5 years in their budget. They have gone through and offered to increase taxes at least half a dozen times on American families and the American economy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. We passed H.R. 6, $7.7 billion over 10 years; H.R. 976, $1.3 billion over 10 years; H.R. 1562, $241 million over the next 10 years; H.R. 2419, $12.1 billion, and the list goes on and on and on. 
   Again, as Americans are striving to pay for their health care costs, their transportation costs, their education costs, why should they be giving more money to Washington, D.C.? And at this time when they are trying to make ends meet on top of the tax increase in their budget, on top of at least seven or eight tax increases propose this year, you have the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel), propose what has now become known in the press as the mother of all tax increases. 
   He will put a huge, almost 30 percent tax on millions of small businesses all across this Nation. Ninety percent of all Americans will pay more taxes under this bill. It will bring in an estimated $3 trillion taken away from American families and American small businesses. This threatens millions of jobs. 
   If we truly care about the American family and the economic perils and struggles that they face, then we want to make sure, number one, they keep the job that they already have instead of sending jobs overseas through excess taxation, regulation and litigation. And again, all of this spending ultimately has to be paid for, and it has to be paid for by a larger tax burden on  the American family and a job-killing tax burden on American small business. 
   So here we are when most American families are trying to put together a budget so they can participate and make sure that all of the children and grandchildren are taken care of at Christmas, and here we have a Democrat majority in Congress who are trying to pass an even larger budget, the largest budget in the history of the Federal Government, taking more money away from their Christmases, taking away the goodies in their stockings to feed this ever-increasing, tax-and-spend beast that they have created. 
   Again, I am unfamiliar with any society in history that somehow has taxed its way into prosperity, and that's what all this spending is resulting in now. So I am happy to join the gentleman from New Jersey to come to the floor now and make sure that the American people are seeing what is happening. 
   There is a process, and process ultimately leads to policy. We had a process in place that was supposed to pass separate spending bills so Members of Congress could actually read the bills. Wouldn't that be a novel idea, that you actually have an opportunity to read the bill before you vote on it. And Democrats would absolutely come to the House floor and criticize and excoriate Republicans if they didn't pass these bills on time, and now they have passed one out of a dozen. So they are going to roll them all into this thing called an omnibus, and the only bus quality about it is it is a fiscal bus; it is going to flatten the American taxpayer. 
   So, soon we will be presented with a thousand-page bill that we have hours to read that will be filled with pork-laden special interest projects which this Democrat majority claimed they were going to clean up. But instead, they have made it worse with all of their special earmarks, be it the tribute to the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee who takes $2 million of American family money to create a museum to himself; be it the gentleman from Pennsylvania who set up what the Wall Street Journal has referred to as Murtha, Inc., where now companies go out and hire lobbyists, and if they locate in his district, all of a sudden earmarks appear. There is no transparency there. There is no accountability there. But all of this is going to get wrapped up into one great big omnibus bill. 
   So when many of us would like to be with our families, and many of us have our families back home in our districts, not in Washington, D.C., instead we are here doing what we have to do, and that is protect the American families out there from this tax-and-spend machine that threatens their education and housing dreams, threatens their health care dreams, to ensure that the Federal budget does not grow beyond the ability of the family budget to pay for it. 
   Already the unfunded obligations of the Federal Government are in excess of $144,000 per individual, and yet the Democrats keep on spending along. There will be a day of reckoning. And so I am sure that the Democrats will come to this House floor and say we are only debating $22 billion in this omnibus spending bill. 
   Number one, I hope I am never in Washington so long that I have concluded that $22 billion is not a lot of money. $22 billion is more than we are spending on veterans health care in this Nation. It is a lot of money. And due to this artifice called baseline budgeting, that is going to grow in 5 years to be a $200 billion figure, imposing again thousands of dollars of taxes on the average American family when they are struggling to make ends meet. 
   And so this debate is really about two different roads. One road leads us to the largest tax increase in American history to be followed by an even larger tax increase in American history, one that threatens our children and grandchildren with a lower standard of living. And that is not my words. Those are the words of the comptroller general, the chief fiduciary officer of the Federal Government. He said right now the government we have, and I paraphrase, the government we have, if left on automatic pilot, no new spending programs, no new benefit increases, threatens the next generation with either, one, a doubling of their tax burden or, two, a Federal Government that consists of little more than Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. And yet the Democrats won't reform these programs. They keep on taxing and they keep on spending. 
   I don't plan to be a party to that. There is another path. It is a path to fiscal responsibility. It is a path to make sure that the Federal budget does not grow beyond the ability of the family budget to pay for it. That is why Republicans will come to this House floor to make sure that this omnibus doesn't run over the American taxpayer and to make sure that the American people can have greater freedom and opportunity than we have had before. But to do that, we have to put America on the path of fiscal responsibility and to live within a budget. 
   Don't let the Federal budget grow beyond the family's budget to pay for it. You cannot grow government at 6 and 7 and 8 percent a year and have the family budget grow at 3 percent a year. You can't sit here and tax American families at 3 and 4 and $5,000 more per year and then somehow claim that you have the Nation's priorities right. The priority of this Nation ought to be protecting the pocketbooks and security and freedoms of the American family. 
   So again, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey. He is one of the stellar leaders in this body in fiscal responsibility. He is a man who is always committed to principle, a real workhorse in this institution, and I am honored to be on the House floor tonight.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that really a 1-percent reduction in the requested increase? And so, for example, the Democrats may have suggested that some account grow by 6.7 percent, and this amendment said no, let's let it grow at 5.7 percent instead. So what we are calling a reduction, was that not really a reduction in the requested increase? Because at the end of the day, the Federal budget was still going to grow.

   Mr. HENSARLING. It is interesting. Rarely do you come to the House floor that somebody says, don't you have compassion? Don't you want to take money away from this American family and hand it over to this program over here? 
   And, again, I want our society to spend more money on education. I want them to spend more money on health care. I want them to spend more money on housing. I'm just not indifferent as to who does the spending. I want American families to do the spending. They want the Federal Government bureaucrats to do the spending after taking a huge hair cut for all the waste and fraud and abuse and duplication that takes place in the Nation's Capitol. 
   What I hear from my constituents, and I have the great honor of representing the Fifth Congressional District of Texas, which is Dallas and east Texas, and I hear from people like the Kirkendahls in Garland who wrote me: ``Congressman, at this point, between taxes and utilities we are at the breaking point of being able to keep a home. If we have an increase of over $2,000 per year in taxes, it may well be the straw that broke the camel's back.'' 
   Well, where is the Democratic compassion for the Kirkendahl family as they try to keep their home? 
   I heard from the Taylor family in Forney, Texas also in my district: ``Dear Congressman, I'm on the verge of foreclosure after 15 years in my house. I won't be able to make it if taxes continue to rise.'' 
   Well, where is this Democrat compassion for the Taylor family in Forney? I'm having trouble seeing it. 
   And so they forget about the people who actually do the work and pay the taxes, because it's their dreams once again. And so compassion, I believe that compassion ultimately shouldn't be measured by the size of a government check. It ought to be measured by the size of a paycheck. And all this Democrat spending is fueling more taxes, which will kill the jobs, kill jobs in this American economy. We start replacing paychecks with welfare checks; there's no compassion in that. 
   And I'll yield back to the gentleman from New Jersey.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Well, I thank the gentleman for yielding once again. And it is sometimes difficult for people to understand billions and trillions of dollars. But they certainly understand hundreds and thousands of dollars coming out of their paycheck. And so to put this in some kind of context, this largest single tax increase in history that was part of the Democrat budget resolution earlier this year, that equates to roughly $3,000 per year per family of four tax increase, $3,000. So I hope people all across America who are listening to this debate will listen very closely and write their Members of Congress, call their Members of Congress, e-mail their Members of Congress. 
   Do you really want that $3,000-per-year tax increase on your family? Can you afford that, to send more money to Washington, D.C. when they're already spending an average of $23,000 per family of four, the highest level since World War II?

   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding once again. And although I haven't kept a running tally, to the best of my knowledge, I'm unacquainted with any Federal program that has met its demise in this Congress. Instead, when you think about the 10,000 Federal programs that are already on the books, this Democrat majority is adding to them, with the exception of one agency in the Department of Labor that's supposed to provide accountability to labor union bosses to make sure that they don't misuse labor union funds. That was the only single agency that I'm aware of that has received a budget decrease of roughly 10,000 Federal programs, one to ensure the integrity of labor union funds to be protected from misuse and fraudulent use and criminal use by labor union bosses. 
   And so, again, the tax and spend machine goes on. And American families have to decide for themselves as they watch this debate during the holiday season what's going to be best for their families. Do they want to have a tax  increase in the neighborhood of $3,000 per family of four? Is that going to help them? Will sending that money to Washington help them with their fuel bills? Will sending that money to Washington better help them send their children to college? Will sending that money to Washington help them meet their mortgage payments, particularly if they have an adjustable rate mortgage and it resets?     
   We're talking about the here and now, but we also have to look at the future. As the gentleman was talking about, we hear the word ``compassion'' thrown on this floor frequently. People will quote scripture and talk about what have you done for the least of these. I always thought the least of these were those who do not vote and those who have yet to be born. They're the ones who tend to get ignored in this process. 
   So why now with all of this spending that the Democrat majority is doing, where is it leading us? Well, let me quote from the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke: Without early and meaningful action to address the growth of the Federal budget, particularly entitlement spending, the U.S. economy could be seriously weakened with future generations bearing much of the cost. Again, where is the compassion there? 
   Let me quote from the Brookings Institution, not exactly a bastion of conservative thought: The Nation's fiscal situation is out of control and could do serious damage to the economy in coming decades, sapping our national strength, making it more difficult to respond to unforeseen contingencies and passing on an unfair burden to future generations. Again, the least of these. 
   The General Accountability Office: The rising costs of government are a fiscal cancer that threatens catastrophic consequences for our country and could bankrupt America. 
   And these aren't my words. These aren't the words of the Republican minority. I mean, this is the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the head of the General Accountability Office, the liberal Brookings Institution.

   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey in talking about how terrible these tax increases are going to be on the American family, but it will be not only in direct terms to having a lesser paycheck, it also threatens the very existence of their paycheck. 
   I toured a small business in my district about a year ago called Jacksonville Industries. They're kind of an aluminum dye cast manufacturer, and before we had passed tax relief, they were on the verge of having to lay off two people. 
   And when I look at what's happening in capital gains and dividends, which really help fuels job creation, you can't have capitalism without capital. 
   Because of the tax relief the Republican Congress has passed, they were able to go out and buy some new machinery. I don't recall what it's called, and I don't exactly know what it does, but it was big and it was noisy, and most importantly, it made them more competitive. And because they were more competitive, and I want to say they had about 20 workers, instead of laying off two workers, they hired two new workers, all because of tax relief. Tax relief allowed them to invest in the American free enterprise system. 
   And so instead of having four people who could have been on unemployment and four people who could have been on welfare and four people who could have been on food stamps, instead, you had four people who had jobs, who had a future, who put a roof over their head, who put groceries on the table because of a paycheck, and yet the Democrat tax increases threaten that very paycheck. 
   Now, they offer compassion. Oh, we have this welfare check over here. We're going to increase the government budget over here. But you cannot increase the Federal budget without decreasing the family budget, and that's what this debate is going to be about this week. 
   Which path do you want to be on? Do you want to be on the path of increasing the Federal budget, threatening future generations with bankruptcy, with this fiscal cancer that's going to grow throughout our Nation, or do you want to be on the path where the Federal budget doesn't grow beyond the family budget ability to pay for it, a budget that doesn't include tax increases at a time when American families are struggling to pay their health care bills, their heating bills, their housing bills? 
   That's what it really is. It's a debate about two different paths. Now, they may look small to Democrats. They claim $22 billion isn't a lot of money. Maybe $22 billion today, and that is a lot of money, but that's quickly going to grow to $200 billion, and within a generation that's going to cause a doubling of taxes on the next generation. And children and grandchildren of America, if we don't stop this and stop it this week, will have a lower standard of living, less freedom and less opportunity, and that's why it so's critical that we win this debate this week.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (GULF COAST HURRICANE HOUSING RECOVERY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, first, I wish to associate myself with the comments of my colleague from Texas and complimenting our chairman, the gentleman from Massachusetts, in having a very fair and open hearing on this legislation. I often disagree with his philosophy, but I know that he is sincere in what he is trying to do, and I appreciate the fairness with which he has operated the committee and allowed these amendments come to the floor. 
   I also want to thank Ranking Member Bachus for his contribution to this legislation in trying to ensure that we do the right thing in New Orleans, that things can actually be better, that we don't have to return to the way that things were. 
   Clearly, these hurricanes represented one of the great natural tragedies in the history of America, and so many of us had friends and family who were affected. My in-laws live in the New Orleans area. For several days, my wife didn't know if her father had survived the hurricane. It turns out he was at the convention center along with thousands of others in fairly deplorable conditions. 
   But my in-laws were among the lucky ones: they survived. Although their home was damaged, it has been rebuilt. But I know how this has impacted people. I have been to the gulf coast and seen the hurt, yet seen the hope as well, and hope is still alive. 
   But 18, 19 months later, we have to ask ourselves this question, How do we best help going forward? America has been very generous, very generous with both their public and private funds. People throughout the Fifth Congressional District of Texas opened up their arms, opened up their wallets, opened up their homes to victims of the hurricanes. 
   The Federal taxpayer has now contributed well over $100 billion to this effort. Nobody can say that the American people have not been generous. 
   But I think we have to ask ourselves, Mr. Chairman, how do we best help going forward? I do not believe that it is always an additional Federal check. We also have to make sure that a great physical tragedy of this century or this generation doesn't turn out to be a great fiscal tragedy for the next generation as well. 
   This amendment would try to take a modest step towards achieving those goals. It has everything to do with providing a work-related requirement that this Congress is already well acquainted with that helped revolutionize welfare reform 10 years ago, and apply it going forward to those who are recipients of the vouchers and the housing programs under this bill. 
   Over 10 years ago, when Congress passed Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, we began the process of ending welfare as we had known it. Instead, we replaced it in this program with a temporary assistance-based program that was based on work and self-sufficiency and responsibility and personal dignity. 
   Now, at the time there were countless naysayers who said this was cruel and unusual. I offered this amendment in committee. It was called un- American. They said it had no compassion. They said the program would never work, that young mothers would somehow be thrown out into the streets with starving children, that somehow they could not find a job, much less hold a job. 
   Mr. Chairman, the naysayers were wrong then, and the naysayers are wrong now. If you look at the record, you will see that after we passed this TANF welfare reform and created incentives for self-sufficiency, the number of families receiving cash welfare steadily declined from an all-time peak of 5.1 million families in March of 1994 to 1.9 million families in September of 2006. It represents the lowest number of people on cash public assistance rolls in over 35 years. This, I believe, is compassionate. 
   Child poverty has fallen and 1.6 million fewer children live in poverty today than in 1995 because of the work-related requirements that were in TANF. Child poverty has fallen dramatically, as I said. Employment of young, single mothers has doubled. Employing mothers who have never been married is up by more than 50 percent. Employment of single mothers who dropped out of high school is up by two-thirds, and we have seen unprecedented declines in poverty among children of single moms, from 50.3 percent a decade ago to 41.9 percent in 2004. 
   Again, the naysayers were wrong then, and the same naysayers are wrong yet again today. 
   Welfare reform worked 10 years ago because we cared enough to tell people, when they were facing challenges, that we were not going to allow them to give up trying. Now we have the same chance to extend this, to empower people who have been impacted by these terrible gulf coast hurricanes, some who have been stuck in public housing for 10, 15 or 20 years. We can show them that there is a better life, and it is within their reach; but the work is key to obtaining this. 
   So, again, my amendment is a simple one. It takes the list of approved work-related activities that have already been established over 10 years ago in welfare reform, as we know in TANF, and applies it to the recipients of this special public housing assistance that we are providing in this bill. Those recipients would be required to perform a minimum of 20 hours per week of work-related activities to help them get back on the road to self-sufficiency and move beyond public housing once and for all. 
   Now, the precedent for requiring recipients of public housing assistance to earn benefits is not new. In 1998, this body passed a law requiring able-bodied people living in public housing to perform 8 hours a month of community service with the notion that individuals ought to give back to their communities. My amendment would simply build on that notion and help put people back on the road to self-sufficiency. 
   Now, I know some people will say that individuals can't find work because there are simply no jobs to be found; therefore, this amendment will not work. 
   But that is a false charge on two counts. First, there are clearly entry-level jobs that are still available, for  example, in New Orleans. Pick up the want ads. You will see plenty of entry-level positions that are there, and they are trying to rebuild a great city. Workers are still needed to help rebuild New Orleans. So it is false on one account. 
   Second of all, it is false because under the TANF requirement, no one is required to get a job if the jobs don't exist. Instead, there are 12 distinct categories of work-related activities to give individuals a broad spectrum of activities to satisfy this requirement. It includes attempting to find work, vocational education, community service and, in some instances, providing child care services to others. Again, these are all activities designed to help people begin on the road to self-sufficiency. 
   To ensure that only the able-bodied are affected by this requirement, my amendment exempts children, senior citizens, the disabled, those already exempt from TANF work requirements and those who cannot find appropriate or affordable child care. 
   Mr. Chairman, the lessons of welfare reform are very clear. By expecting more of people, you can help them expect more out of themselves. We have the opportunity to extend that, the great lessons and the great benefits of that today. We should not miss any opportunity to help break this cycle of dependency and help people change their lives for the better. 
   We need to help the people of the gulf coast, but we need to help the taxpayers as well. We need to ensure that the American people don't face a challenge like this going forward in the future. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, again, this is a very, very simple amendment. I have no idea what is so cruel and unusual about people having the opportunity to become self-reliant, to earn paychecks instead of welfare checks. 
   The gentleman from Georgia, who spoke with great stridency, I don't question his sincerity; I do question a number of his policies. I have no doubt that the gentleman has voted against tax relief to help create 7 1/2 million jobs turning welfare checks to paychecks. 
   So the gentleman has different ways of trying to help people. I look at the statistics. What has helped people? What has brought down child poverty rates? What has helped single mothers find self-sufficiency? 
   So I don't understand, after 18 months, after $100 billion of taxpayer money, why it is so bad to say people ought to be on the road to self-sufficiency.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I have listened very carefully to the previous speaker talk about rhetoric. And indeed, the rhetoric I hear from the other side of the aisle is pure Orwellian; up is down, black is white, victory is defeat and the largest tax increase in American history is somehow actually tax relief. 
   You cannot state good intentions and then instead act with cruel actions. The numbers of this budget lead to the largest single tax increase in American history. And Mr. Speaker, let me quote from the Washington Post again, not exactly a bastion of conservative thought, I will quote from their March 29th edition, ``And while House Democrats say they want to preserve key parts of Bush's signature tax cuts, they project a surplus in 2012 only by assuming that all these cuts expire on schedule in 2010.'' And then they somehow say that we contrive temporary tax relief. Well, as the chairman knows, he has had plenty of opportunities to make this tax relief permanent, but he and everyone else on that side of the aisle have declined that opportunity. 
   And again, it's a matter of priorities. Democrat friends decide to prioritize the Federal budget over the family budget. But let's look at how their single largest tax increase in American history is going to impact family budgets. Let's hear from Joan from Mesquite, who wrote, ``An additional $2,200 raise in taxes for my husband and me would mean that we would not be able to meet our budget obligations. I drive an 11-year-old car. And sometimes it breaks. And it costs me more to fix than what it's worth. I was hoping to buy a newer car, but if taxes go up, I won't be able to do that.'' 
   Let's hear from Robert of Garland. ``I'm unemployed on Social Security and my wife works. At this point, between taxes and utilities, we're at the breaking point of being able to keep our home. If we have an increase of over $2,000 per year, it may well mean the straw that broke the camel's back; we would lose our home.'' That's how the single largest tax increase in American history is affecting that family. 
   Let's see how it affects Linda in Rowlett. ``It would mean the difference of whether my daughter or husband would be able to purchase a car or not. For my husband and I, it helps us continue with his radiation treatments for his prostate cancer and allows us to continue providing in-home assistance for my elderly parents. Please allow us to retain this money for our needs. Please don't let government take additional tax dollars from us.'' 
   That's the cruel actions. It's not the Orwellian rhetoric that we want to somehow preserve the tax relief. They are imposing the single largest tax increase in American history, a cruel hoax on American families as they try to meet their education budgets and their transportation budgets.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to my friend from Virginia. The only thing that is being cut here is the family budget, and it is being cut by the Democrats. If you look at the numbers of the Republican budget, government grows each and every year. Now, it doesn't grow as fast as the Democrat budget. And the way the Democrat budget grows is by imposing the single largest tax increase in American history on hard-working Americans. 
   An average in my district, the Fifth Congressional District of Texas, an average of $2,700 a year, Mr. Speaker, is going to be imposed on those hard-working people as they try to send their children to college, as they struggle to try to meet the healthcare payments for elderly parents, as they try to make payments on their healthcare premiums, as they try to put together that capital to launch their American dream and to buy their first home. 
   The cutting that is going on here is the cutting out of the heart of the family budget by the Democrat budget, imposing the single largest tax increase in American history. And as bad as that tax increase is, $392 billion over 5 years, it is a pittance compared to the taxes that they are going to impose on the next generation, because, Mr. Speaker, their budget is silent, absolutely silent, on the number one fiscal challenge facing America, out-of-control entitlement spending. 
   The Republicans are being responsible in trying to ensure that the next generation doesn't see a doubling of their taxes, which we all know will happen. 
   So this is the kick-the-can-down-the-road budget of the Democrats, when they know that our children and grandchildren will see their taxes doubled from roughly 20 percent of the economy to 40 percent. Now, how many of our children and grandchildren will ever be able to own a home, start a business or send their children to college? 
   This is the idea of the Democrats' fiscal responsibility, doubling taxes on the American people? I want no part of it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I certainly thank the gentlelady from Tennessee for yielding. I particularly appreciate her leadership not only within the Republican Study Committee, the conservative caucus in the House of Representatives, but also her great leadership on issues that impact the family budget,  spending, because we know in this institution that you can't increase some Federal budget without decreasing some family budget. 
   At the moment we are talking about this thing, what most people call Card Check, which sounds innocent enough on its face, but I would note, as my colleagues have said, that it took the Democrats about 2 days to go ahead and waive their own pay-as-you-go provision that supposedly made sure we weren't going to get deeper in debt, it took them about 2 weeks to raise taxes on the American people, and, also, almost took them 2 full months before they started to try to repudiate the right to a secret ballot of American workers, before they try to take back the franchise from American workers. They have been very busy since they took over the House. 
   Now, the formal title of this piece of legislation that we are speaking about this afternoon is the Employee Free Choice Act. Now, Madam Speaker, we know that somewhere running around here in the Capitol are people who are paid to come up with clever titles for pieces of legislation. Well, whoever came up with that title surely deserves a bonus. 
   San Francisco, California, not exactly known as a bastion of conservative thought in America, one of their daily newspapers, the San Francisco Examiner, called that title exquisitely Orwellian, in referring to the famous author George Orwell and his book, 1984.     
   Madam Speaker, I don't know about you, but I know when I was in high school many, many years ago in College Station, Texas, that was required reading. For those who have read it either voluntarily or involuntarily, they may recall that to be Orwellian meant to turn things on their head to call black, white; to call up, down; to call good, bad. I must admit that the Orwell estate must be doing well, because people are still clearly buying his works. 
   This proposed Act has nothing to do with freedom. This proposed Act has nothing to do with choice. This proposed Act is nothing less, nothing less than a full frontal assault, a full, frontal assault of a worker's fundamental right to cast a secret ballot to choose whether or not they want to be a member of a labor union. 
   What is more fundamental to our democracy than the secret ballot? It is one of the pillars. It is one of the pillars of democracy, and yet the Democrats, in this cleverly titled bill, they want to take that away. 
   I might suggest that if they want to take that away, that Members of Congress who are going to vote for this Act, which will be on the floor tomorrow, maybe they ought to think about cosponsoring some companion legislation, and let's go ahead and just spread it all over America. Why don't we just go ahead and provide for card check for congressional elections? 
   Let's get rid of that secret ballot booth. Instead, why don't you publicly have to come down and take a little card and check in front of your friends, your neighbors, not to mention those who may not be too friendly to you, and just say who you are voting for. If it is good enough for congressional elections, it ought to be good enough for labor union elections. 
   Yet, again, Democrats are going to come to this floor tomorrow and vote on a piece of legislation to fundamentally take away the right to a secret ballot from workers all across America. By the way, poll after poll of labor union members say they are against this. They say it is fundamentally unfair to take away their secret ballot. 
   Now the labor union bosses making the six-figure salaries out of their dues, they have a different opinion. In fact, one was quoted saying ``there is no reason to subject the workers to an election.'' No reason to subject the workers to an election. Kind of sounds like something Hugo Chavez might say in Venezuela. 
   You know, there is just no reason to subject the people to an election. But it does appear to be every single reason to subject workers to pressure and intimidation, and that is what this bill is all about. There have been card check campaigns in the recent past. This is known, you can go to public sources. 
   Now there was a union organizing at MGM in Las Vegas and union organizers threatened those people who would not check that they wanted to join a union. They said if we want to take over, we will get your job one way or another. We will get your job. 
   There was a United Steel Workers official. He was told to threaten migrant workers with deportation if they would not pick up the card and check that they wanted to be in the labor union. I don't know where the freedom is. I don't know where the choice is, but I certainly know where the pressure and the intimidation is. 
   Recently, just this last week, we had testimony from a worker in Oregon who said that when she would not publicly check the card that she wanted to join a labor union, that her work life became miserable, miserable when she refused to do this. Again, this is nothing more than assault on a fundamental right to a secret ballot in a labor union election. 
   This overturns decades and decades of custom and practice and law in America on how people can choose. 
   Now, listen, we live in a free society. We should live in a free society. Workers ought to be able to choose if they want to be part of a labor union. That is not a question. There is only one question that is going to be before the floor and that question is, should workers have the right to a secret ballot? Are they going to be open to intimidation, pressure and shakedown? Not one worker in America, not one worker in America is going to be benefited by this. 
   Now, I can think of others who are going to be benefited by this, because all of a sudden, labor union bosses are automatically going to have access to hard-working Americans' paychecks where they used to not have that, to source the money, and unfortunately, so many of these issues come down to money. 
   Indeed, follow the money. It may be instructive. The Pew Foundation has indicated that over half a billion dollars of labor union money has gone to the Democrat party since 1994. You know, even in Washington DC, a half a billion dollars is a lot of money. Seven out of the top ten political contributors in America are organized labor. The American people don't want this, workers don't want this, even unionized workers don't want this, but labor union bosses do. They want a fundamental assault on the right, the right to a secret ballot. What a day of infamy it will be in this House, should we approve that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentlelady for yielding once again. And we are going to have a very important debate tomorrow in this institution about whether or not 
   the Democrat majority will strip workers of their fundamental right to the secret ballot in labor union organizing elections. 
   But beyond that we know what is next on their agenda. It didn't take them too long, about 2 weeks, to first raise taxes on the American people; and that is the next big debate that will be taking place in this institution. It is all about the budget. 
   Now, everybody in this House, both Republican and Democrat alike, will all tell you they want to balance the budget. And you know what? I believe each and every one of them. But there is a very, very different way to go about it. 
   Today the debate in the House tends to be whether or not tax relief that has been granted over the last 5 years was a good thing or bad thing. Well, guess what? We put tax relief into the economy on this end, and let's see what comes out on the other end: 7.2 million jobs; 7.2 million Americans who used to  not have work now have work. How many of them used to have to settle for a welfare check, but now they have a paycheck? 
   How many took from the system, from unemployment and food stamps and Aid to Families with Dependent Children, who now get to pay in the system because they have a paycheck? 
   We have one of the strongest economies that we have had in decades. We have one of the lowest unemployment rates we have had. All of that was due to tax relief. 
   And, Madam Speaker, for purposes of this debate, and this is a very important point, and don't take my word for it, go to the United States Treasury. Tax rates have been lowered, and guess what? We have more tax revenue. We have more tax revenue than we have ever had in the history of the United States of America. 
   Now, how can that happen? Well, maybe it is difficult to understand in Washington, D.C., but it is pretty easy to understand in Tennessee Colony in Anderson County, Texas, that I have the pleasure of representing in the United States Congress. If you will allow farmers and ranchers, if you will allow small business people, if you will allow American families to keep more of what they earn, guess what? They will save. They will invest. They will go out and create their American dream and put a new automobile transmission shop on one street corner. They will add another couple of jobs at a barbecue stand. And guess what? They create jobs of the future, and we have more revenue. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, some people may reject this theory. You can't, you may have your own opinion, but you are not entitled to your own facts. You cannot debate that we have more tax revenue. But some people don't see a link between job creation and tax relief. 
   Even if I am wrong, Madam Speaker, if you will look at the Federal budget, if you will look at the Federal budget, if we had a line item called tax relief in the Federal budget, it is 1 percent, a little more than 1 percent of the entire Federal budget. Even if that money was wasted, burned, buried and didn't do any good to the economy, had no connection to job creation, to home ownership, to people being able to send their kids to college, it is about 1 percent of the budget. 
   My point is if you want to do something about the deficit, your focus needs to be on the spending side. We have a deficit not because we are undertaxed; we have a deficit because we are spending too much. 
   And listen, I take a back seat to no one as far as my concern about passing debt on to future generations. I am the father of a 5-year old and the father of a 3-year old. But even if we were to balance the budget today, and thanks to Republican progrowth economic policies, we will balance the budget, it has very little to do with spending discipline. We know we don't find any of that among our Democrat colleagues. It has everything to do with tax revenue growth. 
   But even if we were to balance the budget in the next few years, as my colleague from Tennessee has indicated, in Washington, D.C., tax relief is temporary, but spending is forever. So much spending has been put on automatic pilot. And it just doesn't grow horizontally, it grows exponentially. 
   If we don't do something now to reform the spending patterns in Washington, D.C., the next generation will face a nasty fiscal fork in the road. And don't take my word for it. Go to the General Accountability Office, the Office of Management and Budget, the Congressional Budget Office. They will all tell you the same thing. We are on the verge of either having to double taxes on the next generation or practically cut out the entirety of the Federal Government except Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. 
   Just think about it, Madam Speaker. There will be no United States Marines. There will be no Border Patrol. There will be no student loans. There will be no airport security. 
   If we don't take fundamental steps now to end wasteful, unaccountable, runaway spending in Washington, D.C., that is the future we are facing. The Comptroller General of the United States has said in testimony before the Budget Committee that we may be on the verge of being the first generation in America's history to leave the next generation with fewer opportunities and a lower standard of living.     
   Madam Speaker, I don't plan to be a part of that, and I am going to do everything I can to fight this on this House floor. So those who go around saying we must balance the budget and those who won't do anything to try to find ways to get better retirement security and better health care at a lower cost, what they are really telling you, Madam Speaker, is, I want to double taxes on the next generation. I want to leave your children and your grandchildren with less freedom and less opportunity. 
   Madam Speaker, how anybody can look themselves in the mirror and do that, I don't know. Again, that is the magnitude of the tax increase that Democrats are going to have to have if they won't join us in a bipartisan fashion and do something about out-of-control entitlement spending. It will be a massive tax increase the likes of which America has never seen before. And once they impose that tax increase on the American people, how many of our children will be able to send their children to college? How many of our children will be able to realize their American Dream and start their first business? How many of our children will be able to buy their first home when this body doubles their taxes for refusing, refusing, to do anything to stop runaway spending? 
   So, Madam Speaker, that is where the fight is. That is where the fight is. Republicans want to try to reform. Democrats want to raise taxes, but they don't own up to the magnitude of the tax increases. But the future of our country is resting upon this debate, and I hope the American people will watch very, very closely.

   Mr. HENSARLING. I want to thank her for bringing this article in the Wall Street Journal, one of America's largest newspapers, to the attention of this body; and obviously it is fascinating for us to discover that the single largest provider of abortion in the Nation, Planned Parenthood, I believe performing one out of five abortions in America, has now planned, according to the press, a rebranding campaign to appeal to women of means. 
   I quote from the article, A move that opens new avenues for boosting revenue and they hope political clout. 
   And as I understand from the gentlelady from Minnesota, as I read through this article, that their political action arm plans to raise $10 million to influence the fall campaign; and as they take the lives of almost 300,000 innocent children, not only is the American taxpayer being asked to subsidize this horrid, this gruesome procedure that so many in America consider to be absolutely immoral, then to top even more indignity on the act they're going to turn around and use money and come back to Congress and ask for even more.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Well, I thank the gentlelady from Ohio for yielding back, and I know there are other speakers who wish to speak, so I will try to be brief. 
   The gentlelady from Minnesota spoke about life-saving centers. On Monday of this week, I went to one. I didn't go as a Member of Congress. I went as a father. And my wife and I have two small children, 6 and 4, and it was time to donate their old baby beds and donate a bunch of maternity clothes. And I had heard about the Dallas Pregnancy Resource Center. A bunch of great ladies in Dallas, Texas, trying to save human life. I had heard of them. I didn't think they knew me, and I showed up on a Monday morning unshowered, unshaven, in a T-shirt to donate two baby beds and a box full of maternity clothes that belonged to my wife. They were very thankful for the gift. 
   And when I was filling out the paperwork, they realized who I was and insisted that I tour the facility. And although I was unshaven and unshowered, I complied with their request, and I'm glad I did. 
   And it is amazing to me, as I think upon my visit with these ladies on Monday, to think that on the one hand, you have Planned Parenthood getting hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money to take the lives of the most innocent among us, the unborn--as pictured next to the gentlelady from Minnesota--hundreds of millions of dollars spent on this abortion factor. 
   And here is this one little place in Dallas, Texas, called the Dallas Pregnancy Resource Center, and they sit there and they counsel with these low-income, these mostly young teen mothers. And every time that they are able to convince a mother to choose life over death, they put a tiny, tiny set of paper footprints on a bulletin board.     
   As you might imagine, sometimes they're blue and sometimes they're pink, and they have the date that one human life was saved. 
   To the best of my knowledge, the Dallas Pregnancy Resource Center receives no Federal money whatsoever to save human lives, and Planned Parenthood takes hundreds of millions of dollars of Federal taxpayer money to take  human life. Something is wrong in America when that takes place. 
   We need to stop, we need to take note of what is taking place. In my head and in my heart, I can come to no other conclusion but that life begins at conception. I take it as a matter of faith, but if I didn't take it as a matter of faith, how can any human being, how can any American, look at that picture next to the gentlelady from Minnesota and conclude otherwise? 
   In our Founding documents, the right to life is unalienable. How can this body ever act otherwise?

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (UNITED STATES-PERU TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement. I regret that heretofore the 110th Congress has been a decisively antitrade Congress, and that is why I want to thank Majority Leader Hoyer and Chairman Rangel for at least bringing this free trade agreement to the floor for a vote. It represents a modest step in the right direction. 
   One thing is very clear tonight when you look at the facts, and that is if a Member will not support the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement, they will support no trade agreement. And as long as I have been a Member of Congress, I guess I never cease to be amazed, and I certainly have not been amazed that trade, still for some reason, seems to be controversial. 
   We have over 200 years of history teaching us that free trade delivers a greater choice of goods and services to our American consumers, and those greater choices mean more competition. More competition has helped lower prices, and this allows American families to buy more using less of their hard-earned paychecks. It means more money to make a down payment on a home. It means more money to send a child to college. It means more money to help a parent with long-term care. 
   According to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, increased trade since World War II has helped boost U.S. annual incomes by over $10,000 per household; yet the forces of protectionism want to take that away from the hard-working American family. He goes on further to say that eliminating all remaining trade barriers could raise U.S. incomes anywhere from $4,000 to $12,000 a year. Another opportunity for hard-working American families being denied by the forces of protectionism. 
   Let's specifically look at the trade agreement before us. In 2006, 98 percent of Peru's exports to the U.S. came into our markets duty free. Let me repeat that just in case somebody didn't hear; 98 percent of Peru's exports to the U.S. came into our markets duty free. But U.S. exports to Peru still face high tariffs. 
   Under the free trade agreement before us, 80 percent of U.S. exports of consumer and industrial goods will now enter Peru tariff free immediately, with the remaining tariffs to be phased out over the next 10 years. 
   I take particular note, representing the Fifth Congressional District of Texas, that this agreement is particularly good for American agriculture, whose success is heavily dependent upon the export market. Currently, 99 percent of Peruvian agricultural exports enter the U.S. duty free, again, 99 percent, while U.S. agricultural exports currently face an average tariff in excess of 16 percent. 
   Under this trade agreement, two-thirds of American agricultural exports will immediately enter Peru duty free, including beef, cotton, wheat and soybeans. And beef is particularly important to many of my constituents in the 5th Congressional District of Texas.     
   I simply don't understand the argument that claims that this trade agreement is somehow unfair. What's unfair is the status quo. That's what is unfair. The U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement turns what is currently a one-way trade street into a two-way street. And let's remember again, 98 percent of their goods already come to our country duty-free. 
   Mr. Speaker, competition works. Trade works. We have over 200 years of history to prove it. But beyond all of the obvious economic benefits of free trade, we must recognize that fundamentally this is an issue of personal freedom. Nations don't trade with nations, people trade with people. And with the exception of national security considerations, every American ought to have the right to determine the origin of the goods and services they want to purchase, and that includes a sweater made in Peru. Who in this Chamber is going to go tell a hardworking schoolteacher in Mesquite, Texas: No, you can't buy that $15 sweater from Peru, you have to buy that $31 sweater that is made in Oklahoma. That is the sweater you have to buy. And if you can't afford it, I'm sorry, but your little child is just going to have to do without that sweater. 
   Mr. Speaker, maybe this institution has the power to do that, but does it have the right? I don't think so, Mr. Speaker. This is the land of the free. Countless generations have fought and sacrificed for the blessings of liberty, and that includes the liberty of trade. To be anti-trade is to be anti-freedom. It's that simple. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have 200 years of history to show that America has benefited from free trade. We need to support this trade agreement.

   Mr. Chairman, I want to encourage the House to adopt this amendment. 
   Right now on the heels of our Democrat colleagues enacting the single largest increase in history, we should leave no stone unturned in trying to find more ways that we can help the poor beleaguered taxpayer, who actually pays for all of these programs. 
   Now, I have no doubt that there are many good things in this legislation, and I know we in Congress are only limited by our imagination on how we can spend the taxpayers' money. 
   Already, just with the programs that are already on the books with the Federal Government before people create new programs, we're on a collision course. We're on a collision course to either, one, have taxes doubled on the next generation, just to pay for government we have, or within one generation there is only going to be, for all intents and purposes, a Federal Government consisting of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. 
   Now, many people don't understand how the institution works, but already  so much of the Federal spending is on automatic pilot, so-called entitlement spending. This is actually one of the few opportunities that Members have to come to the floor of the House and actually try to save taxpayers' money. 
   Now, we know that the President has issued a veto threat, and there is a $23 billion savings that he's trying to achieve. 
   For many of us, we believe the President is trying to spend too much money. But the President is the President, and the President is the one who has the veto pen. 
   If we would adopt the gentleman's amendment, the gentleman from Georgia, we would at least take one small step towards the pathway of saving that $23 billion and maybe, maybe take one small step towards saving the next generation from that nasty fiscal fork in the road to where either, one, they are going to have their taxes doubled, right on the heels, again, of the single largest tax increase in American history that the Democrats have brought to us, or we are going to see a Federal Government consisting of little more than Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. 
   What's ironic about this, Mr. Chairman, is if we don't start taking steps to save money today, and this amendment would save $30 million, if we don't start taking these steps today, tomorrow there might not be an Energy and Water appropriations bill. All the money would go somewhere else, and we continue as an institution to kick the can down the road. 
   Now, some in this body say fiscal responsibility simply means balancing the budget no matter what the cost. Well, for those who are going to have to have their taxes doubled in the next generation, they may differ with that assessment of what fiscal responsibility is. 
   Again, as the gentleman from Georgia has said, the Corps already has a large background of ongoing construction work. We know that; all Members know that. By limiting the Corps investigations, this amendment would help ensure that current Corps projects are completed. 
   Again, it's one very, very small step; but we cannot send this country again under Democrat leadership into some kind of tax-and-spend economic death spiral. We have to take every step possible to save the American people from, number one, the single largest tax increase in American history that threatens to impose over a 5-year period up to $3,000 of taxes per family. We have to save them from that. Then we have to save them from the other spending. 
   So this is a very modest amendment that would put us on a pathway to ensure that the President doesn't veto this bill and that we achieve some level of fiscal responsibility. 
   I urge the House to adopt the amendment of the gentleman from Georgia.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Again, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his leadership and trying to bring some level of fiscal sanity and fiscal accountability back to this body. 
   And I'm not unsympathetic to what I just heard our ranking member say. But I guess I get somewhat frustrated when I see spending bill after spending bill after spending bill, and I see the largest single tax increase in American history enacted by the new majority. 
   I see absolutely no effort on the part of the new majority to do anything to rein in out-of-control entitlement spending. Unfortunately, there are few opportunities to try to save the poor, beleaguered, American taxpayer some of his funds. 
   And again, I'm not sure that this bill is being shortchanged. It does exceed the President's request. It does provide funding above last year, in this case, increasing funding by roughly twice the rate of inflation. 
   There are many American families who don't have the luxury of seeing their incomes go up by twice the rate of inflation. Why are we expecting families to do with less so that government can do with more? 
   And again, I'm not unsympathetic to what the ranking member had to say. But there are so few opportunities. 
   And I understand good things can be done with these funds. But occasionally, Mr. Chairman, we have to stop and we have to take a look at where this funding is coming from. And I talk about the poor, beleaguered, American taxpayer who, if the Democrats have their way and the largest single tax increase in American history is allowed to be imposed upon the American people, will see their taxes go up by roughly $3,000 a year. 
   And I hear from some of those taxpayers from around the country. I heard from Debbie in Lake Zurich, Illinois. She writes, ``I cannot survive a $3,000 tax hike. I am a single, 53-year old woman living in Lake Zurich who is drowning in taxes. Because of taxes I've been forced to put my house on the market. Any more tax increases will create a huge financial burden.'' 
   I heard from Rose in Turnersville, New Jersey. ``As an older adult still in the work force, I'm living paycheck to paycheck. Between property taxes and all the other taxes I pay, I will soon  give up my home. Just affording gas to get to work in my car is now a trial. Please keep the tax cuts we already have.'' 
   As we talk about things we're going to do to safeguard people's homes, how ironic it is, with the largest tax increase in history we're going to spend the money and help take their homes away.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Again I want to commend the gentleman from Georgia for his amendment in this series of amendments, which, as I understand it, would bring the funding to the President's level, which, in most cases for many of us, is still too much. 
   As I stated earlier in the debate, Mr. Chairman, I am still concerned that although clearly good cases are made for how these funds can be used, I look at the larger picture. We still have a bill before us that is growing this part of government at over twice the rate of inflation. Again, we are asking American families to somehow do more with less, and sometimes you wonder if government isn't doing less with more. 
   This is on top of the pressure that has been put on the family budget by the new Democrat majority's enacting the largest single tax increase in American history in their budget. This is on top of the Democrat majority that is trying to increase what we call nondefense discretionary spending by $23 billion above the level of last year. This is in addition to the $6 billion, Mr. Chairman, that they added to the omnibus spending bill at the first of the Congress and the $17 billion in nonemergency spending that they tried to put into the emergency supplemental to support our troops that somehow we all know ended up with funding for peanuts and spinach and many other items that many Americans would consider being part of a pork-barrel spending effort. 
   So, again, I would have more sympathy with those who oppose the bill if I saw any indication whatsoever that the new Democrat majority was trying to save the family budget from the Federal budget. And, instead, I see this explosion of spending, and I haven't even included what the gentleman from Georgia aptly observed, that we hadn't even completed 6 months of the year but already the new Democrat majority, on top of all the old spending, has now authorized over the next 5-year budget window an additional $105 billion of new spending. And you wonder where does it all end? Where does it all end? 
   I said earlier that I wish we could be debating on this floor opportunities to actually reform entitlement spending. We are dealing with a smaller portion of the Federal budget now, but we know that the longest journey starts with the first step. And, Mr. Chairman, we need to observe, and don't take my word for it, about what is going to happen to the American family and the American economy if we don't take some small steps to try to reduce the rate of growth of government.     
   Let's listen to our Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, who was quoted in a House Budget Committee. Without ``early and meaningful action'' to address the growth in entitlement spending, ``the U.S. economy could be seriously weakened, with future generations bearing much of the cost.'' 
   Let's listen to the Comptroller General, our chief fiduciary officer in the United States. He said, ``The rising costs of government entitlements are a fiscal cancer that threatens catastrophic consequences for our country and could bankrupt America.'' Instead, this body kicks the can down the road. 
   And now we have a bill before us which, although it does many worthy things, is increasing the rate of spending of this part of government twice the rate of inflation; again, taking money away from American families after the single largest tax increase in history, threatening to double taxes on their children. 
   And so, we've had three amendments here in a row that would take incredibly modest steps to try to reduce the rate of growth of government. You don't even have to cut government, you just have to reduce the rate of growth to bring some fiscal sanity from this new spending and tax economic debt spiral that the Democrats seem to want to foist us into. 
   So, I would urge the House to adopt the amendment of the gentleman from Georgia. I wish we could do more, but it is a modest start on a very, very long journey.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, again, this amendment, as some previous amendments have, attempts to make a very, very modest step towards saving the family budget from the single largest tax increase in American history. 
   Specifically, over the requested level or the level in the bill, this would reduce funding for Interior's Water and Related Resources account to the President's request from roughly $871 million to $816 million, representing a $55 million savings to the American taxpayer. This account has been a traditionally earmarked account for certain water restoration activities in 17 Western States. 
   The bill's current funding level represents a 6.7 percent increase over the President's request. Again, I am sure this account funds many worthy projects. 
   But we need, I believe, a number of us believe we need a road map to try to bring fiscal sanity to the House in an appropriations bill that is already increasing spending twice the rate of inflation. So now we are having a debate over $816 million, as proposed by the administration, which I am sure many in this body might think is an overly large number when we recognize that money is coming from hardworking American taxpayers, but a difference of $816 million versus $871 million. 
   Again, as the majority in their budget resolution enacts the single largest tax increase in American history, they are asking American families to somehow do more with less. Don't we believe that the Federal Government ought to try to do more with less, and, in this case, we still have an increase, 6.7 percent increase over the President's request. 
   As I have taken to the floor on other occasions during this debate, we should never, ever forget that although something good can be done with the taxpayers' dollars in this account, I have no doubt, we have to remember the hardworking American families back home and how the single largest tax increase in history, which is funding this third appropriation bill, still twice the rate of inflation, we have to remember, we have to remember how this bill impacts them. 
   I sent out a letter to my constituents asking them how this tax increase of the Democrat majority would impact them.     
   I heard from Bruce in Garland. Garland's a city in my district. He said, ``In my particular case, an additional $2,200 in taxes would cut into the finances I used to pay for my son's college education. A control and reduction of spending is what is needed.'' 
   Again, Mr. Chairman, what we realize is as we plus-up some Federal account, we are downsizing some family account. In this case, we're affecting a family's education account. 
   I heard from Joy in the city of Dallas. I represent the eastern part of the city of Dallas. She writes, ``I could not pay for a semester of college for my daughter if I had to send more money to the government.'' 
   So as this account's getting plussed up by twice the rate of inflation, here are two individual families, just two out of millions across America, who are having their education accounts gutted by the plus-up in this particular bill. 
   I heard from Linda, also from the city of Garland. ``If we had to pay an additional $2,200 each year, it would make us have to decide between food or medicine.'' 
   I've got a whole host of these letters, Mr. Chairman, to remind every Member in this body that as we talk about all the noble purposes we have for the American taxpayers' money, they too have noble purposes. They have health care programs in their family, they have education programs in their family, they have energy bills and programs in their family, paying their heating bills, their cooling bills, filling up their automobile. So certainly we could take one modest step in saving the taxpayer $55 million and plus-up the water and related resources account, a traditionally earmarked account. And we had a very vigorous debate over earmarks here recently, their transparency, their accountability. 
   But surely we could agree to hold to the President's level and try to save the family budget from the onslaught of the Federal budget.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I would like to associate myself with the comments of the ranking member of the Budget Committee. What is of great concern here and why once again I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Westmoreland) for these series of amendments to at a minimum look at various spending levels and try to at least keep to the President's level, which so many of us already consider to be overinflated, particularly when we look at the fact of how much more the Federal budget has grown over the family budget. Since I have been on the face of the planet, the Federal budget has outgrown the family budget by a factor of about five to one. This cannot continue. 
   And so the gentleman from Georgia offers several amendments, all that would at least put us on the path to avoid the Presidential veto and spend less than what the new Democrat majority, tax-and-spend majority, wants to do. 
   Again, I think it's very important that we focus on the fact that this is part of a larger plan that we see unveiled in the budget resolution. This is our third appropriations bill that puts us on the course to spend the funds that will arise from this single largest tax increase in American history. 
   Mr. Chairman, for all those who are watching the proceedings of the House today, it might be interesting to note for them that the last time the Democrats had the majority, they enacted the single largest tax increase in American history. So they are at least consistent in what they are trying to do. The big debate in Washington is whether you want to tax more and spend more or whether you want to try to constrain the growth of the Federal budget to where the family budget can actually afford it. 
   I have heard other speakers rise and somehow point the finger at Republicans for fiscal irresponsibility. I must admit on occasion that perhaps is correct, but, Mr. Chairman, since I have been here and since I look in the rearview mirror, every time the Republicans have brought a budget to the floor, the Democrats have brought even a larger budget to the floor. They have decried the prescription drug benefit program of the Republicans for being overly expensive, but their alternative cost even more. And now already in just the first 6 months of this 110th Congress, we have the Democrats wanting to increase nondefense appropriations by $23 billion of taxpayer money, we should never forget that it's the taxpayers' money, above what we spent in 2007. They already added $6 billion to the omnibus spending bill at the first of this Congress. They added $17 billion in nonemergency supplemental spending to the bill that would support our troops in harm's way; but as we notice, as we read the fine print, we discovered it included spinach and peanuts and shrimp and everything else. And now we also understand that the Democrat majority has provided new spending on top of the old spending, $105 billion over 5 years. 
   What the Republicans are trying to do is keep the tax relief that Americans have already been provided, keep it alive, make it permanent. Democrats say that we're not trying to increase taxes on the American people, although in their budget they have the single largest tax increase in American history, they just say, well, we're just going to let this tax relief expire. Well, Mr. Chairman, if you're a hardworking individual in the Fifth District of Texas and you make the same amount of money this year that you made last year and your tax bill goes up, now, that may be called in Washington, DC. letting tax relief expire, I can assure you that is a tax increase on hardworking people in the Fifth District of Texas and all over America. 
   That's why when this bill comes to the floor, and I know there are many worthy programs in this bill, but we can never forget the worthy energy bills that are in the family budget and the worthy water bills that are in the family budget, and you cannot fund the Federal budget without taking money from the family budget. That's why again one modest step would be to vote for this amendment from the gentleman from Georgia, and I once again want to commend him for his leadership on fiscal responsibility in this body.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   First I'm heartened that nobody has risen to oppose the amendment. I've heard many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle in a different context criticize the administration for not always having what they considered to be a sufficient competitive bidding process on contracts, and so I'm a little curious how this language ended up in the bill in the first place. But why wouldn't we want more competition? 
   Again, after our colleagues on the other side of the aisle helped put in place the single largest tax increase in American history, and then start to spend that money in our third appropriations bill that will again grow government way beyond the rate of inflation, we had better look for savings everyplace we can find it. 
   How can you criticize the administration for no-bid contracts, and then here's an opportunity here for competitive bidding, to somehow turn it down? So I don't know why this language is in the bill in the first place, but I want to congratulate and commend the gentleman from Texas for his amendment. 
   It has, I think, the potential to save the poor, beleaguered taxpayer millions, if not billions, of dollars. Is there anything not more ingrained in the American character than competition? We ought to try to make these contracts as competitive as possible. 
   Again, we have to put this whole piece of legislation in context. It's the third appropriations bill arising from a budget resolution that calls for the single largest tax increase in American history, approximately $3,000 of increased taxes for hardworking American families as they try to meet their education needs, as they try to meet their health care needs, as they try to meet their housing needs. 
   So I know there's a number of good programs that are contained within this legislation. In many respects, we're not having a debate today about how much money we're going to spend. We are debating who's going to do the spending, and there are many of us on the floor today who want to make sure that American families get to do more of that spending. 
   We continue to kick this can down the road. It's simply unfair to place such a tax burden on the American people. The average American family already pays $22,000 a year combined in Federal taxes, and now as the Democrat majority is promising to impose an additional $3,000 a year in taxes, and then, even worse, because their budget resolution from which this appropriation bill follows is silent on the issue of what to do with out-of-control entitlement spending, which is putting our sons and daughters, our grandchildren, on automatic pilot to have their taxes doubled so they will never be able to afford their own homes, send their kids to college, start their own business. As the Comptroller General said, and I paraphrase, we are on the verge of being the first generation in American history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living. 
   Now, I wish there was a lot more that we could do today within this piece of legislation, but at least by adopting the amendment of the gentleman from Texas, we will take a few small steps in doing what every other American considers to be common sense, and that is to ensure a maximum of competitive bidding, we would take at least a few small steps towards trying to save the American people from this increased tax burden that, again, subtracts from their dreams of their first home, their dreams of launching a small business. 
   This is all part, again, of a budget that imposes the single largest tax increase on the American people in history. After trying to spend an additional $23 billion over the level spent last year, $6 billion that was added to the omnibus, $17 billion added to the war supplemental in nonemergency spending, the Democrat majority now is going to allow unlimited emergency spending, giving Members practically the ability to rubber-stamp anything with ``emergency.'' And not only does their budget not do anything to reform entitlement spending, it creates reserve funds that promises more entitlement spending, Mr. Chairman, to make the problem even worse. 
   So we should all adopt the amendment of the gentleman from Texas. I applaud his leadership. It's a small step, a commonsense step to try to save the family budget from the Federal budget.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, there are a number of earmarks in this bill that are somewhat similar to this one. I will be the first to admit I don't know all that much about the Edmonds Center for the Arts. But as I follow these typical earmark debates, I know that soon there will be a Member to come to the floor to tell me he knows his district better than I do. Mr. Chairman, I concede the point. 
   He will also tell me that this body has the authority to provide for this earmark. Mr. Chairman, I once again concede the point. 
   I am sure they will come down here and say good things can be done with the money. Mr. Chairman, once again, I will concede the point. 
   They will also tell us well, it is a very small portion of the Federal budget. Mr. Chairman, I will concede the point. 
   But here is what I will not concede: the money is a very small portion of the Federal budget. But I fear again that earmarks in general, and perhaps this category in specific, become a larger portion of the culture of spending which is harmful to the Nation. We need to look at it very closely. 
   Often amendments are brought to the floor that many Members will say this is just draconian. We can't manage to spend less money here. Okay, so we offer earmark amendments and people say, well, it is just a small portion of the Federal budget. It is kind of like either the porridge is too hot or the porridge is too cold. When is the right time to offer an amendment to try to save taxpayers money? 
   So this is money that under the certification letter the funding would be used for renovation of the Edmonds Center for the Arts. Again, there are a number of earmarks that do this. I assume, frankly, there are Members of both parties that are requesting this funding. But it needs to be put in context because every time we so-called ``invest'' in a project like this, there is somebody out in America that is being divested in order to pay for the investment. So we have to look very closely at where this money is coming from. 
   Now, Member after Member comes to the floor to tell us we should do everything we can to preserve the Social Security trust fund. We know under our unified budget today that as long as we are running a deficit, and unfortunately we still are, it is declining due to lots of tax revenue, but we still have a deficit. We know that this expenditure is going to come ultimately out of the Social Security trust fund. Yet so many Members come to the floor to decry the practice. So is this money going to the Edmonds Center for the Arts worth raiding the Social Security trust fund? I believe not. 
   In addition, we know that the Democrats, Mr. Chairman, in their budget resolution, it contains the single largest tax increase in American history. Over 5 years if we don't figure out a way to stop it, the average American family will have an average $3,000 a year tax burden. That is money coming out of their pocket that they could have used for their arts, their entertainment, and their transportation; but they are being divested in order to invest in centers for the arts. 
   As I said earlier, I have no doubt that the sponsor of the earmark knows his district better than I do, just like I know my district better than he does. In talking to people in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas, they think their tax money might be used for better purposes. And if it is going to go to art centers, they kind of prefer that Mesquite Art Center be funded. They prefer the Henderson County Performing Arts Center be funded. They prefer the Lake Country Playhouse in Mineola to be funded; and they prefer the Kaufman County Civic Theater in Terrell, Texas, be funded, and the list goes on. 
   Given that we are threatened with the single largest tax increase in history, a vote for this is to raid the Social Security trust fund. And already with the spending we have, we are due to double taxes on the next generation. 
   I know Congress has the right to do this. I don't question our authority; I question our wisdom in doing that. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman's time has expired.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is aimed at limiting funding for parking facilities within this bill, which is not including Federal facilities that might be included within bills dealing with our military bases, GAO, national parks, what have you. 
   Mr. Chairman, apparently there are about 15 or so of these earmarks covering Members of both parties, and again, as I said earlier, Mr. Chairman, I know that the funds represented are probably a small portion of Federal spending, but I think it is good, I think it is wise that this House pause from time to time and look at the fiscal challenge that we are facing and to remember, if everything is a priority, then nothing is a priority. 
   So, again, I have no doubt that parking facilities are needed all over America, but I doubt the wisdom within the confines of this bill of using Federal taxpayer money today to pay for them. 
   Let's take a look at the challenge that we're facing, Mr. Chairman, and just don't take my word for the fact that we have a great fiscal challenge. Let's listen to our Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke. He said recently, without ``early and meaningful action'' to address spending in Washington, ``the U.S. economy could be seriously weakened; with future generations bearing much of the cost.'' 
   Let's listen to the Brookings Institute, not exactly a bastion of conservative thought: ``The authors of this book believe that the Nation's fiscal situation is out of control and could do serious damage to the economy in coming decades.'' 
   Let's listen to the General Accountability Office: The rising costs of government spending, specifically entitlements, are ``a fiscal cancer'' that threatens ``catastrophic consequences for our country'' and could ``bankrupt America.'' 
   Let's listen again to the GAO: ``Absent policy changes on the spending and/or revenue sides of the budget, a growing imbalance between expected Federal spending and tax revenues will mean escalating and ultimately unsustainable Federal deficits and debt  that serve to threaten our future national security as well as the standard of living for the American people.'' 
   The Federal budget continues to grow way beyond the ability of the family budget to pay for it, and seemingly, the only standard for spending the people's money today is do we have a noble purpose, and can some good use be made of the money. But, Mr. Chairman, that standard is not sufficient. It's not sufficient when we're threatening future generations with a fiscal calamity. Sooner or later, this body needs to say enough is enough. 
   Almost every State in the Union, I think, save but two or three, are running a surplus. We're running a deficit, and what are we doing? We're funding local parking facilities. 
   Now, Mr. Chairman, I'm not here to debate the constitutionality of doing that, but, again, I'm here to debate the wisdom, given the fiscal challenges the Nation faces, and all too often I fear that this body is more focused on the next election and not the next generation. But the Comptroller General has said we're on the verge of being the first generation in America's history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living. 
   Mr. Chairman, fiscal responsibility has to be included in each and every bill, and we have a bill that's growing about 6.7 percent. Let's somewhere draw a line in the sand on behalf of American families, on behalf of American taxpayers, on behalf of future generations and just say, you know, today the Federal taxpayer and future generations are not going to have to pay for parking facilities. It's all this amendment is about, Mr. Chairman. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Chairman, this money's going to have to come from somewhere. So, again, I would invite the committee chairman to tell us, is this part of the largest tax increase in history? Is this coming out of the Social Security Trust Fund? Is this going to be debt passed on to future generations? Where is the money going to come from? Does it reach that purpose? 
   And I cannot believe that the only parking lots that are made available to those who are disabled are somehow coming from the Federal taxpayer. I just don't believe it. 
   With that, I would urge an ``aye'' vote.

   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I must admit, every time I come to the floor and a Democrat lectures me on fiscal responsibility, I feel like I am having an Alice in Wonderland experience; and that is because the deficit is the symptom, it is spending that is the disease. And so we have Democrats come to the floor and say, well, when you Republicans were in power, you spent too much. Well, some of us Republicans agree. So what is your answer, Mr. Chairman? Well, they want to spend even more. 
   For the last 10 years, look at the record. Every time the Republicans offer one budget, the Democrats offer a budget that spends even more. And then they say it is fiscally irresponsible that the national debt went up from $5 trillion to $8 trillion. I don't like that a bit. But, guess what? Because the Democrats' budget was stone cold silent on entitlement spending, the national debt unfunded obligations is $50 trillion. So I will be glad to accept responsibility for $3 trillion when my friends on the other side of the aisle accept responsibility for their $50 trillion.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   I have heard many interesting things from the other side of the aisle tonight. I am reminded that people are entitled to their own opinions, but they shouldn't be entitled to their own facts. 
   I hear a lot of accusations that we have amendments tonight that cut Federal spending. I kind of wish it were true. But last I looked, we had an amendment that level-funded this bill, that spent the same amount of money this year as last year. Now we had an amendment that would increase funding in this bill 5.7 percent. Now we have an amendment that would increase spending up to 6.2 percent. Now, it is less than what the gentleman from Massachusetts desires, and so I guess under his definition that if you spend less money than somebody in the universe desires, that is a cut. So I think, one, we ought to have the facts on the table. 
   Second of all, I have heard many Democrats bristle at the idea that  their budget resolution included the single largest tax increase in American history. Well, don't take my word for it, Mr. Chairman. The Washington Post, not exactly known as the leading conservative publication in America, wrote: ``And while House Democrats say they want to preserve key parts of Bush's signature tax cuts, they project a surplus in 2012 only by assuming that all these cuts expire on schedule in 2010.'' Now, that is the Washington Post, which most people view as one of the more liberal newspapers in America. That's what they say. 
   Now, my friends from the other side of the aisle, Mr. Chairman, may say we are not raising taxes; we are just letting tax cuts expire. Well, Mr. Chairman, if you have the same salary or wage next year as you had last year, but somehow your tax burden is greater, I can tell you this much: Anybody in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas is going to call that a tax increase. 
   Now, something that my friends from the other side of the aisle don't seem to get, because they say that we need money for housing, we need money for transportation, we need money for this, we need money for that, there is another budget in America that funds housing, that funds transportation. Mr. Chairman, that is the family budget. And the only budget that is being cut tonight is the American family budget, and it is being cut by Democrat colleagues. 
   I talk to a lot of hard-working people in my congressional district, in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas, and I hear from them because more spending like what is included in this bill fuels more taxes, the largest single tax increase in American history. And I ask them, how is this tax increase going to impact your family budget? 
   So I hear from people like the Peterson family in Van, Texas: ``If you divide the amount by 12 months of the year, this tax increase comes out to $229.58 per month. I am a widow, full-time college student, and single mother of a growing preteen boy. This amount would be impossible to squeeze out of my already overextended monthly income ..... This monthly amount is more than half of my monthly vehicle installment ..... A tax increase of that magnitude would mean that something would have to be given up in my household.'' 
   That is the budget that is being cut here, Mr. Chairman. The Peterson family in Van, Texas, they are having their budget cut. They are having their transportation budget cut. They can't afford their monthly car payments because of this bill, which, even though they deny it, is part of the single largest tax increase in American history. 
   Or from the Jordan family in Forney, Texas, in my district: ``All of us have been affected by large increases in the price of gas for our cars, electricity rates, cost of water, and cost of food. My husband and I both drive older vehicles and turn up our thermostat to uncomfortable levels ..... This tax increase reinforces the feeling that elected leaders could care less about the struggles of families trying to avoid going into ever-increasing debt.'' 
   Well, guess what? I agree, because once again we have a bill brought to the floor by the Democrat majority that is going to cut the family budget, that is going to cut the Jordan budget in Forney, Texas. And there are family budgets all across America that are going to be cut because this bill spends too much of the people's money. It takes away from their housing priorities, it takes away from their transportation priorities to fuel the government's, Washington's, view of their priority. 
   And that is why you are either part of the problem, or you are part of the solution. And the gentlewoman from Colorado's amendment is part of the solution, and we should adopt it.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Speaker, we all understand that without action many of our citizens will find themselves laid off from their jobs. They won't be able to refinance their homes. This crisis is real. 
   House conservatives know that inaction is not an option, and we have worked tirelessly to put different plans, ideas, and legislation on the table to remedy the crisis. We take some measure of pride in knowing that the underlying legislation has now been improved twice. We believe our efforts help. 
   But, Madam Speaker, I still have many fears about the legislation before us. No one knows if this plan will truly work. We all hope it does. No one knows the true mount of taxpayer liability. The Secretary of the Treasury can go through $700 billion in no time flat and come right back to Congress for $700 billion more. 
   I fear that this legislation still remains more of a bailout than a workout. I fear that it undermines the ethic of personal responsibility. I fear that it still rewards bad behavior and punishes good. But my greatest fear, Madam Speaker, is that it fundamentally changes the role of the government in our free enterprise economy and, despite its current problems, this economy remains the envy of the world. 
   How can we have capitalism on the way up and socialism on the way down? If we lose our ability to fail, will we not soon lose our ability to succeed? If Congress bails out some firms and sectors, how can it say no to others? 
   We must be very careful as we address this financial crisis that we ensure that any short-term gain does not come at the expense of even longer term pain, that being the slippery slope to socialism. 
   Madam Speaker, the thought of my children growing up in an America with less freedom, less opportunity, and a lower standard of living is a long-term pain I cannot and will not bear. Therefore, I will vote again ``no'' on this legislation. I vote ``no'' with some doubt. But, Madam Speaker, there is a better way.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (CONDEMNING THE ONGOING PALESTINIAN ROCKET ATTACKS ON ISRAELI CIVILIANS -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, more than 4,500 rockets and mortar shells have been fired at Israel from the Gaza Strip by Hamas and other terrorist organizations since Israeli forces withdrew from there in 2005. 
   Nearly 1,000 of these rockets and mortar shells have been launched into Israel just since New Year's Day this year. The near daily rocket fire has been targeted primarily and intentionally at civilian communities in Israel, such as Sderot and Ashkelon, and the rockets being used are getting bigger and traveling farther. Some rockets have blown through living room ceilings, crashed through classrooms and downed power lines. And as a result, Israel has suffered dozens of casualties, hundreds of shock victims, thousands of traumatized children. 
   I've heard from Ruthie Eitan, a professor at Sapir College in Israel, just a mile from the Gaza Strip, who told us how the entire campus lives in constant terror. It would be like any college town in America, except this college has been hit with hundreds of rockets since the year 2000, and the barrage is not stopping. In fact, just last week, one of the students died shortly after sustaining massive wounds to his chest from a rocket in a parking lot on campus. 
   Ruthie tells us that many of Sapir's classrooms and auditoriums are unusable, either because of past rocket damage or from being in the line of future rocket fire. But somehow life attempts to go on. 
   But for Ruthie and thousands like her, we introduced this resolution to condemn in the strongest possible terms the ongoing Palestinian rocket attacks on Israeli civilians and to support the sovereign right of the Government of Israel to defend its territory and to stop the rocket attacks on its citizens. 
   And perhaps most importantly, Mr. Speaker, we reaffirm the strong and unyielding friendship between the governments and the people of Israel and the United States. 
   I strongly urge support of all my colleagues for H. Res. 951.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank my dear friend for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rarely come to the floor of the House to complain about process. It's a little bit like complaining about the refereeing in the football game. At the end of the day, it doesn't do a whole lot of good. But the irony, the irony of what I see today is so powerful, I must share it with my colleagues. 
   It was just in the last Congress that our now chairwoman of the Rules Committee, the gentlewoman from New York, said, ``Here we go again, another important issue, another closed rule. The majority is arrogant and out of control. Their unethical assault on our democratic values must stop.'' 
   That is what the gentlewoman from New York, the chairwoman of the Rules Committee, said when she didn't like closed rules when Republicans were in the majority. Well, here we have a closed rule. At least it's closed to Republicans. This Republican offered three amendments, three amendments that were very substantive amendments, none of which were found in order. So I am curious whether this closed rule, now that the Democrats are in the majority, Mr. Speaker, whether they consider it arrogant of themselves, whether they consider it an unethical assault on our democratic values to sit here and bring us a rule which is closed to Republicans. 
   I would certainly yield to the gentlewoman from California if she would like to answer whether or not it's arrogant and unethical to have a closed rule. 
   Apparently she doesn't wish to answer the question. 
   Our Speaker, before she became Speaker, said, ``We are going to have the most honest and open Congress in history.'' Nancy Pelosi, January 18, 2006. She also said, ``Bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open, full and fair debate consisting of a full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives, including a substitute.'' Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi.     
   So I am curious, did she not mean it when she said it? Does she not mean it now? Is there some carefully crafted, clever little loophole by which we can explain the Speaker's rules why there is no full amendment process? 
   And I would be happy to yield to the gentlewoman from California if she would like to explain if the Speaker doesn't mean her words. 
   Apparently she doesn't care to offer an explanation. 
   Let's get into the substance of the bill, Mr. Speaker. We are looking at an insurance program run by the Federal Government, not run particularly well, since supposedly premiums were supposed to support this program; and now, now it owes the taxpayers, $20 billion of which it admits it has no way, no chance whatsoever to pay back. None whatsoever. 
   We have a National Flood Insurance Program run by the Federal Government that subsidizes overtly certain properties, many of which are condos and vacation homes, not all, many of which are. And so we have this anomaly where a factory worker in Mesquite, Texas, in my district, who may be pulling down $50,000, $60,000 a year as a taxpayer, subsidizes the flood insurance for somebody who is making a half a million dollars and has a condo on the beach. 
   One, this is a program that is not fiscally sound. It is a program that is not fair. It is a program that screams out for reforms. And so what does the Democrat majority do? It wants to expand its coverage. It wants to create a huge, new mandatory wind policy. These are serious issues, Mr. Speaker.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time. 
   I listened very carefully to the gentleman from Mississippi, and he may recall that I went to his hometown and I saw what was left of his home. I saw that devastation and I spoke to those people firsthand. 
   Although my family didn't feel quite that devastation, my in-laws lived in New Orleans and their home was severely damaged in Hurricane Katrina. My father-in-law was in the New Orleans Convention Center when all of the violence broke out. That is something that my family knows about, so I know there has been a lot of pain in that community. And I have no doubt that  the Federal Government, which has already rendered over $100 billion of taxpayer aid, can do more good; but I fear, I fear this is not the solution. 
   Now I look at the legislation and I understand it is designed to be actuarially sound. I understand that the taxpayers aren't supposed to have to pay more. I understand that factory worker in Mesquite, Texas, in my district, who generously gave to help fellow Americans in their time of need, he has come to me and said, ``Congressman, I want to be helpful, but tell me we don't have to do this again.'' 
   Congress can't outlaw hurricanes, but what do we do to make sure that he doesn't have to pay again. 
   So now we have a program that is not actuarially sound. It was designed to be, but it is not. So on the coverages that we have, and I will admit under the chairman's leadership there have been a number of reforms put into the program that I support, but we are increasing coverages. We are upping coverages. We are adding wind on top of a program that already owes the taxpayer $20 billion that they have no way to pay for whatsoever. 
   I would note, we had other insurance programs that were supposed to be financially sound: Social Security, which now is a long-term deficit of $8.9 trillion; Federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation is supposed to be fiscally sound, running a deficit of $18 billion, off-balance sheet liability of $73 billion. We have already talked about the National Flood Insurance Program, Federal crop insurance, Medicaid. I could go on and on. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have no doubt again that the people on the gulf coast continue to be in need. But we were told a little earlier this week, I believe by our Speaker, this is supposed to the Congress of the child. Well, let's look at the future of our children. When you look at the spending of the Federal Government already, we know that Chairman Bernanke has said, ``Without early and meaningful action, the U.S. economy will be seriously weakened, with future generations bearing much of the cost.''     
   That's just with the government we have today. The GAO has said we're on the verge of being the first generation in America's history to leave the next generation with the lowest standard of living due to all of this spending. This program makes it worse. It must be rejected.

   Mr. HENSARLING. I certainly thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for leading this hour. I want to thank the other members of the Republican Study Committee, the House's conservative caucus, for lending their voice here. 
   In the remaining time, I just want to make a couple of points, and that is, we see every night the cost of fighting this war, and it is a heavy cost. It's a heavy cost in terms of money and, much more importantly, lives. But we need to again remember the cost of losing this war and what that could mean and how serious the threat is. 
   I was home during the August recess, got to spend time not only with my wife and children, but with my parents. My mother reminded me of something that she said from time to time, and that is, sometimes life is full of lousy options. And yes, fighting this war is costly. But losing this war could be even costlier if Iraq becomes what Afghanistan once was, under the Taliban, a breeding ground, a training ground for terrorists that are bent on hurting our country. 
   And we have to remember these are people who have said they have the right to kill 4 million Americans. Two million of them are children and two of those 2 million are mine. We have to remember what the cost of defeat is. 
   So we finally have signs for cautious optimism. We all need to have an open mind when the report comes in.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Speaker, today I rise to recognize the individuals who sacrificed their lives on September 11, 2001 to protect the safety of our citizens and preserve our great Nation's freedom. 
   The world was forever changed 7 years ago on the morning of September 11. Nearly 3,000 innocent people were murdered at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and on a quiet field in Pennsylvania. 
   While we think back to the massive destruction of that day and mourn the lives lost, we will also never forget the shared spirit of togetherness that followed our sorrow. The countless acts of heroism and bravery on 9/11 gave birth to a dawn of unity and camaraderie. 
   We must thank our first responders who go to work each day willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to save a complete stranger. We must thank the men and women of our armed forces who defend our freedom and Nation. Because of their sacrifices, our Nation stands tall on the great progress that has been achieved by these brave men and women. 
   Since September 11, 2001, we have reshaped our homeland's defense and significantly improved our readiness to deal with terrorist attacks. The war on terror is a struggle for freedom unlike any other that our Nation has faced. We must always be as united behind our cause as they are behind theirs. 
   When America unites to defend the same ideals and virtues that our fathers, grandfathers and generations prior have defended, we know that she will remain a beacon of liberty around the world. 
   Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Fifth District of Texas, I would like to express my eternal gratitude to the men and women that defended our Nation 7 years ago and to the individuals who continue to protect us at home and abroad.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman and my dear friend from Texas for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, the fiscal mismanagement of the Democrats continues. In just 19 months, our friends on the other side of the aisle have managed to double the Federal deficit. They have given us the single largest 1-year increase in the Federal debt, an extra $600 billion. They've given us the largest unfunded obligation ever of the Nation, $57.3 trillion, that's trillion with a T, Madam Speaker, roughly $400,000 of debt per American family under this Democrat leadership. They've given us the largest Federal budget ever. They've given us the largest tax increase ever. They've given a blank check to Fannie and Freddie drawn on the checking accounts of working men and women all over the Nation. 
   And today, today, to the best of my knowledge, for the first time in America's history, they are raiding a bankrupt Treasury in order to give money to the highway trust fund. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, how did we get here? I submit to you it's two reasons. 
   Our friends on the other side of the aisle love earmarks, but, unfortunately, they don't love American made energy. 
   In the last highway bill, as my friend, the gentleman from Arizona, pointed out, 6,300 different earmarks, $24 billion worth. We wouldn't be here, Madam Speaker, if it wasn't for this ``earmarkaholism.'' 
   Now, not all these earmarks are bad. But, Madam Speaker, something called the highway trust fund, why do we have Democrat earmarks for landscaping? Why do we have Democrat earmarks for hiking trails in Tennessee? Why do we have Democrat earmarks, a quarter million dollars for boardwalks? 
   Madam Speaker, why did we end up with $600,000 for horse riding trails in the Jefferson National Forest in Virginia? 
   Madam Speaker, why did the Democrats bring us earmarks, $8 million for a parking facility in Harlem? And the list goes on and on. 
   Now, I'll admit, Madam Speaker, there's been a number of earmarks on our side of the aisle. But this side of the aisle woke up. They understand the American people, and the American people want a moratorium, and it's Republicans that have called for a moratorium. 
   But more importantly, right now, Madam Speaker, one of the reasons there's no money in the trust fund is people can't afford to drive because Democrats view our oil and gas reserves in our Nation as toxic waste sites, and Republicans view them as natural resources to relieve pain at the pump. 
   And that's why, Madam Speaker, if we would simply enact the American Energy Act, the All-of-the-Above Act, Americans could drive again and we could fill up these coffers, and we wouldn't be here today. 
   And, finally, to be here today without any offsets is an absolute tragedy for this Nation. And this bill should be rejected.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have listened very carefully to the debate last evening and today. And I have heard a number of complaints and concerns from our friends on the other side of the aisle. First let me speak to the process. 
   There are a lot of complaints that somehow we are spending too much time debating this appropriations bill. Well, Mr. Chairman, I would point out that the last appropriations bill, the one that funded our troops in harm's way, this body spent almost 4 months, almost 4 months, coming up with that appropriations bill. And, Mr. Chairman, as I look at the clock, we haven't even debated this one yet for 24 hours. 
   Mr. Chairman, we also hear that, well, if you care about homeland security, you have to pass this bill and you have to pass it today. Don't you care about homeland security? Well, Mr. Chairman, as an appropriations bill, to the best of my knowledge, there is nothing in this bill that will go into effect until October 1. So here we are in June and we are being told, no, we can't submit to Democratic procedures here. We can't thoroughly vet and debate this important bill. It has to be passed today, even though it doesn't go into effect until October. 
   And then, Mr. Chairman, we have heard, well, the reason that we don't have our earmarks listed in the bill, the reason that there is this secret slush fund that someday somehow will be unveiled to all is because, well, the staff hasn't had time to vet all of these earmarks.     
   Well, Mr. Chairman, again, when our friends from the other side of the aisle took over as the majority and rewrote the rules, apparently they didn't read their own rules very well. Members on both sides of the aisle became confused. Nobody even knew how to submit their earmark request. 
   So then to turn around and somehow point to this side of the aisle when it was that side of the aisle, Mr. Chairman, that created the problem. I mean, it's like the old proverbial person who is being indicted for murder who says, Well, please don't convict me, I know I killed my parents, but now I'm an orphan. Well, they are the ones who caused the problem, Mr. Chairman, so I don't quite understand why they are complaining about the process that brought us here in the first place. 
   As I listen to the debate, Mr. Chairman, and I do believe this is an important bill, and I believe there is a lot of  important work and very important provisions in this bill, but I think also there seems to be, as I listen closely to the debate on the other side of the aisle, there seems to be no appreciation whatsoever of the role the poor, beleaguered taxpayer plays in homeland security, like there is some unlimited vault from the workers of America to pay for all of this. 
   Mr. Chairman, those on the other side of the aisle, by refusing to do anything about entitlement spending, have put us on a fiscal course to where the next generation won't even have a Department of Homeland Security. Let us learn the lessons of history or we will be condemned to repeat them. 
   One of the reasons that the Soviet Union, the evil empire, doesn't exist anymore is because their economy collapsed. They could not keep pace. Their workers could not produce what was necessary to defend that state. And now we are looking at our friends from this side of the aisle putting us on a fiscal course that would render our total inability to provide for a Department of Homeland Security. 
   Now, I know the easy thing to do is kick the can down the road, worry about the next election, don't worry about the next generation; but Mr. Chairman, I don't think that is worthy of this body. 
   Mr. Chairman, ultimately this comes down to the role of earmarks and our ability to fund this. As my colleague in the other body, Senator Coburn of Oklahoma, has said, earmarks are the gateway drug to spending addiction. Now, I know there are many good earmarks, there are many worthy earmarks; I myself do not request them. But for many Members they have become that gateway drug to spending addiction, making it more difficult to fund our homeland security. Those on the other side of the aisle campaigned for increased transparency, and all we are asking is that Members have the ability to strike at these.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, clearly, anyone who loses their job in America due to factors beyond their control deserve help. That's why we have the unemployment insurance program in the first place. 
   TAA, obviously, goes beyond that and says, if you lose your job because of foreign trade, then you're going to get extra benefits. 
   I would be even more enthusiastic about the program if I thought there was any agenda to promote trade by the Democrat majority. I see none. They have allowed the fast track to elapse. I have yet to see any trade agreement come to this floor. And I can say in Texas, the State that I hail from, one out of seven jobs is tied to trade. Trade is important. But I see no pro trade agenda here. What I do see is a massive expansion of another government program with a massive tax increase to go along with it. 
   Now, we know that roughly 3 percent of Americans will have their jobs displaced by trade. We know that trade will create far more jobs. 
   But again, I might be more enthusiastic about this legislation if I saw the Democrat majority step up to do something about those who lose their jobs due to frivolous litigation. And yet they've excelled at preventing any kind of tort reform in this economy whatsoever. 
   I might be more enthusiastic about this package if I saw the Democrat majority do anything to address those who lose their jobs due to excess taxation, particularly on small businesses, the job engine of America.     
   And yet we know that the distinguished chairman of the Ways and Means Committee just announced ``the mother of all tax hikes.'' Millions and millions of small businessmen all across America could see their taxes increase 25 percent. How many Americans are going to lose their job? Where's the sympathy for those people? Where is their particular special carve-out in the unemployment insurance program? I don't see it. 
   And yet again another current theme we see in all the Democratic legislation is let's somehow loosen up the standards of who can qualify here. Whether it be for housing benefits and agriculture appropriations, whether it be in SCHIP, what we see is language to make it easier for illegal immigrants to access these benefits. We see it each and every time that the bill comes to the floor. We see it yet again in this legislation. Clearly, the American people reject this. That's why this particular program needs to be rejected.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, this is clearly one of the most important votes that many of us will cast in our congressional careers. We are all concerned about the state of our economy. We are all concerned about the state of our capital markets. What has infected Wall Street may soon reach Main Street. Inaction has never been an option. But, again, the Paulson plan should never have been our only option. I fear other options, Madam Speaker, have never been considered seriously in the body. Although I certainly want to congratulate our ranking member, Spencer Bachus; our Republican leadership--Eric Cantor of Virginia, Paul Ryan of Wisconsin--for the work they've done to improve this bill, this is clearly a better bill, Madam Speaker, than it was a week ago, but that's not the relevant test. The relevant test is when you look at the good in the bill, when you look at the bad in the bill, does it take America in a direction that you believe America should go? By that test, Madam Speaker, I will vote ``no'' on this legislation. 
   I fear this legislation before us is fraught with unintended consequences. I fear that ultimately it may not work. I fear that it is too much bailout and not enough workout. I fear that taxpayers may end up inheriting the mother of all debts. Now, some have come to the House floor and said, well, the taxpayer's going to make money on this. You know what, Madam Speaker: They may be right. I can tell you this much, Madam Speaker: as history as our guide, the taxpayer lost $200 billion on the S&L bailout. I can raid my neighbor's college fund for his children, go put it on a roulette table in Las Vegas, maybe I'll triple his money for him, but you know what, Madam Speaker, it's not a risk my neighbor voluntarily assumed. 
   I fear that under this plan, ultimately the Federal Government will become the guarantor of last resort and, Madam Speaker, that does put us on the slippery slope to socialism. If you lose your ability to fail, soon you will lose your ability to succeed. That's why, Madam Speaker, House conservatives have put forth an alternative plan, and we are happy to work on it today and all next week. As important as it is to act quickly, it is more important to act rightly. We would hope this plan would get serious consideration. 
   And, Madam Speaker, once it does, we hope that we can go on--that we can address the taxpayer crisis, as our fellow citizens are looking at the largest tax increase in American history; the spending crisis of an out-of-control Congress; the energy crisis where we see too many of our fellow citizens struggling to pay their bills. 
   Madam Speaker, as we look at this legislation, and I respect all regardless of what side they come down on, if in doubt, err on the side of freedom.

   In the big scope of the Federal budget perhaps the dollars are not large, but before we can really ever attack spending, we have to attack the culture of spending, and you have to lead by example. 
   And why can't we ask people in the Federal Government, as we ask families all around the Nation, as our friends on the other side of the aisle have recently passed the single largest tax increase in history, they're expecting American families to somehow do more with less. Can't we expect a few of the administrators of this agency to somehow, somehow get by on the same amount of money they had last year? 
   I encourage the support for this amendment.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I'd like to associate myself with the comments of the gentlewoman from Tennessee. I, too, appreciate the leadership of the gentleman from Iowa in offering this amendment. 
   Again, the dollars may be small but the principle is large, and frankly, Mr. Chairman, I really somewhat object to those who somehow suggest that after a budget was passed in this institution, representing the largest single tax increase in American history, that somehow amendments to try to save the people's money are somehow dilatory, are somehow frivolous, are somehow not worthy of debate in this democratic institution. 
   We spent months, months debating one spending bill on whether or not to support our troops in Iraq, months, and now we hear protests from the other side, hours into a regular appropriations bill. Somehow after hours we've grown tired of that particular process. 
   Mr. Chairman, I'm worried about this largest single tax increase in American history and what it means to people in my district, the Fifth District of Texas, how it impacts their ability to send their children to college, how it impacts their ability to start a small business, how it impacts their ability to pay their health care premiums. Every opportunity we have to try to get some of that money back to them is an important use of this body's time, a very important use. 
   And so there are several amendments that have a very simple proposition behind them, and the simple proposition is in this particular Department, can't you level-fund from one year to the next year just that group administering the programs. All over America, after passing this single largest tax increase in the history, we're asking American families to somehow do with less, and all we're asking these people to do is do with the same amount that you had last year. That's all that we're asking, Mr. Chairman. 
   But there are bigger issues involved here besides the roughly $2,600, $2,700 per family in the Fifth District of Texas who are going to have to pay that single largest tax increase in history. 
   But we look to the future, and we know what happens if we don't take the first few steps towards fiscal sanity. Already we have been warned by the Congressional Budget Office, we've been warned by the Office of Management and Budget, we've been warned by the Comptroller General what is going to happen to this Nation if we don't do something about entitlement spending, something that our friends on the other side of the aisle refuse to engage in. Social Security and Medicare, in their budget, there's nothing about that. 
   We've heard from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke: Without early and meaningful action to address the rapid growth in entitlements, the U.S. economy could be seriously weakened, with future generations bearing much of the cost. Too much expenditure of the people's money impacts the people's security. 
   We've heard from Comptroller General Walker: The rising costs of government entitlements are a fiscal cancer that threatens catastrophic consequences for our country and could bankrupt America. 
   How are we going to pay for future homeland security bills if we don't take the first few steps towards fiscal responsibility now? Simply level-fund, level-fund, not cut, level-fund the administrative function and lead by example. Lead by example. 
   Mr. Chairman, we haven't even talked about the secret earmark slush fund yet, which, again, I don't understand. I would think if there was any party who would heed the lessons well of the last election, it would be the party that has become the majority party. They know the people are outraged at earmarks, at the process, and so instead of taking this forward, the new majority is taking us backwards. 
   Now, Mr. Chairman, I don't want to necessarily personalize debate, so I will paraphrase here, but recently the Wisconsin State Journal, and I paraphrase, said the Democrats are now dodging the very reforms they helped to generate, and that with this new secret slush fund, and I paraphrase once again, it would prevent lawmakers from questioning earmarks.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Colorado for offering this amendment, and I want to thank him for his leadership in this body, particularly on matters of fiscal responsibility. And I know his district is proud to have him as their Representative. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is a very serious matter that we discuss this evening. Like many Members of Congress, I commute. I work in Washington, but I live back in my district. And I have two small children that happen to be visiting this particular week, and I think about threats to my children and I know the threat of radical Islam. It is one of the most serious threats that they face. So I take the debate on this bill on homeland security very seriously. 
   But, Mr. Chairman, I see other threats to my children's future and my Nation's future. And another threat I see is a Federal budget that has grown beyond the ability of the family budget to pay for it. And, Mr. Chairman, I am afraid if I look at a bill that calls for roughly a 14 percent increase from one year to the next, almost twice the level of what the President requested, I question what this is going to do to the future of my children and the future of my country. 
   Because don't take my word for it, Mr. Chairman; look again at what the Congressional Budget Office has told us, the Office of Management and Budget, the Secretary of Treasury, the Federal Reserve, both conservative and liberal think tanks. They have told us that the present spending patterns that we have, if we don't begin to change the way we spend the people's money, if we don't reform out-of-control entitlement spending, the next generation will face one of two perils. Either, number one, we will actually see their taxes doubled, just to sustain this rate of growth in spending, their taxes will be doubled; otherwise, we will have a Federal Government that consists of little more than Medicaid and Medicare and Social Security. 
   I mean, Mr. Chairman, that is what is almost ironic about this debate; that as we talk about plussing up this account by 14 percent, if we don't change the way we spend the people's money, there won't even be a Department of Homeland Security for the next generation. So, again, what we are doing here in this bill is, we are kicking the can down the road, I fear. 
   And as I look at how money is spent, it reminds me, it is not always how much money you spend. It is how you spend the money. And I don't know if it is the President's fault, Democrats' fault, Republicans' fault, everyone's fault, nobody's fault. But when I see the Department of Homeland Security money somehow ending up helping fund lawn mower races, as the gentleman from Arizona brought to our attention, fund puppet shows, how is that a critical mission within the Department of Homeland Security? That is beyond me. That is beyond me. 
   So I think we have to look very carefully at how the money is spent. And I am afraid that throwing this much money at this situation is just going to exacerbate this kind of spending. 
   Now, in my home district, I am very happy when every volunteer fire department in every small community in my district gets a new pumper truck. I am happy to announce that. I wonder, though, with the challenges we face for the next generation if it is really mission critical. 
   And I am very concerned, as the gentleman from Arizona has spoken, as many others have risen on the floor today, about what is happening in the earmark process. Again, it is not so much always how much money you spend; it is how you spend the people's money. 
   So the new majority that promised us earmark reform is now telling us that they are going to do something completely opposite. They are going to take away the ability for Members, Members who are on the floor today, with the exception of one, I suppose, to offer amendments to strike these earmarks to get at spending perhaps like the lawn mower races. This is moving in the complete opposite direction of what the majority promised when they took office. 
   The American people will not stand idly by.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   First, I want to thank the gentlelady from North Carolina for her amendment. And I want to say, Mr. Chairman, I am very disappointed by some comments I have heard from the other side of the aisle that somehow this is not a worthy debate. I believe one of my colleagues said, I thought I would come to the floor and find us debating something important. 
   How we spend the people's money, how much money we take from hardworking Americans is a very important matter. How much of the bread we take off of the table of that hardworking teacher in Malakoff, Texas, is a very important matter. How much money we take from the fireman, the fireman in Crandall, Texas, who is working to ensure our safety, and how much of the bread we take off of his table is a very important matter, Mr. Chairman. And not just how much money, but once we take that money, how we spend that money. 
   We know that the people, the people, decry how the practice of earmarks has been practiced in this House. And I wished when the Republicans were in the majority we would have done a better job. I was often disappointed. I, myself, don't request earmarks, although I know there are many that are worthy. 
   But at least when this party was in the majority, they woke up and heard the voices of people and said, we need reform. We need accountability. We need transparency. And Members were  given that ability to focus sunlight, sunshine, on those earmarks, and they were allowed a process by which to strike them from the bill. 
   Now I read a number of quotes from our new Democrat majority leadership. The Speaker said, ``I would just as soon do away with them,'' referring to earmarks. She said shortly after becoming Speaker, ``We have placed a moratorium on earmarks until a new reform process is in place to ensure the integrity of every earmark that is funded.'' A new reform process. 
   So now we discover, Mr. Chairman, that the new reform process is to take it out of the sunshine, hide it in the darkness, take away Members' ability to strike it from the bill, and give that, albeit apparently, to one individual who apparently is all knowing, all seeing, and all powerful when it comes to these earmarks. 
   I do not believe, Mr. Chairman, that the American people will sit idly by for this practice. Already the Third Estate is letting the people know what is going on. I don't want to personalize the debate, but let me paraphrase from the Wisconsin State Journal. I won't talk about individual Members, but I will talk about the majority. 
   The Wisconsin State Journal: The Democrats are, and I paraphrase, ``now dodging the very reforms they helped to generate.'' This will ``prevent the public and most lawmakers from questioning earmarks until it is too late.'' Wisconsin State Journal, June 7. 
   The Cleveland Plain Dealer, ``Five months after,'' and again I paraphrase, the Democrat majority, ``took control, the promises remain unfulfilled.'' And what we have, ``That's a secretive process, and its final product gets a `yes' or `no' vote in each Chamber. This means earmarks will sail through before the press or even most Members of Congress can examine or challenge them.'' The Cleveland Plain Dealer of June 10. 
   The Mobile, Alabama, Press Register. ``Democrats work ATM,'' automatic teller machine. ``But now that they control the ATM, the Democrats are finding all sorts of excuses to keep the earmark dispenser open for business. Democrats are reneging on their vows of fiscal responsibility just a few months after they won their chance to load the ATM.'' The Mobile Press Register, June 8. 
   And the list goes on and on and on. 
   Mr. Chairman, there ought to be a message loud and clear from the last election. The people want to reform earmarks. This bill, this Democrat majority, this process, takes us in the exact opposite direction, and it is one more reason we need to support the gentlewoman's amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, we have three different versions of essentially the same Democrat budget that is being presented today. They are all fiscally irresponsible. They all promote the Federal budget over the family budget. They all compromise the future of our children and grandchildren. 
   Let me tell you, Madam Chair, what they have in common. Each one would represent the single largest tax increase in the history of the United States of America. 
   Now this particular chart, Madam Chairman, because I didn't have the numbers available in the Progressive budget, shows what the Democrat Conference budget would do: Almost $400 billion of new taxes on working families; single largest tax increase in America's history. What did the Democrats do last time they were in power, Madam Chair? Well, that was back in 1993. And guess what? They gave us the single largest tax increase in America's history. This particular version of the Democrat budget, see that red there? I would have to have another chart to represent that tax increase because I believe they actually double what the Democrat Conference budget is doing. 
   And, Madam Chairman, people need to know that every time you are increasing the Federal budget, you are decreasing some family budget. Some hardworking family in America is trying to make ends meet. Many of those families are in my district, the Fifth Congressional District of Texas. 
   I heard from one of those families recently. I heard from Linda, I will use her first name, in Roulette, Texas. And she writes: 
   ``Dear Congressman, that tax increase would mean the difference of whether my daughter and her husband would be able to purchase a car or not. For my husband and I, it helps us to continue for his radiation treatments for his prostate cancer. It allows us to continue to provide in-home assistance for my elderly parents, one who has Parkinson's and one who has dementia. Please allow us to retain this money for our needs. Please don't allow our government to take additional tax dollars from us. Please allow us to decide how this money will be spent.'' 
   Madam Chairman, again, when they take money to fuel the Federal budget, to fuel the Federal bureaucracy, they are taking money away from hardworking families. They need that money for their educational needs, for their health care needs, for their housing needs. 
   When is it that you ever have enough of the taxpayers' money? Already in Washington we are spending over $23,000 per American household for the first time in American history since World War II. We must protect the family budget from the Federal budget and prevent this single largest tax increase in American history from being imposed on hardworking American families. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of the time. 
   Madam Chair, all of the Democrats' budgets are breathtakingly bad and fiscally irresponsible for what they do. They impose the single largest tax increase in American history on hardworking American families. They each represent the highest level of spending in the history of our Nation at a time when we are taking $23,000 away, spending $23,000 per family for only the first time since World War II. 
   But as breathtakingly bad as they are for what they do, they are even worse for what they do not do because, Madam Chair, they are absolutely stone cold silent on the number one fiscal issue facing this Nation, facing the next generation, and that is, reforming entitlement spending, which will plunge the next generation into trillions and trillions of dollars of debt. 
   Don't take my word for it. Take the word of the Comptroller General, the chief fiduciary officer of the United States of America, who has said that we are on the verge of being the first generation to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living. I mean, think about that, Madam Chair, because we are spending so much of the people's money that these programs that have been vital to people for generations will go away. If you do not reform Medicare and Social Security and Medicaid, they will not be here for the next generation. 
   Madam Chair, as the father of a 5-year-old daughter and a 3-year-old son, I cannot sit idly by and let that happen. We must keep faith with prior generations by keeping faith with future generations. 
   Let's reform entitlement spending. Let's give the next generation more opportunity and more freedoms. Vote down this Democrat budget.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I do want to speak in favor of the McHenry amendment. I think it is a vitally important amendment that we debate on this House floor today. Maybe the dollar amount is modest; the principle is huge. This is a body that spends too much of the people's money, and it has repercussions. And no matter how intensely our friends from the other side of the aisle want to prevent us from painting a picture for the American people on where their spending is leading, we feel compelled to speak out. 
   Mr. Chairman, already this body is spending over $23,000 per American household. In real terms, it's one of the greatest amounts since World War II. Every appropriations bill that has come to the floor, practically every single one is spending more money than last year, way beyond the rate of inflation and beyond the ability of the family budget to pay for the excess in the Federal budget. 
   So, now we have an Agriculture appropriations bill which is almost 6 percent above last year. I assure you, the American people didn't get a 6 percent raise, those who are expected to pay for it. And beyond the 6 percent increase, the bill expands mandatory spending. Now, supposedly PAYGO is supposed to apply to this, but it doesn't because we have a PAYGO loophole. And this is a big, big loophole, Mr. Chairman. And we need to pay attention to more mandatory spending. Because already, simply with the government that we have today, before our friends on the other side of the aisle add on a massive increase in an SCHIP program that's going to be funded with tax increases and Medicare cuts, before they do that, we're already on automatic pilot to double taxes on the next generation. We're either going to double taxes on the next generation or there is not going to be any Federal Government to speak of, except Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. There will barely be any funds for anything else. 
   And don't take my word for it, Madam Chair, take the word of the Office of Management and Budget, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the conservative Heritage Foundation, the liberal Brookings Institute. So there is this train wreck coming on entitlement spending. 
   We have a modest amendment that would reduce a little bit of spending in the Agriculture bill to take off that pressure, and instead the amendment is simply mocked. Well, we can't do that because we know if we don't pass this amendment, this modest amendment, to save money on the Agriculture appropriations bill, we know what it's leading to on SCHIP, a new permanent entitlement of almost $160 billion over 10 years. I mean, Madam Chair, this is unconscionable, unconscionable on top of the burden that is already going to be placed upon future taxpayers. 
   Now, we have so many Members who come to the floor and talk about, well, we have to be here for the least of these. Well, Madam Chair, I would posit that maybe the least of these are those who do not vote and those who have yet to be born. And so that is why we need the amendment passed by the gentleman from North Carolina to save this money, to take pressure off of creating this new huge permanent entitlement in SCHIP. 
   We also need this amendment in this Ag bill to take the pressure off this huge cut in Medicare that the Democrat majority is now planning, as they seek to pit grandparents against their grandchildren in this massive SCHIP tax-spend-debt spiral. I mean, they're going to increase taxes, the tobacco taxes. I'm not a smoker. I used to be a volunteer in the American Cancer Society, but last I looked, it's still a legal activity. So taxes are going to fall on low- and moderate-income Americans as they seek to take away private insurance from others and put them onto a public insurance plan. 
   We're looking again at cutting Medicare Advantage plans, almost 20 percent of the people. We're going to have pressure to cut Medicare.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, it is a fundamental freedom of the American people to purchase products in an open, competitive market. International trade is the key to opening more markets for more American consumers. More trade means more competition, and competition means families can buy more using less of their paychecks. More trade also means expanded opportunities for American exporters and job creation. 
   Many Democrats claim that trade, for some reason, is a bad thing for our economy. They are wrong. The facts show that trade has had a very good impact on our economy. Approximately 12 million, or 10 percent, of all U.S. jobs depend on exports. One in five factory jobs depend on international Federal trade. 
   Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has emphasized that because of increased trade since World War II, U.S. annual incomes have been boosted over $10,000 per household. And if we would just eliminate all remaining trade barriers, U.S. incomes would rise anywhere from $4,000 to $12,000. 
   We in Congress may have the power, but do we have the right to deny Americans better incomes and better opportunities by preventing them from buying cheaper products overseas? I say ``no.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank him for his leadership in this body, and I thank him for his friendship. 
   Madam Speaker, I know of no one in this body who represents greater integrity and greater honor than the gentleman from South Carolina. His district was very wise to send him to the United States House of Representatives. I want to thank the gentlelady from Tennessee who preceded me who is one of the most dynamic Members  we have in this entire body for the clarity and persuasion of her speech, a lady who knows how challenging it is for families to be able to put food on the table, put gasoline in the car, pay for their health care expenses, and knows that ultimately it is the family budget that ends up paying for the bloated Federal budget. 
   Now I didn't join the Budget Committee because I enjoyed numbers. In fact, I think probably the worst grade I ever made in my life was in an accounting course at Texas A&M University many, many years ago. But I joined the Budget Committee because ultimately the budget is about priorities. And, Madam Speaker, I came to this body because I believe America needs greater freedom and greater opportunity. And you can't have more freedom and more government. You have to choose between one or the other. And sometimes, Madam Speaker, especially at a time of challenging economic times, you have got to decide which is more important, a government check or a paycheck. And right now government increasingly is taking a bite out of that family paycheck to pay for bloated Washington spending. 
   Well, Madam Speaker, I don't know if the American people know it, but right now the Federal Government is spending over $23,000 per American family. It is the first time since World War II that the government has spent that much money, over $23,000. Madam Speaker, I wonder how many families that are listening to this debate tonight think they are getting their $23,000 worth out of the United States Federal Government. 
   Now some will say government has great needs. But you know what, it's not always how much money you spend in Washington that counts, it's how you spend the money. And I want a Federal Government that does a few things 
   well, like guards my family and the families of all Americans against radical Islamic terrorists. I want a Federal Government that can control our borders. I want a Federal Government that will provide a social safety net for those who are too old, too young, and too disabled to help themselves. But outside of that, I want people to go out and have greater freedom and greater opportunity, and have the greatest welfare system known to mankind. And when I say welfare, I mean greater education, greater housing, greater nutrition. That program is called the American free enterprise system, and it is under assault. And one of the things that is assaulting it is the Federal budget. 
   Now let's talk about the fight that is taking place in Congress right now, and that is a fight about whether or not Americans ought to receive a huge automatic tax increase that our friends on the other side of the aisle, Madam Speaker, the Democrats, have passed into legislation. 
   Right now over the next 3 years there will be a huge automatic tax increase on the American people. Now is that what this economy needs now, when people are concerned about their job losses, when they are having trouble filling up their Ford F-150 pickup trucks, when they are having trouble buying milk at the grocery store? I have a 5-year-old and a 4-year-old and they're very thirsty and they drink that milk. And it is expensive. 
   And so the question right now is, should there be a huge automatic tax increase on the American people? Well, Madam Speaker, the Republicans think that there shouldn't be, that we shouldn't have a huge automatic tax increase. Let me tell you what the Democrats have passed. 
   Right now, if we don't change this, the top tax income bracket will go to 39.6 percent, an increase of 13.1 percent. Now why is that important? We always hear, well, you know, this is the wealthy and they need to pay more taxes. Well, you know who files at this rate, Madam Speaker, is small businesses. And, guess what, you can't have capitalism without capital. I used to be a small businessman. I signed the front of a paycheck. I used to sign the back of the paycheck, but I signed the front of the paycheck and I have risked capital. So now all of a sudden the Democrats have put into law a 13.1-percent tax increase on hundreds of thousands of small businesses across our Nation at the very time when they are trying to meet their payroll. What sense does that make, Madam Speaker? 
   Capital gains. The capital of capitalism. Democrats want to increase taxes on that 33.3 percent. If you want to talk about something that's going to send more jobs overseas, it's increasing the tax rate on capital gains. Dividends go up 164 percent. That's right, 164 percent, under the automatic tax increases that the Democrats are going to impose on us. 
   The death tax. You have already paid taxes on it once. You shouldn't have to visit the undertaker and the IRS on the same day, and yet that is going to go from zero up to 55 percent, Madam Speaker. 
   The child tax credit is going to get cut in half. And the lowest tax bracket for the lowest wage earners in America, their taxes are going to increase 50 percent. Under the Democrat plan, Madam Speaker, it is going to go from a 10 percent bracket to a 15-percent bracket. 
   Now is this the recipe that our economy needs? I don't think so. I don't think so. But yet Democrats tell us, well, we need more money because we've got to do all this Washington spending. Well, if you look in the rearview mirror, Madam Speaker, you will see that over the last 10 years government has grown by about 75 percent, and yet the family budget, which has to pay for that Federal budget, has only grown 30 percent. 
   Now ultimately something has to give. And so again our Democrat colleagues, Madam Speaker, tell us, well, we have to raise taxes. And all those tax increases that they want to impose right when the economy is having troubles, they say, well, we've got to raise taxes to somehow balance the budget. 
   Well, Madam Speaker, if people would look at this chart, we don't have a taxation problem, we have a spending problem. Right now the difference between this blue line and red line is this huge massive tax increase that the Democrats want to impose upon hardworking American families, on farmers, on teachers, on small businesses. And look at how much revenue it gains you. And this, Madam Speaker, not to get into too much inside baseball, is what we call a static analysis. This assumes that raising people's taxes has no impact on economic growth. We know that's not true. 
   So given the Democrats' every single assumption, if they do this massive tax increase which is going to amount to roughly $3,000 per American family over the next 3 years, it doesn't get anywhere close to the green line. That's the spending line. That is the line that represents the Federal Government on automatic pilot. That is if no new programs are added, that is how much is going to be spent. And what does that represent? Don't take my word for it; take the Comptroller General's word for it, the chief fiduciary officer in the United States Government. He says that line right there represents either, number one, a doubling of taxes on our children, or it represents a Federal Government that consists of almost nothing but Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. And anybody in charge of counting money for the Federal Government will tell you the same thing. Where is the ethic in that? Where is the morality in that? Imposing that kind of burden on the next generation? But, no, we have so many colleagues that care about the next election and not the next generation.     
   Almost 6 years ago I got in the next generation business because I have a 5-year-old daughter and a 4-year-old son, and I care desperately about their future. So we have to do something about out-of-control spending, and yet our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the Democrats, every single day they add a new program, completely oblivious to the cost on our children and grandchildren, the least of these, those who cannot vote and those yet to be born. 
   If we are to work our way out of the economic challenges we have today, much less spare our children and grandchildren a doubling of their taxation to where we would be the first generation in American history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living, if we are going to keep our faith with our forefathers, if we are going to show fidelity to the future generations and be good stewards  of the American dream, we have to defeat these massive Democrat tax increases. We have to defeat their massive increases in spending. 
   Madam Speaker, it all starts with something we call earmarks, congressional earmarks. As a dear friend of mine in the Senate, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma said, ``Earmarks are the gateway drug to spending addiction.'' There are too many bridges to nowhere, there are too many indoor rainforests. There are too many teapot museums. And the American people are waking up that all too often somebody in this body has taken a bite out of their paycheck so that some Member of Congress can keep his. The system is broken. 
   Republicans in this body have called for an earmark moratorium. They have called for a select committee to clean up this system where the American people too often see money going into campaign contributions. Money coming in one end of Washington, DC, and they see earmarks coming out the other end. The system is broken. It has to be changed, and all the Democrats have said is no, we are not going to join you. They have gone the complete opposite direction. 
   I am proud to be a member of this Republican conference that is trying to clean up this earmark mess, trying to control spending and control taxation so we can get this economy going and Americans can keep their jobs and have a brighter future for themselves and their children and their grandchildren. 
   I thank the gentleman from South Carolina for his leadership, and thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, since the Democrats took control of Congress the price of gas has increased 75 percent. Mr. Speaker, their first response was to declare a 6-week vacation while the American people suffered. Republicans spoke out. The American people heard. They demanded action. 
   So now what do we have, Mr. Speaker? In the dark of night, we have produced a 240-page nonenergy energy bill, with no amendments, no substitutes, no committee hearings, supposedly from a Speaker who promised us the most open, democratic, and fair process known to mankind. These are strong-arm tactics that are more befitting of Hugo Chavez's Venezuela than they are the United States of America. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill does not produce American energy. It is a sham. It is a fraud. There are no new refineries, no clean coal, no ANWR, no nuclear, and regardless of what they say, Mr. Speaker, no production of our deep sea resources. 
   And, in fact, this bill makes matters worse. It would permanently ban the development of our oil and gas resources on almost 88 percent of our offshore resources. 
   You know, it's ironic, Mr. Speaker, if the Democrats would do nothing--and certainly, they've had lots of practice doing nothing--this moratorium on development would go away in just 2 weeks. Decades and decades of American energy, oil and gas in the ground, ready to be developed, but the Democrats won't let us do it. 
   In fact, this has called the publication Roll Call to ask, ``Is this just an elaborate exercise to give their Democrat Members a heaping dose of political cover?'' The answer, Mr. Speaker, is ``yes.'' 
   We need all of the above. We need conservation. We need renewables. We need alternative energy. But we need more American energy, too. Democrats view our oil and gas resources as toxic waste sites. Republicans view them as valuable natural resources that can be used to ease pain at the pump. 
   Vote against that bill. Vote for American energy.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, since the Democrats took control of the House, prices at the pump have increased 75 percent, I would say to my friend from New York. Their response, take a 6-week vacation while the American people suffer. 
   Then they come back and, in the dead of night, present us with a 240-page nonenergy bill, no amendments, no substitutes, no committee hearings. Is this democracy? No. Is there any difference in Nancy Pelosi's America and Hugo Chavez's Venezuela? I think not. 
   This is a sham. This is a fraud. This is a bill designed to ensure Democrats' reelection, not designed to ensure affordable energy in America. 
   No new refineries in their bill, no clean coal, no ANWR, no nuclear and, if you read it, no Outer Continental Shelf; 85 percent still off limits. 
   Democrats look at our oil and gas reserves and say these are toxic waste reserves. Republicans look at our oil and gas reserves and say valuable natural resources to ease the pain at the pump. 
   Mr. Speaker, we need American energy made in America for Americans. We don't need a sham political bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (EXPANDING AMERICAN HOMEOWNERSHIP ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, recently the Democrat majority in this institution sought to create yet another new government housing program, the Affordable Housing Fund. This is on top of the roughly 80 other programs that HUD administers for Housing and Urban Development. So, Madam Chairman, we are being asked today in the underlying bill to fund a new program, without terminating any of the other 80-some-odd programs that are presently on the books; although many have already achieved their mission, many are ineffective, many are duplicative and many are quite costly. 
   Madam Chairman, the so-called Affordable Housing Fund, as designed, will grant moneys to States for a variety of purposes. I know that the purposes are noble, but many of us believe that, unfortunately, this could become a de facto housing slush fund. 
   I furthermore note, as moneys are handed to the States, almost every State in our Union is presently running a surplus, yet we regrettably know the Federal Government continues to run a deficit. So how much sense does this make? 
   For those who tell us that the Federal housing function is underfunded, I might note that according to OMB, in a little over 10 years we have gone from $15.4 billion to $30 billion, roughly double. That rate is higher than the increase in veterans spending, education spending, energy spending, transportation spending, international affairs, and even Social Security over the same period.  
   Although the House has passed this ill-conceived program, there has been no Senate action. The President has signed no bill. So we are being asked, Madam Chairman, to fund a program that doesn't even exist, when hardworking Americans can't even fund the roughly 10,000 Federal programs that are already on the books. 
   My amendment is a simple one. It would remove this funding mechanism in this bill for the so-called Affordable Housing Fund. The funding mechanism shouldn't be in this bill. It has nothing to do with fundamentally reforming FHA. And the bill siphons money from the FHA through what I believe and many of us believe to be a back-door tax on the FHA premiums paid by 4.8 million families that are using FHA insurance. It does this by diverting part of the increase from a negative credit subsidy. 
   To try to speak English here, it appears that people are overpaying their premiums. If so, maybe that money ought to go back to the people who paid the premiums in the first place. 
   I know the creation of the fund has been a long-time goal for Chairman Frank. I appreciate his sincerity, and I appreciate the nobility of his purpose and his ideological consistency. But the fact remains that this is a back-door tax on low- and moderate-income Americans who use FHA. 
   This funding provision is unnecessary, it is unwise, it is unsound. The money ought to go back to the people who paid it. And if that is not the will of the House, it should at least, at least, be used for those who paid the premiums in the first place. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Chairman, either there is a surplus or there is not a surplus. It is really that simple. So now the question is if there is a surplus, what do you do with it. We believe that surplus ought to go back to  the people who paid for it in the first place. And if it is not going to go back to them, it ought to serve them and it should ensure the solvency of this program, since we know Uncle Sam's track record on just about every other Federal insurance program is terrible. This should ensure the solvency of the program. 
   We do not need a funding mechanism for another housing program that does not exist on top of the 90, many of which are not working. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, this particular amendment would save the taxpayers $1.5 billion. This would  strike the funding for the South Carolina HBCU Science and Technology initiative. 
   Let me say at the outset that I have no doubt that good use could be made of these funds by this institution in South Carolina. Let me also stipulate I have no doubt that the gentleman from South Carolina, who has offered this earmark, knows far more about the good work they do at this institution than do I. 
   But I do believe that it is critical that every single penny of Federal spending be put in the context of its impact, not only on the taxpayer, but of future generations. I think if you are going to lead, you have to lead by example. 
   Now, I wish we had the opportunity to come to the floor each and every day and debate what will happen to future generations if we don't alter the spending patterns that we presently have in Congress today. 
   In fact, the chairman of the Federal Reserve has recently spoken, ``Without early and meaningful action to address the rapid growth of entitlements, the U.S. economy could be seriously weakened with future generations bearing much of the cost.'' 
   A report from the Government Accountability Office, the rising cost of government entitlements are a fiscal cancer that threatens catastrophic consequences for our country and could bankrupt America. 
   I know that principally our spending patterns are driven by entitlement spending. But as the late Everett Dirksen once said, $1 billion here, $1 billion, we are starting to talk about real money. By one estimation, we already have 10,000 Federal programs spread across 600 agencies, and it seems like week in, week out, we just add, add to those particular programs. 
   The question I have here today again is when we look at this one expenditure, and, yes, earmarks are a small part of Federal spending, but I believe that they are a large portion of the culture of Federal spending. I am not religiously opposed to earmarks. 
   Again, maybe good things can be done with this money. But looking at the fact that the Federal budget is going way beyond the ability of the family budget to pay for it, at what point do we say that maybe, maybe the Federal taxpayer shouldn't be asked to spend money that goes to, I believe in this case, a private college. 
   Again, as I understand it, the funding would be used for math and science research at the respective institutions. 
   Well, we have got some of these institutions in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas. I am sure they could use the money at Eastfield College. I am sure they could use the money at Trinity Valley Community College. I am sure my alma mater, Texas A&M University, which is not in my district, could use this money as well. 
   But out of the hundreds of thousands of institutions of higher learning, why are we deciding that the taxpayer is supposed to fund this one? Is there any good purpose, any good program, any good project in America that shouldn't receive a Federal subsidy? That's kind of the question that we have here today. 
   When I see a group of earmarks that are going to institutions in Members' districts, and I reflect upon the fact that we are now on a collision course to either double taxes on the next generation, or, for all intents and purposes, have no Federal Government, save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, we have got to start saving the pennies. When we start saving the pennies, eventually, the dollars will take care of themselves. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I might also add that I am pleased to have a historically black college in my district, Jarvis Christian College in Wood County, Texas. Last I looked they don't have any money in this particular bill. 
   But the question again is, if we are going to help people with education, doubling taxes on the American families, which the budget resolution has done, which this bill is a part of, is no way to help an education. 
   I would urge adoption of this amendment.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I would like to continue on somewhat with some of the themes that were touched upon in the last amendment. But before I do, I do want to say a few words about the overall bill. 
   I do want to say that I think a lot of good work was done by the committee, by the chairman, by our ranking member. It is my understanding that the dollar value of the earmarks has declined substantially from the last bill. I am going to say that I view that as progress. But I also want to say that when we are approaching as a Nation a very nasty fiscal fork in the road, and in this institution unfortunately there is a nasty habit of just kicking that can down the road as I mix my metaphors; but, again, don't take my word for it, look at the analysis of the Congressional Budget Office, look at the analysis of the General Accountability Office, look at the Office of Management and Budget. 
   Just dealing with the government that we have today, if Congress just disappeared and created no new government, we are going to reach this fiscal fork in the road in the next generation, where we are either going to have to double taxes on our children and grandchildren, or for all intents and purposes there will be no Federal Government save Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. 
   It is not my analysis. Look at the analysis of these other bodies. And so I believe again that, unfortunately, although earmarks today are a small portion of the Federal budget, they are a large portion of the culture of Federal spending. 
   Another reservation I have is my fear that too often they teach people and teach institutions to become dependent upon the Federal Government. I come from Dallas, Texas, and a part of the Fifth Congressional District takes in the eastern part of the City of Dallas. I was dealing not long ago, taking a tour with one of the very revered and esteemed medical institutions within the City of Dallas that said that for years and years and years they were always happy to competitively bid through the NIH process or other processes for their research grant money. But they have awakened to the dawn of a new day now to where so many of their other competing medical education, medical research institutions were receiving their Federal funding via the earmark track. And so finally, after all these years, they broke down and invested in a Federal lobbyist. Now, they were happy with a competitive system, but they have realized that, unfortunately, that is increasingly not where this Congress is headed. 
   And so I believe that that is a bad thing, again, to try to somehow move away from what should be a more competitive process into one that does something else. Now, again, I think there is a lot of wonderful earmarks here. I have no doubt about it. But, unfortunately, more often than not we see earmarks representing a victory of the special interests over the national interests, a victory of seniority over merit, and too often a victory of secrecy over transparency. 
   I am glad that the Democrat leadership recently reversed themselves to allow the transparency that we see today, and I believe that that is a good thing. But two things we have to remember as we hand out money to one specific educational institution, and in this particular case the Environmental Science Center at the University of Dubuque. Maybe good things can be done with that money, but how about the good things that the taxpayers who fund this, how about the good things they could have done? 
   I recently received some correspondence from a lady in my district, Joyce of Tennessee Colony, Texas: ``Dear Congressman, please do what you can to stop the wasteful spending. I am retired; I am disabled. I am raising three grandchildren and now one great grandchild. I sometimes cannot afford my own medicine. It takes everything I have to get us from month to month. Gas has become a problem. I can't go to church at the end of the month because I don't have gas to get to town.'' 
   So here we are, Mr. Chairman, in an energy and water bill, and we are harming the energy program of American families to put energy earmarks in this bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, in specific, this amendment would strike the earmark that would fund the computer and science equipment at Emmanuel College Center for Science Partnership. 
   Again, following up on some of the debate in the earlier amendments, I simply question why, at a time when our Nation continues to face great fiscal challenges in the future, that although these individual earmarks may be small amounts, I almost feel like the story of the three bears, whether the porridge is too hot or too cold. You come to debate spending on the floor, and sometimes people will tell you, well, that program is so big it is a sacred cow, you can't touch it. And then other times, Mr. Chairman, you hear, well, we are dealing with a very small amount of money here, so why are we bothering with that? You almost believe it is part of the NIMBY syndrome, the ``Not in My Back Yard.'' 
   And, again, I will say I am sure the sponsor of this earmark knows far more about it than I do, knows far more about the educational institutional, and I have no doubt that good things could be done with that money. But that is not really the relevant question. The relevant question ought to be, number one, is this something the Federal Government ought to be doing in the first place, given all the other challenges and needs that we have. 
   Second of all, is this a priority? Is this a priority? Because we know now that as, recently, Congress voted to increase the debt ceiling, continues to raid the Social Security fund. Is it worth taking money out of the Social Security trust fund to fund this particular earmark or any other particular earmark? And that is what Members have to decide. 
   And although I am sure the sponsor of the earmark can make a very good defense and tell us all the wonderful good ways that this money will be used, and I am sure he will tell us that he knows his district better than anybody else, I stipulate that. I stipulate that. But, Mr. Chairman, I think I know my district, the Fifth Congressional District of Texas, better than anybody else in this institution; and I am fearful that every time the people of the Fifth Congressional District are called upon to fund somebody else's earmark somewhere else across the Nation, because, again, as we are trying to fund Federal energy and water programs, we are taking away from family energy and water programs, including in many of those in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas. 
   Recently, I heard from Ken of Mabank, Texas. He was concerned about this single largest tax increase in the history that was passed as part of the Democrat budget. And as you spend more money, you have to tax more money. And so we know that the average American family in the next 5 years is going to be faced with an extra tax burden of about $3,000 a year, and part of it pays for earmarks like these. I heard from Ken in Mabank, and he said: ``Dear Congressman, any increase in taxes will hurt my family budget and cause us to cut back in other key areas. The rising gas prices have already made us cut back on spending. Why does the Federal Government continue to have an open checkbook based on the backs of the taxpayer, me?'' 
   Well, I get letters like these every day, Mr. Chairman. And, again, we have to be cognizant as these so-called investments are made in Washington, we are taking away the ability of families including those in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas to make their investments in energy, their investments in water. And, again, I have no doubt that the sponsor of this amendment believes that good things can be done with the money, but is every good thing in America due to receive a Federal subsidy? Shall we start to subsidize Girl Scout cookies? How about cut flowers in everybody's home? My children, who are age 3 and 5, are just now learning to swim. Maybe we should subsidize swimming pools in every community across America. Where does it all end? Where does the madness stop? 
   This kind of spending fuels the single largest tax increase in history and threatens, threatens, to double taxes on our children. I urge adoption of the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Fueling earmarks like these take away from family education programs, Mr. Chairman. And that is why I urge adoption of the amendment.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would strike the earmark used to fund the equipping of two laboratories, creating 48 state-of-the-art work stations at Roosevelt University Biology Laboratory. 
   Again, Mr. Chairman, there are so many great colleges, so many great universities across our Nation. How do we get into the business of subsidizing some and not subsidizing others?     
   Again, there are many worthy colleges in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas, Jarvis Christian College, Eastfield College, Trinity Valley Community College, and a much greater list beyond that. And so somehow, the students who attend those colleges in the Fifth District of Texas, either they or their peers are being asked to take money that would be destined for their education programs and send them somewhere else, in this case Illinois, to fund somebody else's education, somebody else's research. 
   I again stipulate that I have no doubt that good things could be done with this money. I don't know what. I'm sure the gentleman who sponsored the earmark would be happy to let us know the good things that can be done with this money. 
   But too often, Mr. Chairman, we seem to forget whose money it is in the first place. And so that's why I bring these letters, this correspondence from people from the Fifth Congressional District of Texas, because we should never ever forget that as we're plussing up some Federal program, be it in energy or water or education, you're taking away from some family's program where they're trying to fund their energy, their water, their education. 
   And again, Mr. Chairman, I just don't know how people can be aware of the fact that this Nation is on a collision course for a fiscal calamity. Just the government we have today threatens to double taxes on the American people. Now, a lot of those people today can't vote. Some of those people aren't even born yet. But we know it's going to happen. 
   Go to the Congressional Budget Office. Go to the Office of Management and Budget. Listen to the Federal Reserve Chairman. Let me quote from some other sources. I quoted earlier from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, that without early and meaningful action, the U.S. economy could be seriously weakened, with future generations bearing much of the cost. 
   CBO, either a substantial reduction in the growth of spending, a significant increase in tax revenues relative to the size of the economy, or some combination will be necessary to promote the Nation's long-term fiscal stability. 
   A famous economist, Robert Samuelson, the rising cost of government retirement programs, mainly Social Security and Medicare, increase taxes or budget deficits so much that they could reduce economic growth and this could trigger an economic and political death spiral. 
   And so what I hear from too many of my colleagues is, well, this is just a few dollars in my particular district. Well, the challenge is great. The challenge is great. We must lead by example, and by leading by example, we shouldn't be bringing a bill to the floor, number one, that has a 4.3 percent increase over last year, 3.7 percent over the administration's request, and quite often they request too much, that I believe contains 5.6 billion in earmarks. Where does it all stop? 
   Is this truly a Federal priority? Or should the priority be to assure that we leave the next generation with greater freedom and greater opportunity? 
   That fight starts today. I know too often the focus in the Nation's capital is on the next election and not the next generation. We ought to put it on the next generation because if we don't there'll be no money for them to fund their education programs. There'll be no money at all. And so we need to start today, and in this area of earmarking funds to these private educational institutions is a good start. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I'm sorry that the gentleman from Illinois doesn't see the logic of American families who are working hard trying to save money, trying to put their children through college, and yet he has an earmark that is helping being funded by the largest tax increase in American history.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, this particular amendment would strike the earmark for Nanosys, Inc. The funding would have been used to develop a fuel cell membrane electrode assembly to enable the production of lightweight fuel cells suitable for automotive applications and portable electronic devices. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have no doubt that that is a very worthy expenditure of funds. I, myself, prior to coming to Congress, used to be an officer in what most typically know is a green energy company. 
   The issues surrounding fuel cells, the issues surrounding making energy more environmentally friendly, making America more energy independent are very, very important issues. But I wonder, I wonder about the wisdom, about earmarking funds to a specific, which I assume to be, for profit company, a private company. Otherwise why are they called Nanosys, Inc.? 
   There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of companies across America, all trying to do good things, trying to feed our people, educate our people, clothe our people, heat their homes in the winter, cool them in the summer, help them with transportation. What isn't a priority here? 
   And so now we give all the indication that, instead of having a company come and compete in some process, some kind of competitive bidding process, instead we have an earmark to a private company. Why is their fuel cell technology so superior to somebody else's? 
   Back when I was affiliated with Green Mountain Energy of Austin, Texas, they were doing a lot of good things to produce power from wind energy and solar energy and biomass. Perhaps I should encourage some of my former colleagues of that particular private company to, instead of competing in the halls and competing in the marketplace, to come compete in the halls of Congress for an earmark. 
   Now, again, this Nation desperately needs advances in fuel cell technology, but to start handing money, through earmarks, to individual companies, Mr. Chairman, I do not believe is the way to go. 
   And furthermore, once again we face such fiscal challenges. Our energy challenge, our educational challenge are not the only challenges we face. We face a great fiscal challenge. To paraphrase the Controller General Walker, he has said, we are on the verge, in America, of being the first generation in our Nation's history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living.     
   It has never been done in the history of America. And we will do that if we don't stop the ways that we spend the people's money. 
   So, again, I am faced with a bill here that spends 4.3 percent more than last year. I am faced with an earmark that is part of that process. I am looking at a Democrat budget plan, Mr. Chairman, that will be $21 billion over the President's request. I am looking at a Democrat budget resolution that is going to impose the single largest tax increase in America's history not only on the good people of the Fifth Congressional District of Texas but everybody. So, again, the relevant question is not can good things be done with the money. I am sure Nanosys can do a lot of good things with the earmark that they will mostly likely receive. But it is coming out of American families. It is coming out of their energy budget. It is coming out of their education budget. If we don't fund it through that, if we pass more debt on to our children, then what are they facing? They are facing doubling of their taxes and our generation passing on to them a lower standard of living. And, Mr. Chairman, I simply do not wish to be a part of that. 
   So I urge adoption of this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I will be supporting, I suppose, the chairman's amendment. He said he was not interested, I believe, in biasing the decision; so he will vote present, although I think that the distinguished chairman had voted against the gentleman from California's amendment yesterday on another bill. So I am not sure if the outcome hasn't already been prejudiced. 
   Be that as it may, I have not been opposed to all earmarks. I understand the opportunity and constitutional responsibility that this body has. But as I have observed the process, the process, I believe, more often than not, has led to bad results. And particularly the bad result that I see and why I commend the gentleman from California for his leadership in this area is that I believe, more often than not, we help teach people to become more dependent upon the Federal Government. People who never thought about receiving a Federal earmark now come to their local Member of Congress. There was a time when many individuals would compete in the marketplace of ideas and compete in the marketplace for business and compete in the marketplace for charitable contributions, and now they are being taught they need to compete in the halls of Congress. 
   I recall dealing with a large major medical research institute in my hometown of Dallas, Texas, that does world renowned science who was always happy to come and compete in a competitive bid process for research dollars at the National Institutes of Health, but they woke up one day and many other institutions instead were receiving earmarks; so now they went out and invested their money in a Washington lobbyist and they started receiving earmarks. I do not necessarily view this as a good thing. 
   And I wish I had coined the phrase, but our colleague in the other body, the gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, once said that earmarks are the gateway drug to spending addiction. That may not be true in all cases, but it is certainly true in many cases. And more often than not, I fear that they represent a victory of special interests over the general interest. They represent a victory, often, of secrecy over transparency. Even now we are having trouble trying to put the dollar amounts with the Member, with the earmark. Certainly, I don't see the transparency that I thought that we would have seen from the committee on this matter.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Chairman, we have had a number of debates this evening over the subject of earmarks. I have been heard on that, and I have been happy to have been heard on this particular debate. And again, I know there are many worthy expenditures of funds when it comes to earmarks. I do not necessarily believe that they are all bad. 
   And I must admit, until coming to the floor, I wasn't completely certain what the Minnesota Digital Public Media Archive was. Fortunately, the gentlelady from Minnesota was kind enough to come to me and explain to me exactly what the purpose of the earmark was. I enjoyed our conversation and I appreciated her courtesy, and I want to stipulate this is not a debate on whether or not the gentlelady has a noble purpose for these funds. As explained to me with her enthusiasm, I stipulate there is a noble purpose for these funds. 
   I am not necessarily going to engage in a debate on whether or not the Twin Cities public television station in St. Paul can make good use of the money, the half a million dollars. I am sure they can, as explained to me by the gentlelady from Minnesota. 
   And so I want to again make it very clear, and we don't have the time to debate each and every earmark, but every time we expend these funds we have to look at, number one, where is the money coming from, and number two, what is the fiscal health of our Nation. Already the Federal Government is spending over $23,000 per American family. This is only the second time since World War II that the Federal Government has spent so much money. 
   And right now with just the Federal Government that we have, we are on a collision course to double taxes on the next generation. Don't take my word for it. Go to the Office of Management and Budget, the Congressional Budget Office, or the conservative Heritage Foundation or the liberal Brookings Institute. They will all tell you the same thing. 
   So we are sitting here with an explosion of spending. Some will say, relatively speaking, this is a small amount of money. Relative to the Federal budget, it is a small amount of money. I am happy to stipulate that. But I still believe that earmarks, although a small portion of the Federal budget, tend to be a large portion of the culture of spending. 
   Again, I have no doubt this is a worthy project, but I do note that the PBS television station, I believe, gets almost 85 percent of its funding from donations and other public grants. I am led to believe, and if I am incorrect, I invite the gentlelady from Minnesota to correct me, that they receive rather generous support from the taxpayers of the State of Minnesota. But I don't quite know what the compelling Federal purpose is, Federal purpose, money from Federal taxpayers, to fund the Minnesota Digital Public Media Archive. 
   Look, this isn't a debate on whether or not this is a noble purpose for the money. It is not a debate on whether or not the gentlelady's public television station could do something good with the money. But let's remember where the money is coming from. As long as this Nation is running a deficit, which it is, is this money going to come from raiding the Social Security trust fund yet again, even though I have introduced and supported legislation that would protect that trust fund? 
   If we run a deficit, we are still borrowing money from the Social Security trust fund. Or as we know in the Democratic budget resolution passed earlier this year, we have the single largest  tax increase in American history, over 5 years ramping up to an average of $3,000 per American family.     
   More spending fuels more taxes. Are we going to increase that greater tax burden on present American families or are we going to pass on more debt to our children? Government will be paid for. This earmark will be paid for one way or another. 
   And so the question is not whether or not there's a noble purpose. The question is not whether or not they make good use of the funds, but is it a compelling Federal purpose, worthy of sending debt to our children, worthy of taking money away from the Social Security Trust Fund, worthy of being a part of the largest tax increase in history, and I respectfully submit to my colleagues that I believe it is not. 
   And with that, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Chairman, I do have a number of comments I would like to make about this particular earmark. But before I do, I do feel compelled to address some of the comments by the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I think the way to paraphrase what he just said is: You guys spend too much, so we will spend even more. I am not exactly sure about the logic of that particular argument. 
   I also heard complaints about the war, something that has been debated on this floor, should be debated on this floor, will be debated on this floor. But I would note that the gentleman's party controls both the House and both the Senate; and if his party wants to end funding, they can do that tomorrow. His party is in control of this now. 
   Last, but not least, the distinguished gentleman complains about tax relief. Last I looked, don't take my word for it, go to the United States Treasury, we are awash in tax receipts. Tax relief has brought us in more tax revenue, because when you let the American people save more and invest more, they go out and they create and they grow the economy. So I think the gentleman's comments were very much misplaced. 
   Speaking to this particular amendment; one, this particular amendment would eliminate the earmark of $300,000 in funds to the West Los Angeles Times College. From the certification letter, this is to establish a first-of-its-kind entertainment industry craft and technician college job training program to respond to the film and television industry's immediate need for new trained employees. 
   Previous to coming to floor, I did know a lot about this particular earmark. The sponsor of the earmark, the gentlelady from California, was kind enough to share with me information about it, and I became convinced of a couple of different propositions: 
   Number one, that she has a very noble purpose for this earmark. Again, I want to stipulate to that. 
   Number two, I came away, as I did with the last amendment, knowing that not only is there a noble purpose, I have no doubt that some good things could be done with this money. 
   But like in many of these earmark debates, there tends to be great focus on the good that can be done with this money, but we don't spend a lot of time talking about the harm that can be done with this money. And I know that the gentlelady from California feels that low-income people within her district could benefit from this program. I have no doubt that that is true. But I might point out that there are very many worthy community colleges, for example, in the Fifth Congressional District, who could benefit from this money as well. 
   Eastfield College, we need a lot of people trained for our high-tech industry, for jobs with companies like Texas Instruments, companies like Raytheon. These monies could be used by Trinity Valley Community College. There are several locations within the Fifth District of Texas. They could help in our burgeoning nursery industry. It is a very agricultural part of my district. So, again, education is good. But the education is going to the one particular district in this particular case, not going to the Fifth Congressional District of Texas. So there are many worthy competing goals for this particular money. 
   But I really want us to focus upon the fact that although I have no doubt that good things can be done with these funds, all of government must be paid for. And so, again, I think we should use this debate as an opportunity to focus on who is paying the bill. And, again, as long as this Nation is running a deficit and it is down, thanks to the fact we are awash in tax revenues due to tax relief, we are still running a deficit. That means that any earmark, not just the gentlelady's from California, but any, is going to be raiding the Social Security Trust Fund as we continue, unfortunately, a practice from both parties of raiding the Social Security Trust Fund. 
   In addition, we know that more spending fuels more taxes. And I hear from constituents in my district who have to pay the bills for all these earmarks no matter how worthy they are. I hear from somebody like the Flores family in Garland, Texas. She writes, ``Dear Congressman, I am a divorced mother with a child in college and a child in daycare. An increase in taxes would wipe out hope of the first college graduate in the family. Please don't let this happen. Let's hold the budget down. There are a lot of things I can't afford, so I don't buy them. I need government to take the same attitude.'' 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Again, I appreciate the gentlelady and her purpose for her amendment. When she spoke about the term ``wealthy,'' if there is an industry in America that is wealthy it is obviously Hollywood. I would hope that they would be able to train their own people. But as I spoke about earlier, Rose Flores of Garland, Texas, doesn't consider herself wealthy, and yet she is staring at an average increase in her taxes of $3,000 a year as she tries to put a child through college, the very first one in her family to ever graduate from college. 
   Again, we must focus on the cost of these earmarks.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Chairman, if my ears did not deceive me, I think I heard the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee either observe or lament that with one exception, every amendment offered on this bill, its purpose was to increase  spending. If that was a lamentation, I certainly share his angst. Not wanting to disappoint, I am coming to the floor with several amendments that are designed to do just the opposite, spend less of the people's money to try to save hardworking American taxpayers more, let them keep more of what they earned. 
   Now, Madam Chairman, this is a modest amendment, but it represents a very, very important principle. Today, right now, the Federal Government is spending $23,289 per family. This is the highest level spent in real inflation-adjusted terms since World War II. 
   Earlier this year, the Democrat budget resolution included the largest single tax increase in American history which when fully put in place would put $3,000, an average of $3,000, additional tax burden on the average American family. And now even if Congress were for some reason to just disband today and add no new government, just the government programs we have on automatic pilot threaten to double taxes on the next generation. So we need to find every opportunity that we can today to save the poor beleaguered taxpayer even more money. 
   Madam Chairman, I do not myself know exactly how many Federal programs exist. I have seen one estimate, I believe, from the Heritage Foundation that we have over 10,000 Federal programs spread across 600 different agencies. I defy any man, woman or child to tell me what each and every one of them does. Some of them I am sure do good things; but the question is given the fiscal challenges that we face, are they truly a priority. 
   Madam Chairman, some may have even completed their mission. And some, perhaps like the amendment that I am offering today, are actually duplicative. This is a modest amendment that would save the American taxpayer $8 million. In this particular program, ostensibly, funding is used for training and technical assistance in developing and managing water facilities. But the Office of Management and Budget has recommended that this particular program be eliminated, stating that ``the program is duplicative of other Federal entities such as the Bureau of Reclamation's rural water program which is responsible for water and wastewater treatment facilities.'' That is from the Office of Management and Budget. 
   So we ought to make sure that we are not simply engaging in legislation by symbolism. I know every single program has a lofty-sounding name to help some constituency that is important to us. But we have to look beyond that and see if it is actually achieving its purpose, are there other programs that are also achieving its purpose as well. And according to the Office of Management and Budget, this program is duplicative of other programs. 
   So we have to ask ourselves a very important question. In light of the fact that the Federal Government has never ever spent since World War II so much money of the American family, $23,289, given that the Democrat budget resolution includes the single largest tax increase in history, given that although the national deficit has come down, not due to any spending discipline but due to the fact that we are awash in tax revenues, we still have a tax deficit. So it is a simple question: Do we want to fund a program that the administration considers duplicative given that if we don't, either the funds are coming from the Social Security trust fund, and many of my colleagues have pledged not to do that, if it is not coming from that, it is going to add to this $3,000-per-American-family tax burden, or more debt will be passed on to our children. 
   I believe we ought to use this opportunity to eliminate one duplicative Federal program and return $8 million to the American taxpayer. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   If I was not clear, this amendment would save the American taxpayer $8 million. It would remove a duplicative program, according to OMB, the Rural Community Facilities Program. I don't need a minute to explain what the amendment does. That is it. I certainly apologize to my colleague if I was unclear as to the purpose of the amendment or how it operates.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Chairman, I listened intently to the distinguished chairman of the committee, as  I do whenever he is on the floor. Apparently he does not like amendments that increase spending in this bill, and apparently he doesn't like amendments that decrease the spending in the bill. So apparently he doesn't like amendments. So that much is clear. 
   Second of all, Madam Chairman, when I come down to the floor in efforts to try to save taxpayers money, let them keep more money for their education programs, their health care programs, their energy programs, sometimes we're told that, well, this is so draconian, you know, to try to save this much money. And then other times we're told, well, this is just a piddling little amount. 
   Well, I'm reminded first of a famous quote from the late Senator Everett Dirksen, a billion here, a billion there, pretty soon we're talking about real money. I'm even talking about more modest amounts today. 
   But there's a fundamental principle involved here, and the fundamental principle is that we have a Federal budget growing way beyond the ability of the family budget to pay for it. Make no mistake about it, Madam Chairman, government will be paid for. It's either going to be paid for in the short term by continuing to raid the Social Security Trust Fund, which is what's going to happen if this particular amendment fails. It will be funded by the single largest tax increase in American history which my friends on the other side of the aisle, the Democrat majority, has done in their budget, or perhaps it may even be funded by sending more debt to our children and grandchildren. 
   I think we should look for every opportunity. Given the challenges that we face, the Comptroller General of America has said we are on the verge of being the first generation in America's history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living. Never happened before in the history of America. 
   So, Madam Chairman, I make no apologies for, to use the distinguished chairman's term, droning on about what fiscal perils lay in wait for future generations if we don't start now. And then, again, it's a little bit like Goldilocks and the three bears. Either the porridge is too hot or the porridge is too cold. When is the porridge just right to try to save the family budget from the onslaught of the Federal budget? 
   So when we have the Office of Management and Budget single out a number of different programs, and I certainly think that their expertise in this area is great, to single out certain programs that, one, have outlived their usefulness; number two, are not meeting their objective; or number three, are duplicative, I think amendments are in order for the people's House to save the people money. 
   We have to quit engaging again in the fact of legislation by symbolism. It has a lofty name or it has a lofty purpose, well, let's look at what's actually happening to the money. 
   So this is a modest amendment, and I admit it's modest. I've tried to save big chunks of money and haven't been terribly successful there, and so we're going to attempt to save little chunks of money and perhaps set a precedent here. 
   So this amendment is designed to save the American taxpayer $5 million by hopefully zeroing out the account of a program which the Office of Management and Budget has said does not have performance standards. They do not have performance standards to assess their impact or are too narrowly focused to have a major benefit. They duplicate other Federal programs and award grants on a noncompetitive basis. 
   Now, ostensibly this program is a job opportunities program for low-income individuals, but I happen to know that practically every single one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle voted against the tax relief that has created 8 million new jobs in our economy, which is an undeniable fact. That's truly the best job opportunity program for low-income individuals. 
   And I know that this body recently voted against the maximum opportunity to create an artificial wage to deny some people their opportunity to get on the lowest rung of the economic ladder. 
   There's a lot of ways that we can help low-income people with job opportunities, but one more duplicative program that awards grants on a noncompetitive basis is not it. Let's not raid the Social Security Trust Fund. Let's not be a part of the largest single tax increase in American history. Let's save the American people $5 million.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Chairman, again we have another modest amendment aiming at saving the American taxpayer, in this case $21.4 million. Again, we have a program that has a very lofty name, Preventive Health under the Administration of Aging. But I think that, again, the program needs to be put in the larger context. 
   We are being asked now to provide in this particular appropriations bill $152 billion in discretionary funding, one of the largest bills that will come to the people's House. It has, I believe, a 4.8 percent increase over last year, when I assure you, American families who are being asked to pay for this did not enjoy a 4.8 percent increase. 
   We, once again, have another portion of the Federal budget growing beyond the ability of the family budget to pay for this. So we all know that this is a part of a plan that will increase an additional $26 billion for domestic programs under the budget resolution of the Democrat majority, on top of the $6 billion that has been added to the current year omnibus, on top of the $17 billion in nonwar emergency spending they have added to the Iraq war supplemental. 
   Again, I recall the words of the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, referring to those of us who may drone on about attempting to save the Federal taxpayer money, but there are also those who seemingly use the same old argument that government knows how to spend money better than the American family. 
   Somehow, if we take money away from American families, that's an investment. But if they somehow keep it, well, that's waste, or somehow that's going to bring down the government to its knees. I just don't buy that argument. Somehow we are supposed to believe in the roughly 10,000 Federal programs spread across 600 different agencies, growing at roughly twice the rate of inflation, growing beyond the ability of the family budget to pay for it, that somehow, somehow, every single penny of Federal expenditures is sacrosanct.  Yet there is nothing sacrosanct about the money we take away from the American people to pay for that. 
   Now, the funds in this particular program are awarded to States and territories that supposedly educate older Americans about the importance of healthy lifestyles, a very noble purpose. But I would note with the exception of, I think, two, maybe three States, every single one of them is running a surplus. 
   We are granting money to 95, 98 percent of the States that are running the surplus, while the Federal Government continues to run a deficit. Although that deficit is coming down because we are awash in tax revenues, it certainly hasn't been from any spending disciplines. The bottom line is we are running a deficit, and we are handing out money to States that are running surpluses. 
   Again, this is a program that the Office of Management and Budget says should not be funded: ``It is duplicative of services that States can provide to the Administration on Aging's community-based supportive services program.'' 
   I have heard nobody address or take the opposite viewpoint of OMB and say the program is duplicative. So maybe they approve of duplication. If they think that OMB has got it wrong, I would be interested in hearing that particular argument or that particular debate. 
   Furthermore, OMB says that AOA and visions integrating, prevention is an underlying principle in its core programs and that is better than the current mechanism of providing a small funding stream of unfocused seed money through the Preventive Health Services Program. Again, I feel we have too much legislation by symbolism. 
   We should never forget, when we are talking about the lofty purposes, that this will provide in vital investments and health care. Let's remember the vital investments in health care that the American people have. I mean, they are going to have to pay for this. 
   Again, I often hear from my constituents, like Joyce in Tennessee Colony, Texas, says, ``Please do what you can to stop the wasteful spending. I am retired and disabled. I am raising my three grandchildren and now one great grandchild. I sometimes can't afford my own medicine.'' 
   So here we have a choice. We can take money away from Joyce in Tennessee Colony, take money away from her health care program, to engage in this particular program which OMB says is duplicative. 
   I have heard from David in the city of Garland.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I have noticed that the last several speakers on the House floor were rather strident in their comments, engaged in ad hominem attacks and perhaps at least one of them could have had their words taken down. 
   Having served in this body for several years, I have yet to discover any direct correlation between the stridency with which one delivers their message and the righteousness behind their cause. 
   Many have come here to say that somehow House decorum demands that one speak to another Member before offering an amendment that somehow may be injurious to their district's interests. In all of the years I have served in this body, I have yet to have somebody come to me and explain to me ahead of time how their amendment, how it impacts the people in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas. 
   Yet every day we see something like the largest tax increase in history, which certainly has a terrible impact on the hardworking people of the Fifth Congressional District of Texas. Nobody sought out my permission before they brought that particular piece of legislation to the floor. 
   We have pieces of trade legislation, or it should be called anti-trade legislation, coming to the floor, harming my cow-calf operators in the Fifth District of Texas. Nobody seeks my permission or acquiescence before that legislation is brought to the floor. 
   We have legislation imposing death taxes on people who have worked their whole life to build small businesses in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas. Nobody seeks my acquiescence or permission before bringing that legislation to the floor. 
   I also noticed that an earlier speaker referred to the funds in this amendment as ``my money.'' Well, isn't that a fascinating concept, ``my money.'' I thought it was the taxpayers' money, many of whom reside in the State of New Jersey. Many of whom reside in the State of Texas. 
   I am interested why we seem to have on top of all the other education funds we have, and it is not exactly like this is an area of Federal funding that has gone lacking, since 1995, the elementary and secondary education budget function has increased 147 percent. That is about the highest increase of any budget function in that period of time. 
   I wonder, Mr. Chairman, maybe we ought to go out and create a special education fund for New Jersey and for Texas and for Arkansas and Maine and New Hampshire. Why don't we create one for all 50 States. Then what we can do is we can go ahead with the Democrats' plan for the largest tax increase in history, and we can take all of this money away from American families. Then Washington can keep, say, a third of it in administration cost and waste and inefficiency, and then we can design these programs with our State names on them, take credit for it, and then hand it back to the taxpayers, whose money it is in the first place. 
   So I want to salute the gentleman from New Jersey for his courage, for his steadfast leadership on this issue, his dedication to education, his dedication to fiscal responsibility, and for coming and suffering these ad hominem attacks. That, Mr. Chairman, is what is truly shameful about this particular moment. 
   I would be happy to yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (NEW FISCAL YEAR -- (House of Representatives - October 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I certainly appreciate the gentlewoman's leadership at the Republican Study Committee, Congress's conservative caucus. It is a very timely issue that we are discussing today since, indeed, today is the first day of the fiscal year for the Federal Government. I think for many of us it is easy to sum up the actions of the new Democrat majority; that is, they spend too much and they tax too much. It bodes ill for the future of our Nation. 
   I think that it is important that we step back for a moment and figure out just how much of the people's money is being spent. And it is the people's money. It is not the government's money. It is the people's money. Today, right now, the last figure I saw is that the Federal Government is now spending $23,289 per family of four. This is just about the highest level that has been spent since World War II. Since I have been on the face of the planet, since I was born, the Federal budget has grown four to five times faster than the family budget. Ultimately, it is the family budget that has to pay for that. Since we have been in this 110th Congress with the new Democrat majority, rarely does a day go by that there is not a new opportunity to begin a new government program on top of the roughly 10,000 Federal programs spread across 600 agencies that already exist. It kind of begs the question: How much government is enough? Because we know that as government grows, our freedoms and our opportunities contract. This is supposed to be the land of opportunity. This is supposed to be the land of freedom. Yet, all we do under this new Democrat majority rule is add program after program after program. 
   Madam Speaker, unfortunately all of this new 
   spending imposes a new tax burden on the American people. In the budget that the Democrat majority passed, they included in it the single highest tax increase in American history. When fully implemented over a 5-year period, this budget will impose approximately $3,000 of additional taxes on the average American family. Now, every single day we come to this floor and we debate. And our friends on the other side of the aisle, the Democrats, want to talk about great investments in education, great investments in housing, and great investments in nutrition that they are going to use all this money for. Well, the challenge is, though, that every time that they increase some Federal budget, they are having to decrease some family budget to take it, and right now to the tune of $3,000 per American family. 
   Madam Speaker, I often hear from people in the Fifth District of Texas that I represent. I take great pride in representing these people who have entrusted me with their representation in Congress. I hear from people like the Flores family in Garland, Texas. I heard this lady say, ``I am a divorced mother with a child in college and a child in day care. An increase in taxes of this magnitude would wipe out hope of the first college graduate in the family. Don't let this happen. Let's hold the budget down.'' 
   So, again, what we have here is the Democrats are taking money away  from a family budget in order to give it to some Federal budget. We are not always debating how much money we are going to spend on these items, but we are debating who is going to do the spending. Democrats in Washington want the bureaucrats in Washington to do the spending. Republicans want families to do the spending, the people who actually roll up their sleeves and work hard. They work hard trying to make ends meet. They have got decisions that they have to make around the kitchen table. And this is just one example. I hear from lots of my constituents. 
   I heard from the Lopez family in Mesquite, ``I would like to let you know that if our taxes are increased, this may mean that we could not continue to finance our child's education.'' I heard from the Winters family in Tennessee Colony, ``Stop the wasteful spending. I am retired and disabled. I am raising three grandchildren. Sometimes I can't afford my own medicine.'' And here we are, this new Democrat majority wants to take $3,000 a year away from these hardworking families to fuel their budget, not these families' budgets, but the Federal budget. 
   Now, ultimately, though, it is not just the tax increase that we see right over the horizon that is so challenging. It is what is going to happen to future generations. And rarely does a day occur that somebody doesn't come to the floor and talk about the need to help the least of these. Well, I often think that the least of these are those who cannot vote and those yet to be born. They don't seem to have a say-so in this great debate that we are having today. 
   For example, don't take my word for it, but all this spending that we have seen in Washington, here is the result. Don't take my word for it, but we, right now, are literally on the verge of doing something to the next generation that has never been done before: imposing such a draconian economic burden on them, something that has never been done before, that according to the Comptroller General, the chief fiduciary officer in America, we are on the verge of being the very first generation in America's history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living.     
   As the father of a 5-year-old and a 4-year-old, I will not sit idly by and let that happen. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker, don't take my word for it. Listen to the words of our Chairman of the Federal Reserve, who said: ``Without early and meaningful action to address Federal spending, the U.S. economy could be seriously weakened, with future generations bearing much of the cost.'' 
   Listen to the GAO, the General Accountability Office. They talk about government spending, particularly entitlement spending as a ``fiscal cancer'' that threatens ``catastrophic consequences for our country and could bankrupt America.'' 
   Listen to the famous economist, Robert Samuelson, who writes frequently in newspapers all across the Nation. He says: ``The rising cost of government retirement programs could either increase taxes or budget deficits so much that they could reduce economic growth, and this could trigger an economic and political death spiral.'' 
   The Congressional Budget Office, the Office of Management and Budget, the General Accountability Office, the liberal Brookings Institution, the conservative Heritage Foundation, they all agree that spending is out of control: And what is going to happen is in the next generation either the Federal Government will consist of nothing to speak of but Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security; or you're going to have to double taxes on our children and grandchildren just to balance the budget. 
   Now we see that hurricane coming over the horizon, we see it coming towards us, and yet this Democrat majority every single day adds to the problem. Just last week the Democrat majority took an insurance program, the National Flood Insurance Program, that is already going broke, was supposed to be self-sustaining through premiums, it's $20 billion in the red, and they add additional coverage to it that could expose the taxpayer to $17 trillion, $17 trillion of new liability in just one program alone. 
   So that is why it's so important that we start tackling the pennies and the nickels and the dimes, because we are talking about the priorities of American families, we are talking about their opportunities, we are talking about their ability to send their children to college, we are talking about their ability to save that nest egg, to launch their version of the American Dream and start their new business. We are talking about their ability to pay for their health insurance premiums. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker, every time you increase the Federal budget, you're having to decrease some family budget. I just often wonder when will the madness stop. When will we finally figure out that this isn't investment in the future, that is divesting our children's future by spending all of this money? The Federal budget should not be allowed to grow beyond the family budget's ability to pay for it. 
   That is why conservatives in the Republican Study Committee, the House Conservative Caucus, support a limitation on the growth of the Federal Government, to force Congress to decide amongst some of these priorities among these competing 10,000 Federal programs. Mr. Speaker, I defy any man, woman or child in America to tell me what they all do; 10,000 of them. It reminds me of what President Reagan once said: ``There is nothing as close to eternal life on Earth as a Federal program.'' They all cost money, and they take away from our children's future. 
   So that is why I am so happy that members of the Republican Study Committee have gathered here this evening to talk about the challenges of spending for the future generations and to get together to ensure that we let the American people know that we are working to hold the line on spending, to bring more accountability, to bring more transparency, to try to stave off this tax increase of $3,000 per American family, and that's for the families today. And we are fighting just as hard, if not harder, to ensure that the children and grandchildren of today's taxpayers are not saddled with a doubling of their taxation so that they would see a lower standard of living. That is not the America that we grew up in. That is not the moral obligation we have. We cannot be that first generation in America's history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living. 
   That is why I am happy to join my fellow members of the Republic Study Committee who have come here to debate this important subject tonight. I especially want to thank the gentlewoman from Tennessee for her leadership in this hour.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (NEW FISCAL YEAR -- (House of Representatives - October 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for yielding, and earmarks are a very important part of the debate about spending in Washington, D.C. We know that the people are overtaxed and are overtaxed because Washington spends too much. 
   Now, some people say, well, earmarks are just a small portion of the Federal budget. You know, that may be true, but Mr. Speaker, if you look closely at the numbers today under this Democrat leadership, more money is being spent on congressional earmarks than it is the entirety of our veterans health care system. Now, that's a travesty. This body should be ashamed of that fact, that more money is going to these congressional earmarks than they are going for our veterans health care system. There are still needs in that system, but instead, under this Democrat leadership, the earmark machine continues to roll. 
   Now, when they became the majority party, they claimed they would do better. In fact, our Speaker, Speaker Pelosi, was quoted as saying she would just as soon do without earmarks; though, I've noticed in the latest copy of Congressional Quarterly Weekly she's in the top 10 out of 435 Members when it comes to digging in the trough for more pork, for more congressional earmarks. 
   Now, people understand that earmarks too often represent a triumph of seniority over merit. Too often they represent a triumph of secrecy over transparency, and too often they represent a triumph of special interest over the public interest. 
   Now, again, I'm not here to say that all earmarks are bad, but the process is broken. The Democrats claimed they would clean it up, but instead, they've created huge new loopholes in the system. 
   If you want to go on a pork lean diet, you just can't cut out the sausage. You've got to cut out the bacon and the ham as well, and so when people hear about appropriation earmarks and authorizing earmarks and tax earmarks, what they need to know is what the majority said they were going to do and what they did are two different things. 
   So I wish I were eloquent enough to have thought of this myself, but to quote a colleague on the Senate side, Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Earmarks are the gateway drug to spending addiction. And that's why this fight is so important, and it's so disappointing when the Democrats, in some cases rightfully, criticized the Republicans in the last Congress, but we cleaned up the system. At a bare minimum, we brought transparency and accountability to the system, and they've rolled that back. 
   Now, it was mentioned earlier on the floor this evening that one of the first acts the Democrats had, they asked the entire House of Representatives to pass massive spending bills. They would hide in them earmarks and only later would they be revealed what the House voted on. Thankfully, under the Republicans, we came to the floor and we brought transparency to the debate, and the Democrats were forced to reverse themselves. So at least on a small portion of earmarks, known as the appropriations earmarks, there is at least a modicum of transparency now. 
   We need to have that great disinfectant of sunshine brought on to this system because earmarks are the gateway drug to spending addiction. They create the culture of spending, and we'll never be able to protect the family budget from the Federal budget until we deal with that culture of spending. 
   Earmarks, again by definition, have nothing to do with merit. They take merit, they take competition, they take competitive bidding out of the process, and instead what happens is senior Members, typically in smoke-filled rooms in the back of the Capitol, are somehow able to arrange these special earmarks. 
   Most recently, under the Democrat leadership, there was something like 30 Members of Congress managed to get a special funding stream for hospitals in their district that no one else, no other hospital in America was able to receive. Again, a triumph of seniority over merit, a triumph of secrecy over transparency. 
   It has to do with the culture of spending, and if we're going to save the next generation from having a lower standard of living than we have because we are on a pathway right now just with the government we have to double taxes in the next generation, unconscionable, immoral, and yet the Democrat leadership continues with this culture of spending. 
   The earmark machine is alive and well as represented by the cover story right here, Mr. Speaker, in Congressional Quarterly Weekly. I wish every American could read that to see what is happening in this earmark process. 
   Every time some Member of Congress comes to the floor requesting a new earmark, guess where that money is coming from, Mr. Speaker. Either they're taking it out of the Social Security trust fund, robbing seniors of the hard-earned money that they put into it, or it's going to be part of this $3,000 a year tax increase that the Democrats put into their budget, the single largest tax increase in American history. Or if they choose not to tax it, there's only one other thing they can do, Mr. Speaker, pass on the debt to our children and grandchildren. 
   And that's why I appreciate the gentlewoman from Tennessee. I appreciate  all the members of the Republican Study Committee coming to the floor tonight to add more transparency to this earmark debate, because unless we have transparency and accountability, we won't reduce the number of earmarks, and until we reduce the number of earmarks, we won't be able to change the culture of spending and be able to give the next generation greater freedom and greater opportunity than we've enjoyed. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope people have watched this debate carefully, and for those who wish to know even more, I would invite them to go to the Web site of the Republican Study Committee that I have the honor to chair, at www.house.gov/hensarling/rsc, and learn a great deal more 
   about the spending patterns of the Federal Government and how often the people's money is squandered and taken away from their future and their American dream. 
   But there's a better way. There's a better way under conservative principles to make sure that we do not allow the Federal budget to grow beyond the family budgets and be able to pay for it, that we don't pass debt on to future generations and that we reform these earmarks and make the Democrats remain good to their word. 
   So, again, I thank the gentlewoman from Tennessee for her great leadership in the conservative movement in the House, with her eloquent and articulate voice for her leadership on this subject.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  
   Mr. Speaker, this might possibly be the single most fiscally irresponsible bill to come to the floor this year, and it has had a lot of healthy competition. Why? Because this bill would create nine, count them, nine, Mr. Speaker, new entitlement programs. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, we all know what entitlement programs are; sometimes the American people don't. These are the programs that we put on automatic pilot that get very little oversight. And these nine new entitlement programs are going to be on top of almost 10,000 other Federal programs that are already on the books. And we know that it is entitlement spending that is threatening future generations and threatening their educational opportunities. 
   As the ranking member on the Budget Committee, the gentleman from Wisconsin talked about, we've heard from our chairman of the Federal Reserve, ``Without early and meaningful action to address the rapid growth of entitlements, the U.S. economy could be seriously weakened, with future generations bearing much of the costs, costs that could have been used for their educational opportunities.'' 
   We've heard from Comptroller General Walker, ``The rising costs of government entitlements are a fiscal cancer that threatens catastrophic consequences for our country and could bankrupt America.'' And what does this bill do, Mr. Speaker? It ignores this greatest fiscal threat to our Nation, a threat to educational opportunities, and dumps nine new entitlement spending programs on top of it. 
   Now, I have no doubt that the bill's sponsor will claim that this saves money, but it uses gimmicks. It claims that these entitlements will expire. Well, Mr. Speaker, we see Haley's Comet more frequently than we ever see an entitlement program expiring in the Nation's Capitol. It's got interest rate snapbacks. And we all know that once these entitlement seeds grow, the cost will be borne by future generations. 
   One thing I want to make very clear, Mr. Speaker, is that the worst part of this program is that it will ultimately lessen educational opportunities for hardworking American families. And it will because it is all part of a Democratic spend-and-tax program. Programs like these necessitate the largest single tax increase in American history, which they put into their budget, which takes away from families' opportunities to spend on their educational opportunities. 
   I heard from Melanie in Chandler, Texas, who's in my district. She wrote, ``Congressman, if I have to pay more taxes, then I can't afford to go to school. If taxes are raised, I won't have a choice but to quit school and go back to work.'' 
   I heard from Rose in Garland, Texas, also in my congressional district. ``I'm a divorced mother with a child in college and a child in daycare. An increase in taxes would wipe out hope of the first college graduate in the family.'' 
   I heard from Bruce in Garland. ``In my particular case, an additional $2,200 in taxes would cut into the finances I use to pay for my son's college education. I really believe that given more money, Congress will spend more money, so that is not the answer. A control in reduction of spending is what is needed.'' 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, there are very few opportunities that are as wondrous and as fundamental to the American Dream as education. And so I want to make it very clear again today, we're not having a debate over how much we're going to spend as a Nation on education, but we are having a very fundamental debate on who does that spending. 
   This bill, brought by the Democrat majority, would put all of the control in government. It would reduce opportunities. It would reduce choice. It would reduce innovation for families trying to finance education. And ironically, as part of the largest single tax increase in American history, it takes money away from families. But if people beg for it, maybe they'll get a little bit of it back. 
   We should reject this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, in America, we can either have maximum opportunity or we can have minimum wages. We cannot have both. In the land of the free, in a Nation as great as ours, how can we deny people their maximum opportunity, their opportunity to secure the American Dream? 
   Well, apparently, our Democrat colleagues can, because, for thousands, they will now replace the American Dream of boundless career opportunities instead with the nightmare of welfare dependence. 
   Columnist George Will recently wrote that increasing the minimum wage is ``a bad idea whose time has come.'' And, unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, apparently that time has come. 
   What is the purpose? Notwithstanding the rhetoric that we hear today, the purpose of this law is really to protect skilled labor from the competition of unskilled labor. We understand the elections are over. The American people have spoken. But, apparently, now labor union bosses are collecting their chits. 
   Now, what is the effect of this law? Indeed, I admit, some will have a mandated pay raise in America. Those will be the lucky ones. Many more will have their hours cut, Mr. Speaker. Many will have their benefits cut due to this law, and many will lose their jobs. And again, thousands, thousands will be denied that opportunity to climb on that first rung of the economic ladder in America and, instead, be condemned to a life of poverty. This should not happen in America. 
   Mr. Speaker, I recently spoke to a number of people who create jobs and hope and opportunity in America, good solid citizens from the Fifth Congressional District of Texas. I heard from David Hinds, the owner of Van Tone Created Flavors of Terrell, Texas. His company employs over 25 people in this community in my district. But he says, if we pass this increase in the minimum wage, he is going to have to lay off three, maybe four of his employees and automate his plant to use less labor. 
   I heard from Kevin and Jeaneane Lilly. Kevin was a guy who started out at McDonald's years ago frying up the french fries. He now owns 10 McDonald's restaurants. He says, if the Democrats act today to increase the minimum wage, they will be forced to lay off all of their part-time workers and use only full-time workers. 
   I spoke to Larry Peterson, who has a small business called EmbroidMe in Dallas, Texas. He says, instead of hiring three to four people at the current minimum wage, he is going to have to do with one to two higher paid, more highly skilled people, denying those other two people their rung on the economic ladder.     
   Mr. Speaker, these are just a few stories from one congressional district in Texas, but these stories are going to be replicated all over America if we pass this law. 
   Now, the proponents of this law say somehow it is necessary, because we have to force employers to pay fair wages. Yet I know, Mr. Speaker, that 99 percent of all Americans have their wages set by free people negotiating in a competitive marketplace. 
   In other words, without any interference by Congress whatsoever 99 percent of all people in the workforce were able to find work above the minimum wage. Do we not believe in the American free enterprise system anymore? The proponents also say we must raise the minimum wage to help the poor, but by and large the minimum wage workers aren't poor. Less than one in five lives below the poverty line. The average family income of a minimum wage worker is about $40,000 a year. Very few minimum wage workers, indeed, support a family. Instead, the majority are teenagers. They are college students, and many are part-time workers. 
   In fact, the problem is that many poor people either cannot work or will not work. Over three-fifths of the individuals below the poverty line did not work in 2005. Only 11 percent work full time. 
   An increase in the minimum wage is going to do very little to help poor people who either cannot work or will not work. The way to help poor people is not to cut off the bottom rung of the economic ladder in America. For those who feel that they want to help the poor over and above what we are already doing, I would remind them that, by and large, the working poor qualify for health care through Medicaid, through subsidies, through food stamps, housing subsidies through section 8 vouchers, energy assistance through LIHEAP, cash assistance through Earned Income Tax Credit, TANF, and the list goes on and on and on. 
   In fact, Mr. Speaker, there has been an explosion of anti-poverty spending at the Federal level under President Bush, up 39 percent between the years 2001 and 2005. So contrary to the protest of the other side of the aisle, there is a lot of direct government assistance here. We need to remind people again that any wage rate is better than no wage rate. 
   The pool of minimum wage workers is constantly changing, and as they learn new skills, they prove themselves and they climb up the economic opportunity ladder. Why do we want to deny them this opportunity? 
   Mr. Speaker, I have some personal experience here because I was in high school in May of 1974, when Congress promised me a pay raise. I was the bellman at the Holiday Inn in College Station, Texas, trying to put some money together to go to college. I worked my way through college. 
   But when Congress gave me that pay raise, guess what? I got my pink slip. That Holiday Inn was struggling. They had to lay off the two newest employees they had to make ends meet. This causes unemployment. This should be voted down.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today, and, unfortunately, I have to oppose this particular rules package. 
   I listened very carefully to our new Speaker when she spoke of fairness, and yet I see that the minority is not being given the opportunity to offer amendments to this particular package when it comes to the floor. We are being asked to vote on things we don't even know what they are about, something that, Madam Speaker, your party complained of when you were in the minority. 
   But I specifically am disturbed by what I see in supposedly the fiscal responsibility portion that this rule package would allow. I heard our new Speaker talk about how important it was to bring PAYGO to the floor of the House; and I agree, it is a great concept. 
   Unfortunately, what is being offered, where the minority doesn't have an opportunity to amend, is really false advertising, because what we have, Madam Speaker, is, number one, this concept called baseline budgeting, where these programs are going to grow automatically in what we call discretionary spending, and yet this PAYGO doesn't apply to this. Anything that the majority writes into the budget resolution again is exempted from PAYGO. All of the entitlement spending, a majority of the spending, which could bankrupt our children and our grandchildren, once again is exempt. 
   What is covered, Madam Speaker? It is hard to find. But anything that is, then the majority has 5 to 10 years apparently to put off the costs, and somehow we are supposed to be convinced in 5 to 10 years they are actually going to pay for it. 
   Again, this is false advertising. This isn't PAYGO; this is TAXGO. All this is is a subterfuge to make sure that hardworking American families are denied the tax relief that the Republicans and President Bush brought, the tax relief that created 6 million new jobs, that created the highest rate of homeownership in the history of our country, that helped deficits fall, that ensured that real wages came up. That is why we need to oppose this rule, Madam Speaker.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (CREDIT CARDHOLDERS' BILL OF RIGHTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank him for his leadership. 
   I certainly understand the intent and the purpose of the gentlelady's bill, and her intent is good. Unfortunately, I believe the policy is bad. 
   It is entitled the Credit Card Bill of Rights Act. I fear, if enacted, it will prove to be a ``credit card bill of wrongs'' for credit card holders all over America. I view it as a most decisively anti-consumer piece of legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I believe that this piece of legislation helps turn back the clock to a different era in America where there is little competition for credit cards, where a third fewer Americans had access to credit cards which so many now view as a necessity of everyday economic life. Those people in this previous era who did have credit cards universally paid a high, high interest rate. 
   I believe this bill also represents another assault on our personal economic freedoms and will exacerbate the credit crunch that we see today. Why would we want to bring a bill to the floor that could make credit even less accessible and more expensive at a time when Americans are struggling to pay their bills? 
   This bill ultimately would limit the ability in some instances to charge interest; it would limit the ability in some respects to change terms; limit the ability to impose certain late fees; limit the ability to impose over-the-limit fees. Essentially, it erodes what we call risk-based pricing. 
   And what has risk-based pricing and competition brought us? Number one, what we have seen is where interest rates used to be in the 20 percent range, they have now fallen below the 15 percent range. We have seen a virtual disappearance in our entire economy of the dreaded annual fees, which typically most cards had charged anywhere from $20 to $50. We have seen a flowering, a myriad of benefits that are now available from product protection to free plane tickets because of the competition, and an unprecedented surge in credit card use from under 300 million a day to almost 700. 
   Credit cards are just an absolutely vital tool for the small business in America, which is the job engine in our Nation. Madam Speaker, I hear from a lot of hardworking small business people in my district, the Fifth Congressional District of Texas that I am proud to represent. I hear from the Mayhall family that runs a small business in Athens, Texas. They write, ``Dear Congressman. I run a small business, and I do not have very good credit. I have four credit cards which have very low limits. I try not to use them very often, but sometimes the cash flow isn't there, and I have to have something for my business. Without access to this credit, I would not be able to purchase the items for my business when I need it. 
   ``Please do not make it more difficult for me to run my business. I have enough problems.'' 
   I don't want to tell the Mayhall family of Athens, Texas, that maybe their small business just won't have access to one of those credit cards any more. I don't want to have to tell them that they may have to pay more. That simply isn't right. 
   Now I don't come here today to defend credit card companies and all of their practices. There is one certain credit card company that my wife and I just refuse to do business with. We don't like them. We've changed our main credit cards several times because we didn't like some of the provisions. But we had that choice, Madam Speaker. We had that choice in a competitive economy. 
   We should also mention a phrase that is rarely used in the Halls of Congress, and that is ``individual responsibility.'' We all bear some individual responsibility for knowing what is in our credit card bills. 
   Now listen. If we don't know what the terms are, either, one, we've been misled by a credit card company--and, Madam Speaker, it happens. There are some misleading and fraudulent practices, and they need to be cracked down on. That's why we have the Truth in Lending Act, that's why we have the Unfair and Deceptive Practices Act, that's why we have the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, and others. 
   Another reason that we don't know the terms, Madam Speaker, is because we didn't read them, in which case we have ourselves to blame. Another reason that people don't know their terms is because they're incomprehensible. We can't understand them because of too many crazy government mandates that give us voluminous disclosure written in legalese as opposed to effective disclosure written in English.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Speaker, again, don't take my word for it, but the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has written that if restrictive proposals like these were to become law, ``credit card issuers could also respond in a variety of ways. They may increase loan rates across the board on all borrowers, making it more expensive for both good and delinquent borrowers to use revolving credit. Issuers may also increase minimum monthly payments, reduce credit limits, or reduce the number of credit cards issued to people with impaired credit.'' 
   Madam Speaker, we have seen a similar piece of legislation across the pond in the U.K. Britain decided that credit card default fees were too high. They ordered credit card issuers to cut them or face legal action, and guess what happened? Two of the three biggest issuers imposed annual fees on their credit card holders, 19 have raised interest rates, and we have seen studies that 60 percent of new credit applicants are being rejected. I don't want to repeat that experience in the United States of America in the midst of a credit crunch. 
   We should reject this legislation.

   Madam Chairman, for as many shortcomings as this budget has for what it contains, the largest single tax increase in American history threatening, over the next few years, an increase in family taxes of over $3,000 a year, an explosion of new government spending in bureaucracy, the largest Federal budget ever, earmarks as far as the eye can see, taking money out of paychecks so some Member of Congress can keep their paycheck, for as bad as this budget is for what it contains, it's even worse for what it doesn't contain.     
   There is nothing, nothing in this budget that will reform out-of-control entitlement spending. This budget, this Democrat budget, threatens the retirement security of future generations. 
   And don't take my word for it. Go to the Social Security and Medicare Trustees Report. It's going broke. It is going broke. The Nation can't afford all of the spending that the Democrats are putting forth. Already these programs are threatening future generations with an unconscionable tax hike. We are looking at a fiscal fork in the road already so that future generations are either, A, going to have to have their taxes doubled, or there will be no Federal Government to speak of except Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. 
   Now, our friends on the other side of the aisle say, well, give us a few years and maybe we'll get around to doing something about it. Well, we don't have a few years. We don't have a few years, Mr. Chairman, because every single year that the Democrats choose to kick the can down the road, every single year they choose to ignore the problem, an extra $2 trillion of debt that they decry is put on our children and our grandchildren. 
   Mr. Chairman, I got into the parent business 6 years ago. I have a 6-year-old daughter and a 4-year-old son. I know many on that side of the aisle have children and grandchildren. So I'm so perplexed that they don't care about this problem. Every year they ignore it, it's an extra $8,000 of debt or taxes that are going to be placed on our children and our grandchildren. 
   But don't take my word for it. Listen to the Federal Reserve: ``Without early and meaningful action to address the rapid growth of entitlements, the U.S. economy could be seriously weakened with future generations bearing much of the cost.'' 
   Comptroller General Walker: ``The rising cost of government entitlements are a fiscal cancer, a fiscal cancer that threatens catastrophic consequences for our country and could bankrupt America.'' 
   Those aren't my words, Mr. Chairman. Those are the words of the Comptroller General. Those are the words of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. 
   So right now already as the Democrats decry the current debt, do they not believe that Medicare is a debt of the government? Do they not believe Medicaid is a debt of the government? Do they not believe Social Security is a debt of the government? And if so, it is their budget, their budget that is increasing debt and heaping it upon future generations. 
   This $8,000 a year that they are putting on future generations, that's enough money for every family in my district to send two children to Texas A&M University for 4 years. It will pay an average mortgage for 2 years. And yet, again, the Democrats know about this problem, Mr. Chairman; they just don't do anything about it. 
   Now, somebody who grew up listening to a lot of rock and roll, there's a song that I'm very fond of called ``Ohio'' by Neil Young, and there's a line in that song that says, ``How can you run when you know?'' And that's what I ask about this budget. How can the Democrats run when they know what they are doing to future generations?

   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the ranking member for yielding, and I am sorry that my friend from New Jersey has apparently left the floor. No, I see him there. We had the occasion to debate this budget earlier today. I believe that he just said every Republican voted against OBRA in 1993 and that is what unleashed economic growth, but if I did my homework correctly, I think the gentleman from New Jersey voted against it as well. I would be happy to yield to the gentleman if I was incorrect in my assertion.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Well, I thank the gentleman once again for yielding. 
   There is a big question again about tax increases, and I have heard many of my friends on the other side of the aisle argue that there is no tax increase included in their budget; yet, Mr. Chairman, they claim that they are going to balance the budget in 2012. Well, the only way they can do that is by capturing all these tax revenues. 
   Now, some of them use very clever Washington language. They say, well, we are not raising taxes on working men and women in America. We are just letting tax relief expire. 
   Well, that is a very fine distinction that is lost upon the working men and women of America. I mean, there is this odd quirk in Washington that somehow spending is forever and it grows exponentially at the expense of the family budget, and yet tax relief somehow is temporary. 
   The bottom line is that very soon, within two budget years, there is going to be a massive tax increase upon the American people. There will be, again, the largest single tax increase in American history. Now, we were just talking about the earlier record when the Democrats were in control of Congress of $241 billion. The tax increase they are proposing now will dwarf that, $683 billion, the largest tax increase in American history. 
   Again, they want to claim credit for balancing the budget, and I certainly salute their goal. The Republican budget, it balances the budget without tax increases. But if you look and actually read the numbers, and ultimately the numbers are the only thing you can count on in a budget, well, Mr. Chairman, this is their budget right here.  That is them taking in all of these tax increases. That is how they claim to balance the budget. So, again, there is going to be huge, massive tax increases, scheduled, automatic tax increases. The Republican budget prevents those tax increases from coming into fruition. 
   Now, I have heard our chairman, and I have the greatest amount of respect for the chairman, say on many occasions, well, you know, this is the way the law was written. But, Mr. Chairman, if I did my homework correctly, there have been at least 21 different occasions over the last 5 years to make sure that these automatic tax increases on hardworking American people didn't take place. And as I look at the voting record, the overwhelming majority of Democrats voted to make sure that these tax increases do take place, so I am sure they don't want to admit to the American people that they are raising taxes. But they are. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, what is going to happen? Well, let me tell you what is going to happen under this Democrat budget. 
   Number one, 116 million taxpayers will see an average tax increase of more than $1,800 per year. 
   More than 6 million low-income individuals and couples who currently pay no taxes, no taxes, will no longer be exempt and will have to start paying income taxes. 
   A family of four earning $50,000 will see their taxes increase by $2,100. 
   Low-income families with one or two children will no longer be eligible for the refundable child tax credit in 2011. 
   Tax bills for an estimated 27 million small business owners will increase by more than $4,000 each. 
   Mr. Chairman, I was a small businessman before I came to Congress, and let me tell you, excess taxation prevents small businesses from creating jobs. A job is the greatest housing program, nutritional program, and educational program in the history of mankind. It is a paycheck, not a welfare check. Yet the Democrat tax increase is a dagger aimed at the heart of small business throughout our Nation. 
   The capital gains tax is going to go up 33 percent, the capital of capitalism. If you want to be able to have job growth, you have to have capital. Taxes on dividends go up 164 percent under their plan. 
   Mr. Chairman, the death tax, that is a tax that is immoral. It ought to be illegal. It goes away, and under this Democrat budget, it comes back as high as 55 percent. 
   The child tax credit is cut in half. The lowest tax bracket is increased 50 percent. 
   These are just the tax increases that have been passed into law. How about the others that the Democrats attempted to pass? H.R. 6 attempted to increase taxes $7.7 billion. H.R. 976 attempted to raise taxes $1.4 billion; H.R. 3963 tried to raise taxes $71.5 billion. 
   Now we have Chairman Rangel of the Ways and Means Committee wanting to raise taxes trillions of dollars in the years to come for the AMT. We have a 50 cent increase in gasoline tax recommended by the Energy and Commerce chairman, Mr. Dingell of Michigan, and an additional 5 cent increase per gallon gas hike proposed by Representative James Oberstar, chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. 
   There is no getting around it. This is the largest single tax increase on American history. It is going to cost American families an average of $3,000 a year as they try to educate their children, as they try to keep a roof over their head, as they try to realize their American Dream.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding to me. I have listened with great interest as my friends from the other side of the aisle, the Democrats, attempted to do everything they could to distance themselves from their single largest tax increase in American history contained in their budget. 
   Again, Mr. Chairman, here are $683 billion worth of tax increases. This is what we call the CBO baseline, the Congressional Budget Office, which assumes that, as current law says, we are going to have huge automatic tax increases, most of which kick in in 2011. That is this red line. 
   Well, our friends on the other side of the aisle claim they are balancing the budget in 2012, but they can only do it through these huge, automatic tax increases. And this isn't my baseline. They appointed the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, so if they have some problem with this particular revenue curve, they need to take it up with him. You can't have it both ways. You can't claim you are not increasing taxes and at the same time claim, claim that you are balancing the budget in 2012. 
   Now, I listened very carefully when my distinguished chairman said that he wants to prevent these tax increases. I know he wants to prevent it. And I listened to the gentlelady from Texas saying that she endorses middle income tax relief. But they just don't seem willing to vote that way, Mr. Chairman. 
   If I did the math correctly, there have been at least 21 occasions over the last 6 years when Democrats could have voted to prevent these huge, automatic tax increases, which will amount to an average tax increase on the American family of $3,000 a year. So the rhetoric is nice. The language is comforting. But when will somebody on that side of the aisle put their vote where their rhetoric is? I don't see it, Mr. Chairman. It reminds me of the old adage that your actions are so loud I can hardly hear your words. 
   Now I hear a lot of talk on the other side of the aisle about how compassionate their budget is and somehow our budget is not compassionate. I'm not sure what is really compassionate about raising taxes on hardworking American families because, Mr. Chairman, every time you plus-up the Federal budget, guess what, it comes out of some family budget. And I hear from those families. I hear from the families in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas that I have the honor of representing. 
   I heard from the White family of Mesquite, Texas: ``Regarding the news that the average Texas family may soon be burdened with extra taxes, it is not good news to a family with $24,000 a year in income and two expensive stroke-prevention medications, among other critical medications to maintain.'' Their $3,000 a year tax increase, the largest tax increase in American history, is going to decimate the family health care budget. 
   Now, I heard from the Sessions family in Quitman, Texas, also in my district: ``Any increase in income taxes would cut into my Social Security money so much, to such an extent I would not be able to purchase my medications.'' Again, their single largest tax increase in American history is going to decimate the family health care budget. 
   Mr. Chairman, I heard from the Swanson family from Wills Point, Texas: ``A tax increase of that size will prevent me from receiving the medications necessary to prolong my life.'' 
   Once again, the single largest tax increase in American history are decimating, will decimate families, not just in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas, but all over America. I wish that my friends on the other side of the aisle would just take a moment and think about who has to pay all of these taxes while Americans are struggling to pay for their health care bills and to make sure that they keep a roof over their head, to send their children to college, to fill up their cars and pickup trucks, to try to start small businesses. How are they going to be able to afford the single largest tax increase in history? Where is the compassion in taking money away from these hardworking families? 
   What does it do to their housing? Well, I heard from the Stevens family in Mesquite, Texas: ``I wanted to let you know that I am a single mom that does not receive any type of child support, and an increase of this amount would break me. I would be at risk of losing my home with this type of increase.'' 
   The single largest tax increase in American history, an average of $3,000 per American family, most of it due to hit right there, 2011, coming very soon to a neighborhood near you. It is going to decimate the housing budget. It is going to decimate the health care budget. It is going to decimate the education budget of hardworking American families all across the Nation. 
   Where is the compassion there? There is no compassion there.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for his leadership. I know of no other Member who is kinder or wiser than the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hall), and I appreciate that. 
   I also appreciate the earlier comments of the gentleman from Georgia who sits beside me. I want to assure, Mr. Speaker, all the people of Georgia that he is one of the great leaders of fiscal conservativism in this body, and his fellow fiscal conservatives understand if he is wrong once a year. 
   I somewhat reluctantly rise in opposition to this conference report. The goals contained within this conference report are very lofty goals. I know that many good things could be done with this money and that there are many good programs contained within it. But I have to ask a most inconvenient question, which I frequently find myself asking on this House floor: How are you going to pay for it? 
   Mr. Speaker, we continue to run deficit, which means now, by definition, when you are running a deficit, the first money is coming from raiding the Social Security Trust Fund. Is this program worth that? 
   I have Members coming to the floor to decry, well, we are borrowing money from China. Well, if you are floating T-bills and they are buying that debt, yes, then you are borrowing money from China. Is this worth borrowing money from China? 
   We know within the budget resolution passed by the Democrat majority, it contains the single largest tax increase in American history, which, over the course of 5 years, can amount to a $3,000 per American family tax burden. Is that where we are going to take the money from? 
   Mr. Speaker, there are already 10,000 Federal programs spread across 600 agencies; and since I have been here for almost 5 years, we are adding them at an alarming rate, and I see very few go away. How are we going to pay for it? 
   We are on the road right now to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living if we don't correct our spending ways. Let's get rid of some of the old programs before we add some new programs, no matter how worthy they may be.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise to oppose this particular bill. 
   But before I do, I do want to say I think there are a number of good things, a number of good provisions in the bill. As one who has come to the floor on numerous occasions to attempt to champion fiscal responsibility and earmark reform, I do take note that under the chairwoman's leadership, the gentlewoman from Connecticut, that the number of earmarks are actually reduced in this bill. I consider that progress, and she should be commended for that. 
   Having said that, Mr. Chairman, I also note that the bill increases spending over last year by 5.9 percent, 5.9 percent. Now the people who are ultimately going to be called to pay for this bill, my guess is their salaries didn't go up 5.9 percent. And I know throughout this debate we always point out all the good things that are in the bill, and occasionally we have to point out this very inconvenient question, and that is, who's going to pay for it all? Who's going to pay for it all? 
   Right now, the Federal Government is still spending roughly $23,000 per family. It's one of the largest levels in our Nation's history and the largest since World War II. Although it's down, the deficit is still very high, and Member after Member comes to the floor to decry raiding the Social Security Trust Fund, but we know if we're going to grow the Federal budget, including this bill, way beyond the growth of the family budget, that you continue to raid the Social Security Trust Fund. 
   Members come to this floor to decry borrowing money from China to pay for the national debt, but, again, if we increase this spending 5.9 percent, it's exactly what this body is going to do. 
   Now, we've already had a robust debate over the farm bill last week, and I know that many provisions in this bill will help rural America, and as one who represents six rural east Texas counties, I'm glad for that. As somebody who comes from three generations of people who made their living from agriculture, I appreciate the challenges in agriculture. 
   But I might observe that if we were really, really serious about trying to help all the different people involved in agriculture, maybe what we'd do is end the death tax, something our friends from the other side of the aisle have fought every step of the way. Somebody works their entire life to put together a ranch or a farm, Uncle Sam can come in and take 55 percent. Maybe we would stand up for private property rights and let these people dispose of their livestock as they wish. Maybe we would actually work to open up more markets for all of our food and fiber. But, no, instead, we're going to increase spending 5.9 percent. 
   That's the wrong approach, Mr. Chairman. We should defeat this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment that may be  modest in the dollars involved, but I believe it is very, very important in the principle that underlies it. 
   The amendment would simply level fund the Community Facilities Grant Program, level funding. It would spend the same amount of money next year that we have spent last year. 
   Instead, what we see in this appropriations bill is that the amount is going to be increased 37 percent, 37 percent. Now, again, the people who are going to be expected to pay for this, I seriously doubt that they saw their paychecks increase 37 percent. 
   Now, I have no doubt that good things can be done with this money. Those who want to spend more of the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars always have some very good rationale for doing it. 
   But the question is, any time you create a Federal investment, by definition you are going to be creating a family divestment, because somebody has to pay for this. In this particular case, when it is the Heritage Foundation, as is noted, by at least one count we have 10,000 Federal programs spread across 600 different agencies. I defy any human being to tell me what they do. The Office of Management and Budget has noted in their budget report: ``This program is redundant with other Federal programs at the Department of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development.'' 
   Now, my reading of this bill, and I would certainly let the chairman correct me if I am wrong, I don't think one single program is terminated in this particular bill. Everybody is going to get more money except the people who have to pay for it, and that is the poor beleaguered taxpayer. 
   I have a lot of respect for the chairman of the subcommittee, and we serve on the House Budget Committee together. I know she hears the same testimony that I hear. That testimony is this Nation has a huge spending problem. 
   Already with the government that we have, we are on track to double taxes on the next generation or, for all intents and purposes, there will be no Federal Government in the next generation, save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. 
   I know it's a problem that doesn't manifest itself tomorrow, but how long is this Congress going to kick the can down the road? I mean, we have heard the testimony. Our Comptroller General has said that the rising cost of government is ``a fiscal cancer'' that threatens ``catastrophic consequences for our country and could bankrupt America.'' 
   Yet here we have a bill increasing one program 37 percent and terminating none, none. I mean, where does it all stop? 
   Now, I know the subject matter is important. I have the honor and privilege of representing a fair amount of rural Texas in the Fifth Congressional District, but those are the same people who are being asked to pay for this. They are the ones who are going to be subjected to the single largest tax increase in American history of roughly $3,000 per family. 
   So here we have out of 10,000 Federal programs one that OMB has said is redundant, does the same thing that other programs do. Unfortunately, the committee's response is to increase it 37 percent. 
   Now, maybe the savings is modest to the taxpayer, but the principle is huge, because ultimately the Federal budget cannot grow beyond the family's budget ability to pay for it. There is a very important precedent that could be set here. Let's take one program and tell the American people who have to pay for it, know what, it can do with the same amount of money last year that it had this year. Let's protect, let's protect the family budget from the Federal budget. Let's adopt this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   More spending fuels more taxes. Let's hear it from the McConathy family in Mineola, Texas. ``We are retired and on a fixed income. If our taxes are raised almost $3,000, we will not be able to afford the medication we need.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, that is coming from the people who have to pay the taxes to help pay for the 37 percent increase in this program that the Democrat majority wants. Maybe they can spend their money better for their health care; and, because of that, I urge adoption of this amendment.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, the purpose of this amendment is, frankly, identical to the purpose of the previous amendment; and that is, let's show the American people that, out of these 10,000 Federal programs spread across 600 different agencies, that maybe one of them, one of them can do with the same amount of money next year that they had last year. 
   Instead, this particular program that is involved, the Broadband Grants program, in H.R. 3061, spending on the program has doubled, increased 100 percent. Again, are people who are expecting to pay for this, did their family income go up 100 percent? 
   And I have listened carefully to several of the previous speakers, and I will be measuring my comments. But, Mr. Chairman, I grew up working on my father's family farm. I am the son of a farmer. I am the grandson of a farmer. I am the great grandson of a farmer. I grew up in rural communities in Texas like Slaton and Naples and Lingelville. So, Mr. Chairman, I don't take a back seat to anybody to my commitment to rural America. It is where my roots are. 
   And so maybe some of the people on the other side of the aisle, maybe their constituents are a little different than mine. Maybe the people they grew up with and their surroundings and circumstances were different than mine. But I spend a lot of time talking to people in rural Texas in the counties that I have the pleasure of representing, those counties that help comprise the Fifth District of Texas. And they would love to all have broadband. They would love to have it. 
   And do you know what else they love even more? They would love not to have the single largest tax increase in American history imposed upon them. They would love to get rid of the death tax that can take away the family farm or ranch it took generations to build. That is what they would love. They would love the ability to be able to dispose of their private property, as they struggle to make their family farms and ranches successful. Each one of these has been opposed by the Democrat majority. That is what rural America needs. That is what people on the farm and ranch need. 
   Now, again, the goal of helping bring broadband to rural America is a very worthy goal. It is a very lofty goal. And I am sure in just a couple minutes we will hear how the entire rural America will come to a complete halt if we don't have any Federal, a Federal Government program dealing with broadband, notwithstanding the fact that the Office of Management and Budget has already noted, ``This program is duplicative of the Broadband Loan Program authorized in the 2002 farm bill. The areas eligible for grants are also eligible for low-cost broadband loans through the RUS.'' 
   The program is already there. So what are we doing spending double on this program, being completely oblivious to the people who have to pay for it? 
   Again, there is great, great focus on the benefits of this program. But where is the focus on the cost? 
   Again, I know the gentlelady from Connecticut hears the same testimony I do in the Budget Committee, but already we are on track, we are on track to double taxes for the next generation. The Comptroller General has said that we are on the verge of being the first generation in America's history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living. And so what do we do? We don't even sit idly by. We double spending on this particular program, completely oblivious to those who have to pay for it, especially future generations. 
   If there is anybody who qualifies today for the least of these in the political process, it is future generations. And because of that, although the principle is large, the sum is modest, I encourage adoption of the amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY LAND CLAIMS SETTLEMENT -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   As I listened very carefully to this debate, it is clear that the majority of the speakers feel very passionately that this is a debate about economic development for the region, a distressed region of Michigan. It's about economic development for a Native American tribe. Someone would have to be totally out of touch with their constituency not to realize that the number-one challenge to the economic well-being of our citizens is the high cost of energy. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit is very simple. It removes a provision in last year's ``non-energy'' energy bill that would prevent the government from using its purchasing power to spur the growth of American energy resources, such as coal-to-liquids technology, oil shale, and tar sands. 
   This is especially important since we know that right north of the border, right north of Michigan, that our neighbor to the north, Canada, is rich in these resources. Particularly, so much of their energy and many of their exports come from tar sands. 
   The real estate that we are talking about in question could be greatly impacted should the section 526 not be repealed. Because as most people know who have studied the issue, Mr. Speaker, the United States Air Force wishes to enter into long-term contracts in order to help develop these promising new alternative energy alternatives. Yet in the Democrat ``non-energy'' energy bill, they would be effectively prevented from doing so. That will clearly have an adverse impact upon the economic growth, the economic well-being of the Native American tribe in question, not to mention the real estate in question as well. 
   So, again, Mr. Speaker, when we look at energy, energy now has become a health care issue. It has become an education issue. It is certainly a Native American issue. It is an economic growth issue as well. What has happened is we have seen that the Democrat majority simply wants to bring us bills that somehow believe that if we beg OPEC, we can bring down the price of energy at the pump. Maybe if we sue OPEC, we can bring down the price of energy at the pump. Maybe if we somehow berate oil companies, that will cause prices to go down at the pump. Maybe we should tax them. Well, they will take those taxes and put it right back in their price. 
   But what the Democrat majority hasn't decided to do is to produce American energy in America and bring down the cost of energy that way. Not only have they decided not to do it, Mr. Speaker, they are moving in the complete opposite direction with this section 526, which prevents the Federal Government from contracting in order to spur the growth of these promising alternative fuel sources, like coal-to-liquid technology, like oil shale, like tar sands. They are moving in the complete opposite direction. 
   Mr. Speaker, not unlike probably yourself and many of my other colleagues on the floor on both sides of the aisle, we hear from our constituents. I have heard from a constituent that says the high cost of energy now is preventing them from having three meals a day. The high cost of energy has caused them to have their adult children to have to move back in with them. Yet our Democrat majority will not bring a bill to the floor that actually produces American energy. 
   What Republicans want to do on this side of the aisle is, number one, continue to develop our renewable energy resources. Mr. Speaker, before coming to Congress I was an officer in a green energy company. Those technologies are promising. But, Mr. Speaker, until they are technologically and economically viable will be years to come. In the meantime, people have to take their children to school every day. People have to go to work every day. Many have to go and see their physicians. 
   And so we need to bring down the cost of this energy now. We know that we haven't built a refinery in America in almost 30 years. Our capacity is down. We are having to import not just crude but we are having to import refined gasoline as well. Yet, the Democrat majority does nothing, does nothing to help build more refineries. 
   We need diversification. We need nuclear energy. We sit here and talk to the American people about the threat of global warming, yet we know nuclear energy has no greenhouse emissions whatsoever. 
   It's imperative that we pass this motion to recommit and get more American energy today.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I wish to be heard. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker, I don't know how, when you can have speaker after speaker come to the floor and say essentially this is a bill having to do with the economic well-being of a distressed area of Michigan, the economic well-being of a Native American tribe, and not believe that somehow the cost of energy factors into the economic well-being. 
   We are talking also about a piece of real estate. We are talking about the value of underlying minerals in this piece of real estate that will be greatly impacted on whether or not this section 526 is repealed or not. 
   I would just simply ask the Speaker, when is it germane to bring a motion to produce American energy in America and bring down the high cost of energy for the American people? If not now, when, Mr. Speaker? When will the Democrat majority allow these motions to be voted on?

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of the unalienable right to life and in opposition to H.R. 3. 
   This legislation would require increased Federal support for embryo-destructive research, abrogating, I believe, our responsibility to protect life as declared by our Founders in the Declaration of Independence. 
   Yet, some in this Chamber, I believe, would inadvertently end life, even in its earliest moments, in order to try to improve the lives of others. And they do so by using research that has shown little promise to develop effective treatments. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are alternatives. I support ethical stem cell research that does not spend Federal taxpayer dollars to fund studies that so many Americans find morally reprehensible. For example, we know that adult stem cell research has now, to date, led to 72 different treatments and clinical applications in humans. Additionally, we know that umbilical cord blood is already being used successfully against diseases like leukemia, sickle cell anemia and lymphoma. 
   And just this week, we all know, worldwide we heard the news that a new source of stem cells had been found in amniotic fluid. These cells, which can be retrieved without doing harm to a developing child, and have  been described as having all the positive potential of embryonic stem cells but with much greater stability. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, for those who are committed only to embryonic stem cell research, it is important for all Americans to know there is no current prohibition on this research. Any individual, any university, any medical center is free to use their resources to conduct this type of research. And, indeed, hundreds of millions have already been spent, unfortunately, with little result. 
   In this body we debate a number of vitally important issues. But is there any issue more important than preserving the sanctity of life? And shouldn't we ask ourselves, how can we preserve liberty if we cannot preserve life? And should there be doubt, we should err on the side of life.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (THE BUDGET -- (House of Representatives - February 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Well, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I certainly appreciate her leadership in helping illuminate for families all across America exactly how this process of the Federal budget works. It is very important, Madam Speaker, that people pay attention to this Federal budget because at the end of the day, it is the family budget that pays for the Federal budget. Unfortunately, there is no free lunch. Somebody has to pay for this. And all of government will be paid for, and it is paid for out of the family budget. 
   It is especially important today, Madam Speaker, as families all across America are struggling to fill up their gas tanks. They are struggling to pay their health care premiums. They are struggling to send their kids to college. And every singl e dollar that is used to  plus up a Federal budget has to come out of some family budget. If you are going to plus up the Federal budget, you are going to decrease the family budget. And so it is important that families pay attention to how their money is spent. 
   So I applaud the gentlewoman from Tennessee for organizing a series of Special Orders on the floor of the United States House in order to help educate and enlighten the American people about this budget. 
   The first thing that the Americ an people need to know about the budget is that, contrary to almost every single thing we do in this body, the budget doesn't even have the force of law. That's right, Madam Speaker. At best, it is a mere suggestion. Now, it takes an act of Congress to change the name of a post office, but somehow, the United States budget, the United States budget doesn't bear the force of law. It is a suggestion. 
   Now, many Republicans have come to this floor to try to say, at a bare minimum, the budget ought to be hon est. And when we set a budget, it's supposed to be a ceiling on how much money we take away from American families, how much bread we take off of their table, how many opportunities we take away from them to give to government. There at least, at some point, has to be a ceiling where we say no more, we are not going to take any more away from American families. But instead, it is just a suggestion. 
   And so if we look in our rearview mirror, Madam Speaker, we unfortunately discover, just look for the last 5 years, 10 years, every time there has been a Federal budget, ultimately, Congress spent more money 
   than what that budget provided. And so legislation has been brought by members of the Republican Study Committee, the Conservative Caucus of the House, to change that. But unfortunately we have yet to meet with success. But we will continue to ensure that the re is a limit to how much money is taken away from American families. 
   Well, today how much money is taken? Over $24,000 per family is what the Federal Government is spending. Now, whether it is paid for by cash or credit card, ultimately all government will be paid for. And this is, Madam Speaker, only the first time since World War II that the Federal Government has spent so much of the people's money. And that is an inflation adjusted number. Over $24,000. 
   Madam Speaker, I just wonder how many peo ple who are listening to this debate this afternoon really think they are getting their $24,000 worth out of the Federal Government. Now, clearly there are many good things that the Federal Government does. But there has been an explosion of government, an explosion of government that, again, ultimately has to be paid for by the family budget. 
   Over the last 10 years, Madam Speaker, the Federal budget has grown by 66 percent; yet the family budget, as measured by median family income, has only grown 30.2 percent, less than half that. So families who have to pay for it are having to take a bigger bite out of their paycheck in order to write out that IRS check. Well, Madam Speaker, how long can this go on? How long can the Federal budget exceed the spending of the family budget? American families need to know that. And that is why it is important that these Special Orders have been organized by the Republican Study Committee to let the American people know just how much money is being spent of theirs and how that money is being spent. 
   Now, some will say, and we often hear it, this budget is being cut and that budget is being cut. I wish for once it were true. But there is this thing in Washington, and it is a little bit of inside baseball, called ``baseline budgeting,'' which as this series continues we will speak about more, Madam Speaker, but baseline budgeting is an accounting concept that would make an Enron accountant blush. It automatically inflates all the numbers of the Federal budget. 
   Now, peo ple all across America believe that if you spend the same amount of money on something next year as you did this year, but that is not a cut, but under the concept known as ``baseline budgeting'' and something called the ``current services budget,'' government automatically inflates all of these government accounts. And then say, for example, if you don't increase the Housing and Urban Development budget by 2.7 percent, say you only increase it 2 percent, that is a cut. That is what ``baseline budgeting'' m eans. Again, Republicans representing the Republican Study Committee have come to the House floor to try to introduce honest accounting and transparency on this House floor. 
   Unfortunately, we have not had any cooperation by our friends on the other side of the aisle who want to continue with this thing called ``baseline budgeting'' that inflates the government budget at the expense of the family budget. 
   And just listen to some of these budgets, Madam Speaker. Over the last 10 years, the internationa l affairs budget has grown 128 percent. The energy budget, what we call budget function number 270, has grown 229 percent. The transportation budget, Federal transportation budget has grown 88 percent. Community and regional development, 132 percent. And the list goes on and on. And again, over the last 10 years, the family budget, which has to pay for it, has only grown a little over 30 percent. 
   So government, the Federal budget, is growing at a huge multiple over the family budget, and yet the family budget has to pay for it. And it is that family budget, that family paycheck that is getting stressed. And so it is another reason why the American people need to pay very close attention. 
   Now, how is all of this government paid for? We have the single largest budget that is about to be proposed by the Democrats in the history of America. It is going to weigh in at over $3 trillion, continuing the exponential growth of government at the expense of the family budget. Well, how is it paid for? Well, two d ifferent ways: cash and credit. And the cash is taxes. 
   Now, my friends and I on the other side of the aisle will say, well, all we need to do to balance the budget is raise taxes. Well, they hadn't balanced it yet. But they certainly, certainly have done an excellent job of raising taxes. Already, Madam Speaker, it is very important that the American people know this, but there are huge automatic tax increases that are scheduled, courtesy of our friends on the other side of the aisle, the Democrats. Rig ht now, the single largest tax increase in American history is due to be imposed upon the American people over the next 3 years. This is written into law. 
   The American people need to know what kind of bite is going to come out of their paycheck to inflate the Federal budget at the expense of the family budget. Already, with these scheduled Democrat tax increases due to take place over the next 3 years, the average family in America is going to be socked with an additional tax burden of over $3,000 per f amily. That's right, Madam Speaker, over $3,000 per American family courtesy of our friends on the other side of the aisle. 
   What is going to happen? Well, at the bracket, ordinary income, the top bracket will go from 35 percent to 39.6 percent, which is an increase of 13 percent. Now, some say, well, that is the wealthy. Let's go tax the wealthy. Well, Madam Speaker, how many people in America when they hear that really believe it?     
   Anytime you hear that phrase, it is time for middle-income people to grab their wallets, because it means that Washington is going to go on another money grab. 
   Also, Madam Speaker, it is important to note that approximately over 70 percent of those people who file at that rate are small businesses, the backbone of the American economy. We on this side of the aisle want to help ensure pa ychecks. Paychecks are more important than welfare checks. 
   So here it is: The Democrat party is getting ready in their budget to once again increase taxes on small business. The capital gains tax, the ``capital'' of capitalism, the fuel of free enterprise, that tax is due to increase 33.3 percent over the next 3 years. 
   Dividends are due to increase, a 164 percent tax increase on dividends, courtesy of our friends on the other side of the aisle, the Democrats. 
   The death tax. You have already paid taxes on the income once; but yet under the death tax, American people, Madam Speaker, are compelled to visit  both the undertaker and the IRS on the very same day. That is just an outrage. That tax is due to go from zero to up to 55 percent. People in the Fifth District of Texas, Madam Speaker, can work their entire lives trying to build a ranch, trying to build a farm, trying to build a small business, having the American Dream of thinking maybe one day I can leave that to my children or my grandch ildren, only to see Uncle Sam come in and take 55 percent. 
   The Democrats' budget proposals will gut the American Dream. They will just take away any opportunity to leave that farm, that ranch, that small business. I talked to a rancher in my district who said, Congressman, once Uncle Sam takes his piece, there is not enough left for the family. That shouldn't happen in America. 
   I would be happy to yield back to the gentlelady from Tennessee.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I first come here somewhat amused at the lecture that some of us received from the majority leader last evening on abuse of process. I hear many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say that we have a housing crisis and that this is one of the single most important bills to come to this floor in this Congress. And yet here we are, as the minority, not being allowed any amendments, not being allowed a substitute, not being allowed a motion to recommit, not even being allowed to have an up-or-down vote on the bill. And we're accused of an abusive process? 
   But enough of that. 
   Let's look at the substance of this. There is a great challenge in our housing markets. There is no doubt about it. And there are innocent people who have suffered, and they deserve to be helped. But this is the wrong plan. 
   What we need to do, Mr. Speaker, is, number one, we have to have better disclosure so that people understand the economic obligations they're undertaking. We need to enforce the laws that we have on the books. Mortgage fraud has been rampant on both the borrowers' side and on the lenders' side. 
   We need to prevent the automatic tax increase that has been included in the majority's budget that's going to impose a $3,000-a-year on the average American family tax increase phased in over the next 3 years. We need to do something about the skyrocketing cost of gasoline and food that has occurred on the watch of the majority. They've been in charge of the economic policies of this country for almost 18 months. 
   The shrinking American paycheck is our challenge. A huge bailout of Wall Street and borrowers, some who may be innocent victims and some who may be guilty, is not the answer, and using taxpayers' money to do it is simply an insult. 
   Number one, we ought to have the facts before we actually take on a major piece of legislation. The American people need to know. Over half of America rents their homes or owns their home outright. Of those who have an active mortgage, 95 percent are making their mortgage payments on time. You have roughly 2 percent who are in foreclosure. So now we're being asked essentially for 98 percent of America to bail out 2 percent of America. 
   Now listen. On the investors' side, these are a big bunch of boys and girls on Wall Street who made decisions about what they should invest in. We know from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network that mortgage fraud has been rampant: 1,400 percent increase over the last 6 years; 42 percent increase last year alone, with the majority of the fraud being borrowers who lied about their income, about their assets, about their occupancy; and yet we have a bill to help them out. 
   Let's hear from some of the people who are being called upon to do the bailout. I often ask people who reside in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas that I have the honor of representing what they think about legislation coming to the House floor. And I hear from people like the Sadler family in Mesquite, Texas, and they write: 
   ``Congressman, 3 years ago my husband and I faced the loss of our home due to a decrease in the sales income. We cut our expenses as much as possible, but it was simply no longer affordable. We made the decision to put the home on the market before we faced foreclosure. 
   ``I am adamantly opposed to my tax dollars going toward bailing anyone out of a mortgage crisis. If we didn't have to give up so much of our income to the government for taxes, we could have continued to afford our home.'' 
   And what is the answer of the Democrat majority? Well, to the Sadler family in Mesquite, we're going to increase your taxes an extra $3,000 a year. 
   Mr. Speaker, I heard from Sergeant First Class Kenneth Adams of Frankston, Texas. He writes: 
   ``Congressman, the mortgage crisis Congress is trying to fix is an insult. My house went unpainted until I could return from serving in Iraq. I'm a Sergeant First Class in the United States  Army with over 20 years active and reserve service. Some day I would like to use my VA house-buying benefits, but what a fool I was to earn those type of benefits when all I had to do was be irresponsible, overspend, and have the government bail me out.''     
   That's the answer that the Democrat majority brings to the floor, and it is an insult to 98 percent of Americans who did it right. 
   Mr. Speaker, we should reject this legislation.

   As the distinguished majority leader said, this is about people hurting. He should know. Since his Democrat majority came into office almost 18 months ago, we know that we have a $3,000 per family tax increase that has been approved, gasoline at almost $4 a gallon, milk over $4 a gallon. Yes. This is about people hurting, particularly the 98 percent that rent, that have paid off their mortgages and whose mortgages are current. 
   And if this bill is only going to cost the taxpayers $2.7 billion, why do we see $300 billion written in the bill? 
   With that, I am happy to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona, JEFF FLAKE.

   I think we've certainly heard much about the process and procedures that will take place under this anticipated agreement, but I think it's very important to note for the entirety of the body, and particularly for those of us who have spent a lot of time on the floor since this debate ensued, that with this agreement what we will see going forward after these first two bills is that we will see earmarks in the bills. We will see transparency. We will see the ability of Members to be able to strike at those earmarks. That is what I believe I have heard this evening. That is what much of this debate has been about, lo these many hours. I, for one, believe that to be a good thing. 
   I believe I heard that there is hopefully an expectation of open rules. I understand the majority leader's caveat. I understand there is an anticipation of UCs, as historic norms dictate. I understand there is an anticipation that substantive amendments will be accommodated. I understand that substantive amendments may be in the eye of the beholder and men and women of good faith must work together, and I understand there is an anticipation that if bills are of historic norms, that debate time may be of historic norms as well. 
   But I did want to signal that, if I have the proper understanding, that I wanted to thank the majority leader, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and the Republican leader for their efforts to bring the ability of Members to be able to see these earmarks and challenge these earmarks. I assume that, as I have spoken, if any of the gentlemen involved believe that my understanding is incorrect, I would be happy to yield time to them. 
   Seeing no one believing my understanding is incorrect, again, I want to thank them for bringing us to this point, and I withdraw my objection, Madam Speaker.

   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Rarely do I rise with such trepidation as I do tonight in trying to follow the powerful eloquence of my dear friend and colleague from Arizona (Mr. Franks). I want to thank him for the passion and clarity that he brings to this body. And, again, my own voice is so meager compared to his, Mr. Speaker, but I do want to come tonight and really celebrate a great victory for life in America. 
   I want to thank my other colleagues with the Republican Study Committee who have come here tonight to participate in this 1-hour Special Order, Mr. Speaker. And for those who may be viewing the proceedings, Mr. Speaker, as we all know here, the Republican Study Committee is the conservative caucus in the House of Representatives, over 100 strong, promoting the values of faith and family and free enterprise and freedom that we consider to be the cornerstones of this great experiment in democracy and liberty that we call America. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, we always invite the American people to dialogue with us at the Republican Study Committee and our Web site at www.house.gov/Hensarling/rsc. 
   I really didn't know I would be coming here tonight, and so I have no prepared text whatsoever. It has been an emotional roller coaster of a week. I had a tele-town-hall meeting and got to speak to literally thousands of people from the Fifth Congressional District last evening. It started off talking about the tragedy at Virginia Tech, and I approached that discussion with my constituents not as a Member of Congress, but as a father. 
   I am privileged to be the father of a 5-year-old daughter and a 3-year-old son. And I can only imagine the pain that the families must be going through. And as I see all the reports on television of the promising lives that have been snuffed out in this evil, cruel act, I know that now is a time for comforting those who lost loved ones, it is a time to pray, it is a time to learn. 
   But as the Nation reflects on those 30-some-odd lives that are lost, maybe today is the day to reflect upon the millions of lives that are lost in America through abortion. And I am not naive; I know this is one of the most contentious issues debated in our society. But what right is more fundamental than the right to life? 
   I wish I knew how to talk to those who somehow didn't see life the way that we do or value life the way that we do. In my heart, in my head, I can come to no other conclusion but that life begins at conception, that life is a gift of our Creator, who endows us with this inalienable right to life. I don't understand how my countrymen come to other conclusions. I don't hate them, I don't disparage them, I don't yell at them, but I don't understand how they can come to different conclusions. It is something that I take as a  matter of faith. And if I didn't take it as a matter of faith, I don't know how any parent could ever look at that sonogram, that modern technology we have and see their tiny little baby just weeks old with their head and their arms and their fingers and their feet sometimes moving around in their mother's tummy. How can you conclude anything else but that this is human life? I don't understand that. 
   And so I really come here to celebrate a great victory in the Supreme Court today that affirms what was already said by an overwhelming vote in the United States Congress, that this terribly abhorrent act known as partial-birth abortion, that Congress has the right to outlaw that. And, Mr. Speaker, we could go into all the gruesome details about how this child is just seconds away from getting their first breath of life and how, instead, the instrument of death is plunged into them. I don't think we need to go into that graphic detail. 
   But regardless of how you feel on the pro-life debate or the pro-abortion debate, how anybody could conclude that a child that is just moments away from taking their first breath should have that life snuffed out in the land of the free is beyond me. 
   And so I am happy to come here with my other colleagues from the Republican Study Committee. And again, I come here with great trepidation. Anytime I go to the floor with my dear colleague from Arizona, I serve with many great individuals in this body, Mr. Speaker, but I cannot think of one who has a purer heart than the gentleman from Arizona. And so again, my own voice is quite meager to his. 
   But as I think about my own 5-year-old daughter, Claire, and my own 3-year-old son, Travis, and I remember getting the telephone call from my wife to let me know that they were there, that life existed in her that we created, and to think that somehow in this land of the free, where our Creator has given us this gift of life, that those precious lives could have ever, ever come to an end in this gruesome procedure known as partial-birth abortion is just so abhorrent, my mind can't even go there. 
   And so I celebrate tonight with millions across America. And I certainly celebrate with all the members of the conservative caucus in Congress, the Republican Study Committee, that as many setbacks as we have in America, as we read about great tragedies, today something great happened in America, and the right to life was affirmed.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (SHAREHOLDER VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   I rise in support of this amendment. I rise to support it because I think it would make a bad bill less bad. 
   As I look at the underlying bill, I am reminded of a couple of things that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do well. One is mandate, and the other is class warfare. 
   Now, what we are debating here tonight on the underlying bill is a mandate, a mandate for a voluntary shareholder, non binding referendum on executive compensation. 
   I have listened to the debate today very carefully, and it seems to strike me that if there was ever a case of a remedy in search of a problem, this very well may be it. I have heard many of my colleagues come to the well and speak about outrageous and unreasonable executive compensation. I suspect  that unreasonable and outrageous are to be found in the eyes of the beholder. A CEO that rescues a troubled company, creates thousands of jobs, increases shareholder value by 80 percent so that folks can help send their kids to colleges, maybe help a parent with long term health care, my guess is that if that person made a gazillion dollars he was probably underpaid. A CEO who runs a company into the ground, who loses 80 percent of shareholder value, maybe he isn't worth 50 cents. 
   But the question ought to be, what is the state of corporate governance in America, and the shareholders, do they have say so? They have the most important decision that they can make. Mr. Chairman, they don't have to buy the shares in the first place. And we know that the SEC has just engaged in creating even greater and more disclosure. So if shareholders have the opportunity not to purchase this stock in the first place, I don't understand, and if we have disclosure where it should be, why we are trying to mandate a voluntary, non binding referendum on executive compensation. I don't quite understand. Clearly, in America, you still have a right not to buy a stock. 
   Now, I have heard a lot about what I would characterize as the typical class warfare that we hear from our friends on the other side of the aisle. And it reminds me, sometimes, that one of the accepted forms, really in some respects of bigotry in this society is bigotry against those who are successful. And so we come and we see charts about this disparity in pay. But, you know, Mr. Chairman, the outrage seems to be kind of selective. Where is the outrage of the hundreds of millions of dollars made by personal injury, trial attorneys and tobacco attorneys, and their legal secretaries maybe make $30,000? Where is the outrage there? Where is the outrage at Hollywood actors and actresses making tens of millions of dollars, and the guy moving the set around, maybe he is making $20,000? 
   I recently learned that Julia Roberts made $25 million for the film Mona Lisa. It cost $65 million to make, but only earned $64 million at the U.S. box office. I don't know for a fact a public company had to pay that salary, but I suspect they did. Now, where is the moral outrage there? 
   And, in addition, where is the proposal for the mandatory, voluntary non binding referendum on the compensation that may be paid to one of these individuals? 
   I mean, what comes next? Are we going to have the mandate for the non binding shareholder referendum on the amount of R&D expenditures that a company makes? Perhaps their marketing budget, Mr. Chairman? Maybe their choice of an auditor? I mean, why do we stop here at executive compensation? 
   And let me speak momentarily about the mandate. My guess is that to any individual company, this mandate may not be too costly. And I was very happy to have, in the last Congress, the chairman's support on a piece of legislation that I worked on that provided regulatory relief for our financial institutions. 
   And it is not one particular item. And every single mandate may sound pretty good, looking at it singularly, but collectively they are all adding costs to these companies, and you have to ask yourself, is it serving a good purpose? Because if it isn't, what is helping send jobs overseas is too much regulation, litigation and taxation and we need to support the amendment and vote down the bill.

I question what does the Federal Government know about economic development to begin with. I am going to support the gentleman from Arizona's amendment, but I did want to say something about the gentleman from North Carolina. But for his leadership in coming to the floor to fight for transparency and accountability, he wouldn't have to be here today defending the earmark, and I wanted to congratulate the gentleman for being willing to submit his earmark to this process. Now, I don't think his earmark meets the taxpayer test of efficiency or accountability, but I did want to applaud his leadership in improving the process and bringing transparency and accountability to the floor.

   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank him for his leadership. 
   Mr. Chairman, there is no greater guarantor of our democracy and our freedoms than the first amendment. There is no greater threat to our first amendment, freedom of speech, than the resurrection of the so-called Fairness Doctrine. The use of the term ``fairness doctrine'' would make George Orwell blush. The use of the program would make Hugo Chavez jealous. 
   Fairness, fairness particularly, as defined and policed by government, is the absolute antithesis of freedom. 
   It is patently unfair, and there was a time in our Nation's history when liberals proudly spoke out and jealously guarded our first amendment rights, and now, as we have heard from others, they seek to shut it down. 
   If, in doubt, colleagues err on the side of freedom.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Again, I want to thank him for his leadership on this House floor in attempting to bring fiscal sanity in a place that desperately needs it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I listened very carefully to the gentleman from New York and his comments, and I certainly appreciate the wit that he brings to this debate. Perhaps with the exception of him, I am somewhat curious from time to time why so many Members on this side of the aisle appear to be so grumpy, since they did win the last election. 
   The gentleman said that early on that he wasn't sure if we cared. We certainly care about the gentleman from New York. We just care even more about hard-working taxpayers in our districts. 
   He talks about the devastating cut that an amendment to level-fund this bill would be to the government. A devastating cut, when you are giving them exactly the same amount of money this year that you gave them last year. Webster must be spinning in his grave. I have actually looked up the definition of ``cut'' and it means ``to reduce.'' So for level-funding this bill, I fail to see this thing called a cut. 
   What I do know is being cut is the family budget, because, as the gentleman from Ohio has aptly pointed out, there is all of this spending, a 9.9 percent increase, and somehow it is devastating, devastating, anything less than a 9.9 percent increase in this agency. 
   Well, how about the $3,000 a year largest tax increase in history that this is part of? This spending, this 9.9 percent increase is being funded with this largest tax increase in history. 
   That is where the devastating cut is coming, Mr. Chairman, in the family budgets of American families all across the Nation. And that is what we are trying to prevent, and that is what we care about, and it is indeed a very serious subject.

   But there are many of us on this side of the aisle who think that the best housing project, the best educational project, the best health care project is a job, and that is what the Republican budget helps create.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Chairman, I think it's very important that we focus on exactly what the question is before us. The question before us, with the amendment from the gentleman from Georgia, is will we grow the Financial Services appropriations by 9.9 percent or will we grow it by 8.9 percent? So when you hear the discussion of the devastating cuts and what this will do to all these fundamental government programs, how many families in America would love to have a cut that resulted in an 8.9 percent increase in their family income? 
   Even more fundamental, Mr. Chairman, this amendment will set us on two paths. One path, if we reject this amendment, leads to the largest tax increase in American history, $3,000 per American family. The other path will lead us to a balanced budget, the Republican budget, without raising taxes on hardworking American people. 
   Let's support and approve the amendment from the gentleman from Georgia. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, it is clear, the Democrat majority will soon ram through this Congress the single largest step in Washington-controlled, bureaucratized, rationed, socialized health care. And they are going to do it all under the guise of helping the neediest of our children. But by passing this bill, they are threatening the quality, the access and the choice of health care for all children in America. It is a sad day indeed for our children's physical health. It is a sad day for their fiscal health. 
   We all know, Mr. Speaker, that Medicaid is the program for the neediest of our children, and we know that SCHIP today is providing for the health care of those low-income working parents. 
   This is about something else. This is about taking adults off of private health care and putting them on public health care. It is about creating a new permanent entitlement, no matter what the majority may say. There will be no income limit on SCHIP eligibility, no sunset of the program, no annual allotment for the States. It shifts children participating in private insurance that their parents have chosen to that run by the government. 
   In creating a new entitlement, we are on the verge of leaving the next generation with a lower standard of living. Defeat this program.

Mr. Speaker, today the Democrat majority in Congress will no doubt ram through a bill representing the single largest step in Washington-controlled, bureaucratized, rationed, socialized health care, and they will do this under the guise of insuring needy children who are already insured under Medicaid or are already insured under the SCHIP program, which we could reauthorize. And they do this by turning SCHIP into a new entitlement, threatening to bankrupt the very children they claim to be helping. They do this by cutting Medicare, hastening the bankruptcy of the Medicare trust fund. They do this by cutting Medicare Advantage plan, threatening the health care choices of millions of our seniors. They do this by increasing taxes on working Americans. 
   This is a threat to our children's fiscal health, it is a threat to our Nation's and children's physical health. It should be rejected.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding, and I thank him for his leadership on this bill. 
   I also wish to thank our chairman who, although I have deep philosophical differences with, was certainly fair in his deliberations and more than fair in the amendments that he has allowed here this evening. 
   Indeed, I think that the conflict today comes down to the so-called Affordable Housing Fund. Many on this side of the aisle do not feel that in this bill, which is supposed to provide a strong regulator for Fannie and Freddie, that we need to be expanding big government. 
   And regardless of the rhetoric on the other side, according to OMB, Federal housing assistance has grown 73.8 percent in the last 10 years. Yet, this bill creates another new housing program on top of the 90 other HUD programs ostensibly designed to make housing more affordable. 
   Meanwhile, the Democrat majority earlier this afternoon made housing less affordable by imposing the single largest tax increase in American history on the American people, threatening the home ownership of millions. 
   Next, this fund is supposed to be transferred to some shadowy, amorphous, ill-defined housing trust fund, which to many of us appears nothing less than a new entitlement spending program for the 21st century. This is on top of the entitlement spending that threatens to bankrupt the next generation, will force them to double their taxes, will shatter their dreams of home ownership, and yet we appear to be adding yet another entitlement spending program. 
   Next, the fund represents a dangerous precedent and another surreptitious tax increase. On top of the single largest tax increase in American history, now our friends from the other side of the aisle are going to impose a home mortgage tax on the American people, using the Federal nexus to levy a special tax on Fannie and Freddie, which due to their duopoly status in the marketplace they can effectively pass on to home buyers in the way of higher mortgage interest so that this can be conduited into third party groups. 
   This bill ignores the greatest affordable housing program known in this country, a good job and a low tax rate. The bill imposes new mortgage taxes on Americans and must be rejected.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I tried to listen carefully to my friend from Georgia, his comments. I am not going to follow with the juice analogy and I don't care to put words in his mouth, but what I think I heard was he described the gentleman from New Jersey's amendment as perhaps the worst one that had been offered this evening, that would essentially gut the ability of Fannie and Freddie to achieve their affordable housing mission, or to achieve the mission that Congress has set up for them, and the gentleman is certainly entitled to his own opinion. 
   But when it comes to the use of the portfolio holdings of Fannie and Freddie, which we know, number one, according to the last two, the present and the past Chairmen of the Federal Reserve, creates huge systemic risk to our economy, which ultimately can bring down housing opportunities for all. 
   But if I could quote from a speech from Chairman Greenspan, who said, ``The Federal Reserve Board has been unable to find any credible purpose for the huge balance sheets built by Fannie and Freddie other than the creation of profit through the exploitation of the market-granted subsidy.'' 
   To paraphrase, ``Their purchase of their own or each other's mortgage-backed securities with their market-subsidized debt do not contribute usefully to the mortgage market liquidity, to the enhancement of capital markets in the United States, or to the lowering of mortgage rates for the homeowners.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, I would be happy to yield to the gentleman from Georgia.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I am sure the gentleman from Georgia can get plenty of time from his side. All I am saying is the gentleman from Georgia is entitled to his own opinion, former Chairman Greenspan seems to have a different opinion of the use of the portfolio holdings in the housing mission. So in this particular case, I prefer to take the word of Chairman Greenspan and of Chairman Bernanke as opposed to my colleague from Georgia's expertise on the matter. 
   These portfolios have nothing, nothing to do with their mission and have everything, everything to do with systemic risk. And if we are going to leave them in place, they ought to at least be dedicated, somehow dedicated, to low income housing purposes, which ostensibly is what the purposes of Fannie and Freddie were in the first place. 
   Again, these are not operating, the GSEs are not operating in a competitive marketplace. They are operating in a government-sanctioned duopoly to where they have 80 percent of the market. There is not effective competition, there is not a check here, and we should approve the gentleman's amendment from New Jersey.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, the purpose of this amendment is quite simple, and that is to keep the status quo with respect to the conforming loan limits. The underlying bill would raise it to 150 percent in what are known as certain high-cost areas. I think there are several reasons, Mr. Chairman, why I think the underlying bill contains misguided policy. 
   Number 1, when you look at why were the GSEs chartered in the first place, they receive a panoply of Federal benefits that we are all familiar with. But supposedly, they received these benefits from the Federal Government for a specific purpose, to support the purchases of mortgages made to low- and moderate-income families, mortgages on properties located in underserved areas, mortgages made to very low-income families and low-income families in low-income areas. 
   I do not believe that the charter was to help subsidize housing by the government for the wealthiest in our society. That's not why they were chartered. The Conforming Loan Limit right now, I believe, is already too high. To qualify for the $417,000 mortgage right now, a family would have to earn at least $130,000, more than twice the median family income in this country, not by the standards of the Nation, a low or moderate income. 
   But in the House bill to increase the conforming loan limit by 50 percent to $625,000 in any area where the average home price is over the limit, to qualify for that mortgage, a family's income on an 80/20 LTV would have to be $180,000, almost three times the national median, and that ranks at roughly the top 5 percent of all family incomes in America. 
   According to OFHEO, the regulator, of the GSEs, using data supplied by the National Association of Realtors in 2007, there were only seven areas that would be affected by this, and that would be comprised of areas in about eight or nine different States, which means that 40 to 42 other States would gain nothing by this and arguably might lose something. 
   The other argument that I would pose is that after all the behavior of the GSEs, all of the misrepresentations to the public, misrepresentations to investors, misrepresentations to Congress, billions and billions of dollars of accounting misstatements, earnings being manipulated so that executives could receive bonuses, what does Congress do? We reward them. We expand their market share. We give them an opportunity to make even greater profits. 
   I mean, it leads one to believe that if Enron had been clever enough to change their name to the Enron Housing Corp. we might have done something to still keep them in business. We are expanding their market share. 
   Another point to make is that, and I will grant that any time you have a Federal subsidy, certainly you can lower the price, but the arguments that somehow people can't get in a home without increasing the loan limits to 150 percent, I don't understand. 
   The industry experts have estimated the rate on the spread on the rate to be about 20 basis points, and a current 30-year rate fixed mortgage, that amounts to about $80-a-month difference we are talking about. At least under one scenario, CRS, we are looking at about $28 a month. I am having a hard time believing that knowing how competitive the marketplace is, in almost all communities in the jumbo market area, that this is somehow preventing people from getting into a home. 
   Now, some will speak to a disparity, and I agree. There is the disparity, but I don't think raising the conforming loan limits to 150 percent in only a limited number of areas in the Nation is the solution to that particular challenge. 
   So I have great reservations about expanding the conforming loan limits. But having said that, given the lateness of the hour, given the outcome of this particular amendment in committee, I do think these were important points to be made. 
   But at this point, Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn. 
   There was no objection.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, the first thing I'd like to do is really thank the chairman of the full committee. There are many on this side of the aisle who talk a lot about making this the most open and democratic and fair Congress. Many of their deeds do not match their words. But I want to congratulate the committee chairman for this open process this evening and  his commitment to the institution, his commitment to democracy and permitting these amendments to be offered. And although I have two remaining, Mr. Chairman, I have decided to only offer one. The amendment I offer at this moment, No. 30, achieves one very simple purpose. 
   I understand that our side has lost on the creation of the so-called affordable housing fund, but in the underlying legislation, there is a place holder for something called an affordable housing trust fund. And apparently, if this fund, which is rather ill-defined, is created at some later time, the bill would authorize funds to be transferred from the affordable housing fund to the housing trust fund. I've been pretty diligent in my attendance of our subcommittee and committee hearings. I don't recall a hearing on the housing trust fund. I don't remember a markup on the housing trust fund. And I don't know exactly what the housing trust fund is, but I'm nervous about it. I'm nervous about it because when I look at almost every other government trust fund, what I see is an entitlement. Entitlement spending, Mr. Chairman. And the last thing we need to do is to be authorizing spending for a yet to be created entitlement spending fund. 
   The number one fiscal challenge in the Nation is to reform entitlement spending. And I believe the Chairman's passion about wanting to create affordable housing. I have profound philosophical differences with our chairman, but I don't doubt his passion. I don't doubt his sincerity. 
   But I have my passion. I have my passion. And right now, according to the Office of Management and Budget, the Congressional Budget Office, the Federal Reserve chairman, we are on the road to bankrupt the next generation. Ask anybody who has looked at the long-term spending patterns of entitlement spending in America today and they're going to tell you, we're facing a fiscal fork in the road. In one generation, in one generation, either there will be almost no Federal Government except for Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, there will be no HUD. None of these housing programs will exist. And the other fork in the road, Mr. Chairman, is that we're going to have to double taxes, on the next generation just to balance the budget. Don't take my word for it. Go to the Web site of OMB, GAO, CBO. They're all going to tell you the same thing.     
   And yet here we are tonight deciding that we are going to transfer funds to this yet-to-be-created housing trust fund, create yet another entitlement spending. 
   I am a Member of Congress, but let me tell you something else. I also happen to be a father of a 5-year-old daughter and a 3-year-old son who are already looking at paying for unfunded obligations in this entitlement spending of $50 trillion and now we are going to add to it. And I have heard many speakers on this side of the aisle eloquently speak about the least of these among us. Well, I maintain the least of these among us are those who cannot vote and those who are yet to be born. So I don't particularly care to take it on trust or faith that I am not somehow enabling the next new entitlement to hopefully hasten the bankruptcy of next generation. 
   The Comptroller General of America has said we are on the verge of being the very first generation in America's history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living. I myself will not sit idly by and allow that to happen. 
   So perhaps the chairman has a good idea of what he intends to with the housing trust fund. I do not and I will not create another entitlement program.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   And, again, I guess the chairman has a whole lot more confidence on the attributes of an ill-defined housing trust fund than I do. I have read earlier comments that the chairman has made: ``The placeholder would similarly preserve from this bill to the next bill our ability to spend money on a housing trust fund.'' And I know that the chairman, I believe in the same markup of March 28, in responding to a question: ``Would the gentleman be willing to accept an amendment that explicitly states that it would be subject to PAYGO?'' the chairman replied, ``No.'' 
   So knowing that PAYGO, as the Democratic side has defined it, applies to new entitlement spending and to tax relief, it makes one a little bit suspicious thinking maybe there could be a new entitlement here. The housing trust fund does not appear to be defined; so maybe it is an entitlement; maybe it is not an entitlement. But if it is defined, I don't know. I just happen to be very passionate about not wanting to be part of an effort that might ultimately lead to helping create a new entitlement program and exacerbate the number one fiscal challenge in America. But I don't know how the chairman can say with such great definition if we are going to potentially create a funding stream for a housing trust fund, we don't define it, that he knows absolutely it will not or ever have the attributes of an entitlement. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and when my friends from the other side of the aisle do something that I think is laudatory, I want to laud them for it. 
   They have taken a budget that contained the single largest tax increase in American history and turned it into a budget that has the second largest tax increase in American history, but before I get too effusive with my praise, they have something in there called a trigger which tells the American people that somehow, if you can prevent us from spending all of your money, maybe, maybe you can get a little of it back. So I suspect, Mr. Speaker, we are again looking at the single largest tax increase in American history. 
   Now, speaker after speaker on the other side get up and tell us, oh, we're balancing the budget, we're increasing spending that they call investments, but no, no, no, we're not raising taxes. Mr. Speaker, this is Orwellian double-speak. The numbers don't add up. I have got a 5-year-old daughter who can perform better math than that, and she's not very good at it. You can't balance the budget, increase spending and then claim you're not raising taxes. It's shameful. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is an easy conclusion that the Americans should draw. If they believe that the growth of the Federal budget is more important than the growth of their family budget, they should support this Democrat budget. And if they can sleep well at night knowing that this budget is going to double the taxes of their children and grandchildren, they should embrace that budget. But if they want freedom and opportunity for the next generation, reject this budget.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I heard the gentleman from Georgia earlier read some correspondence from a bishop. I don't have any correspondence from a bishop this evening, but I do have some correspondence from some hard working families in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas talking about what we could do to make their housing affordable. And I think it's particularly important when we think about my friends from the other side of the aisle earlier today, literally just a couple of hours ago, passing the single largest tax increase in American history that will amount to roughly $2,700 a year on the families in the Fifth District of Texas. 
   I heard from the Freeman family in Mesquite, and they wrote me, that ``With the extra $2,700 being forced to pay to Washington, my family could lose our home, or we may be forced to give up education because the money won't be there to pay for it. It is really unfair that the low man on the totem pole is always having to give everything up. These extra taxes are not needed.'' 
   Well, one way we can make housing affordable is not tax people with homes in the first place. 
   I heard from the Kirkendoll family in Garland, Texas. ``Dear Congressman Hensarling, I am unemployed on Social Security and my wife works. At this point, between taxes and utilities, we're at the breaking point of being able to keep a home.'' 
   You know, one of the greatest ways that a home is affordable is you don't take money away from the family in the first place. And so, besides the single largest tax increase in American history that the Democrat majority passed earlier today, now they want to pass on a mortgage tax on hard working families struggling to make ends meet as well. 
   I heard from the Stevens family in Mesquite, Texas. ``Congressman Hensarling, I wanted to let you know that I'm a single mom that does not receive any type of child support, and a tax increase of this amount would break me. I would be at risk of losing my home with this type of increase. I'm writing to ask your help to keep this from happening. This will be devastating to middle income families and families in my situation.''  
   Mr. Chairman, I have many more letters like this. And so we've heard so much rhetoric from our friends on the other side of the aisle that somehow we don't care about affordable housing. The greatest affordable housing program in the history of this Nation is a good job and a low tax rate. And yet, with the single largest tax increase in American history passed by the majority earlier today, they threaten the almost 8 million new jobs empowering people to buy homes. You take the tax relief away. You increase taxes on capital dividends, capital gains, you start taking those jobs away. 
   And then you pass on this roughly $2,700 a year on hard working families all over America, you've got a double whammy. You start taking their jobs away, and then you start taking their ability to pay for these mortgages. 
   I listened very closely to the chairman of the committee earlier when he accused the gentleman of New Jersey from, I guess, subscribing to naive economics. I will admit, it's been a number of years ago, but I actually studied economics. I have a degree in economics. I spent 10 years in private business. And what I know about economics is that when you have a government sanctioned duopoly, as opposed to an atomistic competitive marketplace, they have a great ability to pass on costs to their customers, in this case, ultimately, the homeowner. 
   So I guess the gentleman, our chairman, has studied a different economics than I do. And I did listen when the chairman said that it's the shareholders that will pay. So I'm offering an amendment later this evening that says this so-called affordable housing fund will go away if the regulator determines that interest rates go up. And since the chairman believes that only shareholders will pay, I look forward to him accepting that amendment.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I actually had alluded to this. I hope that the chairman was able to listen at the time. This goes further into the discussion of the mortgage tax that those of us on this side of the aisle believe is being imposed upon the American people by this so-called Affordable Housing Fund. 
   Earlier this evening the chairman said that he believes that this will be paid by the shareholders. We believe on this side of the aisle that, due to the duopoly power, the Fannie and Freddie, that they already control roughly 80 percent of the market in which they operate, that a substantial portion of the cost of the so-called Affordable Housing Fund will, indeed, be imposed upon homeowners in the form of higher mortgages, indeed, functionally a mortgage tax, a new mortgage tax on the American people. 
   I was heartened to hear, although I disagree with his economic analysis, that the chairman has concluded that this will be paid by the shareholders. 
   My amendment is fairly simple. It amends the section dealing with having the regulator suspend the program. Now, we know that within the language the program can be suspended, essentially, dealing with systemic risk of the economy. What my amendment does is, if the regulator finds out that, contrary to the chairman's opinion, that there is a mortgage tax, that indeed it has an adverse impact upon the cost of housing in America, that mortgages rise, that the program will be terminated. 
   So, again, I hope I understood the chairman correctly when he said that he thought this cost would go to shareholders. If he does, I would hope that he would accept the amendment. And if the chairman chooses not to accept the amendment, and I am sure the gentleman will let us know soon, then I guess what we are admitting is that, indeed, there is a mortgage tax to be imposed on hardworking homeowners, some of which we heard from earlier this evening from the Fifth District of Texas, and we know how an additional tax is going to adversely impact them in the ability to keep their homes. 
   So I hope the chairman is right that shareholders, as opposed to homeowners, end up paying this if we are going to be stuck with this particular program. 
   So this is a very simple amendment that says if we have a mortgage tax, the program is suspended. If we are confident there is no mortgage tax, then there shouldn't be any opposition to this particular legislation. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, I request an ``aye'' vote.

   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I was going to ask the chairman for a clarification. What I heard earlier in the evening is that shareholders will pay the cost of the Affordable Housing Fund. And what I think I'm hearing now is that the shareholders will pay substantially most of the housing fund, which leaves some portion paid by somebody else. 
   So I am asking the chairman, in his opinion, if it is no longer being paid totally by the shareholders, doesn't that mean that some portion is indeed being paid by the homeowner? Thus, we can debate the quantity of the mortgage tax that will be imposed upon the homeowner. But it seems to me if we've gone from total shareholder payment to substantial shareholder payment, there is a mortgage tax. And I might request the gentleman from Georgia to yield to the chairman for clarification.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I wish to associate myself with the comments of the gentleman from Louisiana. I, too, wish to raise my voice loud and clear on the issue, but certainly in a far less articulate manner than the gentleman from Louisiana who is well versed on this issue. 
   In my opinion, Mr. Chairman, the only thing worse than a regulated monopoly is an unregulated monopoly. I don't necessarily trust private companies. I trust competitive marketplaces, and wherever Fannie and Freddie goes, I feel the competitive marketplace leaves. 
   Since I have been on the committee 4 1/2 years now, we have heard frequently from our past Federal Reserve chairman and our present Federal Reserve chairman. Their voices could not be more clear on the matter that they believe the GSEs pose a very significant systemic risk to our economy. 
   Now in a competitive marketplace, you are punished for misleading accounting. In a competitive marketplace, you are punished for bad business decisions. In a competitive marketplace, you are certainly, certainly punished for fraud. We no longer have an Enron. We no longer have a WorldCom. We no longer have an Arthur Andersen. We no longer have a New Century. 
   A competitive marketplace, before they could lead to systemic risk, took care of those who may have engaged in faulty accounting, fraud, or poor business decisions. 
   But that is not the case with Fannie and Freddie. And now where we finally have empowered the regulator to do something, the first thing we do is clip his wings. I just feel on this matter, I am going to listen to Chairman Greenspan and I am going to listen to Chairman Bernanke, and I don't totally know the impact of the language of the people who offered the amendment, including my dear friend from Texas, completely, I don't know if I completely understand its impact, but what it seems to do, all of a sudden it seems to say well, the regulator can make sure that Fannie and Freddie can't harm themselves, but they can't make sure that they don't harm the rest of us. That is my interpretation of this amendment. 
   So again, if we are going to sanction a government, if we are going to create essentially a duopoly, and the last time I looked at the records controlled 80 percent of the market in which they operate, and as opposed to retrenching, they seem to prosper when they misstate their earnings, when they have billions and billions of misstated earnings, when they mislead the government and when they mislead their investors, when they couldn't produce audited financials in years, and, I believe, hold more debt than the publicly held debt of the Federal Government, I think we ought to err on the side of strengthening the regulator's ability to protect us by the systemic risk of what we, we in Congress, have created in the first place. 
   So I, too, wanted to raise my voice loud and clear on this issue. I certainly appreciate the chairman's willingness to work with the gentleman from Louisiana and others of us on the committee who are very concerned about the potential systemic risk posed by the activities of Fannie and Freddie. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Neugebauer). 
   The amendment was agreed to.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J. RES. 20, FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, rarely in the history of America has a Congress spent more money with less accountability than this Congress is doing today: $463 billion with 1, count it, 1 hour of accountability. One hour of general debate. Mr. Speaker, that is $7.7 billion per minute of the people's money that is being spent here today. Families all across America will spend more time deliberating over the purchase of a new dryer than we will spend in debating how we spend $463 billion of their hard-earned money. 
   Now, as the Democrats have taken over, Speaker Pelosi recently said, ``Democrats believe we must return to accountability by restoring fiscal discipline and eliminating deficit spending.'' 
   This is fiscal discipline? This is accountability? 
   Mr. Speaker, if this becomes law, everybody's share of the national debt will go up from roughly $28,860 to $30,399. 
   This is cutting out deficit spending? This is accountability? This is fiscal responsibility? 
   Real fiscal responsibility would have been for the Rules Committee to allow for the amendment from the gentleman from California (Mr. Campbell) to pass a true CR. That would have saved $6 billion. 
   We need to vote this rule down.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (OFFICIAL TRUTH SQUAD -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman, and I certainly appreciate his great work as a Member from Georgia. We particularly participate his participation in the Republican Study Committee, the conservative caucus within this caucus. 
   It has been a rather interesting day here on the House floor. I didn't know that it was possible, but apparently our Democrat colleagues created a new record in the House. Now, I am still doing my homework. Maybe they just came in second or third place. But if I did my homework correctly, never in the history of America has a Congress spent more money with less accountability than this Democrat Congress did today just a few hours ago, $463 billion spent in 1 hour, 1 hour of debate to spend $463 billion. 
   Now, I have been a Member of Congress for a while, but, ladies and gentlemen, that is still real money. That  is $7.7 billion per minute that this Democrat majority managed to spend. We just heard from the distinguished ranking member of the Armed Services Committee. Apparently, they didn't spend it very well. They seemed to have forgotten the war fighter and his quality of life when they were putting this massive spending bill together. 
   Now, earlier, as the Democrats took control of the institution, and elections have consequences, I understand that, they won fair and square, but Speaker Pelosi is on the record shortly after the election saying, quote, Democrats believe we must return to accountability by restoring fiscal discipline and eliminating, eliminating, deficit spending. Now this is the Democrat leader, the Speaker of the House, telling the American people that this was their intention. So now we spend $463 billion in 1 hour. 
   Mr. Speaker, families all across America will spend more time deliberating on the purchase of a washer and dryer than this institution did in spending $463 billion of their money, their hard-earned money. It is somewhat mind-boggling to spend that much money with such little accountability. 
   Now, let's talk about the Speaker telling the American people that she and the Democrats were going to eliminate deficit spending. 
   Well, as this bill passed earlier today, if the Senate takes it up, all of a sudden every American's share of the public debt has gone from $28,860 to $30,399. Now, I didn't major in math at Texas A&M University, but I can figure out, if you are trying to eliminate deficit spending, you are headed in the wrong direction, which makes me kind of question why you passed this bill in the first place. 
   Now, the American people were led to believe that this body was going to pass something called a continuing resolution. Now, I understand that is kind of inside baseball, but what it says is, you know, we are going to continue government at the same funding level. There are families all across America who face hardships who have to actually get by on less. A continuing resolution actually says, we are going to, frankly, grow government under the baseline, what we did last year. 
   Had this institution done it, which is what they led the American people to believe, we would have had a continuing resolution which, by the way, fits on a single piece of paper. Instead, we had a 150 page, I believe it was 150 pages, of what we call an omnibus, everything thrown into a massive spending bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Democrats told us, they led us to believe we were going to have this continuing resolution. We end up with this omnibus. They tell us we are going to eliminate deficit spending. Instead, they increased deficit spending. They tell us they are going to have accountability; and, instead, we spend 1 hour, 1 hour debating the expenditure of $463 billion. 
   Let me tell you what else they told us. They told us there would be no earmarks. You know, these are these little perks that Members of Congress take for their own district. Well, at last count, there was near 30 earmarks. Now, maybe they are good earmarks, maybe they are bad earmarks, but don't tell us there aren't going to be any earmarks in the bill and then put them there. 
   I mean, they are the poster children, too often. They are the poster children of fiscal irresponsibility. We have the golden oldie here. The rain forest in Iowa has made another appearance here. Now somebody earlier today said, well, that is a Republican earmark. Well, at least they acknowledge that earmarks were in the bill. 
   Last I looked, the Democrats have a majority in the House; they have a majority in the Senate. Obviously, it would not be in the bill unless Democrats wanted it in the bill. 
   We also had this institution pass a continuing resolution instead of this omnibus. Also, we would have saved $6.2 billion of American families' money. That is what would have happened had the Democrat majority done what they told the American people they were going to do. That is $6.2 billion that could have been applied to, again, quote, unquote, eliminating deficit spending. 
   So they had an opportunity to put their actions where their words were, and they didn't do it. They had extra money, and they spent it. 
   Again, as the gentleman from California illuminated, they didn't spend it very well. They certainly didn't consider the quality of life for the war fighter when they were putting together this omnibus. 
   Also, we were told there would not be any gimmicks. We would have accountability. Well, we look in here and there is gimmicks. There is $3.5 billion here. Now, this is inside baseball, I admit it, but I have served on the Budget Committee for 4 years, and I am starting to recognize these gimmicks. 
   But they put $3.5 billion here by rescinding contract authority for highway programs without decreasing what we call obligation limitations. Then, again, I know that is inside baseball. But let me tell you, what happens is there is no savings. They are claiming savings where there are none. 
   They also make a one-time change, a one-year change in what we call entitlement spending. Again, it is a trick. It is smoke and mirrors. It will not be there. 
   Where is the accountability? I am looking for it. Clearly, we need that magnifying glass of The Official Truth Squad, because nobody can find the vaunted Democrat accountability that we were told would be here. 
   There is a better way. We can have true fiscal accountability. 
   Another gentleman, a colleague of mine from California (Mr. Campbell), offered an amendment that would have given us that continuing resolution that would have saved us $6.2 billion that would have done what the Democrats told the American people they were going to do. But their Rules Committee said, no, we are not going to allow that one. That is kind of a dicey vote. That one was never allowed on the floor, the one that would actually use $6.2 billion to help reduce this deficit. 
   Another thing we can do is embrace the President's call for a balanced budget in 5 years without raising taxes. Now, that is true fiscal responsibility. I would hope that all Members of this Congress could sign up for that program. 
   Now, Democrats will tell us that all the tax relief that was passed on our watch is the source of every fiscal problem known to mankind. Well, as a member of the Budget Committee, we have now received testimony from the head of the GAO, the Government Accountability Office, we have received testimony from the head of the Congressional Budget Office. It is not what we hear from them.     
   What we hear, Mr. Speaker, is that until we do something to help reform entitlement spending and Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security and work on a bipartisan basis to get better retirement security, better health care at a lower cost, that is the fiscal challenge to America. 
   And, by the way, there is an inconvenient fact for our Democrat colleagues, and that inconvenient fact is we have cut marginal rates. We have cut capital gains. And guess what? We have more tax revenue than we have had in the entire history of America. If you allow the American people to keep more of what they earn, they will save it. They will invest it. They will go out and expand businesses. They will create small businesses. They will put out a new barbecue stand. They will do a new transmission repair shop. And now we have created over 7 million new jobs with a future. 
   Now, I know maybe their goal for America is 7 million new welfare checks. But the Republican goal for America was 7 million new paychecks. And under our watch, that is what we achieved. Seven million new paychecks and the greatest amount of tax revenue that we have had in the history of America. We are awash in tax revenue. That is why the deficit is coming down. 
   Now, I am not here to tell you that every time you design tax relief that it creates more tax revenue, but if you do it right, particularly if you put it on the side of helping working families and helping entrepreneurs to save and invest, it will more than pay for itself, and that is what has been done here. But now, Mr. Speaker, the Democrats want to take that tax relief away. They say it is bad. They want to take the 7 million jobs away. And what is really humorous is that they want to  take really the tax revenue away that this explosion of economic activity has created in the first place. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, there are many ways that we can embrace true fiscal responsibility. But to spend $463 billion of the people's money with no hearing, with almost no debate, in 1 hour, to set the land speed record for spending money in the shortest period of time, today the Democrats get the gold medal, the gold medal, in that Olympic competition. Never has more money been spent in less time than today. So how they expect to live up to Speaker Pelosi's goal of eliminating deficit spending, restoring fiscal discipline, and return to accountability, I suggest they enter a different Olympics and try to spend less money with more accountability, and that is something that the American people could truly respect.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I believe that this is a sad day for our institution, the House of Representatives, and I think it is a sad day because I sense this debate has very little to do with coming together as a Nation to face the greatest threat that we have faced since the Cold War. But instead I sense and I fear it has much to do with politics as usual.  
   I have heard speaker after speaker come to the floor to decry faulty intelligence, to decry how our Nation became involved in Iraq in the first place. I have heard speakers decry how the war had been conducted. But, Mr. Speaker, regardless of how we got into Iraq, regardless of whose war it might have been once, today it is an American war, and we must accept that fact. 
   As the people's elected Representatives, certainly we should look at this new strategy. We need to take an open and honest look at it. And certainly we are all disappointed that the previous strategy has not yielded the desired result. But, Mr. Speaker, very, very much hangs in the balance. 
   I myself do not know if the new strategy will work. I think it can work. I hope it will work. And I know it is at least a strategy that has been recommended by the Iraqi Study Group and our new battlefield commander, General Petraeus. So until such a time as somebody brings to me a more compelling strategy or until such a time that somebody convinces me that somehow the security of my country and the security of my family is somehow made better off by our immediate withdrawal and the subsequent implosion of Iraq, I feel we must support the new strategy. Defeat is not an option. 
   So what are the options, Mr. Speaker? Clearly many, if not most, of the Democrats call for withdrawal from Iraq, as do several of my very respected Republican colleagues. And I respect their views when they are heartfelt. But, Mr. Speaker, since Democrats now control both Houses of Congress, why are we not voting on a withdrawal resolution? And that is one of the reasons this is such a sad day. 
   I mean, think about it, Mr. Speaker. How do you look a soldier in the eye and say, You know, I don't believe you can succeed in Iraq. I don't believe in your mission. I don't believe you can win this war. And I have the power to bring you home, but I refuse to do it. I refuse to do it. Where is the courage in that resolution? Where is the conviction in that resolution? If you truly believe in your heart of hearts that our soldiers are needlessly risking their lives, don't you have a moral obligation to bring them home? So with lives hanging in the balance, with our national security hanging in the balance, we have a nonbinding politics-as-usual resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is not really all that easy to figure out exactly what it is that the Democrats support. But if they don't put forth their own strategy and yet they want to vote against the new strategy, that says one and only one thing. It says stay the course. It says status quo. If you don't have an alternative and you want to vote against this new strategy, then you are voting to stay the course. The stakes are too high to stay the course. 
   Now, we all know that fighting this war is very costly. And like many Members of this institution, I have met with the mothers of fallen soldiers. Their burden and sacrifice is solemn and profound. But I never, never, never want to meet with the mothers whose children may perish in the next 9/11 if we accept defeat in Iraq. Iraq must be seen in the larger context of this war with jihadism, with radical Islam. Whether we like it or not, the battle lines are drawn in Iraq. And don't take my word for it. Take the jihadists' word for it. Osama bin Laden has said, ``The epicenter of these wars is Baghdad. Success in Baghdad will be success for the United States. Failure in Iraq is the failure of the United States. Their defeat in Iraq will mean defeat in all their wars.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, we must soberly reflect on the challenge that we face. Listen to al Zawahiri, Osama bin Laden's number two in command: ``Al Qaeda has the right to kill 4 million Americans, 2 million of them children.'' Listen to Hassan Abbassi, Revolutionary Guard's intelligence adviser to the Iranian President: ``We have a strategy drawn up for the destruction of Anglo-Saxon civilization.'' Listen to Iraqi Ayatollah Ahmad Husseini: ``Even if this means using biological, chemical, and bacterial weapons, we will conquer the world.''     
   This is the enemy we face, Mr. Speaker, and we face him foremost in Iraq. 
   The consequences of failure in Iraq are immense, the beginning of a Sunni-Shiite genocidal clash as American troop convoys flee the country. The battle for Baghdad will undoubtedly spill over to the entire country. Shiites will most likely win. They will draw in Jordan and Saudi Arabia to the defense of Sunni Iraqis. Iran will rise to the defense of Shia Iraqis. An entire regional war could easily ensue, and what is left of Iraq would become a safe haven for the recruitment, training and financing of radical Islam.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (NATIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST FUND ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise today in favor of greater housing opportunities for working families. I also rise today against adding yet another new Federal Government housing program on top of the roughly 80-plus programs that HUD already administers, and I hold the list in my hand. And since it is called ``HUD,'' ostensibly, these programs have something to do with either affordable housing or urban development. 
   Mr. Chairman, what we have in front of us again is another classic liberal let's take money away from working families, send it to Washington, and then somehow throw a little bit back at the people. Throw money at the problem. 
   I might add, as the chairman brought out as a beneficial feature of this, that the money goes to the States. The last I looked, all but four or five are running a surplus. Unfortunately, there is still a deficit in the Nation's Capital. 
   Now, I appreciate the chairman's commitment to affordable housing. I agree with him, there is a need for greater affordable housing. He is very sincere in his passion, and I respect that. But I note that he and other Members on that side of the aisle, unfortunately, constantly vote against affordable housing. The greatest determinant in how affordable your housing is is a paycheck. It's a paycheck, Mr. Chairman. 
   And almost all the Democrats voted against the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Reconciliation Act of 2003, which created 8.2 million jobs and helped lead to one of the largest rates of homeownership in the entire history of our Nation. 
   The next biggest determinant in the affordability of housing is once you have that paycheck, how much of it does Uncle Sam take? What is your tax bite? Yet we know, Mr. Chairman, in the budget passed by the Democrat majority, it contains the single largest tax increase in history. We are talking about an average of $3,000 per year on every American family when it is imposed. 
   And I hear from some of these families. I hear from people like the Stephens family in Mesquite who wrote to me: ``Dear Congressman, I wanted to let you know that I am a single mom that does not receive any type of child support, and an increase of this amount,'' talking about the taxes, ``would break me. I would be at risk of losing my home with this type of tax increase.'' So much for making housing more affordable. 
   Also, many of our friends on the other side of the aisle do not support increased opportunities for trade. They want to put tariffs on the Canadian lumber or the Mexican concrete which leads to homes being less affordable. 
   Finally, there is the regulatory burden. Mr. Chairman, they almost all supported Davis-Bacon provisions which increases the cost of public housing by artificially raising wages. At almost every juncture, the Democrat majority is voting against affordable housing, and those are the facts. 
   So it really comes down to a choice: Do we want more opportunity housing or do we want more government housing? We should support opportunity.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, the amendment is a simple one. Earlier this year, in one of the occasionally non-energy energy bills that we see in the House, we had a section 526 added to something called the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. In part, this section of the bill says that no Federal agencies shall enter into a contract for procurement of an alternative fuel if the ``life cycle greenhouse gas emissions,'' a phrase that has yet to be legally defined, that they must be less or equal to such emissions from an equivalent conventional fuel produced from conventional petroleum sources. 
   Mr. Chairman, that is very problematic language to our Defense Department. It is very problematic language to our veterans. And in specific, the author of that provision, the distinguished gentleman from California, who is the Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, told us what his purpose was by putting this section into the bill. And I have in my hand, Mr. Chairman, correspondence dated March 17 from the distinguished gentleman from California to the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. 
   It reads, in part, ``It was developed,'' it, referring to section 526, ``it was included in the legislation in response to proposals under consideration by the Air Force to develop coal-to-liquid fuels.'' 
   That was the purpose of this section. And so, Mr. Chairman, what we have is a portion of a bill that makes it more difficult for our Defense Department to become more energy independent, to rely more on North American and specifically, American fuels than Middle Eastern fuels. This is very problematic for our Defense Department. 
   I also, Mr. Chairman, have in my hand correspondence dated July 9 from the Defense Department, written to the Honorable James Inhofe, ranking member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works. 
   In part, the letter reads, ``it,'' referring to 526, ``creates uncertainty about what fuels DOD can procure and will discourage the development of new sources, particularly reliable domestic sources of energy supplies for the Armed Forces.'' 
   This is the Pentagon, Mr. Chairman. 
   It also goes on to say, ``As written, section 526 could apply to alternative and synthetic fuels, including E85, fuel that is 85 percent ethanol, and B20, diesel fuel that contains 20 percent bio fuels, that the department is encouraged or required to use under other statutes.'' 
   The letter from the Pentagon continues to say, ``The provision opens the Department up to court or administrative challenges to every fuel purchase it makes.'' And this is a very important provision of this letter, Mr. Chairman. 
   ``It could cause significant harm to the readiness of the Armed Forces because these fuels may be widely used and particularly important in certain geographic areas.'' 
   Now, Mr. Chairman, we have got an opportunity in this legislation, and my amendment is a very simple one. It simply says that none of the funds provided in this act that we are debating tonight, shall be available to enforce section 526, this problematic language that the Pentagon says can have an adverse effect on the readiness of our Armed Forces. 
   So, I would hope, Mr. Chairman, that we would pay very careful attention when we are dealing with a bill dealing with our Army, our veterans, our Nation's veterans, with military construction. I would hope that we would pay very, very careful attention and do everything we can to get rid of this section of this law that is hampering our national defense at this time. 
   House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, 
   Washington, DC, March 17, 2008. Hon. Jeff Bingaman,  Chairman, Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC. 
   Dear Chairman Bingaman: I am writing regarding questions that have arisen with respect to the interpretation of section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Section 526 addresses government contracts to purchase alternative fuels. As the author of this provision and Chairman of the committee of jurisdiction in the House, I would like to share my views as to how the language should be interpreted. 
   Section 526 provides: 
   ``No Federal agency shall enter into a contract for procurement of an alternative or synthetic fuel, including a fuel produced from nonconventional petroleum sources, for any mobility-related use, other than for research or testing, unless the contract specifies that the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production and combustion of the fuel supplied under the contract must, on an ongoing basis, be less than or equal to such emissions from the equivalent conventional fuel produced from conventional petroleum sources.'' 
   This provision ensures that Federal agencies are not spending taxpayer dollars on new fuel sources that will exacerbate global warming. It was included in the legislation in response to proposals under consideration by the Air Force to develop coal-to-liquid fuels. As you may know, coal-to-liquid fuels are estimated to produce almost double the greenhouse gas emissions of the comparable conventional fuel. The provision is also applicable to fuels derived from tar sands, which produce significantly higher greenhouse gas emissions than are produced by comparable fuel from conventional petroleum sources.  
   The development and expanded use of these fuels could significantly exacerbate global warming, with highly dangerous effects. Thus, it is important to ensure that the Federal government does not subsidize or otherwise support the expanded use of these fuels through government purchasing decisions. 
   Section 526 applies specifically to contracts to purchase fuels, and it must be interpreted in a manner that makes sense in light of Federal contracting practices. The purpose of the provision is to bar federal agencies from spending taxpayer dollars to support the development and expansion of alternative fuels and fuels from unconventional sources, if those fuels have higher lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than the comparable conventional fuels. It was not intended to bar federal agencies from entering into contracts to purchase fuels that are generally available in the market, such as diesel or jet fuel, that may contain incidental amounts of fuel produced from nonconventional petroleum sources. 
   Thus, section 526 would clearly apply to a contract that specifically requires the contractor to provide an alternative fuel, such as coal-to-liquids fuel, or a fuel produced from a nonconventional petroleum source, such as fuel from tar sands. The provision also would apply to such a contract where the purpose of the contract is to obtain such an alternative fuel or fuel from a nonconventional petroleum source, even if the source of the fuel is not explicitly identified in the contract. Similarly, a contract that supports or provides incentives for a refinery upgrade or expansion to allow a refinery to use or increase its use of tar sands oils would also be subject to section 526. This provision would not apply to contracts to purchase a generally available fuel, such as a specific diesel or jet fuel blend, if that fuel is not an alternative fuel or predominantly produced from an unconventional fuel source. 
   Questions have also been raised as to whether the implementation of this provision must await the development of specific lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions profiles for each fuel type. The language of section 526 requires only a determination of whether a fuel has higher lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than the comparable conventional fuel, not a precise estimate of each fuel's specific greenhouse gas emissions. While there is a range of numeric estimates of the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of coal-to-liquids fuels produced without carbon capture and sequestration and fuels derived from tar sands, there is no debate over the fact that both of these fuels have substantially higher lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than the comparable conventional fuels. There is no barrier to the immediate implementation of section 526 with respect to these fuels. 
   I hope this clarification of my understanding of section 526 is helpful as your Committee oversees federal agencies' implementation of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. 
   Sincerely, 
   Henry A. Waxman, Chairman.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I have listened very carefully to all the speakers on both sides of the aisle, and I have no doubt that those who may still be viewing this at 12:30 a.m. east coast time may be a little bit confused. 
   We have heard a couple of speakers say that bureaucrats have no monopoly on wisdom and that we as Members ought to be exercising our prerogatives, and, certainly, Mr. Chairman, we have that right. 
   But at the same time, we have heard other speakers say, well, Members of that same bureaucracy are actually requesting these particular earmarks. So I could see how some might be confused. On the one hand, if they're requesting it, I am kind of curious why it wasn't in their budget in the first place. 
   So I am not really sure who has the monopoly on wisdom. My assumption is that each and every one of these earmarks is probably a very good expenditure of the taxpayers' money. I don't necessarily know if it's the best expenditure of the taxpayers' money. But I know the Members who serve. They're very serious. They're very diligent. I have no doubt that they have done very good work. 
   I also heard my friend the gentleman from Texas say that this particular amendment would harm our troops or military readiness, harm our veterans, families, and a very long laundry list of others who might be harmed. The underlying assumption is that I believe that this money would somehow disappear. Well, I find that interesting because usually when we debate somebody on the point of earmarks, they tell us don't you realize you're not saving any money? That money stays in the bill, and it's going to get used for some other purpose. So, again, I could see, Mr. Chairman, how people who are watching this debate might be a little bit confused. Which is it? Does the money disappear or does the money stay and maybe fund other readiness centers, other barracks, other military projects? Which is it? We seemingly hear speakers on both sides or several sides on that issue. 
   But if the money does disappear, I would say to my friends on the other side of the aisle you had an opportunity to support the Republican budget on which, last I looked, had a billion extra dollars more to help our veterans than the Democrat budget did. I know that in the Budget Committee there were amendments to strike earmarks and add to the veterans funding. So if you spent less money, maybe the gentlemen on the other side of the aisle harmed our veterans or their families or their military readiness. 
   I think at some point, Mr. Chairman, you have to lead by example. And although I have no doubt, again, that these earmarks are good expenditures of the taxpayers' funds, the system is broken. It's not just that there are a few bad apples in the barrel. The barrel is full of rotten apples. And all too often--and maybe not in this bill, and I certainly accept the passion with which the gentleman from Tennessee spoke, and I know his sincerity in wanting to reform this process, and I regret the fact that under the Democrat majority this appears to be the only bill that we can debate earmarks. But what I know about the system and what the American people know about  the system is that it's broken and that all too often it represents the triumph of secrecy over transparency. All too often it represents a triumph of the special interests over the national interests. All too often it represents the triumph of seniority and privilege over merit. 
   Mr. Chairman, when my party was in the majority, there were a lot of abuses in earmarks. But when the Democrats took over, they said they would do it different. They said they would cut the earmarks in half, and yet last year we had the second highest number of earmarks we've ever had. They claimed there would be no more secrecy in the process, but if we look to the New York Times recently, if I can quote from an August, 2007, news clip: ``Despite promises by Congress to end the secrecy of earmarks and other pet projects, the House of Representatives has quietly funneled hundreds of millions of dollars to specific hospitals and health care providers.'' 
   The Democrats said that there would be across-the-board reform, and yet we had bills initially come to the floor that we were expected to vote on and the earmarks were to come later. The Speaker of the House said she would just as soon do without them, and yet she is on the top 20 list of those who request them. 
   The American people want something different. It is time to join the Republican proposal that the gentleman from Tennessee spoke about and have a moratorium on earmarks, reform this process, start it tonight. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I am reminded of a quote from late President Reagan, and perhaps I can paraphrase: The closest thing to eternal life on Earth is a Federal program. 
   Indeed, we have had speaker after speaker come before in this debate to tell us how TRIA was going to be a temporary program. And I see the able gentlelady from New York, the chairwoman of our Financial Institutions Subcommittee. I wasn't here in this body when TRIA was originally passed, but I took the time to review the record of the debate. At that time she said, ``We are simply working to keep our economy on track with a short-term program that addresses the new terrorist threat.'' 
   The gentleman from Pennsylvania, the chairman of our Capital Markets Subcommittee said, ``We wisely design the TRIA Act as a temporary backstop to get our Nation through a period of economic uncertainty until the private sector can develop models.'' 
   And if you look at the Record, Mr. Speaker, of those who proposed TRIA in the first place, all said it would be a temporary program. Perhaps temporary is in the eye of the beholder. What started out as a 3-year program has since become a 5-year program. The House attempted to extend it 15 years. I think we are now looking at a 7-year extension. I believe for all intents and purposes, we are looking at giving birth de facto to a new Federal permanent insurance program to go along with the scores of others, few of which are financially sound. 
   So again, what was meant to be temporary, and I hope had I been in this body at that time I would have voted for it. I was here for the vote on the first extension, and I supported that extension. I believe there was, indeed, a great calamity in this marketplace. I believe that people in the marketplace needed time to react, to plan, to model. But again, is this something that is going to go on in perpetuity? 
   The question again is begged, and that is, Who can do a better job in the reinsurance market, the Federal Government or private industry? I have no doubt that private industry would love to have the subsidies that are represented by TRIA. Any time the government is going to hand out something free or at a subsidized rate versus the market rate, who wouldn't accept it? Such a deal. I certainly understand that they might be favoring this. 
   Now, I haven't heard in this debate, but in previous iterations of the debate I have heard many come and talk about the great tragedy of 9/11, and I want to let it be known again, we are talking about terrorism reinsurance. It does nothing to prevent terrorism in the first place. We are talking about coming in after the fact and providing this Federal backstop, which many of us don't believe is any longer necessary, putting the taxpayer on the hook at a time when markets could develop. 
   I would take the argument more serious if more people on the other side of the aisle would vote to strengthen, for example, the FISA legislation. Unfortunately, many of them are voting to make it even more difficult for our Federal Government to listen in on the conversations of known terrorists. Most of the Democrats, most of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, in May voted against the Hoekstra amendment to the Intelligence Authorization Act which would have eliminated that section of the bill requiring the Director of National Intelligence to use resources, and I paraphrase him, to study bugs and bunnies instead of suspected terrorists. They have supported expanding the legal rights of terrorist detainees, holding up passage of the 9/11 Commission Recommendation Implementation bill to give union bargaining advantages to TSA screeners, and the list goes on and on. 
   So if we want to talk about terrorism, let's talk about what we can do to prevent it in the first place as opposed to what we can do to subsidize large insurance companies after the fact. 
   Another point I would like to make, and everybody is certainly entitled to their own opinion, and I have looked very carefully at the President's working group position on this, and they have observed what I have observed, and that is the availability and affordability of terrorism risk insurance has improved since the initial terrorist attacks. And despite increases in risk retentions under TRIA, insurers have allocated additional capacity to terrorism risk. Prices have declined. Take-up rates have increased. 
   I simply don't buy into the argument, Mr. Speaker, that we have a market failure here that somehow, some way the market can't create this particular insurance product.     
   I mean, how are we ever going to know, once again, if we're going to hand out something free or at a subsidized rate, as opposed to people having to buy it at the market rate? 
   And let me quote from the President's working group: ``The presence of subsidized Federal reinsurance through TRIA appears to negatively affect the emergence of private reinsurance capacity because it dilutes demand for private sector reinsurance.'' 
   Now, some have said, well, again, that terrorism is a very unique risk. Well, of course it is. But our reinsurance industry has faced these challenges in the past. At one point they had to figure out how to model for the risk of loss of electronic data. At one time in our history they had to figure out how to model for airline crashes. 
   Many say that we will never have major construction in the United States unless we have a government, Federal reinsurance backstop for acts of terrorism. I simply don't observe that in real life. 
   And how, Mr. Speaker, during the Cold War, when thousands of nuclear weapons were poised, aimed at our Nation, how did construction take place during that time in our history? Yet there are those who will maintain that somehow it cannot take place today. 
   Again, I'm not saying that reinsurance is not an important aspect of our market. It is. But I disagree with those on the other side of the aisle who say that even after 5 years that the market is simply incapable of creating a product that those who wish it can pay for at an affordable rate. 
   Another point I would make is that even if this were a valuable program to the Nation, what are we going to do to  pay for it, and what are the long-term implications? 
   Again, as I mentioned earlier, Uncle Sam does not have a particularly stellar track record when it comes to running insurance programs. 
   Social Security, according to the latest report of the trustees of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, owes $6.8 trillion, trillion with a T, more in benefits than it's receiving in taxes, and has a long-term deficit of almost $9 trillion, not a particularly good track record there. 
   The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation is currently running a deficit of $18.1 billion, with an additional off-balance sheet liability of $73.3 billion. 
   The National Flood Insurance Program has a shortfall of $1.3 billion a year over the long term and, according to the Congressional Budget Office, its current financial situation is unsustainable. 
   Medicaid, $317 billion a year. The National Governors Association says, ``The growth of a program that is unsustainable in its current form.'' 
   The Federal crop insurance program requires Federal subsidies. The list goes on and on and on and on. As history is my guide, Mr. Speaker, forgive me if I don't share the enthusiasm and optimism of those on the other side of the aisle who say that somehow this is not going to prove painful for future taxpaying generations. I believe it will be. 
   I believe the private market can handle this. I think they will handle this if we give them the opportunity. I do not think the private insurance companies need this huge subsidy. 
   And when, Mr. Speaker, are we finally going to do something about the long-term financial implications of entitlement spending in these insurance programs? 
   Now, something's got to give. The Comptroller General has said that we're on the verge of being the first generation in America's history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living because of out-of-control spending. Instead, we add burden on top of burden on top of burden. 
   Because of all those reasons, Mr. Speaker, I oppose this legislation, I oppose this report and would urge the House to oppose it as well.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (AMT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and he makes a very important point. As hard as I look at this bill, I can't find any tax relief in it. People who somehow think that by preventing a massive tax increase on the American people, that that's tantamount to relief, they need to talk to the schoolteacher in Mesquite, Texas. They need to talk to the rancher in Murchison, Texas. 
   Again, if you make the same amount of money next year that you made last year and you're paying the same amount of taxes, where's the tax relief? 
   This bill is misnamed. The AMT is misnamed. It ought to be called the alternative massive tax increase because it's a massive tax increase on the American people of $55.7 billion. The only thing that's alternative about it is who has the great honor and pleasure of paying for this tax. 
   Now, I've heard many speakers on the other side of the aisle come and say, well, we pay for it. Well, that will certainly come as a great relief to the teachers and the ranchers and the small business people of the 5th District of Texas to know that you're not going to increase their taxes because somehow you've paid for it. 
   You haven't paid for anything. You've put a massive tax increase on the American people, and in this particular case, you are putting it on investment. You're putting it on small businesses. You're putting it on the capital of capitalism, and you are threatening the paychecks of the American people. 
   Now, I've heard many people come here to the floor and say, well, we have to be fiscally responsible; this needs to be revenue neutral. Well, I agree with my friends on the other side of the aisle. It does need to be revenue neutral. It ought to be revenue neutral to the taxpayer, not the Federal Government. That's the revenue neutrality that we should attempt to achieve here. 
   I heard my friend, the gentleman from Massachusetts, say, well, we have to pay this or there's going to be this tax increase. Well, there's another alternative. There's several alternatives. One's the Taxpayer Choice Act, which would get rid of the AMT once and for all. 
   There's a clear choice before us. Who's going to get the $55.7 billion, Federal Government bureaucrats or American families? We vote for the American family.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON S. CON. RES. 70, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, it was about 2 weeks ago that the front page of the USA Today publication wrote, ``Taxpayers' Bill Leaps By Trillions.'' The first sentence says, ``The Federal Government's long-term financial obligations grew by $2.5 last year, a reflection of the mushrooming cost of Medicare, Social Security benefits.'' 
   $2.5 trillion, Mr. Speaker, under the Democrat watch imposed upon the next generation. It just so happens that two members of the next generation that I'm very concerned about, my 6-year-old daughter and my 4-year-old son, are in the gallery today. And I take the matter very, very seriously that we have a Democrat budget before us today that is absolutely stone cold silent on the number one threat to their future of greater opportunity and greater freedom. And this budget, this Democrat budget does nothing to reform entitlement spending, to give us greater retirement security and better health care at a more reasonable cost. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is a tale of two budgets here. One, again, is stone cold silent on reforming entitlement spending that threatens to bankrupt future generations, including my children. 
   Let me tell you what it's not silent on. It's not silent on tax increases. This budget includes the single largest tax increase in American history. An average family of four working in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas--that I have the honor of representing--over the course of the next 3 years will see a $3,000-a-year tax increase at a time when they're having to go to the convenience store and making the decision, do I buy a gallon of milk or do I buy a gallon of gas? 
   What does this budget do? It raises taxes on a family of four by $3,000. The elderly will see their taxes go up $2,181. A single parent who has two children could see their taxes go up by over $1,600. People are wondering, how am I going to send my kids to college? How am I going to put gas into the pick-up truck? How are we going to commute the 25 miles to work every day? And what does this budget do, Mr. Speaker? It raises taxes, single largest tax increase in American history. 
   Here's another thing this budget does. It says, you know what? The pork barrel factory is alive and well. Let's just keep it going. Let's let Members of Congress continue to have monuments to themselves. Let's continue to subsidize fashion landscaping in the L.A. fashion district, and let's send the bill to the next generation and let's send it to the taxpayers.     
   Mr. Speaker, this is an outrage, and for the sake of today's taxpayers who are struggling and for the sake of future generations, we must reject this conference report.

   I listened very carefully to the distinguished majority leader, who spoke eloquently on deficit spending.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, various news organizations have now confirmed what the Democrats really have in mind with this nonbinding resolution, and that is, choke off funding for the troops. 
   Though they haven't really said it on this House floor, they have said it to their political base, moveon.org, and I hold the transcript in my hand. Let's listen to the words of our colleague, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murtha) who, as we all know, controls our military spending panel. 
   ``They won't be able to continue. They won't be able to do the deployment. They won't have the equipment, they don't have the training and they won't be able to do the work. There's no question in my mind.'' 
   He was further quoted as saying, ``We have to be careful people don't think this is the vote.'' 
   Last evening, CBS News noted that our colleague's proposal ``is a way to get at the same goal without holding a vote to cut funding.'' Again, Mr. Speaker, that goal is to cut funding of the troops. The goal is to accept defeat. 
   Now, I know the author of this proposal has served his Nation with great courage and great honor, but I for one fail to see the courage and the honor in this proposal. 
   The Politico Magazine has called this proposal the ``Slow Bleed Strategy.'' The slow bleed strategy. I wonder who it is who is doing the bleeding. 
   Mr. Speaker, how does anybody look one of our brave soldiers in the eye and tell them, I don't believe in your mission. I don't believe you can succeed and I have the power to bring you home; I have the power to bring you home today but I am not willing to do it because, if I did, I would have to take responsibility and I am concerned about political ramifications. 
   Mr. Speaker, if my Democrat colleagues truly want to cut off funding for the troops and withdraw from Iraq, then let them vote on it today. Let them show the courage of their convictions and vote on it today. We cannot accept this slow bleed strategy. 
   Mr. Speaker, I know that fighting this war is costly. It is costly in terms of blood. It is costly in terms of money. Like many other of my colleagues, I have met with the mothers who have lost sons in Iraq. Their plight is profound; it is sad. But Mr. Speaker, I never, never, never want to meet with the mothers whose children might perish in the next 9/11 if we accept defeat in Iraq. 
   Iraq must be seen in the context of this larger war we are having with radical Islam. The battle lines are drawn, and whether we like it or not, they are drawn in Iraq. Don't take my word for it. Listen to Osama bin Laden. ``The epicenter of these wars is Baghdad. Success in Baghdad will be success for the United States. Failure in Iraq is the failure of the United States. Their defeat in Iraq will mean defeat in all their wars.'' 
   We have to soberly reflect on the enemy that we are facing. Listen to the number two in al Qaeda, al-Zawahiri. ``Al Qaeda has the right to kill 4 million Americans, 2 million of them children.'' As the father of a 4-year-old and a 3-year-old, I find that to be a chilling statement. 
   Listen to Hassan Abbassi, Revolutionary Guard's intelligence adviser to the Iranian President. ``We have a strategy drawn up for the destruction of Anglo-Saxon civilization.'' 
   This is the enemy we face, and we face him foremost in Iraq. If we leave Iraq before subduing him, he will follow us to America, make no mistake about it, and the consequences are immense. Read the National Intelligence Estimate. Read the report of the Iraq Study Group. 
   Iraq has the potential to become what Afghanistan once was under the Taliban, and that is, a breeding ground and a safe haven for the recruitment, training, financing and sanctuary of radical Islamists bent upon attacking our Nation and attacking our families. There will be no greater event to empower the radical Islamists in our defeat in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, it doesn't have to be this way. We are Americans. We can meet this threat. We can work together. Vote against this resolution. Let's support our troops. Let's protect our Nation and our children from this threat.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the distinguished ranking member for yielding. 
   There are so many different reasons, Mr. Speaker, that we should oppose this massive omnibus spending bill, not the least of which is the process. The process can lead to bad results. 
   When the Speaker, Speaker Pelosi, was the minority leader, she said this was a terrible process. In fact, I quote: ``The Republican leadership forced through a so-called `martial law' rule that required a same-day vote, preventing Members of Congress from having enough time to read legislation that spent hundreds of billions of dollars and was thousands of pages long. This arrogance of power is part of a pattern of abuse.'' 
   Now, that's what the Speaker thought when somebody else was in control; but now that her party is in control, I guess it's perfectly appropriate to present a 3,565-page bill on the very same day, of which I'm told 692 pages are devoted to earmarks, and for us to spend approximately 60 minutes debating $515 billion. If I did the back-of-the-envelope math properly, we're debating $9.1 billion of the people's money each minute. 
   Where's the transparency here, Mr. Speaker? Where's the accountability? And this is a bill that still grows government at twice the rate of inflation. There's not one Member of this body who knows what is in this bill, and I'd include the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee. It defies logic that any one Member of this body knows what's in the bill. It should be rejected on that alone. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, ultimately this bill puts us on a path to double taxes on the next generation, and don't take my word for it. Listen to the director of the Congressional Budget Office appointed by the Democrat majority. Listen to the Comptroller General. They all say the same thing. Reject this monstrosity.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (FISCAL IRRESPONSIBILITY -- (House of Representatives - December 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. And, again, I thank her for her leadership in this institution, a very clear, concise, conservative voice on this House floor, particularly when it comes to trying to save the family budget from the onslaught of the Federal budget. 
   As my colleague from Tennessee has pointed out, the House is completely broken. It is completely broken and felled under this new Democratic leadership. They said they would do better if they were in charge. So what do they bring us today? Today they bring us a 3,565-page spending bill which people have been able to see beside my colleague's speaking position over here, weighing in at 34.4 pounds, roughly the weight of my 5-year-old daughter. 
   It spends $515 billion of the people's money, and the Democrat majority brought it to the floor tonight and devoted less than 1 hour of floor time debating this omnibus bill. This body spent about a minute debating every $9.1 billion being spent in this bill. 
   Now, that is money if left in the hands of the families of America and the small businesses of America, who make the jobs and have to work hard to send their kids to college and put food on the table and put roofs over their heads, that money is coming from them; and we spent less than a minute debating $9 billion. The minutes went by, and all of a sudden this House passed a $515 billion bill. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, when the Republicans were in charge, unfortunately, my party occasionally brought an omnibus bill to the floor, and I personally voted against each and every one because I don't believe that was the vision of the Founding Fathers. It is not the way we should run this government. In fact, I was at a town hall meeting in my district not too long ago and a gentleman from the Athens, Texas, in the 5th Congressional District of Texas, said: Don't you think we would have a much better government if Members of Congress were actually required to read the legislation before they vote on it? 
   What human being can read 34.4 pounds, 3,565 pages in one day? That is right, Mr. Speaker, this bill was just given to us today. In the early morning hours, this bill was laid upon this institution. 
   So there is no transparency here. It is interesting to me that when the majority party was in the minority, they screamed to the rafters about this process. Listen to what Speaker Pelosi, then minority Pelosi had to say about this process: ``The Republican leadership forced through a so-called `martial law' rule that required a same-day vote preventing Members of Congress from having enough time to read legislation. They spent hundreds of billions of dollars and it was thousands of pages long. This arrogance of power is part of a pattern of abuse.'' 
   Now that is what Speaker Pelosi said 3 years ago when she was in the minority. Now that she is the Speaker, does this mean she is imposing martial law on this House with this process that she decried 3 years ago? Is she now bringing a spirit of arrogance to this institution which she decried 3 years ago? Is she part of the pattern of abuse that she decried 3 years by forcing Members of this institution to vote on this monstrosity? 
   So on process alone, this bill ought to be rejected. But it really ought to be rejected because it puts us on a path of extreme fiscal irresponsibility. Already today this government is on automatic pilot to force the largest single tax increase in American history on working families all across America. It was included in the Democrat budget. More spending fosters more taxes. 
   And that's just the start, Mr. Speaker, because after imposing the single largest tax increase in American history in the Democrat budget, with their so-called ``mother of all tax increases,'' they are going to once again make history by imposing the single largest tax increase in American history yet again, perhaps twice in a 12-month period. I am sure that will break some kind of record here in the House of Representatives.  
   But don't take my word for it. Listen to the head of the Congressional Budget Office, the head of the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Reserve chairman. They are all going to tell you the same thing, Mr. Speaker, and that is without changing the spending patterns of the Federal Government of which this omnibus represents some of the worst, we are on automatic pilot to double taxes on the next generation. Double. And the average American family pays roughly $22,000 a year in taxes. That will go to $44,000. How many American dreams are going to be squashed by a tax burden of that magnitude, represented by that 34.4 pound omnibus spending legislation which will flatten the American taxpayer like a bus. 
   It is full of gimmicks from people who said they were going to bring the most honest and ethical Congress in the history of mankind to this institution. They take a rubber stamp and they stamp ``emergency spending'' on anything that moves because they have this little clever device that allows them to avoid any kind of budget discipline when they do that. They have this gimmick called ``advanced appropriations'' that would make an Enron accountant blush, but they use it to once again evade any spending discipline whatsoever in this institution. 
   They said they would clean up earmarks and this is chock full of earmarks. Mr. Speaker, if you look closely, maybe some of these earmarks pass the legal test. Maybe they even pass some ethical test, but all too often the American people are seeing campaign cash going into the institution on this end, and they are seeing earmarks coming out the other end. It doesn't meet the fiscal responsibility test, and it doesn't meet the American taxpayer smell test. And that bill is chock full of it. Out of 3,565 pages, 692 pages are devoted to individual congressional earmarks, which many of the American people believe serve no other purposes other than to get Members of Congress reelected. 
   Again, the Democrat majority said they would clean it up and there would be transparency and accountability. We haven't even had time to read the 692 pages. We don't know what is in there. Maybe there is another museum to a Member of Congress, as the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee managed to earmark $2 million to create a museum to himself. 
   One final point before turning this over to some of my other able colleagues from the Republican Study Committee. I want to harken back to a point made by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), ranking member of the Budget Committee. Earlier tonight the Democrat majority leader came to the floor and said, We have a responsibility to fund our government. 
   Well, I don't know everything that is in that bill, Mr. Speaker, but I know something that isn't in that bill. There is no funding for the men and women fighting for freedom in Iraq. Not one penny. Now how do you have a bill that ostensibly funds the United States Government and somehow you leave out the men and women who wear our Nation's uniform? They wear our Nation's uniform. They come from the small towns and factories and fields from all over America. Their paychecks come from the same United States Treasury that Members of Congress' do. Somehow the Democrat majority managed to put into their 34-pound bill thousands of earmarks. They managed to fund every single bureaucrat at the Commerce Department, but they can't find one penny for our brave men and women fighting on the front lines of freedom in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, maybe they don't believe in the cause, but don't they believe in the soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines?     
   There is no way that any Member with any credibility can come to this floor and say we are presenting a bill to fund the Federal Government but, oh, we don't really consider members of our armed services fighting in Iraq to be members of our government. I just don't know what planet some of these people come from, Mr. Speaker, and that's just shameful. It is a shameful moment this year in the history of the House to present this spending abomination, chock full of earmarks that ignore our men and women in harm's way in Iraq. And it's one of the lowest points of this entire year for this Democrat Congress. And I hope that the American people are paying very special attention to what is going on here tonight. 
   I appreciate the gentlelady, again, for her leadership for taking the time to help elaborate on really this heinous piece of legislation that came to the floor earlier, and I want to thank her. And I want to thank all the members of the House Conservative Caucus, the Republican Study Committee, the largest caucus in the House, for always being ready and vigilant to fight for freedom and to work for less government and more freedom and more opportunity, and that's what the Republican Study Committee is all about. And I appreciate the opportunity to share in this Special Order, and I yield back to the gentlelady from Tennessee.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   It's a fascinating evening that we find ourselves in, to be asked to somehow, in less than a day, in fact, as I understand it, Mr. Speaker, this bill was filed after midnight. So on the very same day we're being asked to consider a bill, which all of America can see here, which is over 3,000 pages long. 
   Now, when the Democrat majority came in, they said, well, this was going to be the most fair and democratic Congress that we've ever had, that somehow a new day was dawning, that they would do business in a different way. I have not been a fan of omnibus spending legislation when my party was in control. I voted against the omnibus. It's no way to run the railroad, Mr. Speaker. In fact, when my party was in control, if an omnibus was passed, I note, for example, if I look at the Congressional Record of January 4, 2005, that to bring an omnibus piece of legislation to the floor by waiving the 3-day rule was described as ``martial law'' by then-Minority Leader Pelosi, now Speaker Pelosi. It's in the Record, Mr. Speaker. Look it up. 
   So somehow when she's the minority leader, Mr. Speaker, it's not okay to bring this monstrosity; in fact, it's tantamount to martial law. And yet we've heard that this is going to be such an open and democratic and fair Congress. So what is it, Mr. Speaker? Is it martial law, is it not martial law, to expect Members who haven't even seen the bill, much less read the bill, to vote on it tonight? 
   I heard the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee come and speak to us about earmarks. Well, again, this was the leadership team that claimed that they would do better. And as I look at it, when you add in the earmarks in the one appropriations bill that was passed by regular order, you're still looking at the third highest amount of earmarks, I believe, in the history of the Republic. 
   Now, the Speaker herself said, and I don't have the quote in front of me, but something along the lines that she would just as soon do without earmarks. But as I've read the legislation, she doesn't appear to be leading by example in that regard. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are very few people who know what is in this bill. But what I do know is it spends the people's money with very little accountability. I was at a town hall meeting in my district, and I have the honor and privilege of representing the Fifth Congressional District of Texas. I was in Athens, Texas, and a constituent, a very wise man, came up to me and said, You know what? I don't think that any Member of Congress should be allowed to vote on a piece of legislation unless they've read the bill, which I guess might lend this evening's vote to one, maybe two, Members, maybe no Members. There's something to be said for that. A bad process can lead to bad outcomes, and this is a bad outcome. It spends too much of the people's money. It continues to grow the government budget faster than the family budget, the family budget that has to pay for it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm a member of the House Budget Committee. I see several of my colleagues on the Democrat side who are also serving on that Budget Committee. And we just heard testimony from the head of the Congressional Budget Office, which I might add  was an appointment under this majority, this Democrat majority, who said that if we don't change the spending patterns of the Federal Government that within a generation we're looking at doubling taxes on our children and grandchildren. 
   Now, you can go check the Record. And it's not just the head of the Congressional Budget Office; it's the head of OMB, it's the Comptroller General. And yet we are asked to vote on an omnibus piece of legislation that, once again, sets us on this path to double taxes on the next generation. It's just unconscionable. Again, it robs the family budget to pay for the Federal budget. 
   And here's something else that's unconscionable about this: in this omnibus, we're going to pay to fund some bureaucrat in the bowels of the Commerce Department, but we won't pay for the men and women in our Nation's uniform fighting for liberty in Iraq. Well, last I looked, they're part of this Federal Government as well. They're wearing our Nation's uniform. They get paychecks drawn on the U.S. Treasury. But somehow we can find the ability, in this 3,000-page bill, to pay for every bureaucrat in Washington; but we won't fund the men and women in harm's way in Iraq. Also unconscionable. 
   There are so many reasons, Mr. Speaker, that this rule should be voted down, as should the entire bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in great opposition to this rule and to this conference report. 
   We are here, yet again, discussing a Democrat plan for a statutory date certain for America's defeat in Iraq. We are here, yet again, discussing the Democrats' ``slow bleed'' strategy for our brave men and women in uniform in Iraq, designed to gradually deny them the critical equipment, support, and reinforcements they need to do the job. We are here, yet again, discussing just how much pork and unrelated spending can be shoved into this conference report to encourage or persuade reluctant Members to support this legislation. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, according to today's L.A. Times and other major media outlets, we are likely to have this vote again and again and again because the majority party's leadership somehow believes it is in their political interests to do so. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, we all know about the recent announcement of the Democratic leader in the Senate. He has announced to our troops, he has announced to al Qaeda, he has announced to the world that the war in Iraq is lost. 
   Mr. Speaker, Corporal Tyler Rock of the 1st Battalion, 6th Marines seems to disagree. I would quote him directly, but I believe the House rules would not permit it; so allow me to paraphrase that he has a quote for the Senate majority leader. Let me go on to say that he has said, ``We could leave this place and say we are sorry to the terrorists, and then we could wait for 3,000 more American civilians to die before we say, `Hey, that's not nice again.' '' 
   Mr. Speaker, I suspect that Corporal Rock speaks for most of our troops. Let's not cut their support. There will be no greater event to empower radical Islam than our defeat and retreat from Iraq. 
   The terrorists that we fight there believe they have the moral authority to kill 2 million, 2 million of our children, two of them being my own. 
   They are the ones that say the battlefield is in Iraq. Why can't we understand that in the Halls of Congress? 
   There is no doubt that fighting this war is costly. There is no more difficult duty I have, or any of us have, than to meet with the mothers of those who have lost loved ones on the field of battle. But as difficult as that duty is, I  never, never, never want to meet with the mothers who lose children in the next 9/11 because we turned our back on our duty. 
   The cost of fighting this war is great. The cost of losing it is greater.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I especially thank him for his leadership in this area to try to make health care more affordable, more portable, high quality, and accessible for all of the children in America. The gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Shadegg) has been a great leader in this effort. I also appreciate his leadership in the conservative caucus in Congress, the Republican Study Committee, and all he has meant to that group in advancing the cause of freedom and free markets in America. 
   People need to listen closely to this debate. The debate is not about whether or not we are going to have an SCHIP program, a State Children's Health Insurance Program. It is really a tale of two SCHIPs, if you will. People need to know, number one, when they hear America needs to provide health insurance for poor children, well, I am not sure that anybody disagrees with that in America. That is why we have something called the Medicaid program, for the poor in America. So that is a nonissue. That is totally a nonissue. 
   What we are talking about is health care for the working poor, those up to 200 percent of the poverty level, and the SCHIP program was actually started 10 years ago by a Republican Congress to provide health insurance benefits to, number one, the uninsured; number two, low income; number three, American; and, number four, children. Uninsured, low-income American children. That's what the program was supposed to do. And I don't believe there is one Member of this body on either side of the aisle who wouldn't vote to reauthorize this program today for uninsured, low-income American children. Even though I am a fiscal conservative, I would vote to appropriate more money to ensure that eligible children can be a part of this program. 
   But, unfortunately, our friends on the other side of the aisle have discovered some new poll or focus group results that say we have this great bumper sticker slogan, and maybe we can somehow put people in a box, maybe we can fool the American people as to what this is all about. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, occasionally it is helpful to have the facts. Again, this is a program that was designed for people up to 200 percent of the poverty level, presently $40,000. Yet loopholes and exemptions allow families up to $83,000. I am not sure anybody is going to call that the working poor in America. It is not the working poor in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas. But loopholes and exemptions allow people making up to $83,000 to get these benefits. What the Democrats are doing, they are doing nothing about the loopholes and exemptions; and they are expressly taking the program to 300 percent of the poverty level when there are still eligible children that haven't been enrolled. 
   So a program designed for the working poor, the Democrats are trying to transform to people making $83,000. And that is not right. It is not right at all. 
   Second of all, this was a program designed for children. It is called the State Children's Health Insurance Program. And yet we have 13 States that are insuring adults while 800,000 eligible kids aren't enrolled. What does the Democrat plan do? Well, bring on more adults. We have three States covering more adults than children already. So we have precious resources of our Nation instead going to adults, and the Democrats say let's insure more adults. Republicans say let's put the children first. Let's put the children first. 
   This was a program that was also designed for American children. American children. Now if anybody walks into any emergency room in any hospital in America and they have an emergency, I want them to be treated. We are all God's children. But to have illegal immigrants use emergency rooms and be able to access our health care system for their everyday health care when they are in this Nation illegally, while we still have 800,000 eligible children not enrolled, that is just a tragedy. That is a travesty. That is crazy. 
   Yet under the Democrat plan, what they do is they claim this isn't for illegal immigrants. Then I ask them why did they take away the proof of citizenship requirements? I mean, your words say something, but your actions are even louder than your words. When you take the proof of citizenship requirement out of the bill, you are de facto allowing more illegal immigrants to access this program.

Yet, you have to read the fine print because even today there are so many exemptions and so many loopholes that there are States that are insuring people up to $82,000 income for a family of four, and they do nothing to bring this back to the working poor.

That's what the debate is about today. That is the main debate we are having today.

   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for his insight. And looking at all of the cigarette cartons in front of you, as somebody who used to serve on the board of directors in Dallas, Texas, of the American Cancer Society, I know how seriously devastating the habit of smoking can be to families. I have seen a lot of cancer in the families of friends, something I take very, very seriously. 
   And to think that now we are going to have a health insurance program ostensibly counting on 22 million more Americans to take up smoking is frankly beyond insulting. It is beyond ludicrous. For the life of me I cannot fathom why any type of system would be created, and then as an irony, and I make this point as an aside, the tax would go mainly to those who are making less than 200 percent of poverty level, the same people that ostensibly this program is due to help. Fifty-four percent of all smokers are in families making less than $42,000 a year.

So under the Democrat plan, you would tax people making less than 200 percent of poverty in order to extend subsidies to families making up to $83,000 a year.

   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I certainly hope that the President would veto the bill. 
   And again, our Democrat colleagues know that last month, last week, last night, today, tomorrow, this body stands ready to reauthorize the SCHIP program, as long as it's really going to help the uninsured, as long as it's going to help the working poor, as long as it's going to help children, and as long as those children are American children. 
   So, a debate is taking place about that, but I'd like to harken back to another point that the gentleman made. As important as this debate is, we need to keep the focus on ultimately how are we going to get affordable health care, accessible health care, health care of high quality to all families across America. 
   And in many respects, this is not just an economic debate. In many respects, we're not debating how much money we're going to spend on children's health care in America, but we are debating who's going to do the spending. 
   So, under the Democrat plan, the Congressional Budget Office says that for all intents and purposes over 2 million children will be taken off their chosen health insurance plan and shoved into the government health insurance plan. And you might have seen in the newspaper ``The Politico'' that this was really Senator HILLARY CLINTON's plan from the first, that if she couldn't pass her Canadian-style, socialized health care system in one big bite, that she would do it in little bites. 
   So there's memos dating back, and I have the document right here, the document right here that's referred to in the article. And if I could quote from the October 2 issue of ``The Politico,'' ``Back in 1993, according to an internal White House staff memo, then-First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's staff saw Federal coverage of children as a precursor to universal coverage. 
   ``In a section of the memo titled `Kids First,' Clinton's staff laid out backup plans in the event the universal coverage idea failed.'' 
   And now we're seeing it. That failed, and so this is really the first step in taking us down that road in that Canadian-style, socialized health care system where ultimately, ultimately mothers in America won't be waiting hours to see a doctor to help their sick children. They will be waiting days. They may be waiting weeks, and it won't be the doctor of their choice. It will be the doctor of some government bureaucrat's choice, and I don't plan to stand idly by and allow that to happen to my children, much less the children in the Fifth District of Texas, much less the children in America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this conference report, but I certainly want to thank our ranking member for taking a product and making it better. 
   Mr. Speaker, 2 days ago the front page of USA Today talks about taxpayers' bill leaps by billions, long-term financial obligations of the Federal Government grew by $2.5 trillion last year, unfunded obligations that will be placed on our children and grandchildren. 
   Today we have a conference report for a farm bill that is going to cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $700 billion. Now, I have heard it said, well, this bill is paid for. Yes, it is paid for. It is paid for by the auto mechanics in Garland, Texas. It is paid for by the guy that sweeps out the grocery store in Mineola. It is paid for by the guy who works at the counter at the hardware store in Canton, Texas, that I have the privilege of representing. 
   We have a farm program that in many ways is at odds with the poster child that is represented. Two-thirds of this bill isn't about agriculture. It is about nutritional programs, welfare programs, food stamps. And of the money that is going to agricultural production, two-thirds of agricultural production is not getting anything. And yet some of this money is going, as we know, to millionaires, at a time when middle-income family paychecks are shrinking. 
   Now, I must admit, Mr. Speaker, this is a debate that is somewhat personal to me. I grew up working on a family farm. I come from three generations of farmers. No one sought a subsidy from their neighbor. No one gave a subsidy. You can make a living in agriculture without asking your neighbor to give you a check. 
   We do need a farm bill, but what needs to be in a farm bill is tax relief, to prevent taxes from being increased. We need an end to the death tax. We need to increase trade opportunities. We could be exporting good Texas beef right now to Colombia.

   Mr. HENSARLING. We do need a farm bill, but not a farm bill that forces our neighbors to subsidize this program. Ninety-six percent of the world lives outside of America, and already we had the Democrat majority deny a trade agreement that could have opened up great trading opportunities for agriculture in America. 
   We need a respect for private property rights. We need regulatory relief. When we have an EPA out of control trying to somehow deign animal manure as part of the Superfund hazardous waste site, you know that something is out of control. 
   So our agricultural producers need help. But this is the wrong way to do it. Again, at a time of shrinking paychecks, at a time when $2.5 trillion of burden have been added to our children and grandchildren, why are we keeping alive a relic of the New Deal, not to mention at a time of the highest food inflation in almost two decades. And why we would take money away from some people to hand to millionaires is beyond me. 
   We ought to defeat this conference report.

   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I listened to the Speaker of the House who spoke so eloquently about the pain Americans are feeling at the gas pump. She and her party should know a lot about it. They helped cause it. 
   Since the Democrats have been in control here for almost a year and a half, we have seen prices at the pump go up about $1.50 a gallon. A barrel of oil is at the highest price we have ever seen. They have tried to sue their way into lower gas prices. Now they are trying to tax their way into lower gas prices. Yet they never think about producing American energy in America. 
   So now we have the so-called tax extender bills, Mr. Speaker. Well, isn't that an interesting concept. Why is it that spending is forever and grows exponentially, and yet tax relief to hardworking middle-income families is somehow temporary? It just kind of disappears. But the Speaker of the House tells us that this is somehow fiscally responsible. 
   If you read the front page of USA Today 2 days ago, it tells you that under the Democrats' watch we have an extra $2.7 trillion of unfunded obligations that are put upon our children. 
   Apparently the majority leader thinks that is a laughing matter. As the father of a 6-year-old and the father of a 4-year-old, I don't find it too funny. 
   What we have here is we are going to preserve tax relief for some by increasing taxes for others. Again, what an interesting concept. The bottom line is the job creation mechanism of America is taxed, taxed again when people's paychecks are shrinking. This isn't fair. 
   Now some people say, well, these particular provisions need reform. I am happy to reform the Tax Code. I have cosponsored the Taxpayer Choice Act of 2008. I invite my Democrat colleagues to cosponsor it so that we can present a two-tier flat tax system to the American people. But the bottom line is Washington is spending too much, and we don't need another tax increase bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (ANNUAL BUDGET DEBATE -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, tonight we start an important debate that we have here each year in this Nation, and that is a debate over the annual budget. I know for a lot of people, Mr. Speaker, this is a debate about numbers, kind of a green-shade visor exercise, but frankly, it is a lot more than that. It has a lot to do with values. It has a lot to do with principles.     
   And it is a debate that the American people need to pay very close attention to. Clearly, we know the results of the last election: there is a new majority party. The Democrat majority has taken control, which they have not had in 12 years. They won the election fair and square. But, Mr. Speaker, the more things change, the more they stay the same. 
   I have the pleasure and honor of serving on the House Budget Committee, and just this last week the Democrats voted out their budget that has the single largest tax increase in American history in it. Now, Mr. Speaker, the last time that the Democrats had control of the House, guess what they did, they passed the single largest tax increase in American history. Again, the more things change, the more they stay the same. The single largest tax increase in American history. Mr. Speaker, people have to know what this is going to mean to them. 
   I have the honor and privilege of representing people in the Fifth District of Texas. It starts out in the city of Dallas, takes in the southeast Dallas County suburbs, and six really great east Texas counties full of small business people and agricultural producers. For the people in the State of Texas, for the people in the Fifth District of Texas, that is going to mean an additional tax burden for the average family of four of $2,700 a year. That is $2,700 a year, Mr. Speaker, that could have gone into funding the family budget that is instead going to go into funding the Federal budget. And every time, every time that we increase that Federal budget, we are taking money away from some valuable family budget. 
   Now, we are always going to hear from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the Democrats, that these vital investments are needed for housing programs and for nutritional programs and health care programs. And certainly we need a social safety net. But, Mr. Speaker, this isn't really a debate about how much we spend on these vital programs. The real question is, who is going to do the spending? Democrats believe government should do the spending. We believe that families should do the spending. And when it comes to my constituents in the State of Texas, they need that $2,700. They need that $2,700 to help send a child to college, to help finance higher education. They need that $2,700 to  make a down payment on their first home and help realize the great American Dream for their family. They need that $2,700 a year to help with long-term care for an elderly parent. I mean, these are the priorities of American families. 
   Where do we believe that somehow we have all this perfect knowledge in Washington, D.C.? I mean, Mr. Speaker, how much is enough? The single largest tax increase in American history is now being proposed by the Democrats, and what is this going to do? What is this going to do to families all across America? Every family in America who is paying attention to this debate ought to go and look at their checkbook, and every night, every week they have to get around that kitchen table and they have to make priorities, something that Congress isn't particularly good at, and they have to decide how they are going to meet their bills. 
   And yet here is the Democrat majority saying, well, we need an extra $2,700 a year from your family because we know better than you do about the health care you need and the education you need. You can't handle that yourself. We need to do it for you. 
   That is just one difference, one difference that we have. Because in the Republican budget, we know the American people work hard for their money. We know they roll up their sleeves and work hard to put food on the table to feed their family, to put a roof over their family's head. 
   There is no tax increase on the poor beleaguered taxpayer, no tax increase on American families, no tax increase on small businesses in the Republican budget. But what do you find in the Democrat budget? The single largest tax increase in American history. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I have been joined by a number of my colleagues tonight who know a lot about what this Democrat budget would mean to their constituents and would mean to their people back home. I am very happy that we are joined by the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), and I would like to yield to her to get her perspective on this single largest tax increase in American history.

   Again, this single largest tax increase in history that the Democrats are proposing may fuel their vision of Big Government, but it doesn't do much to help fuel the budgets of families throughout our Nation, including some families in the State of Nebraska. 
   And I am very happy that we have been joined by one of the outstanding freshmen Members within our GOP ranks. At this time I would yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Smith).

   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for his contribution. I thank him for his leadership within the freshman class. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker, people need to know that once a year we come together and as a Nation debate what the Federal budget ought to be. There are clearly those who think that the American people are undertaxed, and I suppose that is why the Democrats have proposed the largest single tax increase in American history. 
   But talking to working mothers in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas, talking to small business people and talking to farmers and ranchers, they don't seem to think that they are undertaxed. They think that Washington spends too much. But, instead, the Democrat response is almost $400 billion of tax increase. Nationwide, that is about $2,400, $2,500 per family of four that is going to be taken out of the family budget and put into the Federal budget if they succeed in their largest single tax increase in American history. 
   They are going to eliminate the marriage penalty relief. They are going to bring back the marriage penalty so people who fall in love and get married have to pay more taxes than if the two were single. 
   They are going to cut the child tax credit in half. They are going to cut it in half as working families and working mothers all over America are struggling to meet the needs of their children and of child care. 
   And for the working poor, this one is so hard to believe, but for the working poor in the 10 percent bracket, they are going to raise their taxes 50 percent. Fifty percent, Mr. Speaker, on the working poor and take them back to the 15 percent bracket. 
   Where does it all end? 
   I myself hail from the Lone Star State of Texas. We are what is known as a sales tax State. We do not have a State income tax. We are very blessed that we do not have one. Yet there has been this inequity in the Tax Code that allows taxpayers who come from a State income tax State to deduct their taxes, but for those of us from a sales tax State, we don't have that benefit. 
   Well, the Republicans knew that was not equitable, and we passed tax relief so all Americans would enjoy tax relief, whether or not they are from a sales tax State or a State income tax State. Now under the Democrats' plan, under the single largest tax increase in America's history, they are going to bring back the penalty if you happen to hail from one of these sales tax States. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am very happy that we are joined tonight by another Member who comes from one of those sales tax States, one of the great leaders of the Republican Study Committee, one of the co-authors of the American Taxpayer Bill of Rights. At this time I yield to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for bringing to the floor very important aspects of this debate. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker, I just do not know how anybody can justify this single largest tax increase in American history, almost $400 billion of taxes that are going to get imposed on American families. In Texas, it is going to be taking away $2,700 on average from every family of four. I mean, that is impacting real families in Texas. It is taking away from their family budget. 
   Mr. Speaker, I recently contacted my constituents and I asked them if the Democrats are successful with their plan to put forth the single largest tax increase in American history, what is it going to mean to you? 
   Well, I heard from Diana in Mesquite, and she said: Congressman, I wanted to let you know that I am a single mom that does not receive any type of child support, and an increase of this amount would break me. I would be at risk of losing my home with this type of increase. I am writing to ask your help to keep this from happening. This would be devastating to middle-income families and families in my situation. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker, every time you plus-up, you increase the Federal budget, you are taking away from the family budget. You are taking away from Diana's budget in Mesquite, as she works to try to keep her home. 
   I heard from Brian who came from Dallas, and I asked him, and he said: Congressman Hensarling, the loss of $2,700 would affect our ability to pay tuition and books for our daughter to go to college. While she is a junior this year, we are trying to save money for her education, and as the cost of education increases each year, the loss of these funds due to an increase in taxes will have a negative impact on our plans for her education. 
   Again, what the Democrats are doing with their single largest tax increase in American history is they are getting the family budget. They are making it more difficult. They are making it more difficult for Brian to be able to send his daughter to college. There is no fairness in this. There is no compassion in this. 
   I have heard from many other constituents and the Democrats have to realize once again how devastating this is to American families. It is not their money, Mr. Speaker. They did not earn it. It belongs to the American people. It is their money. They need to use it for their education program. 
   I think it is again important to point out that if the Democrats are successful in their plan to engage in the single largest tax increase in American history, it is going to take away from American families their ability to send their children to college. It is going to take away from their ability to purchase their first homes. It is going to devastate the family budget so that Democrats can bulk up on the Federal budget. This is not fair, Mr. Speaker. This is not right. 
   Another gentleman who has been a great leader within our conference and a great leader in the Budget Committee and somebody who represents the people of south Alabama very well in this institution, who knows about the devastating impact that this Democrat budget could have on family budgets, is the gentleman from Alabama, and I would be happy to yield to Mr. Bonner.

   Mr. HENSARLING. We should obviously inform our Democrat colleagues that last I looked, the IRS takes voluntary contributions. So if they don't believe their taxes are high enough, if they don't believe the taxes of their constituents are high enough, they can simply add a zero to that line on the 1040 and send in more. They somehow act that there is a revenue deficiency in Washington, DC. 
   I don't know how much government spending is enough, but just looking over about the last 10 years, I see where the agricultural budget has increased 126 percent, the Federal transportation budget, 97 percent, the education budget, 75 percent, Medicare has increased 137 percent, all at the same time where the family budget has increased about 36 percent. The Federal budget is outpacing the family budget by 3 to 1, 4 to 1. That cannot continue. 
   So, again, we come back to the basic question. Is Washington spending too much, or are the American people undertaxed? I think the gentleman from Alabama has hit the nail on the head.

   Mr. HENSARLING. No, it went down again on a straight party line vote. It was a very simple amendment. Budgets are about priorities. At a time our Nation is fighting this war on terror, it was a very simple amendment. It said, you know what? Whatever figure we decide is the right figure for veterans' funding, and I know you can never give enough, but whatever it is, let's make sure we put a floor under it. Let's give it a firewall. Because too often what we find out in what we call the appropriations process up here, sometimes these funds get raided for other purposes, just like Congress has too many times raided the Social Security fund. 
   So this was a simple amendment that said we are going to put a firewall around veterans' spending, and the number that we put in the budget is sacrosanct. Every single Democrat on the Budget Committee voted against that amendment. They voted against veterans. It was not a proud day for the institution.

   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for his contribution this evening. I thank him for his leadership on the Budget Committee. And he has brought up a very important point, Mr. Speaker, that we have yet to talk about this evening, and that is, as the Democrats offer up their single largest tax increase in American history, that is like the appetizer. That is the appetizer. 
   As the gentleman from Alabama talked about his family, and he has a wonderful family, and we all think about our children and our grandchildren, but do we really think enough about them? Because let me tell you, the single largest tax increase in history is just the start. The Comptroller General, the Chief Fiduciary Officer of the Federal Government has said that if we don't begin to reform entitlement spending, this spending explosion in Washington, unless, as a society, we find a better way, a smarter way to deliver health care and retirement security at a more reasonable cost, we are going to be on a path to double taxes, double taxes on our children and grandchildren in just one generation. And that is why I say, the single largest tax increase in American history, that is just the appetizer. The entree is, because the Democrats have no reforms, no reforms of entitlement spending in their budget whatsoever, which is the single largest fiscal challenge we face, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of Management and Budget, the Federal Reserve Chairman, the Secretary of Treasury, anybody who is responsible for fiscal or monetary policy in America, the Democrat budget is silent on it. They are putting us on a path to double taxes on our children. And the Comptroller General, and I paraphrase, has said, we are on the verge of being the first generation in American history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living. 
   And as the father of a 5-year-old and a 3-year-old, I will not stand idly by and let that happen. I will raise my voice about this single largest tax increase in American history. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are joined by another great freshman member of the Republican Party who has been outspoken on these budget issues and somebody else who hasn't lost his ability to be outraged on how this will impact, the single largest tax increase in American history will impact the people in his district. And I am happy now to yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan).

   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman from Ohio for joining us this evening, for this debate about the very important budget that will be introduced and debated on this floor tomorrow, Mr. Speaker. 
   Another aspect of this debate that is important to note, and I am sure we will hear from our friends on the other side of the aisle, the Democrats, how tax relief over the last several years has somehow been a bad thing for America. 
   I might note, Mr. Speaker, that as we have given small businesses and America's families tax relief, guess what we have? We have more tax revenue. And, in fact, Mr. Speaker, we have more tax revenue than we have ever had in the  history of America. We are awash in tax revenue. Why? Because if you let the American people keep more of what they earn, they will save, they will invest, they will work hard. They will expand the automobile transmission shop on one street corner. They will go out and start a barbecue stand on another street corner. It is called entrepreneurial vision. People go out and roll up their sleeves and work hard, and that is what they have done. 
   And not only, Mr. Speaker, are we awash in tax revenue. In this case, tax relief has proven to be part of the deficit solution. We also have new jobs. Since we have had tax relief, we have created 7 1/2 million new jobs in America. 7 1/2 million new jobs. The greatest health care program, the greatest nutritional program, the greatest housing program in the history of America is the American free enterprise system and the jobs that it creates. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, if the Democrats go through with their program to have the single largest tax increase in American history, you start taking the jobs away. And somehow they call it compassion when they hand you a government check and they take away your paycheck, because when they increase taxes on American families and they increase taxes on small businesses, they take away our jobs. They take away our careers. They take away our futures. There is nothing fair about that, Mr. Speaker. There is nothing compassionate about that. 
   The Republican budget will ensure that hardworking American families are not burdened with further tax increases. The Republican budget will make sure that the next generation enjoys greater freedom and greater opportunity, and that vital programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security that are going broke, that we reform them and modernize them and that we can save them for the next generation. 
   The Democrat budget is absolutely silent, absolutely silent on the number one fiscal challenge to the next generation.     
   They present a budget for the next election, Mr. Speaker. We are presenting a budget for the next generation. 
   So I hope, Mr. Speaker, that the American people will follow this very important debate closely, because there are two different visions. One believes in the family budget; one believes in the Federal budget. One believes in American families keeping more of what they earn; the other believes in the single largest tax increase in American history. And it is not too late for us to vote for the family budget and against the single largest tax increase in American history.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule. 
   I am very disappointed that one of the most substantial portions of the bill will not be able to be debated today as it was in committee. That has to do with the entirety of the issue of what is known as ``assignee liability.'' It's a very important part of the provision. It deserves to be fully aired on the floor of the House. I am disappointed that the Rules Committee did not find this particular amendment in order. 
   Mr. Speaker, I submitted two amendments to the Rules Committee, one of which I have been led to believe the chairman of the full committee is going to accept. So it's kind of interesting, the one of the more controversial nature, and actually one that is more substantive, unfortunately, was not found in order. 
   Mr. Speaker, we know how important it is that we have a vibrant secondary market to add liquidity to that market so that people can realize their dream, the American Dream of owning their own home. Nobody denies that we face great challenges in our subprime market, and I don't think anybody denies that it has the potential to have a great disruption in our economy. But many of us question whether this bill is going to make matters worse or make it better. I believe, Mr. Speaker, it is going to make matters worse. 
   And one of the matters in the bill that is going to make matters worse is assignee liability. People who choose to invest by having a piece of a group of mortgages and they buy that on what is known as the secondary market, all of a sudden they are going to have legal liability for what somebody else may or may not have done. 
   So investors not just all over America, Mr. Speaker, but all over the world are going to have options that they look at on where they want to invest their hard-earned money, and many of them are going to say all of a sudden there is all this murky uncertainty, Do I really want to invest in the secondary mortgage market when all of a sudden somebody could turn around and sue me? I didn't originate the mortgage. I don't know the homeowner. I don't even know the person who signed the loan documents. I'm just trying to have an investment for my family, and all of a sudden I can be held liable. Maybe I'll go invest in something else. 
   At a time when we need even more liquidity in the market this provision will lead to less liquidity. 
   And all of a sudden we have this murky legal standard. All of a sudden we have got loan originators having to identify loan products that are ``appropriate.'' Well, if you want to talk about a standard that's in the eye of the beholder, it's ``appropriate.'' We talk about ``net tangible benefit.'' Well, who is supposed to determine that? How is that going to be discerned? Loans with ``predatory characteristics,'' well, one person's predatory characteristics may be another person's homeownership opportunity. 
   We still have to remember, Mr. Speaker, that for all the subprime loans that have gone bad, millions and millions of Americans have had an opportunity to own their first home because of the subprime market. And  here we are again moving in the exact opposite direction. And I think that this assignee liability, this could prove to be a trial attorney's dream and a homeowner's nightmare. And I am very disappointed a major portion of this bill that was debated in committee will not be debated on the full floor. 
   For this reason, I would certainly oppose this rule and oppose the underlying bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I continue to be concerned about the increased liability exposure that is being introduced into the market creating even greater uncertainty at a time that many of us believe that we need even more liquidity in the market as we're looking at facing all of these subprime adjustable resets. 
   So, again, I find it somewhat odd that when we look at the Federal Reserve that appears to be pushing on the accelerator, this committee wants to push further on the brake. 
   And anytime you add increased liability upon a standard that many of us believe to be highly subjective, dealing with such terms as ``appropriate,'' ``net tangible benefit,'' ``predatory characteristics,'' you are going to chase more people out of the marketplace. Fewer people are going to want to originate these mortgages. You are deciding de facto with this amendment that there is some portion of Americans who are going to be denied their homeownership opportunities. Now, I can't tell you what their names are. I don't know exactly who they are. But there are just millions and millions of Americans who are just barely going to qualify to be able to get into their own home or keep their own home. And I hear from them every single day. 
   I've heard from the Kirkland family in Athens, Texas, in the Fifth Congressional District that I have the honor of representing. They wrote to me: ``Dear Congressman, I think Congress should not ban subprime loans. I think it lets people buy a home, improve their life, and own a piece of the dream.'' 
   Now, this bill doesn't outlaw all subprime loans. The amendment doesn't outlaw all subprime loans. But there is a universe of subprime loans that de facto are going to be outlawed by the increased liability exposure in this amendment, and people like the Kirkland family will no longer own their home, and that is wrong.

   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I do rise in opposition to what I conclude to be a bad bill for homeowners in America. I do want to acknowledge, though, the efforts of the ranking member to take a bad bill and turn it into a less bad bill. There is no doubt that this Nation faces a great challenge in the subprime market, no doubt about it at all. I am convinced, though, that this piece of legislation is going to make it worse, make the situation worse, and not make it better. 
   The first thing we need to remember as legislators is first do no harm. What should Congress do to make sure this doesn't happen again? Clearly, there has to be enforcement. There's no doubt that fraud has taken place within the subprime market. But we also need effective disclosure so that consumers know the types of transactions in which they are entering. We need greater financial literacy. I agree, yes, that there must be mortgage broker registration. But what Congress should not do is essentially outlaw the American Dream for many struggling families who may be of low income, who may have checkered credit pasts. By bootstrapping more, more mortgage transactions into the HOEPA standard, that is what this bill does. 
   Also, by having assignee liability with all these amorphous legal doctrines and phrases that no one understands, you will drive investment away from the secondary market at exactly the time when it is needed more. As the market has perhaps even overcorrected, we need more liquidity. This bill takes us to less liquidity. 
   I heard from one of my constituents recently from Forney, Texas, a lady by the name of Connie Taylor. She wrote me and said: ``If it hadn't been for subprime lending, I wouldn't have my house now. My credit was destroyed because of divorce. I worked hard for 5 years to clean up that credit.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, we shouldn't take away homeowner opportunity from Ms. Taylor in Forney, Texas, and all the other millions of people who may have checkered credit pasts. Because of that, I urge that we defeat this legislation.

   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I too share great concern about this amendment. I've had concern about assignee liability in this legislation to begin with. But I at least recognized the benefit of having a so-called safe harbor provision. 
   As I looked at the safe harbor, I was somewhat fearful that there were still some dangerous reefs that were lurking beneath the waves. I'm fearful if this amendment is passed not only will those dangerous reefs be present, but any harbor will have disappeared as well. 
   Again, we need to step back and decide, on this entire issue of assignee liability, when we look at all the resets that are due to happen in the market, will this legislation add liquidity to the market? Will it subtract liquidity from the market? 
   For people who are trying to keep their homes, over and above whatever the market is providing, are the actions of us in this body going to exacerbate the situation and dry up even more liquidity? 
   I think this is a major amendment, that whatever balance was struck in this area completely removes that balance. And I think it will provide for an explosion of liability exposure that could be very, very damaging to the secondary market. 
   I've heard the distinguished chairman of the committee on a couple of occasions refer to Chairman Bernanke's comments on the subject. And I'm not sure I've seen where he's actually advocated assignee liability, although he has acknowledged that, under certain circumstances, in a very limited situation, it might be helpful. 
   But I also saw in his testimony before our committee, if I can quote from the chairman: ``We've seen from different States different experiences and there have been examples where assignee liability provisions have driven lenders out of the State.'' 
   Let's not drive them out of the Nation. Let's reject this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Chairman, there are clearly many reasons why home loans go delinquent. The number one reason, we all know, is the loss of a job, or other bad luck like long-term illness or disability. Clearly a phenomenon that has been discussed at quite some length in committee and on the floor, predatory lending has played a significant role as well. And many of us have urged very robust antifraud provisions and increased resources for enforcement. 
   But I think we also shouldn't underestimate the role of another phenomenon in home loans becoming delinquent, and I call that predatory borrowing. People who knowingly take advantage of the system, who game the system, who give false information in their disclosures and their verifications. And making the risk-based analyses that lenders use to determine how much money a person should be responsibly lent makes that impossible. And there are borrowers, there are borrowers all across America who have knowingly exaggerated their incomes. They represented that they used a home for their primary residence, and they didn't. They acted as straw buyers in property-flipping schemes and used other scams to qualify for loans that otherwise they would not have qualified for and loans that they cannot pay back, and to a great extent many other people are now suffering. 
   And the result of this predatory borrowing is predictable: higher foreclosure rates; reduced availability of credit in the market; fewer homeownership opportunities for those low-income people, those people who may have a checkered credit past but who are honest, who are responsible, and who just need a second chance. 
   So, Madam Chairman, I think this is a very, very modest amendment today that would simply remove the civil liability of a lender and cancel the right of rescission for a borrower in instances where the borrower knowingly lied on their mortgage loan application. 
   Borrowers who have done this, who have misled lenders into giving them these loans, should not be able to turn around and then sue the lender and be able to rescind those loans to compound their deception with some kind of financial advantage. I hope that most, if not all, of us would hopefully conclude that that is an absurd and perverse result. One should not profit from their dishonesty. 
   I certainly appreciate the chairman's willingness to work with me on this amendment. I have been led to believe that he supports it. And although I respect the views of everybody in this committee, I have clearly said that I do not believe this bill should pass. But if it does pass, if it does pass, there does need to be some minimal acknowledgment of the role of personal responsibility and of predatory borrowing. And I urge the adoption of the amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Speaker, Republicans have come to the floor this afternoon to prevent a huge Democrat tax increase from taking place on millions of working families across America. 
   Democrats have come to the floor to pay for their tax increase with yet another tax increase. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, they call it the PAYGO rule. It fits nicely on a bumper sticker. Now, supposedly it means if you increase spending here or you have tax relief there, somehow you pay for it. But when I look at the budget, I see that Medicare has grown by almost 9 percent. They didn't pay for that. It was exempt. I saw Medicaid grow almost 8 percent. That was exempt from their PAYGO rule. Social Security increased 5 1/2 percent. That was exempt from their PAYGO rule. Discretionary spending, 38 percent of the budget, well, PAYGO doesn't apply to that, either. And now they bring a 1-year AMT delay bill that's also exempt from their PAYGO rule. 
   This proves that the Democrats' PAYGO rule has gone from a fig leaf to no leaf. Let's reject it.

   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to thank him for his leadership. He is one of the outstanding freshmen Members that we have on this side of the aisle. His leadership in helping protect the family budget from the Federal budget is noted. It is noted in this body, and certainly noted in his district and increasingly being noted nationwide. So I thank him for his leadership in bringing this amendment to the floor. 
   Mr. Chairman, I think this is a very, very important amendment, and I listened carefully to chairman of the committee and his words. I think again, as I said yesterday on this House floor, that much good work has been done on this legislation. 
   But I do take exception when he uses the term that this amendment amounts to a devastating cut. Again, people are entitled to their own opinions, but they are not entitled to their own facts. This amendment simply says this appropriations bill will be funded at last year's level. 
   Now, last I looked at Webster's, and looked up the definition of cut, it means to reduce an amount. We are simply asking, in extraordinary times, that government somehow not increase its budget. We are not talking about a decrease here. We are simply saying try to live on the same budget that you lived on last year. 
   Now, I do believe there is a place where the phrase ``devastating cut'' is applicable. 
   As the gentleman from Ohio aptly pointed out, more spending fueled more taxes. Again, that is a very simple nexus, but more spending will fuel more taxes. It's one of the reasons that we have seen within the Democrat budget the single largest tax increase in American history. 
   Now, that tax increase, when fully implemented over 5 years, is going to amount to roughly $3,000 for every American family. That is a devastating cut. That is a devastating cut to the family budget. 
   I hear from these families. I hear from families in my district, the Fifth District of Texas, that I have the honor and pleasure of representing. I hear from people like Bruce in Garland who writes, ``Congressman, in my particular case, additional taxes would cut into the finances I used to pay for my son's college education. I really believe that given more money, Congress will simply spend more money. That is not the answer.'' 
   I hear from Joy in Dallas, ``Congressman, I could not pay for a semester of college for my daughter if I had to send $2,200 more to the government.'' 
   I hear from Linda, also, in the City of Garland that I represent, ``If we had to pay an additional $2,200 each year, it would make us have to decide between food or medicine.'' 
   The list goes on and on and on. That is a devastating cut, the largest tax increase in American history fueled by more spending, some of which is contained in this bill, those are devastating cuts. Those are devastating cuts to hard-working American families. It's cutting their education program, it's cutting their health care program, it's cutting their American dream. 
   I certainly commend the chairman. Relative to some of these bills, this is a more reasonable approach. 
   But when we look at the largest tax increase in history, when we look at the looming entitlement crisis, and I was very grateful to hear the chairman acknowledge its existence in debate yesterday, but given all of those facts, can't we somehow raise the bar on how much we are going to spend on this Federal legislation and protect the family budget from the onslaught of the Federal budget? 
   There are two paths we can go down. One path leads us to an extra $3,000 of tax increases on the American family. 
   The other path tells the Federal budget, live with as much as you have lived with last year, and we will protect the American family from devastating cuts in their budget.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding and I thank him for his leadership in the Republican Study Committee and his leadership for fiscal sanity in this country. 
   Mr. Chairman, I regret that the chairman of the full Appropriations Committee is no longer on the floor. I have listened to his comments carefully. He alluded to some of the debate being part fiction. Well, I must admit, when I have my Democrat colleagues come to the floor and lecture on the subject of fiscal responsibility, I do feel like we are in the midst of a chapter in ``Alice in Wonderland.'' We hear our friends from this side of the aisle lecture us, well, it was you Republicans who voted for these budgets that increased spending. 
   Well, Mr. Chairman, again, you are entitled to your own opinions. You are not entitled to your own facts. Look at the record. Every time that the Republicans offered a budget that spent more money, Democrats offered a budget that spent even more. It spent even more. Look at the record. You have Democrats come to the floor, Mr. Chairman, and say, well, the Republicans are responsible for this very expensive prescription drug benefit program. 
   Well, they are right. But guess what? Their program cost even more. It cost even more. Then they say, well, under your watch, the national debt went up by $3 trillion. Well, the unfunded obligations, the debt that will be imposed on our children and grandchildren for their refusal to do anything about out-of-control entitlement spending, is $50 trillion. $50 trillion. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, I would be more than happy to take responsibility for $3 trillion when my friends from the other side of the aisle will take responsibility for the $50 trillion. They had nothing, absolutely nothing, stone-cold silence on entitlement spending in their budget, something that the Comptroller General says we are on the verge of being the first generation of American history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living. When will the madness stop? 
   Then I hear about these devastating cuts. How about the devastating cuts to the American family when their largest tax increase in American history is imposed? How about those devastating cuts? Then we hear about this meat-cleaver approach of an across-the-board cut. Well, my friends from the other side of the aisle didn't have any problem with a meat-cleaver cut of the American family budget of $3,000 per American family. How about that meat-cleaver cut? 
   What I am essentially hearing here, and I know much good work has been done on this bill, but I am hearing ``NIMBY.'' Sure, maybe there is a big entitlement crisis here, but ``not in my backyard.'' It needs to begin today.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, there are three different budgets that are offered by our friends on the other side of the aisle, the Democrats, today. They have many common elements. This one, perhaps, though, is the worst. It's the worst in that it raises taxes by the highest amount on working families all across America, especially at a time when they're trying to stretch their paychecks to make sure that they can keep a roof over their head, to make sure that they can fill up their cars and their pickup trucks, to make sure that maybe for the first time they're able to send somebody to college. 
   Now, we know that the main Democrat alternative, the one that ultimately will be voted on by the majority of our friends on the other side of the aisle, that has over a $600 billion tax increase included in it. That's roughly $3,000 for every family in America. That's the average tax increase that will be imposed upon families over the next 5-year period. 
   Now, this particular budget increases taxes by almost a third more. So I haven't, Mr. Chairman, quite had the time to do the back-of-the-envelope calculation, but who knows, maybe they're raising taxes by $4,000 per family. 
   And not unlike all the other Democrat budgets we hear, they're saying, well, we don't really want to raise taxes on working families, and we really want to give them tax relief. 
   But what I don't see, Mr. Chairman, is any effort whatsoever for people to put their vote where their rhetoric is. 
   If I've done my homework properly, over the last 6 years there have been 21 different votes on the House floor to stop these huge automatic tax increases that are part of current law. And yet, my guess is, and I don't have the list in front of me, that most of my friends on the other side of the aisle kept those tax increases, and so now they're going to be imposed on working people. 
   Now we're told, well, it's not really a tax increase. It's just the expiration of tax relief. Well, that's kind of interesting, because I can tell you that is a fine distinction that's going to be lost on the working men and women of the Fifth Congressional District of Texas. 
   If you wake up one day and your paycheck, if you're making the same salary next year that you made last year, and all of a sudden your taxes are higher, I can tell you, to the school teacher in Mesquite, Texas, that's a tax increase. To the rancher in Mineola, Texas, that's a tax increase. To a factory worker in Garland, that's a tax increase. So I know that it's very common and seems to be favorable within the Halls of Congress to say, well, there's no tax increase; we're just letting tax relief expire. Well, ultimately, especially in 2011 when the full brunt of this tax increase occurs, working families all across America will be hit, and it will impact, again, their ability to keep a roof over their head, their ability to send someone to college. 
   The Republican budget doesn't have any tax increases in it. It also, on the other hand, has no tax cuts in it. But what it does do is it prevents automatic tax increases that are part of current law from occurring. 
   Now, a second part of this budget, which is common with all the Democrat budgets, is it does nothing, nothing about the proliferation of earmarks. There's been a huge debate in the United States Congress about what to do about earmarks. 
   Now, Mr. Chairman, I'll admit not all earmarks are bad, but the system is bad. And our friends on the other side of the aisle told us they would come here and clean them up. They said they'd cut them in half. But last year we had the second highest amount of earmarks that we've ever had. 
   We were told there would be transparency, yet we had almost 300 of what we call air-dropped earmarks that just somehow appear mystically out of the heavens into these bills that nobody knows they're there and no opportunity to come to the House floor to debate. 
   And so here we have on the one hand, Mr. Chairman, we have working families struggling, struggling to stretch their paychecks, and yet our friends on the other side of the aisle want to perpetuate the status quo of earmarks, which many Americans are now waking up to the fact that all too often someone in Congress is taking a bite out of their paycheck so that some Member of Congress can keep theirs. It's not fair to them, particularly in tough, challenging economic times.     
   So in the Republican budget, we declare a year-long moratorium on earmarks. And we give that money to the taxpayer. We say, You know what, it's more important that you are able to pay your heating bill, and it is more important that you be able to put gasoline in your car than it is to fund some kind of monument to me as has been done for the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. It's more important that you have $2 million than some Member of Congress get a monument to himself. 
   We say it's more important, again, that the rancher in Mineola, Texas, is able to send a kid to college than it is to send $100,000 to make sure we have proper landscaping in the L.A. fashion district. 
   These are two very distinct differences. So we are having the largest tax increase in American history to pay for more congressional earmarks, and clearly this budget and every other Democrat budget needs to be summarily rejected by this body. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, I think it is very important for all the American people who are following this debate, we always hear these claims that all we're going to do is somehow tax the rich. Well, again we've heard the gentlelady from California say that this budget balances, but according to the Congressional Budget Office, headed up by a Democrat, their appointee, the only way that that budget balances or any of the Democrat budgets balance is by huge automatic tax increases that will take place over the next few years. And under the tax increases that will take place in current law, you're going to have 116 million taxpayers see an average tax increase of $1,800 a year. 
   More than 6 million low-income individuals and couples who currently pay no tax, no tax, will no longer be exempt. Approximately 48 million married couples will face an average tax increase of $3,000 a year. Low-income families with one or two children will no longer be eligible for the refundable child tax credit in 2011. Roughly 12 million single women, and we know that often to be poor in America is to be a single mother, 12 million single women will see their tax increases by $1,100 per year. And again, don't take my word for it, go to the Congressional Budget Office and look at the numbers and their impact on all the different tax brackets. Those who are at the lowest bracket today, the 10 percent bracket, are going to see their taxes increase 50 percent to a 15 percent bracket. 
   So I hope the American people are watching this debate very closely, because every time we hear the Democrats say, oh, we're just going to tax the wealthy, we're going to tax the wealthy, that's a sign for any working American to hold on to their wallet, Mr. Chairman. That's what that sign is. 
   And we're also debating today the AMT, the alternative minimum tax, which would have been more aptly named the ``absolute maximum tax.'' Well, when that was brought to the floor by Democrats in the first place, Mr. Chairman, we were told that's going to only impact 150 high-income Americans, and yet today we know it threatens 25 million Americans with an additional tax payment of over $2,000 a year. 
   So our friends on the other side of the aisle can't have it both ways. Either you do not balance the budget, or if you do, you certainly have no spending discipline in your budget, then you're doing it through the tax increases. And look at the numbers of your Congressional Budget Office. They say you will impose the single largest tax increase in American history. And it's not just aimed for the wealthy; it's aimed at all. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, I'm not sure the hardworking men and women of America need a chart to know how expensive gasoline is, and I was interested in my friend from Texas's history lesson. But there is a more recent history lesson that I believe the American people could benefit from. 
   Elections have consequences. The Democrats took control of the Senate and took control of the House in January of 2007. They've been in control of the Nation's economy now for 15 months. This is what the price of oil was when the Democrats took control of this body. Here's where the price of oil is now. Roughly double. 
   Since the Democrats took control of this body, Mr. Chairman, job growth has been cut in half, and the economy has actually lost over 80,000 jobs in the most recent 2 months. The average family's grocery bill has increased about $70 per month since the Democrats took control of Congress. The stock market has lost about 10 percent of its value since the Democrats took control of Congress. Home prices have fallen roughly 8 percent since the Democrats took control of Congress. Consumer price inflation has increased over 4 percent, the largest calendar year increase since the early 1990s, since the Democrats have taken control of Congress. That is the more recent history lesson that the American people can profit from. 
   There is another aspect, though, of these Democrat budgets that, again, I believe deserve very special attention. I want to again thank the ranking member for his insight into the peril that these budgets present to future generations and really the threat to the retirement security of our children and grandchildren because these budgets compromise it. 
   We know that Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security won't be around for future generations unless they are reformed. But I want to focus again on the fact that this budget and every Democrat budget will raise taxes on hardworking American families by at least $3,000 a month. 
   And what do they do with that money? They keep alive an earmark system that far too many Americans have rightfully concluded that all too often represent the victory of secrecy over transparency and special interest  over the national interest and privilege over merit. So they're going to raise taxes on American families $3,000 a year. And what are they going to pay for? Well, they are going to pay for things like $2 million to study yoga in the Defense bill that was placed in by a Democrat Member of Congress. And perhaps they don't have a bridge to nowhere, but according to CBS News, we have an arch to nowhere. A Democrat Member of Congress wanted to rebuild an arch in a park. 
   We fund the Doyle Center for Manufacturing Technology, named after a Democrat Member of Congress. I have already mentioned the Charlie Rangel Center. They raise taxes on the American people, $3,000 a family, to pay for the Charlie Rangel Center for Public Service. I've already mentioned the fact that they are spending $100,000 for the L.A. fashion district for ``signage and streetscape improvements.'' One of the district's main thoroughfares, Robertson Boulevard, is known as a ``great place to spot celebrity shoppers.'' The Democrat budgets keep these earmarks alive and well and raise taxes on the American people $3,000 a year to pay for it. 
   There's $231,000 for something called the Lincoln Airport Commission, an airport in Illinois that does not even exist, the executive director of whom apparently is on the staff of a Democrat Member of the United States Congress. 
   In order to raise taxes $3,000 a year on American families, the Democrats also continue to fund earmarks like $300,000, requested for a Democrat Member, to help train future employees of Hollywood movie sets. I'm sure the movie studios are struggling as they make their multimillions at the box office. And $2 million for the ``paint shield'' for protecting people from micro-bio threats, which was given to one specific company. No competitive bid. They just handed the money to Sherwin-Williams and said no need to compete. No need to show merit. We're going to raise taxes on the American family $3,000 a year to pay for more earmarks. And the list goes on and on. 
   Two very different budgets, Mr. Chairman. The Republican budget says enough's enough; declare a year-long moratorium on earmarks and fix this broken system. Every single Democrat budget, Mr. Chairman, says the status quo is fine. Let's keep these earmarks acoming. Let's make sure we take from the family paychecks so some Member of Congress can keep theirs. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I want to congratulate my friends on the other side of the aisle. Although we have very strong disagreements, I respect their principle and I respect the passion that they bring to the floor in this debate. We on this side of the aisle have our passion. We have our principles. And I think, Mr. Chairman, that it's important to note that no matter what Democrat budget you're talking about, there's really only one Democrat budget, and they differ from the Republican budget in many different ways. Theirs values the government budget. Ours values the family budget. Every Democrat budget, including this Progressive budget, will increase taxes on the American family, the largest single tax increase in American history, by over $3,000 per family. The Republican budget will prevent those tax increases while hardworking American families are trying to fill up their cars, send their kids to college, and put food on the table. 
   Second of all, every Democrat budget provides the highest amount of government spending we've ever seen. More government. If you think the answer to your problems is more government, then maybe you want this Democrat budget. If you think the answer to your problems is more freedom, more opportunity, a secure paycheck, and greater career opportunities, then you want the Republican budget. 
   The Democrat budgets are silent, silent on earmark reform. They want to preserve the status quo. They will continue to take a bite out of people's paychecks again so that some Member of Congress might keep theirs. 
   But for as bad as what these budgets do, they are even worse for what they don't do. They are stone cold silent on the number one fiscal challenge in the land, and that is out-of-control entitlement spending. Mr. Chairman, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security will not be here for future generations unless we reform them. We are on the verge of being the first generation in American history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living, double their taxes with just the government we have today. I will not sit idly by, nor will any Republican, and let that happen. 
   Defeat the Democrat budget. Vote for less government, more freedom, and our children's future.

   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the ranking member for yielding, and I certainly thank him for his leadership and all he does to protect the family budget from the Federal budget. 
   Mr. Chairman, today the American people are truly presented a tale of two budgets. Look at the Democrat budget: a $683 billion tax increase, the single largest tax increase in American history. And, Mr. Chairman, it's about $3,000 out of every American family paycheck a year. This is written in the law. This isn't something they are planning. This is something written into law. And I hope, Mr. Chairman, that they'll reflect upon how this impacts working families in their district because I can assure you I hear from families in my district. 
   I heard from the Vance family in Maybank, Texas, in the Fifth Congressional District. They write: ``Dear Jeb, both my wife and I are cancer patients, and I can't for the life of me understand why anyone would think this Nation could survive such a huge tax increase at this time. As it stands right now, I would have to sell my house, lose my small business, and go without health insurance'' to pay the Democrat tax increase. The Republican budget: no tax increases. 
   Let's look at the spending side. No news here. The largest single budget in American history. More government programs, more government spending, more of the same. The Republican budget actually has spending control, holds discretionary spending to 4.3 percent, and still funds our Nation's priorities. 
   Let's look at the national debt. What did the Democrats bring us? The single largest 1-year increase in the Federal debt. The Republican budget balances the budget in 2012 without, I repeat, Mr. Chairman, without tax increases. 
   Let's look at earmarks. The Democrat budget: status quo. They want to continue the earmarks. While they are raising taxes on hardworking American families $3,000 a year, just look at what they did last year.     
   There was $100,000 for landscaping for the L.A. fashion district; $300,000 to train people to work on Hollywood movie sets; $2 million, $2 million so they could create a monument to one of their Members, all while putting the single largest tax increase on American families. Now let's think about entitlement spending: Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. They're not going to be around for my 6-year-old daughter or my 4-year-old son unless we reform these entitlements. 
   The Democrat budget? Stone cold silent. What does that mean? Listen to our former Comptroller General: ``The rising cost of government entitlements are a fiscal cancer that threatens catastrophic consequences for our country and could bankrupt America.'' 
   The Republican budget reforms these programs. It is a budget for the next generation. Theirs is a budget for the next election. Two completely different visions, Mr. Chairman. Theirs is a vision of more government, less opportunity, and higher taxes. Ours is about greater economic security and a brighter future for our children. We don't want to be the first generation in America's history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living. And that's what they do by remaining stone cold silent on the greatest fiscal challenge to our Nation. We can have a brighter future for our children, but we must enact the Republican budget.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (PORK-BARREL SPENDING -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Speaker, we come tonight to speak about the subject of pork barrel spending at a time when hardworking, middle-income American families are having to cut back on their spending. They're having to cut back on their spending because their paychecks are shrinking; they're shrinking with the high cost of energy; they're shrinking because of the high cost of food. 
   Since the Democrat majority took control of the economic policies of our Nation almost 18 months ago, gasoline has now approached $4 a gallon. Milk is already over $4 a gallon. And all over America people are driving to their convenience stores or driving to their grocery stores, making a decision about gasoline and milk. 
   It's tough times for hardworking, struggling, middle-income families. And yet, the Democrat majority, in their Budget Resolution, the conference report--which, of course, is the agreement between the Senate and the House--their budget today was passed that included a tax increase on these very same families of $3,000 for the average family of four to be phased in over the next 3 years, Madam Speaker. Again, while they're struggling to send their kids to college, struggling to make their mortgage payments, struggling to fill up their cars, this is what's happened. 
   Well, what is fueling the tax increase that the Democrat majority has imposed upon middle-income families throughout our Nation? Well, there's a culture of spending. They presented a budget that represents the highest amount spent in the history of America. There is a culture of spending, and it is fueled by irresponsible pork barrel spending, also known as ``earmarks.'' 
   Now, when the Democrat majority was in the minority, they made a number of promises. They said earmarks were out of control under the Republican majority. And Madam Speaker, you know, to some extent they were right. But this is a Republican Conference that has learned its lesson. But commitments were made by the Democrat majority that have not been kept. 
   First of all, the Speaker of the House said we're going to come and we're going to cut earmarks in half. But instead, Madam Speaker, what did we get? Last year, 11,610 items of pork barrel spending put into spending bills by the Democrat majority, the second highest level ever in American history, totaling approximately $17 billion. Now, some people say, well, $17 billion isn't a whole lot of money. Well, Madam Speaker, I hope I'm never in Washington so long that I think $17 billion is not a lot of money. Millions of Americans could pay their annual gasoline bills with the money that's being spent on the pork barrel spending in Washington, DC. That's enough money to preserve the child tax credit, which under the Budget Resolution passed by the Democrat majority is going to disappear. And so I think that is a lot of money. And not only is it a lot of money, it represents waste. 
   And too often what we see in this pork barrel spending promulgated by the Democrat majority is that we see a triumph of secrecy over transparency, and we see a triumph of the special interests over the national interests, and we see a triumph of seniority and privilege over merit. Now, again, the Democrat majority said they were going to do things differently. Madam Speaker, then minority leader, now Speaker  Nancy Pelosi said in USA Today that there has to be transparency. ``I would just as soon do away with all the earmarks,'' right here, USA Today, late 2006. And instead, if we read the spending bills, what we find out is, out of 435 Members of Congress, she's in the top 20, top 20 of pork barrel spending. 
   Then, chairman of the Democrat Congressional Campaign Committee, Rahm Emanuel, said, ``Well, for far too long business as usual has involved individual Members doling out favors in appropriations and other bills through earmarks. The American people deserve to know more than who sponsored special interest legislation. They deserve earmark reform that puts an end to special interest earmarking and prevents the practice of earmark abuse.'' 
   Now, Madam Speaker, that's what they said before they became the majority party here. But what do we see now? And don't just take my word for it, but let's look at what just happened today. Today, as the farm bill was passed, what do we have in there? We have, again, pork barrel spending that apparently appears out of nowhere. We have slush funds for ski slopes. We had the language slipped by the Democrat majority into the farm bill that would benefit a Democrat Senator in Vermont. It would require the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service to sell portions of the Green Mountain National Forest exclusively to the Bromley Ski Resort. And the ski resort advertises, ``Bromley's grooming and snowmaking are second to none, and with our 44 trails of varied terrain, from treed glades & true New England cruisers to sun soft expert mogul fields, everyone in your family will be smiling all day long.'' Well, Madam Speaker, I'm not sure the American people, who have to put up with this kind of earmark abuse, I don't think they're smiling. Now, maybe the people who own the Bromley Ski Resort in Vermont, they're smiling, you know, they got a nice little deal in the agricultural bill. 
   Then we had a quarter of a billion dollars slipped in for the Senate Finance Committee Chairman, Max Baucus, to help the Plum Creek Timber Company in Montana sell a parcel of land to the environmental group called The Nature Conservancy. Now, technically, they get to claim a $250 million tax refund even though they're a nonprofit institution and they don't actually pay taxes. 
   Now, the language was quite careful, Madam Speaker. It was very careful and clever. They wrote this language, they didn't name this particular earmark, but they wrote it in such a way that it only applies to one parcel of land in the entire United States of America, and that is that belonging to the Plum Creek Timber Company in Montana. 
   And then, Madam Speaker, we have $170 million for the salmon earmark requested apparently by our own Speaker, Nancy Pelosi. Clearly, there is something fishy in the farm bill. 
   Now, we were told again that we wouldn't have these earmarks, this pork barrel spending that just kind of drops down from the heavens in these conference reports. We never had a chance to vote on this in the House, Madam Speaker, it just kind of drops down. And so for a Speaker who is supposed to lead by example, who tells the American people that she would just as soon do without earmarks, that she wants an open and ethical and transparent process to slip a $170 million fishy earmark into the farm bill, this is something the American people need to know. 
   Why are their taxes being raised by $3,000 per family of four over the next 3 years? Well, part of the reason is, Madam Speaker, to pay $170 million for the salmon earmark in the farm bill, to help subsidize the Plum Creek Timber Company, to help the Bromley Ski Resort. So much for cleaning up the earmark process. 
   You know, we were also told that there certainly wouldn't be any more secrecy in this earmark process. 
   You know, the former chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee told us that. Yet, that's not the case. Let me quote from the New York Times, not exactly a bastion of conservative thought, on one of the bills that came to this floor last year. ``Despite promises by Congress to end the secrecy of earmarks and other pet projects, the House of Representatives has quietly funneled hundreds of millions of dollars to specific hospitals and health care providers.'' ``Instead of naming the hospitals, the bill describes  them in cryptic terms so that identifying a beneficiary is like solving a riddle. Most of the provisions were added to the bill at the request of Democrat law makers.'' 
   ``Some Republicans have complained about what they call `hospital pork.' '' This is the New York Times reporting this. This, from a Democrat majority who said there would be no more secrecy. And instead, out of all the hospitals throughout the Nation that I'm sure can all use help, somehow the special privilege and secret pork barrel process practiced by the Democrat majority manages to somehow favor a special privileged few and does it in a cryptic secret manner. One more reason that hardworking, middle-income families who are trying to get that paycheck to go a little further are instead seeing that paycheck shrink to pay for more Democratic pork. 
   And, Madam Speaker, I'm very happy tonight that I am joined by one of the great leaders of fiscal responsibility in this House, one of the most principled Members, one of the most active Members, one of the most courageous Members that I have met in my congressional career. And I am proud that he is a fellow member of the conservative caucus, the Republican Study Committee, a man I am proud to call my friend. 
   And at this time, I would be happy to yield to the gentleman from Georgia, Dr. Price, for his comments.

   Again, Madam Speaker, I think it's important for us to reflect upon what the Democrat majority said they were going to do and what they have actually done. One of the prominent Members of the Democrat leadership, the gentleman from Illinois, who was, in the last election, the chairman of the Democrat Congressional Campaign Committee, where his job, obviously, is to find things for the Democrats to say to get elected. Well, one of the things that he said on behalf of the Democrat Party was, ``For far too long, business as usual has involved individual Members doling out favors in appropriations and other bills through earmarks. The American people deserve to know more than who sponsored special interest legislation. They deserve earmark reform that puts an end to special interest earmarking.'' 
   But yet, Madam Speaker, the system appears to be alive and well. Now that the Democrats have become the majority party, what do we figure out? Well, let's read from a recent column in the New York Times dated January of this year: 
   ``Representative John Murtha has procured eye-popping chunks of pork for contractors that he helped put in business in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Every one of the 26 beneficiaries of Mr. Murtha's earmarks in last year's defense budget made contributions to his campaign kitty, a total of $413,250, according to the newspaper Roll Call.'' This is the New York Times. Again, not exactly a bastion of conservative thought. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, I'm not here to imply that there is anything illegal about that activity. I'm not here to even imply that this in any way, shape, or form breaches House ethics rules. Now, perhaps it should. Maybe that's a debate for a different day. But you know what, Madam Speaker? It doesn't pass the taxpayer smell test. It doesn't do what the Democrats claimed they would do when they were in the minority. And now that they've been elected  to the majority, now that they've controlled this institution for almost 18 months, they are not practicing what they are preaching. 
   Here's another example. I quote from the newspaper Roll Call: ``A new political action committee, BEST PAC, created by the brother of House Intelligence Committee Chair Representative Silvestre Reyes, raised $50,000 this spring almost entirely from staff and clients of powerhouse lobbying shop PMA Group, and within weeks those same donors reaped millions of dollars in earmarks from Reyes and other Members of Congress closely affiliated with PMA ..... Most of the donations were made on May 7, 4 days before the intelligence panel approved the 2008 intelligence authorization bill, which included earmarks for several donors to the PAC ..... '' 
   Again, Madam Speaker, I don't imply that this was illegal. I don't imply that this somehow breached House ethics rules. And I'm familiar with the gentleman from Texas, and I believe him to be an honorable gentleman. But far too often what the American citizen sees is he sees his paycheck shrinking to pay for earmarks so that some Member of Congress can preserve his paycheck. And at a time when they are struggling to fill up their gas tanks, at a time when they are struggling to put bread on the table, it is an outrage, it is an outrage that this pork barrel spending continues on. And, unfortunately, Madam Speaker, what we are seeing under the Democrat majority is Members of Congress passing pork barrel spending, earmarks, whether recipients get it, and I guess they're showing their gratitude, and all of a sudden they come up with a campaign donation, and then the campaign donation ends up inuring to the benefit of that particular Member of Congress, and the cycle goes on and on and on. And, again, it may be legal. It may pass the House ethics test. It does not pass the American taxpayer smell test. And even though I've been a Member of Congress now for almost 6 years, I haven't lost my ability to be outraged, and this, Madam Speaker, is outrageous. 
   And now I'm very happy to say, Madam Speaker, that we have been joined by a distinguished member of our leadership, the chief deputy whip, a great leader in the earmark reform movement in the House, a man I am also very proud to call my friend, and I would be happy to yield now to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Cantor).

   Mr. HENSARLING. Again, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for coming down tonight and talking again about how the Democrat majority, unfortunately, seems to speak out of both sides of their mouth when it comes to pork barrel spending that is taking away from the paychecks of hardworking middle-income families so that Members of Congress can somehow keep their paychecks. 
   It is unfair. 
   And there's a big difference between the two parties. The Democrat party said they would do something about it. And they did. They put the pork barrel spending factory into high gear. The Republicans made mistakes when it came to earmark spending. That is one of the reasons that we lost in 2006. 
   But, Madam Speaker, we have learned our lesson. And that's why the Republican Conference supports a moratorium, a moratorium on this pork barrel spending, do away with this system and come up with a system that is more transparent and more accountable to the American people. 
   The Democrat majority hasn't called for anything like that. They are just  doing fine taking money away from middle-income families struggling to put food on the table, struggling to fill up their cars and pickup trucks, take that money away and spend it on monuments themselves and spend it on special interest favors for special interest groups. It has got to stop. 
   Madam Speaker, another great leader we have in the earmark reform movement in the United States House of Representatives, another fellow member of the Conservative Caucus of the Republican Study Committee is the gentlelady from North Carolina. 
   And I am happy to yield time to her at this time.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Again I thank the gentlelady from North Carolina for coming here tonight to participate in this Special Order and to try to stand up for the hardworking middle-income American families that are seeing their paychecks shrink. And one of the great  reasons their paychecks are getting ready to shrink even further is because of a budget resolution conference report passed today that includes the single largest tax increase in American history, passed courtesy of the Democrat majority that will pose a $3,000 average tax increase on a family of four of America while they are struggling to fill up their cars and while they are struggling to put food on the table. 
   Why are taxes having to be increased? Well, Madam Speaker, part of the reason is because of the culture of spending fueled by these wasteful, pork barrel spending earmarks.     
   They continue to proliferate and explode under the Democrats. 
   I mean, what kinds of earmarks are the American taxpayer having to pay for? Well, one includes a monument that a single Member of Congress decided to dedicate to himself. It's called the monument to me, to benefit the chairman in the House Ways and Means Committee, Charles Rangel. 
   Let me quote from the Wall Street Journal. ``New York's Charlie Rangel provided smirks this week when news emerged that the Harlem congressman was humbly seeking a $2 million earmark to celebrate the `Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service' at the City College of New York,'' that much money so that one Member of Congress can build a monument to himself. These are tax increases on hard-working American families so that Democrat Members of Congress can build monuments to themselves. 
   Here is another one, let me quote from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. ``Representative Mike Doyle, a Forest Hills Democrat and staunch Murtha ally is an eager apprentice. One major achievement is the Doyle Center for Manufacturing Technology based in South Oakland. Mr. Doyle helped launch the center with a $1.5 million grant.'' Interesting. Here is another monument to another Democrat Member of Congress, and the list goes on and on and on. 
   Now, as the gentlelady from North Carolina said, not every earmark is bad, but the system is bad. The system fuels a culture of spending that is bankrupting hard-working American families as they are struggling to make that paycheck stretch. It is waste. It's an insult to these families to abuse their earnings in such a fashion. 
   I am very happy tonight also to see that we have been joined by one of the great conservative leaders in America, a former chairman of the House conservative caucus known as the Republican Study Committee and somebody who has been a mentor to me, a man I am proud to call my friend. 
   I am happy now to yield time to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Shadegg).

   Mr. HENSARLING. You know, it's interesting, we sit here and assume that a lot of people know what an earmark is and what pork barrel spending is. Probably the best way to define it is money that Congress takes out of their pocket to give to a specific entity that doesn't have to be competitively bid. It can go to one particular corporation. It can go to only one entity, and it doesn't go through any competitive bidding process whatsoever. 
   As the gentleman said, well, some Members of Congress say I know my district the best, and I am supposed to bring the pork home. 
   Well, the people in the Fifth District of Texas, they are not so interested in me bringing the bacon home, they want to make sure that Congress doesn't take it out of their smokehouse in the first place. 
   As the gentleman ably points out, when somebody is getting something for nothing, there is somebody else who is getting something for nothing.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Well, as a matter of fact, we have clearly documented that earlier this evening, and it's not just us saying it, The New York Times has said it, and I quote again, ``Representative John Murtha has procured eye-popping chunks of pork for contractors he helped put in business in Johnstown, Pennsylvania.'' 
   ``Every one of the 26 beneficiaries of Mr. Murtha's earmarks in last year's defense budget made contributions to his campaign kitty, a total of $413,250,'' this from the New York Times. 
   If the gentleman will allow me, again, under this Democrat majority, what we see too often is that Members of Congress direct earmarks to special interest recipients. They turn around and give campaign donations to the campaign, and then the campaign helps re-elect the Member of Congress, and the cycle goes over and over under this Democrat majority.

   Mr. HENSARLING. If the gentleman would yield, it's a good time to point out again what a difference there is between the two political parties on this issue. The Democrats claim they would cut these earmarks in half but they didn't do it. Instead we end up with the second highest number of pork-barrel spending earmarks that we have seen in the history of America. They claim no more secrecy in the process. Yet we know that we have secret earmarks come in to benefit a select number of hospitals. 
   It has been well documented. They claim they would bring integrity to the system, and yet we continue to see earmarks coming out of this end of Washington D.C., and we see campaign contributions coming in the other end. How convenient. 
   Then they claimed that we can't continue to tax, we can't continue to have bridges of nowhere for America's children to pay for, but apparently we can have museums to honor Democrat Members of Congress, apparently we can have money going to the so-called Hippie Museum. Apparently we can send money to help the L.A. fashion district with their signage and streetscape improvements.     
   The Republican Party has called for a moratorium on earmarks. This process needs to be reformed. The Democrat Party likes the status quo as it is. The leader of our party takes no earmarks. The leader of their party claims she would just as soon do without them; and instead, she is in the top 20 recipients of earmarks. 
   The Republican presidential candidate says I will veto any spending bill with an earmark. And you look at their two presidential candidates, one is in the top 10, and the other, although only in the bottom half, has still managed $91 million of pork-barrel spending. 
   To add her perspective, I am happy we are joined by the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn), and I yield to her at this time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this rule. 
   I find it fascinating that our Speaker, when she became our Speaker, said that we were going to have the most open democratic Congress in the history of America, and yet we have a rule coming to the floor that doesn't even allow dissenting voices to speak in general debate. 
   Our Speaker also at one time said the 110th Congress will commit itself to a higher standard, pay-as-you-go, no new deficit spending. But instead, we waive the PAYGO rule. And we baseline shop. I know that's inside baseball, but as the gentleman from California said, it's kind of like deciding you're going to pay last year's gasoline prices. Well, I wish we could do that. 
   And now we have the whole question of earmarks. Our Speaker at one time said that she would just as soon do without earmarks. Instead what we have are airdropped earmarks, secret earmarks coming in in a conference report that nobody can challenge, including one, apparently, according to press reports, that was requested by none other than the Speaker of the House. 
   And so for all of these reasons, Mr. Speaker, this rule ought to be defeated. This is too important of legislation to come before us to be treated in such a frivolous manner. 
   Now, let's talk about the matter at hand, the actual substance of the bill. At a time when we're looking at some of the worst food inflation in the last two decades, what do we have coming before us, Mr. Speaker? A bill that will pay out billions of dollars of taxpayer subsidies to a select group of farmers. You know, it kind of begs the question, Mr. Speaker: Why do we have a farm subsidy program? 
   You know, I'm thinking about all the people who are going to have to pay these billions of dollars in taxes to subsidize a select group of farmers. You know, I think about the auto mechanic in Mesquite, Texas; I think about the guy working at the grocery store in Mineola, Texas; I think about the school teacher or the factory worker in Garland; where is their government subsidy program? Why are we bestowing billions of dollars in subsidies on this one select group?     
   This is a relic of the New Deal. We are paying out money to millionaires. We are teaching more people to be reliant upon government programs. Now, Mr. Speaker, we need a farm program. We just don't need a farm subsidy program. 
   Let me tell you what farmers in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas that I have the honor of representing need. They need some relief in their energy cost. The energy that it takes to run their tractors, their combines, their farm equipment, and the cost of diesel, they need some relief there.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. And yet there is absolutely nothing that our friends do on the other side of the aisle to produce any American energy, to get us any more independent, to have independent American energy. 
   Also, we benefit one set of farmers at the cost of another. This continues the ethanol mandates. It continues the tariff on imported ethanol. Now, if you've got a bunch of corn growers, it may be very good for them. I would say they're in high cotton, but I guess they're in high corn. But it's not too good for the cattle raisers, not too good for the poultry people. It's not too good for the hog farmers or the other livestock people who are all of a sudden seeing their feed prices almost triple. What are we doing for them? 
   Then let's talk about trade. Ninety-six percent of the world's consumers live outside of America, and yet this is an anti-trade Congress under Democrat leadership. You had the Colombian Trade Agreement totally one way. Farmers and ranchers want to export, and they're being disallowed the opportunity to do that.

   Mr. HENSARLING. So we need a farm bill that promotes trade, Mr. Speaker. 
   Next, we need death tax relief for our farmers and ranchers. Somebody in the Fifth Congressional District worked his whole life building a farm and told me, ``Congressman, after the government takes theirs, there's just not enough to go around.'' You shouldn't work your whole life building a family farm only to have Uncle Sam take 55 percent. We need income tax relief. That's what a farm bill needs to help the true agricultural producers. Not a subsidy program, an assistance program for those who work hard.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I certainly regret I didn't have an opportunity to negotiate a Popsicle with the gentleman from Massachusetts. I am sure that would have been an interesting experience; about as interesting as this experience is in debating a bill which I feel has a lot to do with feel-good politics, a bill that is particularly unworkable, I fear may lead to de facto price controls, and really takes our attention off of the challenge that we face, and that is to increase American production of American energy. 
   As much as Members of Congress might like to do it, in over 200 years I have yet to see the ability to repeal the laws of supply and demand. And so  again, I am sure the gentleman from Michigan is very sincere, and I know that he has worked on similar legislation for quite some time, but when we talk about price gouging and an emergency situation, what are we doing to bring down the price of gas at the pump today. 
   Instead, we have a piece of legislation that is going to allow Federal regulators, bureaucrats that according to the gentleman from Massachusetts, appear to be the savior of the Nation, to tell us what is, quote, ``unconscionably excessive,'' and ``taking unfair advantage'' related to ``an energy emergency to increase prices unreasonably.'' So now we are going to have a Federal bureau come in and tell us what are reasonable prices and reasonable situations. 
   The FTC, the Federal Trade Commission, after Katrina researched this issue. They could find very little evidence of it. We have unconscionably high gas prices in America, but it has everything to do with a Congress that wants to put its head in the sand and produce no energy. 
   Our friends from the other side of the aisle, the Democrats, since taking over the energy policy of the Nation, since taking over the economic policy of the Nation 18 months ago, have overseen gas prices that are now 75 percent higher. They have attempted to beg their way, beg OPEC to somehow produce more and bring down the cost of energy. Well, if we can't beg them, maybe we should sue them. We have had legislation to sue OPEC. We are going to sue for lower prices at the pump. 
   Well, if that doesn't work, maybe we can tax. Let's tax oil producers. Well, Mr. Speaker, the only challenge with that is once you tax them, they turn around and put it in the price of the product, and the poor, beleaguered consumer who is going to the convenience store trying to decide do I buy a gallon of milk or do I buy a gallon of gas, he ends up paying for it. I mean, these are policies that are out of the 1970s. President Carter and a Democrat Congress tried them; they failed. We became more dependent using these types of policies on foreign sources of energy.

   Listen, we all agree, we need to develop renewables. We need to develop alternative sources of energy, but people have to go to work every day and take the children to school every day. This bill does nothing to help them. We need to produce American energy in America today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, 18 months ago, there was an election. The Democrats won. They won fair and square. And for 18 months, Mr. Speaker, they have controlled the economic policies and the energy policies of our great Nation. Let's look back and take a look at what has happened in those 18 months. 
   Since Democrats have taken control of these policies, the price of bread, Mr. Speaker, has increased 21 percent; milk, 26 percent; eggs, 34 percent; gasoline, the price that we pay at the pump, has increased 71 percent under the energy policies of this new Democrat majority. As an aside, in the last 18 months, the value of one's home has decreased 7 percent under their policies. 
   Mr. Speaker, tonight many of us have gathered to specifically talk about the energy policies of the Democrat majority and how they differ so greatly from the policies of the Republican party. 
   All over America, families are going to convenience stores and they are having to make a decision: Do I buy a gallon of milk, or do I buy a gallon of gas? They are having to make decisions about do I take my children to school, or do I go to work? Families are in pain, having seen their gasoline prices increase 71 percent. 
   What has the Democrat majority brought us in the way of an energy policy? Well, their first policy was to beg. ``Let's beg OPEC. Let's see if maybe we beg them, they will bring down the price of gasoline at the pump.'' 
   Well, that didn't work, Mr. Speaker. 
   What was their next policy? Their next policy was to sue. ``Let's sue OPEC. If we somehow bring in the trial attorneys, we will lower prices at the pump.'' 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, that didn't seem to work either. 
   Well, here is another one they want to try. ``Let's tax. Let's tax oil producers, and somehow that will bring down prices at the pump.'' 
   Well, something I remember from my eighth grade economics about supply and demand and cost. You impose another cost on a producer, well, he is going to do his best to put it in the price of the product. Well, in fact, that is what will happen. It almost sounds the like the policies of Jimmy Carter and a Democrat Congress of a bygone era which made us even more dependent upon foreign oil. 
   Here is another one: ``Let's try to castigate. Let's bring up people who produce energy and let's say nasty things about them and their companies and their families. Surely that will bring down the cost of energy at the pump.'' 
   Well, that hasn't seemed to work either. 
   The new one we tried today, the Democrat majority, ``well, let's outlaw people who charge unreasonable prices. Let's criminalize that activity.'' 
   What they never have thought of, Mr. Speaker, is why don't we try to produce more American energy in America? I mean, not only have they not thought about it, Mr. Speaker, they are moving in the complete opposite direction. They are passing policies that make it more difficult to produce American energy in America to bring down the cost at the pump. 
   In fact, in one of the many non-energy energy bills that this Democrat majority has brought to the floor, they passed a provision known as section 526 of Public Law 110-140 that would prohibit Federal agencies, in this case specifically the United States Air Force, from contracting, taking in long-term contracts in order to get energy from oil shale, tar sands, coal-to-liquids, alternative fuels, which is one, one of the ways that we could make ourselves more energy independent and quit relying so much on foreign sources of oil that are driving up the cost of gasoline at the pump. 
   Because of this section that was introduced in one of the many Democrat non-energy energy bills, or, as one of  my colleagues say, the Democrat lethargy bills, myself and the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Conaway, have introduced H.R. 5656, which almost has 100 cosponsors now, that would repeal this section, which would allow the Federal Government to contract for these alternative fuels to try to bring in more energy independence to help jump-start some of these alternative technologies, which is a huge part of the solution in order to bring down the price of gasoline at the pump. 
   Mr. Speaker, many of us will come to the floor to talk about this very critical issue to American families, and those who have town hall meetings know it is the number one issue on the minds of our constituents, as it well should be. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to lead this Special Order tonight. At this time I would like to yield to the coauthor of H.R. 5656, which would repeal this needless section making it more difficult to enact alternative energy policies, I would like to yield to the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Conaway, for his opening comments.

   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for joining us, and I certainly appreciate his illuminating comments. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope people listened very carefully to what the gentleman had to say. 
   First, again, since the Democrats took over the Nation's energy policies 18 months ago, the price of gasoline, as almost every working family in America knows, has increased, roughly, 70 percent in just 18 months. How does that impact working families in America? 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, I have the privilege of representing the Fifth Congressional District of Texas, and I go out of my way to make sure that I reach out to my constituents and understand the challenges, their hopes and aspirations, and I hear from them frequently. 
   I have recently heard from the Thomas family in Mesquite, Texas. They wrote to me. 
   ``Dear Congressman, to make up for the rising prices, we calculate the use of the car to make the gas last a week. Some things we no longer can buy. We have had to cut back on our groceries. We rarely have three meals a day anymore.''     
   Mr. Speaker, I know they don't mean to do it. I know there are men and women of good intentions, but under the Democrat energy policies, people in Mesquite, Texas, can no longer have three meals a day. That is the result of these policies. 
   Again, as they have tried to beg, castigate, tax and criminalize their way into lower gas prices, they have failed each and every time. What they want to do is produce American energy in America. As the gentleman from Georgia pointed out, under their policies, Mr. Speaker, 85 percent, 85 percent of our deep-sea resources are put out of bounds, out of bounds. And 75 percent of our onshore resources, out of bounds. 
   The Arctic area of Alaska where more than half of America's proven energy reserves reside, no, can't produce American energy there. Why wouldn't you want to do that when people are suffering? 
   Now there are so many different things that we need to do, but the most important thing that we need to do, Mr. Speaker, is produce American energy in America. I just read today where there was a huge discovery of petroleum off the coast of Brazil. In Brazil, they celebrated. What a wonderful thing, we have these huge new energy reserves. America must be the only country in the world that when we discover great energy reserves, it is a cause for mourning. Oh, no, we have oil. Oh, no, we have natural gas. Quick let's go out, let's make sure nobody can touch it. It is a point of shame. We can't have these natural resources helping working American families. 
   I mean, what a fouled-up policy, Mr. Speaker. 
   I am very happy that we have been joined tonight by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Carter) who knows all too well what the Democrat majority has done to put all of this energy out of bounds and who will speak to us more about what needs to be done in leasing our deep-sea resources and the Arctic area of Alaska. I am very happy to yield time to Mr. Carter.

I thank him for the valuable leadership that he provides us in the Republican Congress, and I particularly appreciate his comments, his illuminating comments on leasing and what it is that we can do as a Nation to provide more American energy in America. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker, elections have consequences. Since the Democrats took over the energy policy of this Nation 18 months ago, when they took it over, gasoline was selling at a national average of $2.33 a gallon. Today we know, Mr. Speaker, it is well over $4 a gallon in just 18 months. I'm not sure if history shows us any greater increase in the price at the pump in such a short period of time under the policies, again, of this Democrat majority. 
   Now, that's having a devastating impact, Mr. Speaker, on working families. And yet the Democrat majority refuses, refuses to do anything to produce more energy in America. And I think sometimes, Mr. Speaker, they forget about how their policies are impacting hard working American families. 
   Again, I have the privilege of representing the Fifth Congressional District of Texas. And I hear from my constituents often about the challenges they're facing having to pay this Pelosi premium, having to pay all of this extra money for gas. I recently heard from the Forest family of Mesquite, Texas. And they wrote to me, Dear Congressman, we cannot continue to operate this way. We have now canceled our life insurance policies, canceled our cable, scaled down our automobile insurance, and buy only the necessities at the grocery store. No movies or other luxuries. My son and his daughter have had to move in with us because he can no longer pay rent, day care, buy food, and pay for his auto insurance and gas to go to work. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker, I know they don't mean to do it, but the Democrat majority has got to wake up on how their no energy, no production policies are hurting working Americans. 
   People in Mesquite, Texas, are having to cancel their life insurance policies and take in their adult children back into their homes because they refuse, refuse to produce any American energy in America to bring down the cost of gasoline at the pump. That is a travesty, Mr. Speaker, a travesty. 
   And for further comments on the energy policies that we need in the Nation, and the need to repeal this Section 526 that for all intents and purposes will make it almost impossible to develop oil shale, tar sands, and coal-to-liquid technology, I once again want to yield to the coauthor of H.R. 5656, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway).

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (AMERICA'S FAILED ECONOMIC AND ENERGY POLICIES -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Again, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his leadership. I thank him for working with me and co-authoring, I think, a very important piece of legislation. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker, since the Democrats took control of the energy policy of this Nation 18 months ago, the price of gasoline has increased 70 percent to over $4 a gallon, having a terrible impact on working families all across America and the Fifth District of Texas that I represent. 
   I recently heard from the Gardner family of Dallas who wrote me: ``Dear Congressman, I am the proud father of an Eagle Scout. I know you are an Eagle as well. I have a younger son in the Scouting program. In order to afford sending our youngest to summer camp, we have had to cancel any summer family trips in order to afford the increased cost of fuel of sending our youngest to camp in Colorado.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I salute this family for their commitment to Scouting, their commitment to their son, but under the Democrat energy policies that have seen gasoline go to over $4 a gallon, families all across America are having to cancel their summer vacation plans. 
   Mr. Speaker, what's the answer? Well, I wish there was just one magic button or one magic wand that we could wave to get this done. There is not, but it has a lot to do with, again, producing American energy in America, and it is not just oil and gas. It is renewables. It is alternatives. 
   I am proud to say that our Republican Party has constantly, constantly supported renewable energy. In the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was almost $4 billion for the hydrogen fuel cell program, with the goal of launching hydrogen fuel cars by the year 2020; $3 billion dedicated to developing affordable, efficient and renewable energy technologies. We supported extending the renewable electricity production credit, the H Prize that would offer cash prizes for achievements in the development of hydrogen energy technologies, millions for biomass research, millions for solar research. Renewables are part of the equation. 
   Mr. Speaker, before I came to Congress, I was an officer in one of the Nation's leading retailers of green electricity. I'm committed to it. Mr. Speaker, I'm the father of a 6-year-old daughter and a 4-year-old son, and I hope one day that they are driving in hydrogen-powered cars. I hope that one day they will have solar cells on their roofs and no longer be tied to the electricity grid. 
   But in the meantime, Mr. Speaker, every day in America somebody needs to drive to work today. Every day in  America somebody needs to take an elderly parent to see a doctor. That's today. Somebody has to take their child to school. That is today. 
   There are wonderful renewable technologies, but I can tell you as one who has worked in the industry, for these to be commercially viable, for them to be scalable, these technologies are easily 10 years away, perhaps 15, and in some cases, 20. 
   Another part of the answer, Mr. Speaker, is diversification. China is building two to three nuclear plants a year. In America, we haven't built a new nuclear plant and we haven't had any new permits in 30 years, and yet we know nuclear power has zero emissions, no impact, no carbon footprint whatsoever. We need diversification. 
   Another thing we need to do, Mr. Speaker, under the Republican plan to bring down the price of fuel at the pump is reduce the number of boutique fuels. There was a time in America's history where if you drove from Spokane, Washington, to Kansas City, Kansas, to Dallas, Texas, to Miami, Florida, there's only one gasoline you bought. Now it may be as many as a dozen, which drives up the price and leads to spot shortages. 
   Mr. Speaker, not only have we doubled, we are twice as dependent on foreign sources of energy today as we were at the height of the Arab oil embargo. Not only are we importing more oil, we are now having to import refined gasoline. Why? Because we haven't built a refinery in a generation because of this worshipping at the altar of radical environmentalism. 
   And Mr. Speaker, sometimes I think my friends on the other side of the aisle have forgotten that people are part of the environment, too, and they're struggling. They're struggling to keep their job, pay their rent, fill up their cars. We have to expand American refining capacity. 
   And then we have to produce the energy we have. Mr. Speaker, we are blessed with great energy resources. We are the Saudi Arabia of coal. That's why I and the gentleman from Texas have introduced this bill to ensure that Federal agencies can contract to help to develop these promising technologies in coal-to-liquid. It's already being done in Britain, in Saudi Arabia. We can do it now if the Democrat majority would get out of the way and let us produce. 
   And our oil resources, Mr. Speaker, the Outer Continental Shelf, our deep sea resources, why is 85 percent of that outlawed? Why is it off the board? Why can't we produce there? 
   There are decades and decades and decades of energy just sitting there for the take, and again, the radical environmental left that helps control our Democrat majority won't let it happen. 
   The arctic area of Alaska, half of our proven petroleum reserves sit there in an area of America where almost no one lives. 
   Mr. Speaker, I get to represent a large portion of East Texas, and I can tell you, somehow man, nature and pump jack can coexist. They can coexist peacefully, and it can be done in Alaska as well. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I would hope that something as challenging as the high price of petroleum, that we could come together as Republicans and Democrats and work for the betterment of all the people in America. 
   But Mr. Speaker, you cannot outlaw supply and demand. You cannot do it. Demand has increased precipitously over the world, particularly in areas like China and India, and we're sitting on these great supplies, and we're the only Nation in the world that I'm aware of who sits on so much energy and refuses to produce it. 
   And instead, what does our Democrat majority offer us? Beg OPEC, sue OPEC, tax oil companies, castigate oil companies, impose a form of price controls. That does nothing, nothing to help American families. 
   The Republican plan will, and with that, I would be happy to yield to the gentleman from Texas.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, this has obviously been a spirited debate by men and women on both sides of the aisle who I respect. But I do think if the American people are watching this debate, and I hope they are, we need to dispose of one issue very clearly, and that is there is indeed a dictionary over on that part of the floor, and every amendment that was brought here today is either going to increase spending in this account or level funding. But according to the logic of our friends on the other side of the aisle, if you fund something at a lesser quantity than somebody else wants it, then you have a Draconian cut. Well, if they are increasing this bill 3.1 percent, that is a cut below 3.5 percent. It is a cut below 4 percent. 
   If all these programs are so good, why did you cut them? Why didn't you increase it 6 percent? Why didn't you increase it 8 percent? So let's dispose of that argument right now. 
   Again, the only budget that is being cut here, Mr. Chairman, is the family budget. And the family budget is being cut as part of this single largest tax increase in American history contained in the Democrat's budget resolution, which I know they tried to run away from. Now, they said earlier that: We know the cost of everything and the value of nothing. Maybe they need to know the value of hard-earned paychecks in American families. 
   So they need to think about the Zapata family in Kaufman, Texas, because when they put their tax increase on them, let me tell you what the Zapatas have to say. ``If taxes on my family are increased that much, this could seriously affect my life. My mortgage is adjustable and will most likely go up. If the taxes go up, it would be devastating, and I could face foreclosure.'' 
   They don't know the value of the paycheck to the Brooker family in Wills Point. ``No increase in taxes. My family is one breath away from losing our home as it is.'' 
   Those are the budgets that are being cut today, Mr. Chairman, not only by the single largest tax increase in American history, but they are about to bring a tax increase to try to fund their farm bill by taxing jobs. They are saying somehow foreign companies are evil when they come to America and they invest and create jobs, in my district among other districts. 
   So there is a real choice here: Increase the family budget, or increase the Federal budget. We come down on the side of the family budget.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Ohio, again, for his leadership in bringing this terribly needed amendment to the floor, his diligence in authoring this amendment on a number of these spending bills. 
   Again, although I wish we were debating other facets of the Federal budget today, I think it is very, very important to illuminate once again where we stand as a Nation on spending. 
   I was in a hearing earlier this morning in the Financial Services Committee. In that committee, we are talking about the possibility of a whole new Federal wind storm insurance program. I am not here to debate the merits of that, but it brought to mind that this Nation is facing a fiscal storm, and it's a storm that we see off our shore; but it is one that unfortunately, this body continues to ignore. 
   It continues to ignore this problem by growing the Federal budget at a huge multiple over inflation, growing the Federal budget way beyond the growth of the family budget. Ultimately, it's the family that has to pay for this, hardworking American families that are trying to pay for their transportation programs, trying to pay for their health care programs, trying to pay for their education programs. 
   I have no doubt that every single dollar in this bill can be used for a good purpose. There is not a doubt there, but when do we look at what happens in the aggregate? We have had spending debates going on for weeks and weeks now. Unfortunately, they do become somewhat similar. 
   But there are very important points that still need to be illuminated in this debate. Again, in every single spending bill brought to the floor, somebody can say, well, this is a good idea. But who goes back and looks at it in the aggregate? Whoever adds it all up and sees what we are doing to the least of these in our society, those who do not vote, and those who have yet to be born. I am speaking about future, future generations. 
   So all this amendment is asking to do, notwithstanding the language of the other side, this amendment seeks to cut nothing. This amendment seeks to level fund this particular appropriations bill, using the same funding last year that it will use this year. 
   Mr. Chairman, there are many people, many families all across America who would love the opportunity to make it on the same income they had last year, this year, this year to next year. So somehow we are trying to be convinced that something terrible and draconian is going on. 
   Frankly, our friends from the other side of the aisle always accuse us of cutting something. I wish, occasionally, that might be true. 
   But all spending is not created equal, and there needs to be priorities. There is no doubt that many items within this bill are a priority. But I don't believe it's a priority to impose an even greater tax burden on the American people, as the Democrats seek to do in their single largest tax increase in history. That shouldn't be a priority. 
   Nor should it be a priority to pass on debt to future generations, which ultimately I believe this bill will do. It  shouldn't be a priority to raid the Social Security trust fund, which, by definition, if we are running a Federal deficit, then any excessive spending continues to raid the Social Security trust fund. 
   So all we are asking is, is it easier to be on the road to fiscal responsibility and keep faith with future generations, or are you going to be on the road to fiscal irresponsibility and not keep faith? If you follow that road, here is what you are looking at. Listen to the words of our Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, who said: ``Without early and meaningful action'' to address government spending, particularly entitlements ``the U.S. economy could be seriously weakened with future generations bearing much of the cost.'' Those aren't my words. Those are the words of the Federal Reserve Chairman. 
   Now listen to scholars at the Brookings Institute, widely known as a liberal institution, no bastion of conservative thought: ``The authors of this book believe that the Nation's fiscal situation is out of control and can do serious damage to the economy in coming decades, sapping our national strength, making it much more difficult to respond to unforeseen contingencies and passing on an unfair burden to future generations.'' 
   Yet week after week after week we have spending bills coming to this floor, growing government way beyond the rate of inflation, growing government way beyond the growth of the family budget, and it's the family budget that has to pay for Federal budget. 
   So here we have just one more chapter in this book of fiscal irresponsibility. 
   Now, again, I know there are many good programs in this bill. But why were so many of the other bills costing billions and billions and billions and growing these budgets 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 percent more than last year? Again, too often people are focusing on one individual aspect of this budget, and they are not focusing on the budget as a whole. 
   Let's listen to the words of the Comptroller General, the chief fiduciary officer in America, who said that the rising cost of government, again, particularly the entitlement spending, is a ``fiscal cancer,'' fiscal cancer that threatens ``catastrophic consequences for our country and could bankrupt America.'' 
   Again, these aren't my words. These aren't the words of one lone Member. These aren't the words of the Member from the Fifth District of Texas. These are words of the people who most know about the fiscal condition of this Nation.     
   The Comptroller General has gone on to say, and I paraphrase, that we're on the verge of being the very first generation in America's history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living. 
   Mr. Chairman, like many others on this floor, I'm in the next generation business. I've got a 5-year-old daughter and a 3-year-old son, and I am not indifferent as to leaving my children and the children of America with a lower standard of living. I can't sit idly by while this House week after week after week spends our children's future, spends them into bankruptcy, threatens to double their taxes. That's the magnitude we're looking at, doubling their taxes. 
   And so this is a very reasonable amendment. Frankly, I wish the gentleman from Ohio had done even more on his amendments. But level funding, that's all we're asking, Mr. Chairman. When you look at the consequences, can we at least take a bill and get a little smarter, a little wiser and spend the same amount of money next year that we did this year? And, frankly, it's the future of our children and our grandchildren that are on the line.

   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, I rise tonight as one who typically comes to this floor to champion the cause of fiscal conservatism. But tonight, perhaps more importantly, I come here as the grandson of a farmer. I come here as the son of a farmer. I come here as one who grew up working on the family farm. 
   I have looked at the work of Mr. Flake and Mr. Kind, and I believe that this amendment is the one that is best for agriculture, and I think it is the one that is best for taxpayers. I don't like everything in this amendment. There is a lot I don't like about it. But I have got to ask myself, does it take me in a direction I want to go or does it take me in a direction I don't want to go? I think this work takes me in the direction I want to go, because it provides real reform. If you have got a program that's costing taxpayers $20 billion a year, maybe you need some reform. 
   If 10 percent of the recipients are receiving 33 percent of the egg, maybe you need some reform. If most of the subsidies are going to commercial farmers that have average incomes above $200,000, maybe you need some real reform. 
   Very importantly, for the agriculture producers in the Fifth District of Texas, our future is in exports. We want to export good Texas beef, and I'm afraid the committee bill is going to hurt trade. It will hurt trade. 
   We need to support this alternative.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (HOPE VI IMPROVEMENT AND REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, President Reagan once said that the nearest thing to eternal life on Earth is a Federal program, and I don't think there is any better case study than perhaps the HOPE VI program. If there was ever a program that cried out for termination, it's this one; termination so that the money used for this program can be returned to hardworking American families. 
   Many of us are acquainted with the history of the program, begun in 1992 with a very noble purpose of taking 86,000 units of severely distressed public housing and replacing them, demolishing them. 
   Well, guess what, Madam Chairman; it achieved its mission. But somewhere along the line we had this thing in Washington known as mission creep. What we should have done is probably given all the employees of the program a bonus, throw them a big party and say thank you for doing something good and achieving the mission of your particular program. But instead, somehow the program goes on and on and on. 
   Now, the Office of Management and Budget has said that this program is ineffective. If you look at their part rating of the Office of Management and Budget and start to study it, they ask very specific questions about the program, one of which is: Does the program address a specific and existing problem, interest or need? And the answer is no. The program has accomplished its primary goal to demolish 100,000 severely distressed public housing units by 2003. 
   Another question in the part rating of the Office of Management and Budget: Is the program designed so that it is not redundant or duplicative of any Federal, State, local or private effort? The answer again, no. HOPE VI is one of a select number of tools available to housing authorities to revitalize distressed or obsolete public housing. 
   So again, number one, we had a program that accomplished its original mission. We now have a program that is duplicative of other housing programs. And I know there are many who come to the floor who are very sincere and passionate in their belief that the only way to help low-income people is through government housing programs. I have a different philosophy. I have a different set of principles. 
   We already have 80-plus Federal housing programs, and the budget for Federal housing programs has almost doubled in the last 10 years, from $15.4 billion to more than $30 billion now. 
   And this percentage increase, almost double, is a rate, Madam Chairman, a rate of increase that is higher than veterans spending, education spending, energy spending, transportation spending, international affairs spending, and even Social Security over that same time period. 
   So, relative to our budget priorities, it's very hard to argue that somehow Federal housing programs have been shortchanged. I fear that HOPE VI simply compounds failure. We take failed housing projects, we start to demolish them, and then we fail to get rid of the program. 
   Again, I understand that some people and many on the other side of the aisle do not agree with my vision. They believe the only way to help is through other government programs, and if so, I would ask this, and I'm sorry that this didn't happen in committee. 
   I offered an amendment to transfer this money to the section 8 program. I think there are a number of challenges with section 8, but I certainly see it as a superior form of government assistance than these other programs.     
   And Member after Member on the other side of the aisle has complained that we have insufficient resources for section 8. Well, here's an opportunity. Now, unfortunately, that amendment was not ruled in order. I hope that one day maybe I can work with the majority in finding ways to take less effective government housing programs and perhaps transfer funds to more effective housing programs. 
   I also find it quite curious that many Members on the other side of the aisle complained about this program in hearings and in markups. So they complained about it and then sit here and reauthorize it. 
   And there are two other reasons that we should not support this. One is, it puts us on a trajectory to help double-spending to the next generation. Now, sometimes we have to make some tough choices. We are going to double taxes on the next generation if we don't do something about spending today. 
   And we should never forget that the best housing program is a job. And the greatest threat to jobs today is the threatened tax increases of the majority. That's where we ought to get our affordable housing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, we come here tonight to talk about an issue that is clearly the number one issue challenging families all across America, and that is the high cost of energy at the gas pump. In fact, Mr. Speaker, I was just ending what we call a tele-town hall meeting talking with the good folks of the Fifth Congressional District of Texas that I have the privilege of representing in the House of Representatives, and I would say out of, oh, I don't know, 15 or 20 questions that I was able to take, I would say probably three-quarters of them had to do with what is Congress going to do to help bring down the cost of gasoline at the pump. 
   All across America, Mr. Speaker, families are going to their local convenience stores and they are having to decide, do I buy a gallon of gas, or do I buy an a gallon of milk? I can't an afford to do both. At roughly $4 a gallon, working families in America cannot make ends meet. 
   You would think on something of this national import that this institution, that this great deliberative body, that the people's House would act. You would think maybe we would act in concert, Mr. Speaker, but at least we would act. Instead, we don't see it, Mr. Speaker. We don't see it. What we see is the Democrat majority saying, well, maybe we can somehow sue our way into lower gas prices. Let's sue OPEC. I don't know what we are going to do, Mr. Speaker. Are we going to send a legion of trial lawyers to the Middle East to sue OPEC? Is that somehow going to solve our problems with the price of gas at the pump? 
   Well, that didn't work, so they came up with the idea, the Democrats, let's tax the oil companies. Nobody likes them. Well, that is something that was tried in the seventies, and guess what? When you tax something, they will put it in the price and it raises the price to you. What we found in the seventies is that we became even more dependent upon foreign oil when we did that. 
   Now their latest idea, Mr. Speaker, is let's somehow say we are going to try to outlaw investment. They call it ``speculation.'' I thought in a capitalistic economy investment was a pretty good thing. 
   But the reason the price is going up is when we see that demand increases and there is no commitment to supply in the U.S., Congress, try as they may, cannot repeal the laws of supply and demand, Mr. Speaker. It can't be done, anymore than we can say that the sun no longer rises in the east. 
   So Republicans have a different plan. Actually, Republicans have a plan, the American Energy Act. And what we want to do is do all of the above. We want to support renewable energy. 
   Prior to coming to Congress, I worked for a renewable electricity company. I was very proud of the work that was done in the area of solar energy, in the area of wind power, in the area of biomass. It was an important part of my passion and my professional life, and Republicans support renewables. 
   We want to do more work in alternative energy, particularly in, for example, coal-to-liquids. We are the Saudi Arabia of coal, Mr. Speaker, but somehow the Democrats won't let us use it. They won't allow the Federal Government, for example, to enter into long-term supply contracts for these alternative fuels, oil shale, tar sands, coal-to-liquids. 
   Conservation is a very important part of the mix as well. But, Mr. Speaker, so is producing our oil and gas resources that we have in America. Why can't we produce American energy in America for Americans? And that is what the American Energy Act, supported by Republicans in the House, is all about. 
   All we ask for, Mr. Speaker, is in the people's House, can't we have a vote? But Speaker Pelosi will not allow a vote. She simply says, no, we are not even going to vote on it. The people don't even have a choice. 
   In fact, Mr. Speaker, recently the Washington Post, not exactly a bastion of conservative thought, said, ``Why not have a vote on offshore drilling?'' They recognize that Speaker Pelosi won't even allow a simple up-or-down vote. Let me continue to quote from their op-ed of July 25th: ``When they took the majority, House Democrats proclaimed that bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open, full and fair debate consisting of a full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives.''     
   Why not on drilling, the Washington Post says? Why not on drilling? 
   But again, as people are suffering in the small businesses, in the homes, in the coffee shops of East Texas that I represent, maybe they are not suffering in the salons of San Francisco represented by Speaker Pelosi and maybe that is why she doesn't necessarily understand the pain that people are feeling. And that is why it is so critical, Mr. Speaker, so critical that we get an up or down vote in producing some supply. 
   For all intents and purposes, Mr. Speaker, 85 percent of our offshore resources are illegal to develop. For all intents and purposes, Mr. Speaker, 75 percent of our onshore resources of oil and gas are illegal to develop. 
   Recently Brazil found a huge offshore find of energy, and the whole Nation celebrated. It seems like, in America, when we find energy it is some kind of point of shame and we want to cover it up and we want to make sure that nobody knows about it and nobody develops it. We appear to be the only industrialized nation in the world that won't develop its own energy. Again, Mr. Speaker, it is all of the above. We have got to do it all to bring down the price of gas at the pump. 
   So Mr. Speaker, I am very happy that I have been joined by some other colleagues who are real leaders in this institution in trying to create more American energy for Americans, in America, and help those families who are having to commute to work every day, who are trying to help take an elderly parent to the doctor, who are trying in just a couple of weeks taking their kids to school.  
   I just had a person tell me this weekend that they now are spending 1 1/2 days a week just to pay to commute to work. Out of a five-day work week, they are spending 1 1/2 days just paying to commute so they can get the 3 1/2 days of pay. That is just not right, Mr. Speaker. It is just not right. 
   And so again, I am glad I am joined by a couple of my colleagues here. And at this time I would be very happy to yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway) to get some of his comments.

   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for his leadership in this institution, particularly on the piece of legislation that we are working together on in trying to repeal something known as section 526, that disallows the Federal Government from entering into long-term supply contracts for alternative fuels to help jump-start that needed industry. 
   The gentleman from Texas brought up a number of good points in his comments. And, again, you would think this would not be particularly controversial. 
   Just last week, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve stated: A one percent increase in supply could lower prices by 10 percent. Now, that is the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. Supply matters. And yet, our friends from the other side of the aisle, the Democrat majority, refuses; not only do they refuse to produce any more American-made oil and gas, not only do they refuse to do that, Mr. Speaker, they won't even let us have a vote. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, if there is one thing that the American people could do tonight that would help bring down the cost of energy at the pump is go to their computers, go to their telephones, contact their Members of Congress and say, at least let's have a vote. Let's have a vote on the American Energy Act. 
   Survey after survey after survey shows that three-quarters, 80 percent of Americans want more supply and they want it now. We have to start today, Mr. Speaker. And it is just absolutely ludicrous when families are suffering, like the Gardner family of Dallas, Texas, that I have the pleasure of representing who wrote to me that, ``In order to afford to send our youngest to camp, we have had to cancel the family vacation due to the increased cost of fuel.'' 
   Family vacations all across America are getting cancelled because the Democrat majority will not allow more American energy to be produced in America. Since they have taken over, the energy policy in this Nation 18 months ago, the cost of gas has gone from roughly $2.50 a gallon to roughly $4 a gallon. Now, I am not saying it is all their fault, but they are moving this country in the complete wrong direction. 
   And now, Mr. Speaker, again I am very pleased that I have been joined by a number of my colleagues who have a lot of expertise on this issue of energy, and one of the great leaders we have on this side of the aisle is the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus). I yield to him at this time.

   Mr. HENSARLING. And if the gentleman would yield again, I had asked the question earlier, what is preventing us from taking advantage of American resources on American soil? 
   Isn't it also true that recently the Democrat majority passed legislation known as Section 526, that prevents the Federal Government from entering into long-term energy contracts, something I believe the United States Air Force wanted to do to wean itself away from foreign oil and develop coal to liquids on American soil; but yet our friends on the other side of the aisle, I believe, have prevented our Pentagon or our United States Air Force from doing that. Is that correct?

   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his leadership on this issue, his leadership on health care issues, his contribution to the Republican Study Committee which is sponsoring this special order, Mr. Speaker. 
   Again, this is the number one issue, Mr. Speaker, that our constituents write about, call about. They're concerned about. I hear from them every day. 
   I just recently, Mr. Speaker, heard from the Forist family in Mesquite, Texas, that I have the honor of representing in Congress. And they have a small business. They wrote in. 
   ``My husband is an owner operator and the cost of fuel is $1600 a WEEK. We're not making a profit. We can't  continue to operate this way. We have now cancelled our life insurance policies, cancelled our cable, scaled down our automobile insurance, and buy the necessities at the grocery store.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm getting letters like this every single day, and yet the Democrat majority will not support legislation to produce more American energy in America for Americans. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, we agree with the Democrats on many things. We believe that there should be more conservation, and most Republicans have supported the various tax provisions that do that. Mr. Speaker, we agree on renewable energy. I was an officer in a renewable energy company prior to coming to Congress. 
   There are very exciting technologies, and most Republicans have supported those programs. 
   But where we go in different directions, Mr. Speaker, is that the Democrats want to make illegal the production of energy in 85 percent of our offshore resources and, effectively, 75 percent. They don't believe that producing more oil and natural gas has anything to do with the cost of price at the pump. They're trying to repeal the laws of economics. 
   Well, in fact, Mr. Speaker, what the Speaker of the House has said recently, ``This call for drilling in areas that are protected is a hoax. It's an absolute hoax on the part of the Republicans and this administration.'' Speaker  Nancy Pelosi 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, for those who are listening to this special order, they may have a different opinion. Public opinion policy shows that 85 percent of Americans want to produce more American energy in America for Americans. Maybe they may want to call 202-224-3121 and register their opinion with the Speaker of the House. 
   Now, again, I don't know how they feel about the high cost of energy in the salons of San Francisco, but I can tell you in the small businesses and the farms and ranches of the Fifth District of Texas, those people are hurting. 
   And now, Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield time to another great Member of this institution who has been a leader on the issue as well, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady).

   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for helping remind this body--and I think everybody in this body agrees--that we need more conservation. Everybody in this body believes that we should have more renewable energy and that it's the key to our children's future. Where we depart with the Democrat majority, Mr. Speaker, is we believe that, when 50 percent of our proven resources--petroleum resources--in Alaska are illegal to develop, there's a problem, that when 85 percent of our offshore resources are illegal to develop, there's a problem. 
   We have decades and decades and decades of American energy laying untapped that we could bring to the market to help bring down the cost of energy. Yet the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, has said, as this quote shows, that she believes that it's all a hoax. The American people, I believe, Mr. Speaker, disagree, and perhaps they might be interested in calling (202) 224-3121 and in just saying, ``Speaker Pelosi, at least allow a vote. As, supposedly, the most Democratic institution in the history of mankind, at least allow the voices of the people to be heard, and let there be a vote.'' 
   In speaking of voices to be heard, Mr. Speaker, as one of the great voices in this institution, I want to yield now to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess).

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. If the American people, Madam Chairman, are watching this debate, they've certainly seen a lot of name calling and a lot of shouting, and now we're having our motives questioned. I personally try to not go down that road. I assume my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I'm sure their purposes are noble. But I must admit in the 4 1/2 years I've been here, I've certainly been called a lot of names. I think this afternoon's the first time I've been called part of the fringe. I thought fringe had more to do with curtains. But here we are as part of the fringe, I guess, because we believe that the government shouldn't grow faster than the people's ability to pay for it. And somehow that's being called a fringe opinion. 
   We believe that it's the people's money, and not the government's money. Yet we are being told by our Democrat colleagues that's a fringe opinion. 
   We happen to believe that the best housing program and the best education program is a paycheck, not a government check; but somehow our Democrat colleagues have chosen to tell us that that's a fringe opinion. 
   And then we hear lectures from our Democrat colleagues saying well, when you guys were in the majority you spent too much money. So Madam Chairman, their response is well, we're going to spend even more. That logic defies me. 
   Now, they focus a lot on their noble purposes, Madam Chairman, and they focus a lot on the benefits of all this spending that they care to do. And again, I would like to point out, this particular amendment says that this bill will grow by 3.8 percent instead of 4.8 percent. I suppose that's another fringe opinion as well. 
   But you know what, Madam Chairman? My friends on the other side of the aisle don't focus upon where this money is coming from, and so they talk about their investments on behalf of the American people. Well, Madam Chairman, maybe the American people want to make their own investments. 
   You know, I listen to the Ward family in my district from Garland, Texas, and they write, ``Dear Congressman, a tax increase in the spending is going to fuel the taxes, the largest tax increase in American history courtesy of the Democrat Party.'' So all this spending in this bill is fostering a tax increase on the American people. So the Ward family in Garland says, ``A tax increase this year would wipe out my ability to continue my daughter's education.'' 
   Well, I've got a message for the Ward family in Garland. Don't worry. Don't worry about it. The Democrats have an investment that they're going to make on your behalf. So don't worry about the $3,000 a year they're going to take from you. 
   I also heard from the Kincaid family in Garland. ``In my particular case, an additional $2,200 in taxes would cut into the finances I use to pay for my son's education.'' 
   The gentleman from Garland, Texas in my district goes on to say, ``I really believe that, given more money, Congress will spend more money. That's not the answer.'' 
   Well, I guess we ought to tell the Kincaid family in Garland, Texas, don't worry about your son's college education. The Democrats are going to make an investment for you. 
   I heard from the Brock family in Dallas, Texas, also in my district. ``Dear Congressman, with this tax increase I could not pay for a semester of college for my daughter if I had to send $2,200 more to the government.'' 
   Well, again, we have good news for them. Don't worry about all the money that they're taking. The Democrats have an investment for you. 
   So, again, Madam Chairman, what our friends on the other side of the aisle don't seem to realize is that all this great government spending and all these wonderful investments they have are coming out of the pockets of the American people. In many respects, we are not having a debate over how much this Nation ought to spend on health. We're debating who's doing the spending. It ought to be the family.

   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, after all of this debate, I still cannot believe that people don't understand what the word ``cut'' means. I took the opportunity to go look it up in my dictionary. I would urge my Democrat colleagues to do the same. 
   They might find a reduction in amount. Only in Washington would somebody call an increase of 4.6 percent a cut. People all over America would love to have their salaries cut if it would only increase 4.6 percent. 
   I think I just heard the previous speaker say that people who pay taxes ought to get some of their money back. Well, maybe it shouldn't be taken from them in the first place. 
   But let's go back to the term ``cut,'' because the only budgets that are being cut here today are the family budgets of hard-working Americans all across this land. It is their budgets that are being cut. 
   The budgets like the Flores family in Garland, who says, ``I am a divorced mother with a child in college and a  child in daycare.'' When you increase taxes, you are going to wipe out the hope of the first college graduate in the family. To my colleagues on the other said of the aisle, that is the budget they are cutting. They are cutting the Flores family budget. They are cutting their education program. 
   They are cutting the education program of the Mouton-Tedder family in Chandler, this largest tax increase in history, that they are imposing on the American people. They write in, ``If I have to pay more taxes, then I can't afford to go to school.'' Once again, Democrats cutting education budgets for families in America. 
   They are cutting the health budget as well. I heard from the Winters family in Tennessee Colony. ``Please do what you can to stop the wasteful spending. I am retired and disabled. I am raising my three grandchildren and one great grandchild. I sometimes can't afford my own medicine.'' 
   The only budgets that are being cut here are the Democrats cutting the health budgets and the education budgets of the American family. It ought to stop.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to rise today in support of the amendment from the gentleman from Virginia. We are discussing a very important issue that faces all Americans today, and that is making America energy independent. 
   As part of that goal, as part of that goal we must have energy conservation. Everyday somebody comes to the floor and talks about energy conservation. 
   There is another aspect to making America energy independent, and that is the aspect of fiscal responsibility. We have a program here today, it may be a very worthy program, but it costs money. How do we pay for it? You cannot be energy independent and support programs represented by the underlying bill unless you have the fiscal responsibility to pay for them. And that is why, Mr. Chairman, recent actions of our Speaker are most curious. 
   According to CNN, the Speaker's office has now requested that the military provide her with a luxury jet that seats 42 business class seats according to CNN, a fully enclosed stateroom according to CNN, an entertainment center, a private bed, state-of-the-art communications system, and a crew of 16. 
   Mr. Chairman, if we are going to tell the American people that we are going to be energy independent, you have to lead by example. You have to have a culture that says, yes, we are going to do things to conserve energy. 
   Now, somebody has brought up the aspect of security. That is a legitimate issue. But how come our previous Speaker, according to CNN, used a smaller jet, consuming far less fuel, that seated 12, not 42, and didn't have the requested fully enclosed stateroom, entertainment center, private bed, state-of-the-art communications center, and a crew of 16? Again, Mr. Chairman, you have to lead by example. 
   I also noticed recently that our Speaker was critical of the President  when it came to the issue of global warming. She was quoted as saying in the Boston Globe: ``The signs of global warming and its impact is overwhelming and unequivocal.'' And in criticizing the President she said: ``It is not just about what he says; it is about what he does.'' 
   So now we have the Speaker telling us, number one, we are going to have a Congress that is fiscally responsible, and we have the Speaker telling us that we have to be concerned about global climate change and energy conservation. Let's look at the fiscal responsibility aspect of this. 
   According to the D.C. Examiner, now a flight from the Nation's Capital to her hometown of San Francisco is going to cost $300,000. Now, any one of our constituents can go on line to Expedia.com and make the same trip for $300. Okay, well, again, maybe there is some legitimate security concerns, but do we need the 42 business class seats, a fully enclosed stateroom, an entertainment center, private bed, state-of-the-art communications system, and a crew of 16? How is that leading by example? How is that an example of this Democratic Congress's commitment to fiscal responsibility and energy conservation? I don't think it is. 
   So why is the Speaker requesting this? Well, according to the Washington Times, it says that she is seeking regular military flights not only for herself and her staff, but also for relatives and for other members of the California delegation. That is according to the Washington Times. 
   According to CNN, just recently she asked the use of the military plane to attend a retreat in Williamsburg, Virginia, that is a 2-hour drive from Washington, D.C. 
   Now, this plane that she wants costs $15,000 an hour. How many gallons of fuel is that consuming? How do we come forth to the American people and say let's pass a bill for energy conservation, and then we have this waste? I don't understand it, Mr. Chairman. 
   And now apparently there is a new wrinkle here. We understand from the San Francisco Chronicle that the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murtha) when asked about this said, and referring to the Pentagon: ``I don't need to pressure them. I just tell them what they need to do,'' in dealing with this request to the military for this luxury plane. 
   Apparently he was further quoted in CNN, ABC, and the San Francisco Chronicle that ``the Pentagon made a mistake in leaking information,'' quote, ``since she decides on the allocations for the Department of Defense.'' 
   This is not conservation. It is not fiscal responsibility. Let's support the gentleman's amendment.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, recently Speaker  Nancy Pelosi said it is time for Congress to return to fiscal responsibility. It is often said that the best way to lead is by example. But I don't know if spending $300,000 of the taxpayer money to fly the Speaker in a personal luxury jet to travel back and forth to San Francisco sets much of an example, particularly when any American can find a $300 ticket for the same route on expedia.com. 
   According to CNN, Speaker Pelosi has requested that the military give her a jet that would include 42 business class seats, a fully enclosed stateroom, an entertainment center, a private bed, state-of-the-art communications system and a crew of 16. 
   Now, I know there are legitimate security concerns, but somehow the previous Speaker managed to use a smaller jet that seated 12 and had none of these amenities. 
   Why did the Speaker request this jet? According to the Washington Times, the Democrat, quote, ``is seeking regular military flights not only for herself and her staff, but also for relatives and other Members of Congress.'' 
   If this is the Democrats' idea of fiscal responsibility, working families had better hold on to their wallets.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (SEASONED CUSTOMER CTR EXEMPTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I certainly thank him for his leadership in this area to remove some unneeded regulation on our financial institutions. I also want to thank our new chairman, the gentleman from Massachusetts, for his steadfast support on this issue as well. 
   Madam Speaker, current Federal regulations require financial institutions to file a currency transaction report with the IRS for any customer transaction over $10,000 during a business day. 
   We all know that these CTRs, as they are called, are designed to help our Federal law enforcement thwart money laundering and other illegal activities; but the problem is that this $10,000 threshold which was set in 1970 is so low in the existing exemption process, so cumbersome and costly that it is causing banks to repeatedly file CTRs for many of their known and expected regular business transactions for their well-known customers. 
   And it doesn't matter if that business has been a so-called ``seasoned customer'' for the financial institution for 5, 10, 15 or even 20 years. Right now it is simply too difficult for our financial institutions to apply for exemptions for our customers that they know are not a risk. So this forces, Madam Speaker, our financial institutions to file CTRs when they know the customer is not a risk just to protect themselves from legal liability or potential large fines. 
   And so when law enforcement is looking for a needle in a haystack, our financial institutions are being asked to put more hay on the stack and they are being told to pay for it by taking money away from their local communities that otherwise could be used for local lending. If the financial institutions passed these CTR compliance costs on to customers, through higher fees or higher interest rates, it makes it more difficult for American citizens to save for retirement, finance a child's college education, or launch a small business that creates jobs. 
   This bill, which I have long supported, will fix this problem by clarifying the existing CTRs filing exemption for seasoned customers. And as a result of this legislation, when passed, a number of the 13 million-plus CTRs filed annually would stop, allowing banks to devote more of their resources to improving other suspicious activity reporting. 
   The fact remains, Madam Speaker, when we come across a regulation like this, if we cannot determine a compelling reason for it to exist in the modern marketplace, we have a duty to either modify it or eliminate it, and that is what we are doing today. 
   Congress today can help reduce the cost of banking for customers without jeopardizing critical law enforcement goals. I urge all of my colleagues to support this important bill.

No one knows this better than SAM JOHNSON, a true American hero, and I commend him on introducing H.R. 511. 
   It is time for the Democrats to say what they mean and mean what they say. They can't have it both ways. To vote to support troops in the field and then vote not to give them the resources needed to win can be deceptive, dangerous, and could put the lives of American servicemen and -women at even greater risk. 
   If the Democrat majority does not support the President's plan, they are in the majority, they need to put forth their plan that is in the interest of the American people, and they must also reflect upon the cost of failure. They must understand how high the stakes are in Iraq, both in terms of human life and global stability.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this rule and to this underlying resolution. 
   I have listened to my chairman carefully, the gentleman from South Carolina, and I wish to add my respect along with that of the gentleman, ranking member from Wisconsin. He conducts our committee in a very fair-minded manner, and I appreciate and respect him for that. And I take him at his word when he says that he believes that he is putting forth on this floor a fiscally responsible budget. But, Mr. Speaker, there is a distinct difference in our philosophies. How you look the American people in the eye and impose upon them the single largest tax increase in American history and call that fiscally responsible is simply beyond me. Our chairman has a different definition. 
   Now, I believe that what we need to do is try to help protect the family budget from the Federal budget. Already, Mr. Speaker, we are awash in Federal tax revenues. And we've heard the gentleman from South Carolina and many other people from this side of the aisle extol the virtues of their balanced budget. Okay. If they have a balanced budget, did they cut spending to get there? No. There is only one other option, and that is that they increase taxes. 
   And don't take my word for it, Mr. Speaker. Go, for example, to the Washington Post, not exactly a bastion of conservative thought in our Nation. They have said that the only way the Democrat budget will achieve balance is they assume the tax relief goes away, and thus it imposes the single largest tax increase in American history. 
   Now, I have heard our chairman and other people from this side of the aisle, different colleagues get up and say, well, we're not really raising taxes on the American people, we're just letting the tax relief expire.     
   But if you make the same paycheck last year that you made this year and your tax bill is higher, that is going to be a distinction that is lost on the American people. 
   Is it letting tax relief expire if it is a tax increase? I have to tell you, if the people in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas have to pay a larger tax bill, they call it a tax increase, and the sooner that we in this body recognize that fact, the better off America will be. Under the Democrat's budget resolution, the average family, the average family in Texas will have a $2,700 a year tax increased phased in over 5 years. 
   Something else we need to remember, Mr. Speaker, is that every time you are taking money away from the American family to plus-up some Federal budget category, you are having to subtract from some family budget category; $2,700 a year is a lot of money to Texas families. How many families can no longer send a child to college because of the single largest tax increase in American history that the Democrats are trying to impose upon us? How many American families will not be able to find their American dream, to put together their savings and invest in that first small business because the Democrats are imposing the single largest tax increase in American history? How many families will no longer be able to afford their healthcare premiums because the Democrats are imposing the single largest tax increase in American history? $2,700 a year. 
   First, the working poor under this plan would have their taxes increased 50 percent, from the 10 percent bracket to the 15 percent bracket. The child tax credit would be cut in half. The death tax would come up to where Uncle Sam could take as much as 55 percent of your estate. 
   Mr. Speaker, as bad as this budget is for what it does, it is even worse for what it doesn't do, because I know the chairman presided over the hearings that I attended with the Federal Reserve Chairman, with the head of OMB, with the Secretary of the Treasury, with CBO, who all said the same thing: The single largest fiscal challenge in this Nation is out of control entitlement spending, and this budget is stone-cold silent on that number one challenge. 
   As bad as the tax imposition is going to be on this generation, if we don't act, if we kick the can down the road, if we avoid leadership, the next generation will see their taxes double. There is nothing fiscally responsible about doubling taxes on the next generation, nothing fiscally responsible about taking their dreams away. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must defeat this rule and defeat this budget. Again, Mr. Speaker, I don't understand why you would avoid dealing with the number one fiscal challenge in the Nation. 
   I know the chairman, the gentleman from South Carolina, said this isn't the place to do it. Well, I will ask a question that was asked by a very famous President: If not us, who? If not now, when? 
   I am curious as to what advantage we have by somehow kicking this can down the road to some other body or to some other bill or to some other institution. At least in the last two Republican Congresses, we had two budgets in a row from the House, from the House, that actually made steps toward reforming entitlement spending. 
   Now, it is a huge challenge, I admit, but every year we avoid it. In Social Security alone, we run up an extra $400 billion of debt, of unfunded obligations to pass on to the next generation. And yet the Democrats turn their back on this once again. That is another reason to defeat this.

   Name me three industries that are not hurting in this economy that could not be helped, sustained and made more profitable by the infusion of $15 billion? 
   Stone cold silence at the witness table.

Now, I suspect nobody in this Chamber has heard the names of those businesses, but we've all heard the names of the Big 3 automakers, and we know that they've had the ability to spend $50 million to lobby this Congress this year. I don't deny them their first amendment opportunities to petition the Congress for the redress of their grievances. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, are they getting the money and small business isn't getting the money merely because we have not heard the names of the small businesses and because they're working hard to put food on their tables to sustain their families and because they don't have $50 million to spend on lobbying expenses? 
   I think there must be a better way. Indeed, it would be one thing if we knew for a fact that this money somehow would solve the problem, but we don't. Independent analysts in the auto industry tell us, if demand does not pick up for the domestic auto industry, $15 billion, $35 billion, $75 billion, and $105 billion will not solve the problem. It will not solve the problem.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself an additional minute. 
   Everybody agrees that the auto industry needs to reorganize, but the question that is before this body is: Is it going to reorganize at the risk of investors or is it going to reorganize at the risk of the poor, beleaguered taxpayer? Is it going to take voluntary capital from investors at risk or involuntary capital from taxpayers that is placed at risk? 
   The taxpayer can take no more. We are seeing the largest nominal deficit in the history of our Nation. The unfunded obligations of the average American family are over $400,000. Bailout mania has had thousands of dollars of obligations to them. We want the Big 3 to survive, but they've got to get down their labor costs. They've got to convince the American consumer that their products are worthy of their investment. They must reorganize, but another bailout at the taxpayer expense is not the answer, particularly when small business does not enjoy the same benefit. 
   This bill should be voted down.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (TEMPORARY TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, this bill is very cleverly entitled the Temporary Tax Relief Act of 2007. But there's no tax relief here; no tax relief at all. All they do is for one year postpone a huge automatic tax increase on some people and they combine that with a $76 billion tax increase on others. So maybe the ``temporary'' is accurate, the ``tax relief'' is not. All they are doing is rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic tax ship. That is what this bill is all about. AMT ought to stand for ``automatic major taxation.'' 
   When I hear my Democratic friends decry it, they have had opportunity to get rid of this bill in the past, and perhaps there are some freshmen here, if they haven't had an opportunity, I would invite them to cosponsor the Taxpayer Choice Act, which would permanently repeal this huge automatic tax increase. 
   But, wait, our Democrat friends say, well, you have got to have something that is revenue-neutral. Well, guess what? Fully repealing the AMT is revenue-neutral. It is revenue-neutral to the taxpayer, the one who counts; not revenue-neutral to the Federal Government, but revenue-neutral to the hardworking taxpayer, the teacher, the fireman, the person who's trying to send their kid to college, pay for their mortgage payment. And you take that away. That is wrong. Vote this bill down.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H. CON. RES. 99, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank my good friend and the gentleman from Texas for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule. It is anti-family, it is anti-tax, it is fiscally irresponsible. And I agree with my colleague from Texas. I can hardly believe some of the things I am hearing on the House floor. 
   The Democrats, Madam Speaker, obviously want to have it both ways. They claim on the one hand that they have done this incredible job of balancing the Federal budget, and then they claim that they actually preserve tax relief in the budget. But if anybody would bother to read the document, the only way they achieve balance is by taking away all of the tax relief that we have enjoyed in the last several years. They would bring forth the single largest tax increase in American history. 
   And guess what, Madam Speaker? Twelve years ago, the last time that they were in power, guess what they did? They brought forth the single largest tax increase in American history. Certainly they at least get an A for consistency, but you have to give them an F for fiscal responsibility. 
   I would point out to the preceding speaker, the gentlewoman from Connecticut, and I have the honor of serving with her on the Budget Committee, had the Democrats felt so strongly about preserving the tax relief, they had ample opportunity in committee to preserve the tax relief for American families, and they chose not to do it. 
   This is a budget which may be worthy of a Pulitzer Prize in fiction. It is full of Orwellian-speak. It is something that is worthy of the Twilight Zone. It makes no sense. You cannot claim that you are not reducing spending, you are  preserving tax relief, and you are balancing budget all at the same time. You are taking three different sides of the argument. It does not wash. 
   This Democrat budget is also silent, absolutely stone cold silent on the number one fiscal issue facing our Nation, and that is out-of-control entitlement spending. If we don't reform these entitlement programs, it will lead to a doubling of taxes on the American people, our children, and our grandchildren. The single largest tax increase in history will pale in comparison if we don't act today. 
   And this is a budget for the next election, it is not a budget for the next generation. You can't have a fiscally responsible budget and remain silent on the number one fiscal challenge facing the Nation today. If you want to save Medicare, if you want to save Social Security, if you want to save Medicaid, you have to reform these programs; and the Democrat budget, again, is stone cold silent. 
   They speak of their reserve funds, but, Madam Speaker, there is no reserve and there is no funds. Again, this is fiction. This is pure, unadulterated fiction. 
   What isn't fiction is the largest single tax increase in American history that is going to fall upon American families. It is going to fall upon them hard. Because every time the Democrats increase the Federal budget, they are cutting some family budget. They are taking away from a family's ability to send a child to college. They are taking away from a family's ability to help a parent with long-term health care. They are taking away a family's ability to buy that first home, make a down payment on their first home. Every time you take away, every time you increase the Federal budget, you are taking away from the family budget. 
   So these two documents stand in stark contrast. The Democrat budget, the single largest tax increase in history. Again, this contrast could not be more stark. The single largest tax increase in American history. And I remind my colleagues on the other side to please, please think about the families that are in your district that actually pay these taxes. 
   You may think we are having a debate on how much our society is going to spend on health care and housing and education. That is not the debate I think we are having. I think we are having a debate about who is going to do that spending. Is it going to be government bureaucrats, or is it going to be American families? 
   In my State of Texas, the average Texas family is going to have to pay an additional $2,700 a year under the Democrat plan to have the single largest tax increase in American history. I asked my constituents, Madam Speaker, what is this going to mean to you? And I heard from several of them. 
   I heard, for example, from Diana in Mesquite, Texas. She wrote, ``Dear Congressman, I wanted to let you know that I am a single mom that does not receive any type of child support, and an increase of this amount would break me. I would be at the risk of losing my home with this type of increase. I am writing to ask your help to keep this from happening. This would be devastating to middle-income families.'' That is what Diana in Mesquite wrote. 
   Brian in Dallas, ``This tax increase would affect our ability to pay tuition and books for our daughter to go to college. While she's a junior this year, we are trying to save money for her education. But as the cost of education increases this year, the loss of these funds, this increase in taxes, will have a negative impact on our ability to send her to college.'' 
   Again, this largest single tax increase in American history will have devastating impacts on American families. So the two budgets sit in stark contrast. One preserves the tax relief that has helped bring down the deficit, has given us the most tax revenues we have ever had before. We are awash in tax revenues, because people rolled up their sleeves, they went out, they worked, they saved. And that is why we have to vote down this rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, first, I want to thank the chairman of the committee, and I want to thank all those who contributed to this underlying legislation. I thank them for their good work on behalf of our Nation's veterans. 
   I myself am not a veteran. I did not serve my Nation in uniform. My grandfather did. He served during World War II. My father did. He served during Korea. My brother did. He served during the Cold War. So I have the highest respect for the men and women who serve our Nation in uniform. 
   Mr. Chairman, as we approach the annual debate on our budget, one thing that I think that we hold in common, although there are many differences in our parties, is that we all believe that our veterans and especially our veterans health care ought to be one of the most important priorities that we have as a Nation. And as we continue to fight this war on terror, we know we are creating more veterans with more health care needs. 
   During the last congressional recess, I spent a lot of time visiting with the veterans of the Fifth Congressional District in Texas that I have the honor and pleasure of representing. I heard many good comments, frankly, about VA health care and some complaints. And I suppose, Mr. Chairman, that one of the most important complaints I heard was the complaint on the waiting time in order to actually get the appointment that the veteran has requested. 
   Now, I know that great strides have been made in reducing these waiting times. I know that the veterans health care system is serving entire new populations that they didn't serve years ago. And this is a good thing. But I still would hope that, number one, we could understand exactly the challenges that our veterans are facing and see if there are not some commonsense solutions, as earlier the gentlelady from Texas, my colleague, said, that essentially we can save time and save money and still help our veterans. 
   This amendment is a very simple amendment. I hope it is a very noncontroversial amendment. It simply directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to study the average length of time between the desired date for which a veteran seeks a scheduled medical appointment and the date in which the appointment is actually completed. 
   Now, I know that the vast majority of appointments are completed within this 30-day window, but I don't believe this body knows if that means the bulk of them happened on day 29 or the bulk of them may happen on day six. This is important information we ought to have. 
   I represent a district that is urban, suburban, and rural; and this study would not just concentrate on our urban areas but our rural areas as well, where a number of our veterans go to retire. 
   Additionally, this amendment would ask for the Secretary's recommendations on what we might do to shorten the length of time to 15 days and provide recommendations to our body to do that. Not only veterans in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas, but if you look at the independent budget supported by numerous of our veterans service organizations, they speak to the need to see what we can do to reduce, in many cases, excess waiting times, something they flagged as a strong concern. 
   So I know the VA has made great strides, but there is still work that we can do to serve these people who serve us and protect freedom, the greatest commodity that we have in our land. And by supporting this amendment, Congress can make just one more small step in the direction of supporting our veterans. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I hope that the American people, Mr. Chairman, are paying very careful attention to this budget debate. The budget is really about priorities. We have heard about the priorities of the Democratic budget, and that is, let's increase the Federal budget at the expense of the family budget. I can hardly believe what I am hearing with respect to taxes. We know that, having been in power fewer than 90 days, the Democrats have now proposed the single largest tax increase in American history, almost $400 billion of new taxes on the American people. 
   Well, guess what? Last time they were in the majority, Mr. Chairman, they proposed the single biggest tax increase in American history. I suppose there is something to be said for consistency. 
   Now, I have heard from our distinguished chairman, and I have the utmost respect for him, and others that there is really not a tax increase. We just have expiring tax provisions. 
   Well, Mr. Chairman, when people all over America all of a sudden look at their tax bill and see how much they are going to have to pay, I think that is going to be a distinction that is lost on them. Either you are paying more in taxes or you are not. 
   And I might point out, Mr. Chairman, that all the members, all the Democratic members of the Budget Committee had the opportunity to make sure that the tax relief for American families was permanent, that we extended it. But, instead, they voted against it. They will have another opportunity tomorrow. So there is the old saying that your actions are so loud that I can hardly hear your words. 
   And so what are we left with? Again, the Democrats are proposing the single largest tax increase in American history. 
   Now, I have the honor and privilege of representing a lot of good people in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas. And in my home State, the single largest tax increase in American history that Democrats are trying to impose is going to mean an extra $2,700 burden on a family of four in my State. 
   And I asked people, I asked people from the Fifth District, what is this going to mean to you? And I heard from a lady, and I will use first names here, Diana from Mesquite, Texas, a suburb of Dallas. She said, Congressman, I wanted to let you know that I am a single mom that does not receive any type of child support, and an increase of this amount would break me. I would be at risk of losing my home with this type of increase. I am writing to ask your help to keep this from happening. This would be devastating to middle-income families in my situation. 
   Mr. Chairman, what the Democrats don't seem to realize again is when they spend more money on the Federal budget, they are taking money away from the family budget with their single largest tax increase in American history. 
   Let's hear from Brian from Dallas. Dear Congressman Hensarling, the tax increase would most likely affect our ability to pay tuition and books for our daughter to go to college. She is a junior this year, and we are trying to save money for her education. The loss of these funds due to an increase in taxes will have a negative impact on our plans for her education. 
   They are taking money away from the family budget. They are putting Diana's home in jeopardy. They are putting the education of Brian's daughter in jeopardy. 
   Vote down this single largest tax increase in American history.

   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am not sure that the last speaker is reading the same budget that I am. I mean, it is incredible to be lectured here on the whole question of entitlement spending, and the Democrat budget alternative is stone cold silent on the issue, the number one fiscal issue that is challenging our Nation. 
   And don't take my word for it, Mr. Chairman. Look at the testimony of the Congressional Budget Office. Look at the testimony of the General Accountability Office. Look at the testimony of our Federal Reserve Chairman, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of OMB. Anybody who has any responsibility for fiscal policy in America will tell you that we are on the verge, we are on the verge, and to paraphrase the Comptroller General, we are on the verge of being the first generation in America's history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living. 
   So when we get lectured about entitlement spending, why is the Democrat alternative silent on it? Why have all the Democrats refused to join us in doing anything to save Social Security, save Medicare, save Medicaid for the next generation? 
   Let's look here. They speak about what has happened in the Federal debt, and they should be concerned about it. But when it increases $3 trillion, look at what has happened to the unfunded liability in Social Security and Medicare when they refuse to do anything, anything to reform entitlement spending. If you do not reform Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, they will not be there for the next generation. They will not be there. If you do not reform them, you lose them. 
   So how their budget, Mr. Chairman, can be described as fiscally responsible when they are absolutely silent on the number one fiscal issue that faces our Nation is beyond me.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman, the ranking member, for yielding once again; and I wish to follow up on his insights about this single largest tax increase in American history that the Democrats are trying to impose. Again, Mr. Chairman, it is reminiscent of what they did 12 years ago, the last time they were in the majority. Again, as I said, they at least get an A for consistency. 
   But, Mr. Chairman, this is very, very serious business; and we need to take a good hard look at the numbers. But beyond the numbers, Mr. Chairman, we need to look at the people. 
   Earlier this evening, I read some correspondence from some constituents from the Fifth District of Texas that I have the honor of representing in Congress. These are people who will be hurt by the single largest tax increase  in American history that the Democrats are attempting to impose upon America today. 
   I heard from Carrie of Dallas, and she said: ``Jeb, you asked us to let you know what we'd be sacrificing if I had to spend another $2,200 in taxes. Well my family's basic needs may not be met, food, shelter, school clothes for the kids. Not to mention not being able to pay my creditors. Please continue to do your best to help the working class and families.'' 
   Well, Mr. Chairman, I want to let Carrie in Dallas know that I want her to be able to keep her earnings, and I am going to fight this single largest tax increase in American history that the Democrats are trying to impose. 
   Mr. Chairman, I heard from Lorri in Palestine, TX: ``Dear Congressman, I have a son going to college and my mother is on a fixed income and needs my help more times than less. The tax relief I received gave me the opportunity to help my family with their needs. If my taxes are increased again, my family would suffer tremendously.'' 
   Well, Mr. Chairman, I want to let Lorri in Palestine know that I am going to do everything I can to make sure she can keep more of her earnings and fight this single largest tax increase in America's history. 
   Mr. Chairman, I had a particularly poignant letter from Linda from Rowlett, TX, that I have the honor to represent in Congress. She said: ``This tax increase would make the difference whether my daughter and her husband would be able to purchase a car or not. For my husband and I, it helps us continue with his radiation treatments for his prostate cancer. It allows us to continue providing in-home assistance for my elderly parents, one of whom has Parkinson's and one who has dementia. Please allow us to retain this money for our needs. Please do not let our government take additional tax dollars from us. Please allow us to decide how this money will be spent. Please do not allow the government to decide for us.'' 
   Well, Mr. Chairman, again, I have a message for Linda of Rowlett. I am going to do everything I can to ensure that she gets to keep her earnings for her family, for her health care needs, for her housing needs, her transportation needs. 
   Vote against this largest tax increase in American history.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (BUDGET SCHOOL -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentlewoman from Tennessee for yielding, and I certainly thank her for her leadership and ingenuity in putting together this budget school for the American people. It is their money. Too often people come to this floor and they think it's their money. It's not. It's the people's money, and they need to know what the U.S. House is doing about it. 
   The gentlewoman had so many great speakers from our Conservative Caucus, the Republican Study Committee, and I think I just want to sum up really what is probably a tale of two budgets: the Republican budget and the Democrat budget. And, unfortunately, for the American people, it was the Democrat budget that was passed into law. 
   Number one, the Democrat budget included the single highest tax increase in American history on American families at a time when we know the economy is struggling, American families are struggling. I have two small children. I know what's happened to the price of milk. I know what's happened to the cost of a loaf of bread and to all the various and sundry cereals that they see advertised on Saturday morning that my wife and I are compelled to buy. Groceries have gone up. Gasoline has gone up. Ever since the Democrats took control of the economic policy of America 15 months ago, all we have seen is that American families have to struggle. 
   But what are the Democrats doing on top of this as American families are struggling? They are imposing a tax increase of almost $3,000 per American family over the course of the next 3 years. I mean, Mr. Speaker, this is just simply unconscionable. In my district in East Texas, the average family will see their taxes increase $2,734. Small businesses, as we struggle to make sure that we keep our jobs, that we expand our jobs, small businesses, their taxes are going to go up by as much as 13 percent. Taxes on capital gains will go up 33 percent; dividends, 164 percent. Mr. Speaker, you can't have capitalism without capital. You can't have the job engine if you take that away. And so at a time when people are concerned about their paychecks, the Democrats are going to take even a bigger bite out of their paychecks and the people who create those paychecks in the first place: the small business. I mean, Mr. Speaker, this is just unconscionable. 
   The death tax is going to go from zero percent up to 55 percent. People work their whole life to put together a farm, a ranch, a small business; and all of a sudden Uncle Sam can come in and take over half of it, and there's just not enough left to go around. The child tax credit is going to be cut in half. The lowest tax bracket is going to be increased by 50 percent. The marriage penalty will return. This is the Democrat plan for economic growth? This is the Democrat plan to help struggling American families? 
   A tale of two budgets. The Republican budget has no tax increase, Mr. Speaker. I repeat, no tax increase. 
   Another incredibly distinguishing aspect of the tale of two budgets is that the Republican budget says enough is enough on these earmarks. No more bridges to nowhere. It's your money. So the Republican budget included an earmark moratorium. They said you know what? The system's broken. The system's wasteful. We're going to stop it. We are going to ensure that there's a select committee to see if there's a better way to spend the people's money. And, instead, the Democrat budget rejects that. And, instead, what do they have? They have almost $15 billion for congressional earmarks that all too often represent the victory of seniority over merit, special interest over the general interest, and secrecy over transparency. 
   In the Democrat budget, in the last budget, they financed $2 million so that one of their committee chairmen could build a museum to himself; $100,000 is sent to the Los Angeles Fashion District for landscaping at the same time they are increasing taxes on American families. They earmark $300,000 to train people to work on Hollywood movie sets while they're taxing hardworking American families. And the list goes on and on. They are the party of congressional earmarks. Business as usual. 
   Some say it's not a whole lot of money. Well, Mr. Speaker, I hope I'm never in Congress so long that I conclude that $16 billion of the people's money is not a lot of money. It's a lot of money to the people in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas. And at the time when they are trying to keep a roof over their head, send their kids to college, pay for a gallon of gasoline, pay for a gallon of milk, to sit there and be building museums to sitting Members of Congress, to be sending money to the L.A. Fashion District is simply unconscionable. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, again, when you look at two budgets, it's not just about numbers; it's about visions. At a time when we need more jobs and more growth and we need to secure the family paycheck, all the Democrats offer are more earmarks, and they offer tax increases on the American family as much as $3,000 per year.  
   The Republican budget has no tax increase. It will help the family paycheck. It will help create small businesses. It has spending control and will lead to a brighter future for our children and future generations and provide them with greater freedom and greater opportunity. That is the tale of two budgets and how the American people's money is spent. 
   So I thank the gentlewoman from Tennessee for this wonderful program on the budget. I thank her for her leadership within the Republican Study Committee, the Conservative Caucus in Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise in support of his point of order. 
   I see that the distinguished Speaker of the House is on the floor, was on the floor; and although I don't have the quote in front of me, I know, as she took the gavel to become Speaker of the House, that she said that this would be something along the lines of the fairest and most democratically run House in the history of our country. I'm trying to see where the fairness, I'm trying to see where the democracy comes in, where most of us, most of us didn't even know of the existence of this almost-300-page bill until we arrived this morning. And so I'm having a little trouble seeing exactly where we're having fairness and democracy. 
   Specifically, Mr. Speaker, I think Speaker Pelosi said bills should generally come to the floor under procedure that allows open, full, and fair debate consisting of a full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives, including a substitute. 
   Members should have at least 24 hours to examine the bill. That is certainly not true for this Member. I don't think it's true for the vast majority of Members here. 
   So the Speaker may say one thing, and I respect her words, but the actions are speaking far more loudly than the words are. 
   And I would think, with the great human tragedy that is taking place in California unfolding upon the television screens of almost everyone in America, I would think that if any Speaker would be sensitive to that human tragedy it would be this Speaker since she hails from the State of California. 
   Yet we have countless Members who need to return home to be about the business of their constituents, and they're not here. They're not present for a very, very important vote and a vote that could have obviously taken place months ago, a vote that could have taken place weeks ago, and a vote that can take place early next week when these people will return. 
   And yet, I fear, I'm not questioning the motives or the heart of any one Member, but the actions are such that people could be led to believe that this is simply a move to manipulate the outcome of a vote. And I'm not sure that's the appearance that we want to give the American people. 
   And, again, Republicans, Members on this side of the aisle, have stood ready for weeks and for months to reauthorize an SCHIP program. The vast majority will vote to support funding for every eligible child. But a program that was designed and passed by a Republican House to ensure health insurance benefits for uninsured low-income American children, that's been hijacked. 
   And again, yet again, the Democrat Congress will try to transform that program into something else; instead to give additional benefits to adults while we still have children that are not served, to give benefits to illegal immigrants while we still have Americans unserved, to give benefits to the uninsured while we have those who are insured and, finally, to give benefits to higher-income Americans before we serve lower-income Americans. That is not right. This is not fair. This is not democratic. It's not what the Speaker committed to. And this point of order should be sustained.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Speaker, we're not having a debate today on whether or not to reauthorize SCHIP. What we're really having a debate about is a tale of two SCHIPs, because it was 10 years ago that Republicans created SCHIP to provide health insurance benefits to uninsured low-income American children. And every Republican stands ready today to reauthorize that program and fund that program. 
   But yet, again, Democrats are coming with their tale of SCHIP, an SCHIP that instead is transforming this program to give additional benefits to adults before children, illegal immigrants before Americans, the insured before the uninsured, and, finally, the higher-income before lower-income. 
   These are the facts. The program was designed for those up to 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. The Democrats will increase it explicitly up to 300 percent; but with all their loopholes, even wealthier families will qualify, shortchanging low-income, uninsured American children to subsidize higher-income families. 
   Although the program was designed for children, 13 States insure adults. Three cover more adults than children. Democrats continue this practice, shortchanging low-income, uninsured American children in order to subsidize adults. 
   Although the program was designed for the Americans, the Democrats still strip out proof of citizenship measures. Democrats shortchange low-income, uninsured American children in order to subsidize illegal immigrants. 
   Although the program was designed to help the uninsured, CBO reports that the plan will, in effect, take 2 million off of private health insurance. Democrats shortchange low-income, uninsured American children in order to subsidize the already insured. 
   Let's put the children first and the politics second. Let's reject this bill, and let's reauthorize the real SCHIP program for our children.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Ten years ago, a Republican Congress created SCHIP to provide health insurance benefits to children who are uninsured, who are Americans, and whose parents represent the working poor. Yet today, once again, this Democrat Congress will try to do something else, and that is, give these same benefits to adults, to illegal immigrants, to those who are already insured, and to some of the wealthiest among us. These are the facts. 
   Although the program was designed for those up to 200 percent of poverty, we know today there are families of up to $82,000 of income receiving these benefits. Although the program was designed for children, we know almost 20 States now serve more adults than children. Although the program was designed for Americans, the Democrats strip out proof-of-citizenship measures. And although the program was designed for the uninsured, CBO said this will have the effect of taking 2 million off and putting them on a government insurance program. That is wrong.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, once again, the Democrats are telling us that somehow bureaucrats in Washington can do more to lower the cost of prescription drugs than free market competition. To paraphrase President Reagan, ``There they go again.'' 
   The Congressional Budget Office has already opined that the Secretary of HHS would not be able to negotiate prices lower than those that are already negotiated by prescription drug plans under current law. 
   Let us be very clear: Price negotiations are already taking place on behalf of seniors. And for 200 years, it has been market competition, not government edict, that has given us the goods that we want at the lowest possible price. 
   Now, our colleagues on this side of the aisle continue to hold up the VA as the model, the model where you cannot choose your doctor, cannot choose your pharmacist, and they only cover a third of the drugs that Medicare does. They do not cover Lipitor, Crestor or Nexium. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I would like to personally invite Speaker Pelosi to come  to Athens, Texas, and tell one of my constituents, 80-year-old Hazel Heard, why she is going to take her Lipitor away. Hazel will not be happy. And I am told she has a big dog.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today to offer an amendment with my good friend, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), who just offered the previous amendment, and I certainly associate myself with his efforts on the previous amendment. 
   This amendment represents what many of us consider to be a very, very important principle, and that fundamental important principle is if you're an able-bodied adult under the age of 62 receiving means-tested Federal assistance, you ought to be on the road to self-sufficiency. That's what this amendment is all about, and that's what the principle is. This, we believe, will further encourage people to make the transition from dependency upon section 8 rental assistance to self-sufficiency. Not only is that important to them, it's important to the taxpayer who we're asking to pick up the tab. And this is, I believe, over a $2 billion bill. 
   Now, specifically, our amendment would require people receiving section 8 rental assistance for 7 consecutive years to perform a certain amount of work-related activities, which includes work, looking for work, job training, education and a host of other activities that are reflected in the TANF statute, which we mirror. There are a number of exemptions. It exempts those under age 18, over the age of 62, blind, disabled, those already working, already exempt under TANF, single parents of children under six who are unable to find appropriate child care. 
   Over 10 years ago, the Nation embarked on a bold new experiment with TANF, and we said that Federal assistance should be temporary and based on work and self-sufficiency and responsibility and personal dignity. That is a principle. Now many naysayers then said that it was mean. They said it was unworkable. Some even implied it was racist. Well, they were wrong then, and they are wrong now. Under TANF, the number of families receiving cash welfare steadily declined from a peak of 5.1 million families in March of 1994 to 1.9 million families. Child poverty has fallen dramatically. The employment of young single mothers has doubled, and the employment of mothers who have never been married is up by more than 50 percent. 
   Now, the lessons are clear. But we didn't finish the job 10 years ago, and we should finish it. Again, this is a vote on a very simple principle. If you're an able-bodied adult receiving means-tested Federal assistance, should you be on the road to self-sufficiency? I believe the answer is yes. 
   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I must admit, I really regret, Madam Chairman, that the gentleman from Georgia chose to characterize this as ``bigoted.'' Perhaps I could have taken his words down.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank him for his outstanding leadership on this floor and within the Republican Study Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm very happy to come to the floor today and debate this resolution with my fellow members of the Republican Study Committee. But if press reports are to be believed, I am disturbed by the reason that we are here, and that is, is this a poll driven resolution? 
   We all know that our Democratic colleagues now have one of the lowest congressional approval ratings in almost 50 years. We know they don't want to spend time on this floor debating how little has been achieved in their tenure, and perhaps they want to spend even less time talking about what they have achieved; the single largest tax increase in American history, a secret earmarking plan gone awry, and a spendorama, spending millions and millions on peanut storage, NASA and dairy products, put into a  bill to support our troops in harm's way.     
   Putting polls aside, why are we here? Make no mistake about it. What we are debating today is whether or not to declare defeat in Iraq, the battlefront in our war against radical Islam. 
   Everyone knows that fighting this battle in Iraq is costly, but losing this battle in Iraq is even costlier. 
   Mr. Speaker, sometimes life presents us with lousy options, but that is a reality with which we must deal. Iraq must be seen in the larger context of our war with radical Islam. The battle lines are drawn; and whether or not we like it, they are drawn in Iraq. 
   Don't take my word for it. Take the word of Osama bin Laden: ``The epicenter of these wars is Baghdad. Success in Baghdad will be success for the United States. Failure in Iraq is the failure of the United States. Their defeat in Iraq will mean defeat in all of their wars.'' And we have to soberly reflect upon the enemy that we are facing. Listen to the number two in al Qaeda, al Zawahiri: ``Al Qaeda has the right to kill 4 million Americans, 2 million of them children.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, two of those children are my children. And I take this very, very seriously. 
   Al Qaeda has further vowed to expel the Americans from Iraq. They have vowed that they will ``launch a jihad wave to the secular countries neighboring Iraq.'' 
   Again, this is the enemy we face and we face him foremost in Iraq. If we leave Iraq before subduing him, he will follow us here to our shores. And make no mistake about it. The consequences are immense. Read the National Intelligence Estimate. Read the report of the Iraq Study Group. Precipitous withdrawal declaring defeat will not end this war. Instead, it will make it worse. It will send it to neighboring countries. It may lead to genocide. 
   Now, I have listened to the debate of my colleagues carefully. Some still complain about the decision to go in. It's a moot point. Many want to complain about mistakes or incompetence of 3 years, 2 years, or perhaps 1 year ago that may or may not be accurate. Today they are irrelevant. 
   The question is what do we do now? We have a new commander. We have a new strategy. We have a report due in September. We have signs of hope. Let's give it a chance. There is too much at stake to declare defeat today.

<DOCNO>Mr. HENSARLING. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. First, I want to thank my dear friend, and a genuine American hero, for yielding time to me today. 
   Mr. Speaker, speaker after speaker on the other side of the aisle have come to the floor to speak against the past decision to go into Iraq. They criticize past lapses of intelligence, they criticize past actions, they criticize past setbacks. They want to live in the past. 
   Regardless of whose war this was in the past, today it is an American war. And the Democratic majority must decide do they support the mission, or do they not support the mission? 
   Now, certainly we are all disappointed that we have not achieved the success that we would have desired by now. And I myself do not know if the new strategy will prove successful. I think it can be successful. I hope it will be successful. And I know it is a strategy that has been recommended by the Iraqi Study Group and our new battlefield commander. 
   So until such a time as somebody comes to me with a more compelling strategy, or until somebody convinces me that somehow my Nation and my family will be more secure by our premature withdrawal from Iraq and subsequent implosion, I feel I must support this new strategy. I will support this new strategy. Defeat is not an option. 
   What are the options, Mr. Speaker? Clearly, many. Many, if not most, of my Democrat colleagues want to cut off funding for our troops and withdraw from Iraq. This is well known. And I respect their views when they are heartfelt. But since Democrats control a majority in both houses of Congress, why are we voting on a nonbinding withdrawal resolution?     
   That is why this is a sad day. Somewhere over in Baghdad right now is a marine sergeant who is tired, he is resolute, he has dirt on his face. But you know what? He volunteered, he loves America, he loves his freedom. He has a picture in his wallet. His parents are praying for him. He is thinking about his wife. 
   Who, who in this body, what Member can go to that marine and say, you know what? I don't believe in your mission. I don't believe you can succeed. I don't believe you can win, and I am going to oppose reinforcements. Guess what? I have the power to bring you home, but I am just not willing to do it. Because if I do it now everyone will know it, and I have to take responsibility, and I am just not willing to do that. 
   Mr. Speaker, if you believe in something, stand up for it. Where is the courage? Where is the conviction in a nonbinding resolution? 
   Mr. Speaker, we all know that fighting this war is costly. Like many Members of this body, I have met with the mothers of the fallen soldiers. Their burden and sacrifice is profound. But I never, never, never want to meet with the mothers whose children may perish in the next 9/11 if we accept defeat in Iraq. 
   Iraq must be seen in the larger context of the war with radical Islam, and whether we like it or not, the battle lines are drawn in Iraq. Don't take my word for it, listen to what the jihadists have to say. Listen to Osama bin Laden, ``The epicenter of these wars is Baghdad. Success in Baghdad will be success for the United States. Failure in Iraq is the failure of the United States. Their defeat in Iraq will mean defeat in all their wars.'' 
   We must soberly reflect on the challenge that we face. Listen to al-Zawahiri, who is number two in command. ``Al Qaeda has the right to kill 4 million Americans, 2 million of them children.'' 
   Listen to Hassan Abbassi, Revolutionary Guard's intelligence adviser to the Iranian President. ``We have a strategy drawn up for the destruction of Anglo-Saxon civilization.'' 
   Listen to Iraqi Ayatollah Ahmad Husseini. ``Even if this means using biological, chemical and bacterial weapons, we will conquer the world.'' 
   This is the enemy we face, and we face him foremost in Iraq. If we leave Iraq before subduing him, he will follow us to America. Make no doubt about it, the consequences in Iraq are immense. Don't take my word for it. Read the report of the Iraq Study Group. Read the National Intelligence Estimate. Read the work of the Middle East scholars at the American Enterprise Institute, Heritage Foundation, Brookings Institute. 
   If we do not pursue success, Iraq will become what Afghanistan once was. It will be a breeding ground, a safe haven for the recruitment, training, financing and sanctuary of radical Islamists bent upon attacking our Nation and our families. We cannot wish it away, we cannot hope it away, we cannot dream it away. There will be no greater event to empower radical Islam than our defeat in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, it doesn't have to be this way. We are Americans. We can meet this threat. We can work together. Vote against this resolution. Support our troops. Protect our Nation and our children from this threat.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I certainly thank the gentlelady for yielding. I thank her for those kind words. And I must admit, at 56", I'm rarely referred to as a giant, but I certainly take it as a great compliment. 
   The gentlelady from Minnesota has done great work in this body. I'm honored to serve with her, and I hope her constituents are very proud of the work that she has done. She has been a leader on so many issues from day one, and I thank her especially on probably the most fundamental question we have in American society today, for helping lead this Special Order today on the whole question of life. 
   Mr. Speaker, I need not tell you that millions of people all across America are reflecting upon that Supreme Court decision of decades ago, Roe v. Wade. Many Americans are celebrating. Many others are mourning. I am mourning. I mourn that decision. 
   I'm not naive. I know this question represents one of the great political fault lines in America today, and I know many of my countrymen feel quite differently than I do. But I just believe in my heart, I believe in my head, that there is no more fundamental right that we have than the right to life. And it is enshrined in our very founding documents that we were created. Our creator brought us into this world with certain unalienable rights, including the right to life. 
   Now, again, Mr. Speaker, I can come to no other conclusion in my head, in my heart, than but life begins at conception. And I don't understand my countrymen who come to different conclusions. I don't hate these people. I don't disparage them. But I have great sadness about what has occurred because of their beliefs; that millions of our countrymen are not here today to take that first breath, to take that first walk, to go into that first dance recital, to hit that first baseball, to put together that first two plus two equals four, I did it daddy. Millions and millions of our fellow countrymen will  never experience that moment because of what I believe to be a very wrongheaded and a very unconstitutional decision made many, many years ago. 
   And so Mr. Speaker, a battle continues in this great body as a battle continues all across our land. And it's not just a battle to change laws. It is a battle to change the hearts and minds of our countrymen. And again, it's something that I take as an article of faith. But Mr. Speaker, if there's any parent in this body who has seen that sonogram when your baby is just weeks old, to see that beating heart, to see those little fingers, to see those little toes, and know that you have this great privilege that God Almighty has entrusted you with this gift to nurture this life, how you see that and turn your back on it is beyond me, is absolutely beyond me.     
   And so, Mr. Speaker, there have been others who have come here tonight who are far more eloquent than am I. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, I just want to, one, thank all of the fellow members of the Republican Study Committee that I have the great honor of chairing in this institution, really the conservative caucus in this House. I want to thank them for raising their voice on the single most important issue we face as a society, and that is the definition of the right to life. I want to thank them for coming to this body to do this. 
   And Mr. Speaker, I believe that I have a lot of blessings in life. I am not sure I will ever have a greater privilege than serving in the United States House. I enjoy coming to the floor of this institution and being able to talk about my beliefs and my vision for this great Republic. 
   Like some of us, we have the opportunity to occasionally meet with the President of the United States and tell the most powerful man in the world what our views are. We have opportunities to salute people who deserve recognition. We have all kinds of opportunities that give us a lot of self-satisfaction. 
   But no matter how many speeches I give on the House floor, no matter how many opportunities I have to meet with the President in the Oval Office, Mr. Speaker, those opportunities pale, absolutely pale in comparison to the opportunity that I have each week to fly home to Dallas, Texas, and have my 5-year-old daughter and my 4-year-old son run into my arms saying, ``Daddy, Daddy, Daddy. We missed you.'' 
   And it's just one more reminder, Mr. Speaker, of how critical and how precious human life is, and it transcends all of the other debates that we have in this institution. 
   And so, again, I want to thank all of my fellow members of the Republican Study Committee. I want to thank the gentlelady from Minnesota adding her leadership and her eloquent voice here tonight. I wish I knew what I could say to reach out to my follow citizens and try to convince them to treasure human life and to understand how precious it is. 
   And often when we hear in the debate in this institution that we ought to do it for the least of these, truly, truly unborn life is the least of these. Let us recognize it. Let us hold it precious. And let us live up to our constitutional responsibilities, and let us live up to our responsibilities from the Creator and grant our follow citizens that precious right to life. 
   And so the battle goes on, Mr. Speaker. There has been some progress. There are fewer abortions in the land today than there was previously. 
   So I continue to be optimistic. I could not serve in this body unless I was an optimist. There is much work to be done. But I see a day, it may not be in my life, Mr. Speaker, but maybe in the life of my children, maybe in the life of my grandchildren, should I be blessed with any, that one day all Americans will somehow lock arms and lock hearts and decide that they will protect and defend that unalienable right to life; and I thank the gentlelady for yielding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to the distinguished gentleman from Massachusetts, the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, who indicated that part of the package before us was a request of the Bush administration. 
   It may be a request of the Bush administration, but it was necessitated by that gentleman and by others who for years have forestalled any type of reform of Fannie and Freddie, neither man nor beast, half private, half public. You can go back, Mr. Speaker, and look at the record. 
   Before I arrived here almost 6 years ago, the debate has been ensuing how can you have these entities that essentially are able to privatize their profits but socialize their losses and not put the taxpayers at risk? 
   Now we were told, well, there is no taxpayer guarantee here. There's nothing to worry about. I've got a press release here dated '01 from the chairman of the Capital Market Subcommittee who says that the new GSE bill is a solution in search of a problem; that OFHEO has developed and implemented a robust and comprehensive and continuous examination program that works. 
   Well, many of us have said, no, that is wrong. I have got language from, again, the distinguished gentleman from Massachusetts who says, dating back to a hearing in 2003, ``I believe there has been more alarm raised about potential unsafety and unsoundness than, in fact, exists.'' 
   Well, I think what we discovered today is perhaps there is a lot of unsafety. Perhaps there is a lot of unsoundness that has to be addressed. 
   So now we are being asked to take--really this is a historic moment--we are being asked to take a terribly flawed housing bill that could put the taxpayer on the line for $300 billion to help bail out people on Wall Street who made bad bets, and then couple that with an absolutely breathtaking bailout of Fannie and Freddie that in its worst-case scenario, which admittedly is unlikely, but in its worst-case scenario could add $5 trillion to the national debt at the snap of a finger. That's an increase of 50 percent in the national debt overnight. 
   That's what would happen, Mr. Speaker, if you have the Federal taxpayer underwrite all the debts of Fannie and Freddie. I mean, this will help establish this particular Congress as having, perhaps, the worst record on fiscal responsibility in our Nation's history. They have had lots of competition. 
   There are so many different reasons why we should not pass the bill today. Let's look, number one, at the underlying housing bill. You have 95 percent of America that either rents their home, owns their home outright and are current in their mortgage, and they are being asked to bail out the other 5 percent. Now out of that 5 percent, some are very deserving. Some were victims of mortgage fraud, predatory lending. Some had bad reverses in the economy that were beyond their control. But others are not so deserving. Many were speculators. Many engaged in mortgage fraud themselves. There's been an explosion of mortgage fraud in the market.  
   Finally, some people just didn't exercise personal responsibility. When people are struggling to pay their own mortgages, who acted responsibly, they shouldn't be forced to pay for their neighbors as well, much less bail out Wall Street. 
   Let's look at the Fannie and Freddie package.

   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, Fannie and Freddie have become financial Frankensteins that now threaten to gobble their creators. They're private companies that receive special congressional benefits granted no other companies in America, and with these special benefits, they have learned how to privatize their profits and socialize their losses. 
   They've taken these special privileges, and their executives have received millions and millions of dollars in bonuses, some of whom received those bonuses through manipulating earnings, cooking the books, by privatizing their profits. 
   And now we have a bill before us that, taken to its logical conclusion, could cost the taxpayer $5 trillion, increase the national debt 50 percent overnight. They have learned how to socialize their losses. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will admit that contingency is unlikely, but it is likely enough that we have this package before us, because I will admit, Mr. Speaker, that unfortunately, today, Fannie and Freddie are too big to fail. But shame on us if we allow them to be too big to fail tomorrow, or the next year, and send yet again the taxpayer the bill. 
   This legislation before us, Mr. Speaker, not only doesn't prevent a future multibillion dollar bailout, it actually increases its risk. 
   Mr. Speaker, item number one: this bill puts on a mortgage tax on Fannie and Freddie. Now, let's think about that for a second. These are companies that apparently are so poor that we have to bail them out, but apparently, they're so rich that we can impose a new tax on them. It's insanity, Mr. Speaker. 
   Conforming loan limits. Under this legislation, their conforming loan limits can rise, meaning they can engage in even more risky behavior that has nothing to do with low-income housing. 
   Their portfolio cap has already been lifted. Under this legislation their portfolio holdings can increase, who two Federal chairmen have cited as a great source of systemic risk throughout our economy. 
   Their capital standards, already low, they can be lowered even still. I mean, they're a third of what a well-capitalized bank should be. We go from an implicit government backing to explicit government backing.  
   And, Mr. Speaker, think about the precedent. If you're big enough, if you're interconnected enough, if you spend $170 million on lobbying, you become too big to fail. If you're small, independent, and you don't have a lobbyist, well, guess what, you're too small to help but you can still pay the tab for Fannie and Freddie. 
   It's time to take away their special privileges. It's time to introduce legislation over a reasonable period of time that privatizes these institutions. Mr. Speaker, I will do just that tomorrow. 
   We should reject this bill and not send anymore bills to the taxpayer.

   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Smith-Stupak amendment to restore the pro-life Mexico City Policy protections that were effectively stripped from this bill. 
   Human life is a precious commodity and around the globe it is still too often taken for granted. Like millions, in my heart and in my mind, I believe that life begins at conception. And as a Member of this body, I feel I have an obligation to protect the right to life wherever I can. The most effective way to do that now, today, is to support the Mexico City Policy which would prevent our international aid from going to foreign organizations that support or promote abortions. 
   This policy is based on the simple idea that American taxpayers should not be forced to export abortions with their money. Again, we're talking about taking money away from the American taxpayer and using it to subsidize foreign abortions. For most, this defies common sense. It defies fiscal sense. And it is reprehensible to the millions who believe in the fundamental right to life.

   Again, how amazing. What an amazing place this is, when you are debating whether or not you are going to increase something called Foreign Operations 9.5 percent versus 8.5 percent growth, and somehow that is called a cut. Only in Washington, D.C. can you call an 8.5 percent increase a cut. 
   Now, the only thing that I see that is being cut is the family budget of hard  working American families as our friends on the other side of the aisle want to enact the single largest tax increase in American history. The average family in America, when this tax increase plan is complete, will have to pay an extra $3,000 a year in taxes. Mr. Chairman, that is a cut. 
   Mr. Chairman, somehow I have heard that this amendment, the gentleman from Georgia is irresponsible for offering such an amendment. People who work hard for their paychecks in America would be lucky to have an 8.5 percent increase. 
   We are dealing with Foreign Operations here. Maybe we ought to be thinking about family budget operations. Already the Federal Government is spending $23,289 per American family. Our friends on the other side of the aisle now, as we are debating this appropriation bill, have a plan to spend an extra $23 billion in non-defense discretionary, on top of the $6 billion in the omnibus, on top of the $17 billion in the war supplemental, all to be paid for by the single largest tax increase in history. And it is irresponsible to only increase Foreign Operations 8.5 percent? 
   Let's protect the family budget from the Federal budget and support this amendment.

   Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlemen for yielding. I especially appreciate the gentleman's leadership, his principled leadership in this body. For the people of his district in New Jersey, Mr. Garrett is somebody who is truly committed to the principles of Constitutional government, limited government, fiscal responsibility. He is a voice of sanity on this floor. He is admired and respected by all of his colleagues, Mr. Speaker, and I certainly appreciate his leadership here tonight. 
   It is an important topic that he has introduced here tonight, and that is the topic of earmarks, which many people know as pork-barrel spending. I know perhaps pork-barrel spending has been around since the dawn of the Republic, but too often, too often the pork-barrel spending represents a waste of the hard-earned taxpayer money.  
   If you look at the Federal budget, and both myself and the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Speaker, serve on the Budget Committee, the dollars involved are still big. They are still big. We, in this Nation, and we should be ashamed of this, this body should be ashamed that it spends more money on earmarks than it does for the entire veterans health care system. Think about that. Think about that, Mr. Speaker. This is wrong. 
   In the last election, the Democrat party said they were going to be different. I agree with the gentleman from New Jersey. We are both Republicans. We were not always happy with the leadership that we saw in our party in dealing with earmarks, in dealing with the ``bridges to nowhere,'' in dealing with the ``indoor rain forest'' and all the other earmarks that have come to really represent fiscal irresponsibility. But my party finally awoke to the fact that the people would not tolerate this. 
   The Republican party at the end of the last Congress put in reforms to at least bring in the disinfectant of sunshine into this body, so we at least knew where the earmarks were coming from, who was the sponsor, and we had the ability, we had the ability to come to this floor, to come to the people's House and offer amendments to strike those earmarks. 
   Now, the Democrat party had in some respects rightfully criticized the Republican party. They said, well, if you will allow us to come to power, we will be different. We'll be different. The Speaker said, ``We pledge to make this the most honest, ethical and open Congress in history.'' She also went on to say, ``I would just as soon do away with all earmarks.'' Yet now we wake up and the Speaker of the House, I believe, now gets more earmarks than any other Member of Congress. If you are going to lead, you have to lead by example. 
   So what the Democrats have done, Mr. Speaker, is that they have rolled back the transparency, they have rolled back the accountability that the Republicans put in, albeit too late, in the last Congress. 
   This is how under Democrat leadership we end up with the $2 million earmark for the Rangel Center for Public Service requested by none other than Congressman CHARLES RANGEL to provide himself with an office and a library. This is transparency? This is accountability? This is fiscal responsibility? One Member of Congress decides to take $2 million of the people's money and build a museum to himself? This is what the Democrats call responsibility? This is what they call fiscal responsibility? 
   There is $1 million for the Center for Instrumental Critical Infrastructure in Congressman Murtha's district? No one, including the chairman, no one, including the chairman who wrote the bill, could confirm that the organization even existed. But somehow they are going to end up with $1 million. 
   There is $231,000 for the Lincoln Airport Commission, an airport in Illinois that doesn't exist, and an airport that was supposed to come out of the private sector. And the list goes on and on and on. 
   Now, I am not here, Mr. Speaker, to say that every single earmark is a bad use of the people's money. But, more often than not, earmarking represents a triumph of seniority over merit. It represents a triumph of secrecy over accountability. And because of that, it wastes the people's money and it leads to the culture of spending. 
   The American people are not overtaxed. The Federal Government spends too much. We know, Mr. Speaker, already with just the government we have today, adding no new programs, no new benefits, just the government we have today is destined to bankrupt our children and grandchildren. 
   Don't take my word for it. The Comptroller General of America, the chief fiduciary officer of our government, has said that we are on the verge of being the very first America generation in American history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living. Think about that, Mr. Speaker. It has never happened in the entire history of America, that we could be the first generation to break faith with all those other generations that have left us with an America with greater freedom and greater opportunity. Now here we are spending the people's money, taking away from people who do not vote because they are children and those who have not yet been born, and because of the spending patterns of the Federal Government, we are due to leave them a lower standard of living. 
   It was just this week on Wednesday that my wife and I celebrated our son's fourth birthday. We have a daughter who is 5 1/2 . We have a great stake in America's future. I will not be a part, the gentleman from New Jersey will not be a part, the Republican Study Committee will not be a part, the Republican Conference will not be a part of leaving the next generation with that lower standard of living; restricting their freedoms, restricting their opportunities, leaving an America that is less than the America we know. We won't be a part of it. 
   It all starts with the earmarks. The earmarks are the culture of spending. I wish I had been creative enough or articulate enough to come up with the line from the Senator from Oklahoma, who said, ``Earmarks are the gateway drug to spending addiction.'' 
   They teach people to become dependent upon the Federal Government. It totally, totally puts the value of merit aside, and, because of that, it is critical that we reform the process and restrict the number of earmarks. 
   Democrats, the Democrats who in the last election on some occasions again rightfully criticized the Republicans for our earmark practice, but instead they are rolling it back. 
   Now, it is a little bit of inside baseball, but in Washington you have what are known as appropriation earmarks. Ostensibly, the Democrats, our friends from the other side of the aisle, have given us some limited accountability there. But there is also something known as tax earmarks. There is something known as authorizing earmarks, more creative ways to spend the people's money. It is all pork. If you want to go on a lean pork diet, you just can't cut out the sausage. You have to cut out the bacon and the ham as well. The Democrats said they were going to do so much more, and they have done so much less. 
   We all know recently in what is known as the SCHIP bill, and, Mr. Speaker, we all know that Washington excels at acronyms, but in this particular bill, approximately 25 Members of Congress in the dark of night managed to cut some kind of deal in a smoke-filled backroom to get extra reimbursements for their hospitals that nobody else in America receives. 
   Supposedly we were supposed to have accountability. Supposedly we were supposed to have transparency. But not with all the loopholes that the Democrats have put in to their so-called earmark reform process. 
   So I would like to say that talk is cheap, but, unfortunately, talk is rather expensive here, costing billions and billions of dollars in earmarks that the Democrats refuse to clean up, that they claimed they would clean up in the 2006 election, and instead they keep on coming. 
   I remember introducing an amendment on the floor to restrict an earmark that was geared towards the Hollywood movie industry to help train people, train people for Hollywood, this struggling movie industry whose top ten box office hits from just a few weeks ago grossed almost $1 billion. Somehow the American taxpayer has to help them recruit people for their movie sets. 
   The list goes on and on and on. Nothing, nothing has been done. The dollars are still going to the Saint Joseph's College theater renovation in Indiana; $150,000 for the Kansas Regional Prisons Museum in Lansing, Kansas. 
   There is no accountability. There is no transparency. There is no reform here. And because of this, because of this, the next generation is looking at a lower standard of living. 
   That is why I am so happy that the gentleman from New Jersey has come to the floor to lead on this issue for all of the American people, and I am happy to yield back to him.

   Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and this is a very important issue for this body to take up. 
   Again, the term ``discharge petition,'' what does it mean? It is something that shouldn't be necessary. What it says is we are asking Members to have the leadership schedule a vote on this bill so that the Democrats can't roll back the transparency and accountability reforms that the Republicans put in at the end of the last Congress. Again, we are talking about porkbarrel spending here. 
   Every single leader of the Democrat Party claimed they wanted more accountability. They wanted more transparency, and then they go and exempt two-thirds of the spending in what we call authorizing. So they left out huge categories of this. But we shouldn't be surprised because right after the election, when they were bringing spending bills to the floor, they actually wanted us to vote on the spending bill and then later, only later were they going to tell us what the earmarks were in the bill. They tried to hide them from us. We brought that to the attention of the American people and the American people said no. And we enjoyed a victory. Fiscal conservatives made the Democrats at least make good on that pledge and bring this transparency and accountability back here. 
   So this is a very important effort of the Republicans in the House, and we hope we will be joined by the Democrats who claim that they are committed to fiscal responsibility, who claim that they want to have earmark reform. They complained that the Republican earmark reforms didn't go far enough, and yet they rolled them back. All we are saying is bring us what we had at the end of the last Congress.

   Mr. HENSARLING. I will be happy to stay here as long as necessary to have the Democrat leadership commit to the words they made before the election and have their actions after the election comport with those words before the election. 
   And if I could, and I know that time is coming to a close, I would like to add, as you brought up, every Member who comes to this floor with an earmark says this is a good thing; the money can be used for a good cause. I don't doubt that. There are many good causes in America. The YMCA, the Girl Scouts, cut flowers. There are a lot of great causes. But the question is, number one: Is it a Federal priority and how do we pay for it today? 
   Today, since the Federal Government continues to run a deficit, although under our President's leadership with more tax revenue from economic growth, it is falling. But right now, the money for a earmark can only come from one of three sources. number one, by raiding the Social Security trust fund. Is the earmark worth taking money away from our seniors? 
   Under the Democrats, we now have a plan for the single largest tax increase  in history, almost $3,000 per family. More earmarks lead to more taxes. Is it worth putting a $3,000 tax burden on a family of four to pay for the Charlie Rangel Museum to himself? Or debt to our children and grandchildren? Is the Charlie Rangel Museum to himself, is that worth passing on $2 million of debt to our children and grandchildren? It is not worth passing on that debt to my children, and it is not worth passing on that debt to the children of the people of the Fifth Congressional District of Texas, much less the children of the people of America. 
   And so I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership, his principled leadership, in trying to reform earmarks.
