<DOCNO>Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Chairman, I rise today as an original cosponsor and strong supporter of the Employee Free Choice Act. 
   Abraham Lincoln once said, ``If any man tells you he loves America yet hates labor, he is a liar.'' President Lincoln's words are no less true now then they were when he spoke them over a century ago. 
   Organized labor has played a critical role throughout our history. Without it we would never have witnessed the rise of the greatest middle class that the world has ever seen. But there is more to be done. Madam Chairman, over the last six years, our middle class families, including those in my district in Pennsylvania, have been squeezed by the anti-worker policies of this administration. 
   The late Senator Wellstone, a champion of organized labor used to tell this story about the great abolitionist Wendell Philips. One day Philips, in his usual fashion, gave a fiery speech, and said that slavery was unconscionable, an outrage and should be abolished. He finished speaking and a friend came up to him and said, ``Wendell, why are you so on fire?'' He turned to his friend and said ``Brother May, I'm on fire because I have mountains of ice before me to melt.'' 
   We too have mountains of ice to melt. Madam Chairman, there is much to be done to strengthen our middle class and to make sure that they, like their parents, can ensure that their children will have more than they did. For middle class families, the Employee Free Choice Act is a good start down the path to greater prosperity. 
   Everywhere families turn they face ever increasing costs. Health care, education, gas, food, housing. Prices are up, wages are down and middle class families are struggling. People can sit around and argue all day about why the middle class is getting squeezed, but when I think about my friends and neighbors back home in Pennsylvania, it is clear that arguments are no longer good enough--we need to do something. Letting workers organize fairly is a good start. 
   Madam Chairman, I would like to use my time here to set the record straight. For too many years now and for far too many Americans, joining a union has been a risk, rather than a right. I don't think that it's too much to ask that if a majority of workers want to join a union, they should be free to do so. And they should be free to do so without coercion and without misinformation campaigns.

<DOCNO>Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, families across the country are facing record gas prices and increased congestion on our roadways. We hear it every time we go home. And as Members of Congress, we have a responsibility to do what we can do to make things better. This amendment is about making sure that our public transportation resources are being used as effectively and efficiently as possible.  
   Through this measure, we require Amtrak to take a hard look at passenger rail service at two important rail stations in our districts. Our hope is that they will find a way to help commuters and rail passengers in our districts by either expanding passenger rail service through increasing the frequency of stops or by reducing prices. 
   For years, the Cornwells Heights and Princeton Junction stations have been hubs for commuters who work in New York City. Amtrak then cut the number of trains at these stations in half. Then they increased prices for our commuters. 
   Mr. Chairman, countless families rely on the Cornwells Heights and Princeton Junction stations, and as a result of Amtrak's train cuts and fare hikes, families have been forced to drive longer distances or pay much higher fares. Today, our region is making economic progress, and Amtrak has a chance to keep moving us forward. 
   Mr. Chairman, in these troubled times, our local economy can't afford to take anymore hits and we can't allow commuters to use more time on crowded highways when they could be home with their families. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of our time. 
   Mr. Chairman, it now costs a Cornwells Heights commuter $972 per month just to get to work and back. More importantly, the cuts in service have put more cars on our clogged highways, more exhaust fumes in the air, and forced our hardworking constituents to spend more time getting to and from work and less time at home. That means more time on a train or in traffic and less time at home with the ones that they love. 
   Mr. Chairman, our region is experiencing the economic revitalization. Increased rail service and more riders means progress, while more cuts means going backwards. I would like to thank the chairman, Chairman Oberstar. I would like to thank my colleague from Pennsylvania, Mr. Shuster. I would like to thank my colleague from New Jersey, Mr. Holt, and also my other colleague from Pennsylvania, Ms. Schwartz, for their support on this important measure. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Thank you, Chairman Obey and Chairman Murtha. 
   As a solemn and distinguished body, we again stand ready to break with President Bush and demand change in Iraq. And again, we have a chance to do what is right after years of pursuing the wrong strategy, a misguided strategy, that I saw firsthand and a battle my fellow paratroopers are still fighting today. 
   Today, we can come together to do what is right. Today, we can change direction in Iraq, refocus on al Qaeda in Afghanistan and give our troops the GI Bill that they have earned. 
   The question before us is clear: Do we proceed in a bipartisan way with the support of military experts and American families? Or do we continue to allow more political posturing and more of the same while American troops are stuck refereeing a religious civil war? 
   That is the choice we all must make. And to those who stand in the way of change and accountability in Iraq, the American people are paying attention.

   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand with those who want a change. I am proud to fight for accountability in our foreign policy and proud to fight until our brave veterans get the benefits that they deserve. 
   A year ago, I called on my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to stand ready for change. I renew that same call today. Neither our troops nor our veterans can wait for us to change our foreign policy in Iraq, not until next year's sixth anniversary, or the seventh anniversary, or the tenth.

<DOCNO>Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding. 
   You know, it is funny. This is my first time as a member of the 30-Something Group, and I know I am the puppy of the group because I am only 33 years old. So when I ran for Congress, I had tremendous support from the network community, those bloggers out there all across America. But there are bloggers, especially in Philadelphia and greater Philadelphia and the suburbs that blog every day, and they got so excited when the 30-Something Group was their voice when you were in the minority. Your voice in talking about progressive values, talking about the things in the New Direction, that if we were just given the chance, we would lead. And when we got that chance just a few months ago in the 110th Congress, those bloggers, that network community, are just so proud of their efforts. And it is neat for me to be here to think that when we had a rebirth in our country and Philadelphia, the city of Philadelphia was part of that rebirth and to know that six of the ten biggest bloggers in our country are from Philadelphia and the Philadelphia suburbs. People like Chris Bowers of MyDD and Duncan Black of Atrios and how they are following the 30-Something Group every day and to be part of this group now is just a really proud moment. 
   And another proud moment that the gentleman from Florida mentioned is the fact that today is the 20th anniversary of the public service of the Speaker of the House, Ms. Nancy Pelosi from California. And when I was in this body just a few months ago speaking and taking that oath of office, taking that oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States as a Member of Congress, and when I was there with my wife, Jenni, and my 6-month old, at that time a month old, daughter, Maggie Murphy, and I know, Mr. Speaker, that they are watching at home on C-SPAN because I am down here trying to work on behalf of our great country, I know that I was thinking of not just the folks that are over in Iraq, those men that I served with or those men that I had taught when I was a professor at West Point, but I thought about my month-old daughter, Maggie, and I thought about what an incredible story it is that when she was born into this great country, the third most powerful person is a woman, the Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
   And I thought about a role model. Here is this Italian Catholic woman originally from Baltimore, now in San Francisco, and the criticism about the Speaker before she got in here was that she wasn't going to do a good job or she was going to lead from the left. She has really made this a House united. She has reached across the aisle to the Republicans. She has tried to lead in a moderate fashion, and I think we have to give her a lot of credit. I know the analysts have said that she is getting high marks as the Speaker, and I know that I am proud that she is our Speaker and I am proud to serve under her leadership. 
   I will keep my remarks relatively brief. It is my maiden voyage here with the 30-Something Group, and I am joined as well with one of my brothers, the other MURPHY, CHRIS MURPHY, who is the elder statesman from Connecticut, who is a whole, I think, 30 some days older than I am, and I know tonight the Speaker Pro Tempore is the gentleman from the great State of Indiana, the sheriff, but tonight I want to speak about the New Direction that we are bringing about. 
   Finally, the rubber stamp Congress of the past is gone and the do something Congress is here. And we all campaigned in saying that we were going to hold President Bush accountable. And I had served in Baghdad as a captain with the 82nd Airborne Division, and I am so proud of my military service. My father served during Vietnam in the Navy. My grandfather served. My brother is still serving in the Air Force. And I think back to those times and what you come to expect of the Congress. And our men and women who are serving so honorably fight for our country. They fight to support and defend the Constitution of the United States, and they execute the public policy as it is drafted and implemented here in Washington. 
   And I know that I get e-mails from Iraq and Afghanistan and those heroes talk about sometimes they don't know what the policy necessarily should be, but what they do appreciate is the fact that we are actually having a debate, that we are actually asking the tough questions necessary. So when we talk about a New Direction in this 110th Congress, when we talk about accountability, part of that is what we just passed out of the Armed Services Committee with the defense appropriations bill. Talking about in Iraq when we give the Iraqis support, why is it that 4 years later they are still, for the most part, sitting on the sidelines? Why is it that we gave them pallets and pallets, crates and crates of literally U.S. money and pallets stacked this high, shipped it over to Baghdad, gave it out, and billions and billions of dollars are simply missing? 
   When we talk about accountability, we have to talk about the weapons that we have given the Iraqis. In the United States military, and I joined it back in 1993, we are taught pretty early that your weapon is your best friend. There was even a cadence that I used to sing when I would jog in the morning and run troops, ``I used to date a beauty queen; now I date my M-16.'' And it is kind of funny, but it is true in that you are always around your weapon. It is part of that accountability. 
   If you lose your weapon, that is the end of your career. You will be lucky if you don't get court-martialed. 
   But how that relates to Iraq is we have given the Iraqis 14,000 weapons, AK-47s, M-16s, that are now missing. Think about that. We have given 14,000 weapons to the Iraqis that are completely missing, unaccounted for. That is not the accountability that our taxpayers are expecting. That is not the accountability that we should be expecting when we fight the war on terror because when you give billions of dollars over in Iraq, when you give 14,000 weapons to Iraq that are now just missing, that affects the lives of our soldiers. And we cannot stand for that. 
   I would also like to talk about accountability when it comes to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Almost 6 years ago,  our Nation was attacked by Osama bin Laden. Thousands of innocent civilians, innocent Americans were murdered on September 11 of 2001. The culprit: Osama bin Laden. He was in Afghanistan. He trained al Qaeda, and al Qaeda was really given a free pass by the government there, the Taliban. And we made a decision. We got a coalition. We got Canada and all these other countries going in there in Afghanistan to do the job. And then a short time later, President Bush said, no, let's change our focus to Iraq. Well, we have ten times more troops now in Iraq now than in Afghanistan. And when we talk about accountability, you have to ask the question, what are we doing to get Osama bin Laden? Why is it that we give Pakistan billions of dollars? We actually give Pakistan $80 million a month because we have intelligence that is unclassified that we can talk about here in this setting that Osama bin Laden is in Afghanistan and possibly on the border of Pakistan. So we need Pakistan's help as an ally. 
   Why is it that President Musharraf has outsourced the hunt for Osama bin Laden to his regional warlords? 
   Years ago we learned that we outsourced the hunt for Osama bin Laden in Tora Bora and he slipped through our fingers when we had a chance. We can't repeat the same mistakes. So if we are giving support to Pakistan and Afghanistan, which we should, they are our allies, we need to demand accountability. We need to demand the accountability that the American taxpayers, that the American families, and that the American soldiers deserve. 
   And the last point I would like to bring up on my maiden voyage here in the 30-something Group is education. One of the greatest jobs I ever had was being a professor at West Point teaching constitutional military law. And it was the Constitution that those young cadets who were about to become second lieutenants were going to take an oath to support and defend. And education is vital for Americans and our students to be more and more competitive in a global economy. 
   I joke with the gentleman from Florida we are not competing in my district in Bucks County for jobs against Florida. As I look at Mr. Altmire, we are not competing with the folks in Pittsburgh in Bucks County. I look at the congressman from Connecticut (Mr. Murphy). We are not competing with jobs necessarily against the folks in Connecticut. We are competing for jobs with people in China and South Korea and Japan and in Europe. And we need to have high investment in education so we remain more competitive. 
   And this gets me into our national debt. Right now our debt is over $9 trillion. So that means every man, woman, and child in America owes over $29,000 to our national debt. So that means when my daughter, Maggie, was born 6 months ago at Lower Bucks Hospital in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, she was born in that hospital and she owed $29,000 to our national debt. That is a debt that we owe to foreign countries like communist China, like Japan, like South Korea, like Mexico. We keep borrowing and borrowing and borrowing and borrowing. 
   Now, when I am back home, people say to me, Patrick, we are at war. Of course it is going to cost money. 
   And I say, $9 trillion we have in debt, $9 trillion; yet this war in Iraq has only cost at this point about $450 billion. That is a huge difference. 
   And how it relates to education is just in March of 2007, we paid $21 billion just that month on the interest rate to this debt, just paying off the interest rate that we owe, $21 billion. But that same month we only paid $5 billion in education. So what we spend on education, $5 billion, we spend four times that much that same month on our interest rate on our debt. 
   We need a change and we are making that change happen here in the 110th Congress. And I am proud to be part of it. I am proud to be part of the leadership to make sure we do what is necessary, establishing a pay-as-you-go system, doing the things necessary to hold all of us accountable and this government accountable. 
   So I would say to the gentleman of Florida, thank you for giving me the opportunity on this maiden voyage. I look forward to many more times back here with the 30-something Group, and I am proud of all those supporters not just back home in Bucks County and northeast Philadelphia and Montgomery County and the network community. I am proud, on this 20th anniversary, of the public service of our leader, Speaker Pelosi, to be here amongst the 30-something Group. Thank you so much.

<DOCNO>Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE MONTH -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Bucks County Community College in celebration of National Community College Month. By  providing a gateway to higher learning for those who would otherwise be unable to continue their education, community colleges, like Bucks County, are improving our society and our communities. We need to continue to work to make college more accessible, so that we continue to build a more competitive workforce. Madam Speaker, by supporting these important institutions of higher education we can ensure their ability to serve students eager for knowledge and a path to a successful future. 
   Madam Speaker, I am a strong advocate of community colleges because I am the product of a community college. After graduating from high school, I enrolled at Bucks County Community College, in Newtown, Pennsylvania, where I gained the ability and confidence to achieve. My year at Bucks County Community College was very important. It prepared me for King's College, Widener University School of Law and eventually to serve as an educator myself at West Point. My love of learning and teaching blossomed at Bucks County Community College--an experience no doubt shared by so many across our great Nation. 
   For more than 40 years, Bucks County Community College has provided a critical service to Bucks County. Whether students are there as a stepping stone to another college or university, or preparing for jobs in business, public service or health care, Bucks provides a high quality education and a great environment in which to learn. The college has expanded its services by opening two campuses in addition to its main campus in Newtown. This has increased accessibility, especially for those continuing their education while working full-time. As one of the oldest community colleges in Pennsylvania, Bucks County Community College has established itself as a leader in education, not just among other community colleges, but among all colleges and universities. 
   If not for Bucks County Community College, I would not be where I am today. I know that mine is not the only case in which a community college changed the life of a young student. With 11 million students enrolled at more than 1,200 community colleges nationwide, these schools provide an invaluable service to a large portion of our community. Madam Speaker, these affordable, local institutions give every student, of every background, the ability to experience the benefits of higher education. 
   It was at Bucks County Community College that I learned how hard I could work and how much I could achieve. Like millions of other students, all I needed was an opportunity, and I took advantage of it. Madam Speaker, this is the unique and necessary function of our community colleges. They give every student a chance to succeed. 
   Madam Speaker, my appreciation for the opportunity provided by our community colleges is personal and near to my heart. I Urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Res. 334.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the 2008 Departments of Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill. This bill funds domestic priorities that are important to all Americans and invests in our Nation's future. 
   To help keep our families and neighborhoods safe, it provides a much-needed increase to the COPS program. To support American competitiveness and improve science and technology education, this bill increases funding for the National Science Foundation. 
   In a global economy, investment in American innovation and regional development must be a priority. Madam Speaker, I am pleased that this appropriations bill provides over $300 million for the Economic Development Administration and encourages new investment in green technologies to reduce energy use. 
   Over the past 50 years, my district in Bucks County, Pennsylvania has lost most of its manufacturing jobs. While towns in my district still struggle with these dramatic economic changes, I am encouraged by forward thinking plans that have brought high-tech and green energy companies to my district. 
   Fairless Hills, Bucks County, once home to heavy steel manufacturing, now boasts one of Pennsylvania's premier examples of industrial revitalization. Twenty-four hundred acres in Fairless Hills, known as the Keystone Industrial Port Complex (KIPC), are designated a Keystone Opportunity Improvement Zone by the State of Pennsylvania. The important economic incentives available at KIPC, coupled with its strategic location on the Delaware River, make the site attractive to new companies. Two renewable energy companies have already located there. 
   Public and private economic development professionals continue to work hard at every level to attract new investment, support workforce development and improve regional infrastructure. I am a proud partner in these endeavors because I know the enormous potential of this project to revitalize the region. 
   The United States must look to the future and support proactive regional initiatives that not only create jobs, but advance our Nation's commitment to energy independence. New investments for the Economic Development Administration will go a long way toward achieving these goals. 
   Mr. Chairman, by passing this bill, we provide our communities with the resources necessary for successful development and we invest in America's future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Thank you to the gentleman from Wisconsin. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are 435 Members of Congress, and I know there are many people on the other side of the aisle who don't know who I am. I am PATRICK MURPHY, and I am from Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Back home, my wife and my daughter Maggie are watching, probably on C-SPAN right now. 
   Over 13 years ago, I wore the United States Army uniform for the first time. I was able to live the American dream. I was able to rise through the ranks and become a captain and a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division. We had a saying in the Army: Lead, follow or get out of the way. 
   Well, in the past 4 years, the Republican-led Congress followed. They had their chance, and they followed lockstep as this President led our country into an open-ended commitment refereeing a religious civil war. 
   For the last 4 years, this Republican Congress followed lockstep as my fellow soldiers continued to die in Iraq without a clear mission, without benchmarks to determine success, without a clear timeline for coming home. In the last 4 years, the Republican Congress followed this President as thousands of brave American soldiers returned home in coffins with our American flag. Nineteen of those coffins had soldiers that I served with in Iraq, 19 paratroopers. 
   Mr. Speaker, with this bill, with this vote, we mark the end of that error. 
   Many of the 49 new freshmen, both Democrats and Republicans, were elected a few months ago on the promise of new leadership, and that is what this bill does. It leads our way out of Iraq. It leads the way to rebuild our overextended Army, and leads the way to win the war on terror. 
   To those on the other side of the aisle who are opposed, I want to ask you the same questions that my gunner asked me when I was leading a convoy up and down Ambush Alley one day. He said, ``Sir, what are we doing over here? What's our mission? When are these Iraqis going to come off the sidelines and stand up for their own country?'' 
   So to my colleagues across the aisle, your taunts about supporting our troops ring hollow if you are still unable to answer those questions now 4 years later. 
   Mr. Speaker, to vote ``no'' on this bill is to stand idly by, to let our commitment to Iraq remain open-ended and to let countless more American soldiers be killed in the sands of al-Anbar and the streets of Baghdad. 
   Short-term political peril may sidestep those who cast their vote for the status quo, but our children's history books will not treat them kindly, nor should they. 
   Mr. Speaker, the 110th Congress will be judged whether we have the political courage to put forth a plan to restore accountability and oversight, to bring our troops home from Iraq and, most importantly, to win the war on terror. 
   This is our opportunity. This is our chance to lead. For too long, the American people have been craving leadership, craving accountability and craving a new direction in Iraq. Let's give that to them today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I take the floor today not as a Democrat or a Republican, but as an Iraq war veteran who was a captain with the 82nd Airborne Division in Baghdad. Three years ago I came home, but 19 of my fellow paratroopers did not. 
   I rise to give a voice to the hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians and veterans across the globe who are deeply troubled by the President's plan to escalate the number of American troops in Iraq. 
   I served in Baghdad from June 2003 to January 2004. I saw firsthand this administration's failed policies in Iraq. 
   In this new Congress, there are 49 new faces. I am proud that five of those 49 new faces are veterans. All five of those veterans are Democrats. 
   Today, I stand with my other military veterans, Sergeant Major Tim Walz and Admiral Joe Sestak. We stand together to tell this administration that we are against the escalation and to say with one voice that Congress will no longer be a blank check to the President's failed policies. 
   Mr. Speaker, the time for more troops was 4 years ago, but this President ignored the military experts like General Shinseki and General Zinni, who in 2003 called for more troops, several hundred thousand more troops, to secure Iraq. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, our President is ignoring military leaders again, patriots like General Colin Powell, General Abizaid and the bipartisan Iraq Study Group who were clear: the President's plan to send more of our best and bravest to die refereeing a civil war in Iraq is wrong. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is a time for a new direction in Iraq. From my time serving with the 82nd Airborne Division in Iraq, it became clear that in order to succeed we must make it clear to the Iraqis that we are not going to be there forever. Yet 3 years after I left Iraq, Americans are still running convoys up and down Ambush Alley and securing Iraqi street corners. 
   Today I am proud to stand with my fellow veterans and support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, we often hear from our colleagues on the other side that the only way to support the troops is to blindly support the President. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask anyone to look at Admiral Joe Sestak, a man who was responsible for the safety and security of 15,000 sailors and marines, and tell him that he does not support the troops. I ask them to look at Sergeant Tim Walz, a man who served his country for 24 years in the Minnesota National Guard as a noncommissioned officer, the backbone of our Army, and tell him he does not support our troops. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are the troops, and we oppose the President's escalation of troops.

   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I take to the floor today, not as a Democrat or a Republican, but as an Iraq war veteran who was a captain of the 82nd Airborne Division in Baghdad. 
   I speak with a heavy heart for my fellow paratrooper Specialist Chad Keith, Specialist James Lambert and the 17 other brave men I served with who never made it home. 
   I rise to give voice to hundreds of thousands of patriotic Pennsylvanians and veterans across the globe who are deeply troubled by the President's call to escalate the number of American troops in Iraq. 
   I served in Baghdad from June of 2003 to January of 2004. Walking in my own combat boots, I saw firsthand this administration's failed policy in Iraq. I led convoys up and down Ambush Alley in a Humvee without doors, convoys that Americans still run today because too many Iraqis are still sitting on the sidelines. 
   I served in al-Rashid, Baghdad, which, like Philadelphia, is home to 1.5 million people. While there are 7,000 Philadelphia police officers serving, like my father in Philadelphia, protecting its citizens, there were only 3,500 of us in al-Rashid, Baghdad. 
   Mr. Speaker, the time for more troops was 4 years ago, but this President ignored military experts like General Shinseki and General Zinni, who, in 2003, called for several hundred thousand troops to secure Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, our President, again, is ignoring military leaders, patriots like General Colin Powell, like General Abizaid and members of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group who oppose this escalation. 
   But most importantly, Congresses in the past did not stand up to the President and his policies. But today I stand with my other military veterans, some who were just elected, like Sergeant Major TIM WALZ, Admiral JOE SESTAK and Commander CHRIS CARNEY. We stand together to tell this administration that we are against this escalation, and that Congress will no longer give the President a blank check. 
   Mr. Speaker, close to my heart is a small park on the corner of 24th and Aspen Streets in Philadelphia. This is the Patrick Ward Memorial Park. Patrick Ward was a door gunner in the U.S. Army during Vietnam. He was killed serving the country that he loved. He was the type of guy that neighborhoods devote street corners to and parents name their children after him, including my parents, Marge and Jack Murphy. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask you, how many more street corner memorials are we going to have for this war? This is what the President's proposal does. It sends more of our best and bravest to die refereeing a civil war. Just a month ago, Sergeant Jae Moon from my district in Levittown, Bucks County, was killed in Iraq. 
   You know, a few blocks away from this great Chamber, when you walk in the snow, is the Vietnam Memorial, where half the soldiers listed on that wall died after America's leaders knew our strategy would not work. It was immoral then, and it would be immoral now to engage in the same delusion. That is why sending more troops in the civil war is the wrong strategy. 
   We need to win the war on terror, and reasonable people may disagree on what to do, but most will agree that it is immoral to send young Americans to fight and die in a conflict without a real strategy for success. The President's current course is not resolute, it is reckless. That is why I will vote to send a message to our President that staying the course is no longer an option. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time for a new direction in Iraq. From my time serving with the 82nd Airborne Division in Iraq, it became clear that in order to succeed there, you must tell the Iraqis that we will not be there forever. Yet, 3 years now since I have been home, it is still Americans leading convoys up and down Ambush Alley and securing Iraqi street corners. We must make the Iraqis stand up for Iraq and set a timeline to start bringing our heroes home. 
   That is why I am proud to be an original cosponsor, with Senator BARACK OBAMA and fellow paratrooper, Congressman MIKE THOMPSON, of the Iraq De-escalation Act, a moderate and responsible plan to start bringing our troops home, mandating a surge in diplomacy and refocusing our efforts on the war on terror and Afghanistan. 
   Mr. Speaker, our country needs a real plan to get our troops out of Iraq, to protect our homeland and to secure and refocus our efforts on capturing and killing Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda. There are over 130,000 American servicemen and women serving bravely in Iraq. Unfortunately, thousands more are on the way. An open-ended strategy that ends in more faceless roadside bombs in Baghdad and more street-corner memorials in America is not one that I will support.

<DOCNO>Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I want to add a word of my support of Mr. Pallone's amendment. The issue of companies circumventing the law and the wishes of cities and towns in this Nation deserves to be addressed. 
   In my district, in Bensalem, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, a firm wanted to build a waste transfer station. Given the potential environmental and health risks, both the local community and even the State voiced their objections to the proposal. As an end run around this, the rail company that would service the proposed waste transfer facility applied to the Federal Surface Transportation Board, or the STB, to, in effect, have the waste transfer facility declared a rail facility. This was an attempt to supersede the rulings of the State and local entities that had already rejected the proposed waste transfer station. Fortunately, the rail company's application was rejected, but they can reapply to the STB at any time. 
   Just yesterday I stood with Bensalem Mayor Joe DiGirolamo and Pennsylvania State Representative Gene DiGirolamo and opposed this facility. Mr. Chairman, people in the local, State and Federal level are all opposed to this end run around the law. 
   Mr. Chairman, when Congress created the STB, it was never intended to allow decisions by the STB to be used to override the wishes of cities and towns across the country, and certainly not as a means of superseding health and environmental regulations of State and local governments. Yet that is exactly what is happening. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his excellent leadership on this issue, and thank Chairman Olver for providing me the opportunity to speak today and stand up for the residents of Bensalem and the Eighth District of Pennsylvania.

   I stand with the Republican State Representative from my district, Gene DiGirolamo, as we fight together to preserve these critical laws in conference. Mr. DiGirolamo of Bensalem is a leading advocate for mental health parity, and has worked tirelessly for health care laws that are fair and just.

   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   I come before you today, Mr. Chairman, on behalf of Anne Beck of Erwinna, Pennsylvania; Tony Plescha of Yardley, Pennsylvania; Nancy Rees of Yardley, Pennsylvania; and thousands of families across my district of Bucks County who have been hit by three floods in 3 years. 
   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to picture a family distraught, a home in tatters, and rain that just won't stop. If that family asked for help, either from their insurance company or from FEMA, they would face a maze of bureaucracy instead of relief. As of right now, there is no one who will fight for families or business owners who seek assistance in rebuilding after a catastrophic storm. 
   We are trying to change that here today. With this amendment, we are looking to create the Office of the Flood Insurance Advocate, someone to fight for all of us when we need help the most. 
   Modeled after the successful Taxpayer Advocate Service at the IRS, this office would fight the battles for weary, rain-soaked families and businesses looking to rebuild. 
   In creating the Flood Insurance Advocate, our measure would help cut through the red tape. The National Flood Insurance Advocate would do two major things: the first, report to Congress about problems facing the flood insurance program; and, second, determine the most effective way to create the Office of the Flood Insurance Advocate nationwide. 
   Mr. Chairman, families and businesses back home need our help. 
   I now yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New York, a colleague in the Blue Dog Coalition, Mr. Mike Arcuri.

   Mr. Chairman, in closing, I want to tell you about Nancy Rees of Yardley, Pennsylvania. Over the last 3 years, Yardley was hit with three floods. Mrs. Rees came to our office because her insurance policy was rated with the wrong formulas. This seemingly simple mistake cost her an extra $10,000 per year in insurance premiums. $10,000 more a year. Thankfully for Mrs. Rees, after countless hours of working with our staff, she was successful. But in this case, a flood insurance advocate could have stood up for her in the wake of a major flood. That is why we need to pass this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL TEEN DRIVER SAFETY WEEK -- (House of Representatives - September 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I am proud to join my colleague from Pennsylvania, Mr. DENT, in supporting the goals and ideals of National Teen Driver Safety Week. I signed on as an original co-sponsor of this important initiative because I believe that teen driver safety--especially in Pennsylvania--deserves our support and our attention. This is an important piece of legislation and I urge my fellow Members of Congress to support it today. 
   I am also proud of the research and prevention efforts of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, which includes a campus in my district. We should all applaud their commitment to keeping our teens and roads safer and I hope that the establishment of Teen Driver Safety Week will bring attention to this important issue in communities like mine across the United States. 
   Madam Speaker, the figures are daunting: Almost 7,500 drivers between the ages of 15 and 20 were involved in fatal crashes in 2005 and the fatality rate for teens is four times the rate for drivers between 25 and 69. The good news is that we can do something about it. The majority of teen driver crashes in our country are due to avoidable mistakes like speeding or cell phone use. The research shows that involvement from parents, educators and peers can make the difference in saving young lives. 
   In my own district, an organization called Central Bucks Cares is leading the charge to engage teen drivers in safe driving practices. After the tragic deaths of Laura Lauterbach and James Ogden, both students at Central Bucks East High School, the nonprofit community coalition assembled a roundtable discussion on teen driving. Following the roundtable, student intern Sarah Canavan of Buckingham helped Central Bucks Cares to draft a contract that teen drivers and their parents could agree to. 
   Teens agree to responsible driving practices, including courteous behavior towards other drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians, as well as adherence to traffic laws and road signs. Parents agree to serve as good role models in their own driving and to encourage safe driving practices by enforcing the terms of the contract. 
   Sarah's younger sister Amy and her mother were the first teen/parent pair to sign and fully support the agreement. I hope that many more families in Pennsylvania and nationwide will follow their example in making a commitment to safer teen driving. 
   Madam Speaker, I see the difference that Central Bucks Cares is making in my district and I hope that this legislation will help other communities to do the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (TRADE AND GLOBALIZATION ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support much-needed economic redevelopment through the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act. This forwarding-thinking legislation will ensure that America's workers receive the training and assistance they need to compete in the global economy. 
   Globalization has had a significant impact on the American workforce, but our national policies have not kept pace with international economic changes. Gone are the days when men and women began and ended their careers at a steel or textile mill. Now, even customer service professionals and software engineers are losing jobs to overseas competition. 
   Thirty years ago, in my district in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, more than 46,000 people were employed in manufacturing jobs. Like many other working-class communities, my district suffered severe job loss when foreign competition forced major employers like US Steel, Jones Apparel and Rohm and Haas to shut-down most of their operations. By 2005, manufacturing employment in Bucks County had fallen 34 percent. The departure of manufacturing jobs resulted in vacant properties, abandoned buildings and contaminated land--and in Bristol, Pennsylvania, crumbling roads and poor drainage put families at risk during a recent flood. But most of all, the decline in manufacturing jobs decline left thousands of middle class workers out of a job. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act makes substantial improvements to the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program and gives communities like mine a chance. 
   Through the Manufacturing Redevelopment Zone Program, this legislation will provide important tax incentives to cities and towns like those in my district that have suffered substantial reductions in manufacturing employment. Communities designated as manufacturing redevelopment zones will have a second-chance to revitalize their economy by attracting new investments that will create family-sustaining jobs. This program will help lift-up some of our Nation's poorest communities, but it is also a chance to demonstrate our commitment to American innovation. 
   While towns in my district still face many challenges, lower Bucks County has begun to turn the comer. Over the past 5 years, we have worked hard attract new investment, support workforce development and improve infrastructure. 
   The ongoing redevelopment at a former US Steel site is an outstanding example of my community's potential. Through incentives and a commitment to revitalization, that site is now home to a clean wind power manufacturer that employs over 800 people. More high-tech, green energy companies plan to open facilities in the near future. We have made great progress, but there is more work to be done. 
   The additional incentives provided under a manufacturing zone designation would allow towns in lower Bucks County to make infrastructure improvements, cleanup brownfields, attract new investments and create jobs. Through ingenuity and good old fashioned American competitiveness we will move even closer to economic revitalization and energy independence. 
   Mr. Speaker, Lower Bucks County has enormous potential and I pledge to do everything I can to encourage economic growth and support middle class families in my district. Towns in my district are still struggling and I am proud to partner local leaders and the business community to support economic development. 
   By passing this bill, we give hard working Americans the support they need and strengthen a foundation for economic leadership. I urge my colleagues to support this critical piece of legislation.

   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join the Girl Scouts of the USA in celebrating their 95th anniversary. Since its founding in 1912, the Girl Scouts has become the world's preeminent organization for girls. Back then they had just 18 members, but today, there are 3.7 million Girl Scouts--2.7 million girl members and 928,000 adult members working primarily as volunteers.  
   Girl Scouting builds confidence, character, and leadership skills which allow girls to grow into young women who make positive contributions to the world around them. Each unique experience, be it reading to younger students or participating in a math competition, empowers girls and helps them reach their full potential. 
   On the national level, the Girl Scouts of the USA has been an advocate for girls' involvement in math, science and engineering; for violence prevention and for the health and safety of all girls. Through their many government and corporate partnerships, the Girl Scouts bring innovative programming to girls throughout the country and expand their reach to underserved communities where girls need it most. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud that the Girl Scouts of Freedom Valley, which serves my district, has over 21,000 members and 7,000 adult volunteers. I am proud to have such a wonderful team of volunteers dedicated to the leadership and character development of girls in Southeastern Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I know that all of us take pride knowing that each and every Girl Scout of today will be one of tomorrow's leaders. 
   I know the Girl Scouts of the USA will celebrate many more anniversaries and continue to be a positive influence on our Nation's girls and on our society for generations to come.

<DOCNO>Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (CONDEMNING THE DECISION BY THE UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE UNION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM TO SUPPORT A BOYCOTT OF ISRAELI ACADEMIA -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlelady from Texas for her leadership on this issue and the gentlelady from Florida. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer a resolution to let the world know that this House stands opposed to anti-Semitism and reaffirms our support for academic freedom. It is sad that in this day and age I would have to offer such a resolution, but the actions of a misguided group thousands of miles away have forced this body to act. 
   Madam Speaker, in May the leadership of the University and College Union, or UCU, the main union representing 120,000 British college teachers, called for a boycott of Israeli academic institutions. As a former professor myself at the United States Military Academy at West Point, I know how wrong this action is from an academic and diplomatic perspective. 
   This boycott will sever academic contacts and exchanges of personnel between British and Israeli academic institutions, as well as have a significant economic impact, given that the union enjoys significant influence in Britain. 
   The reasons given by the leadership of the UCU for endorsing a boycott consist of the same tired propaganda and inflammatory rhetoric typically used by the enemies of Israel and do not deserve to be repeated on the floor of this distinguished body. This call for a boycott by the UCU is even more disturbing, given that Britain's National Union of Journalists called for a similar boycott this past April. 
   It should come as no surprise that these boycotts have drawn harsh criticism. In a recent editorial entitled ``Malicious Boycotts,'' the New York Times called them nonsense, writing, and I quote, ``Who would respect the judgment of a scholar who selects or rejects colleagues on political grounds? Who would trust the dispatches of a reporter who has openly engaged against one side of a conflict? Critical thinking and well thought-out criticism are intrinsic to good scholarship and good journalism. These boycotts represent neither.'' 
   The criticism, though, does not end there. Now former Prime Minister  Tony Blair has criticized the boycott saying, ``I hope very much that decision is overturned because it does absolutely no good for the peace process or for relations in that part of the world.'' 
   Madam Speaker, the former Prime Minister is right. We need to build dialogue and trust in the Middle East and we cannot do that without our greatest ally there, the State of Israel. Israel is a stable democracy that shares our values. This is rare in a region of the world where few nations have democracy, rule of law and religious freedom. 
   As an Iraq war veteran, I know firsthand just how dangerous that part of the world truly is. That's why when Israel comes under attack from hatemongers, it's the American values that are also under such attack. Today, by passing this bipartisan resolution, we're stating with one voice that this Congress will stand up and defend our friend, the State of Israel. 
   Specifically, my resolution condemns the decision by the UCU leadership to boycott Israeli academia and urges the general membership to reject the boycott. It also urges the academic community and individual governments to reject any call for a boycott of Israel and to reaffirm the importance of academic freedom. 
   Limiting academic exchange and shrinking the marketplace of ideas only hinders our ability to bring peace to the Middle East and to help solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
   Madam Speaker, in closing, I want to make sure that I thank some of my distinguished colleagues who were instrumental in bringing this resolution to the floor today; the chairman of the Subcommittee on Europe, ROBERT WEXLER; and the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, TOM LANTOS; and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. These three distinguished Members have proven themselves to be leaders in standing up for Israel, and I thank them for all their work in bringing this resolution to the floor. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I will conclude by urging swift passage of this critical resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey. I rise in support of the gentleman's amendment from the great State of New Jersey. I rise because this debate is personal to me. 
   Madam Chairman, as a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division, I saw American heroes at their finest, gaining vital intelligence the right way. We have all seen images of what happens when young soldiers are left without clear leadership at the top. Simply put, the treatment of detainees is a strategic imperative to every servicemember wearing the uniform and every American we took an oath to support and protect. 
   In the first Gulf War, over 100,000 Iraqi soldiers surrendered to American forces because they knew that they would be treated humanely by the American forces. Thousands who did not hide behind street corners with RPGs or IEDs. 
   The treatment of detainees is what set America apart as a global leader, and it is how we begin to restore the reputation squandered by President Bush and the tragedy of Abu Ghraib. 
   Madam Chairman, there is nobody in this chamber who supports the vigorous interrogation of suspected terrorists more than me, but it must be done the way that reflects the greatness of America and in a way that protects our fighting men and women. Madam Chairman, this amendment helps do just that. 
   One of my heroes, General Colin Powell, once said: The world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism. 
   Will this amendment fix all our problems? Of course not. But it certainly is a start. I urge my colleagues to vote for the gentleman's amendment.

   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Chairman, I have great respect for the gentleman from California, and that he is also a paratrooper. But, Madam Chairman, I would suggest that those were my same concerns. In that letter we address those concerns that the Under Secretary said; that in forward operating bases in the environment, there is no mandate in this bill that would require them to videotape the interrogations. It is only at the strategic level in theater, only where they go. 
   In my case in al Rasheed, Baghdad in 2002, 2004, Madam Chairman, we would interrogate them at a forward operating base, then we would bring them up to the Baghdad airport, then they would go to somewhere else. It would only be at that higher level, not at the forward operating base. And we put that language in this bill to address those exact concerns. 
   So although I respect greatly the service and the commitment of the gentleman from California and his concerns, those concerns were addressed in this bill. And that is why I support our amendment.

   In the post-9/11 world, we must utilize all the tools at our disposal to keep our country safe and secure. That is why Congresswoman Schwartz and I, along with our Governor and the majority of the Pennsylvania delegation, are fighting to form a homeland security hub at Willow Grove. Strategically located near Philadelphia, New York City, and Washington, D.C., this air base must continue to serve as a strategic asset for our regional and national security. 
   Madam Chairman, our amendment is simple: It prohibits the base from becoming a commercial, cargo, or passenger airport. Maintaining Willow Grove's strategic focus ensures that we continue to keep Pennsylvania families safe. This is a commonsense, bipartisan way to secure our region. It's a matter of national security. 
   I thank the Pennsylvania delegation, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment.

   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Thank you, Congressman Ross. I will make sure that when my wife and I retire today we will pray for your brother-in-law over in the Middle East. He is one of our heroes, and we are proud of his service to the country. 
   I rise today to bring an end to the pattern of systemic neglect from the White House. Last November, American families sent Democrats to Congress to bring about change. There are now 49 new Members in the House of Representatives. Five of those Members are veterans. Of those five, I am proud to say they are all Democrats. I am also proud to say that three of the five are from the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in Admiral SESTAK, Commander CARNEY, and myself. 
   Change from the neglect our military veterans are currently experiencing, as they try to get the health care they deserve, Americans have seen now the past few days what is going on in Walter Reed. It is our opinion that this is criminal neglect.     
   But when the people voted for change in November, they voted to change from the strategy in Iraq that has American troops refereeing a civil war while too many Iraqis sit on the sidelines, and a change in the way we pay for the war in Iraq. 
   The American taxpayers have spent more than $400 billion in Iraq. If they were to see an invoice, just one invoice, taxpayers would see the widespread waste, fraud, and abuse. And that is why, as Blue Dogs, we stood together with the Iraqi Accountability Act. Fifty-eight Members of Congress agreed to this act. Congressmen ALLEN, ALTMIRE, ARCURI, BACA, BAIRD, BARROW, BEAN, BERRY, BISHOP, BOSWELL, BOYD, BOYDA, BRADY, BRALEY, CARDOZA, CASTOR, CHANDLER, COSTA, DAVIS, DONNELLY, ELLSWORTH, GILLIBRAND, GONZALEZ, HARE, HARMAN, HERSETH, HILL, HODES, HOLDEN, ISRAEL, MAHONEY, MARSHALL, MATHESON, MCINTYRE, MCNERNEY, MELANCON, MARCHANT, MILLER, MITCHELL, DENNIS MOORE, GWEN MOORE, PETERSON, POMEROY, ROSS, SALAZAR, SCHWARTZ, SCOTT, SHULER, TANNER, THOMPSON, WELCH, FILNER, WALZ, CLARKE, ELLISON, SIRES, HOLT, REYES.  
   All of these Members, all 58 Members are cosponsors to the Iraq Accountability bill, and they signed on because they have seen what is really going on. They have seen that over the past 4 years families of my district of Bucks County, Pennsylvania and northeast Philadelphia and across the country have heard a lot of bad news from Iraq. 
   But we are also hearing about money lost and weapons missing. Recently here in Congress we heard from the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. He spoke to the Armed Services Committee, and he told us about $9 billion that has simply vanished. But as many as 14,000 weapons have disappeared, weapons that could be in the enemy's hands right now. These are dollars and these are weapons that were sent to the Iraqis that have gone missing because of mismanagement and fraud. It is not just about the money, but it is also about the safety of our troops. Those missing weapons could arm an entire division of the Muqtada al-Sadr army, an entire division. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is long past time that we kept track of the money and the weapons that we are giving to the Iraqis and replace the fraud, waste, and abuse with proper oversight, responsibility, and accountability. 
   The legislation that the Blue Dogs are supporting addresses the glaring lack of oversight and accountability in Iraq and addresses how taxpayer dollars are spent on the war. It puts forward commonsense proposals that ensure that fewer resources are wasted and more resources get to the troops on the battlefield. 
   This legislation calls for transparency in how Iraq's war funds are spent. It urges the establishment of a Truman committee-type commission to track and curb the fraud, waste, and abuse. It calls for the Iraqi war to go through the normal budgeting process, not through emergency bills or supplementals. These are measures everyone should agree on regardless of the political party. 
   American families are frustrated with the war in Iraq. This legislation will go a long way toward providing the change that we all seek and the transparency that we all deserve. It is time for answers, Mr. Speaker, and it is time for accountability, and it is time to put an end to the pattern of neglect.

   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today for a simple yet important purpose. I rise alongside my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to say that we support a 3.5 percent pay increase for the brave men and women of our Armed Forces. 
   Madam Speaker, when I was serving in Baghdad, I fought alongside Specialist Juan Arevalo, or ``RV'' to his friends and fellow paratroopers. RV is a quick-witted and fearless Texan who had the trust of everyone in our brigade and would say things to make us laugh or make us think, even during war. 
   We used to joke that RV signed up for active duty in the Army without even knowing that soldiers got paid. The joke was that he was so innocent, he thought the only compensation he received was training, housing, and three square meals a day. Serving in Iraq and making just over $15,000 a year, RV told everybody he was the richest man in Iraq. 
   Even though RV would have worked for free in our military, he shouldn't have to, and neither should the families who depend on their loved ones overseas. 
   More than 1.6 million soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. Many of them multiple times. These are the brave men and women whose pay we seek to raise today, a pay raise that is long overdue. 
   Madam Speaker, there are more than 3 million family members who count on someone serving on active duty in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today we fight not just for those soldiers but for their families as well. 
   Our resolution points out that there is currently a 4 percent pay gap between members of the Armed Forces and those in civilian life. At a time when our Armed Forces are stretched so thin, we need to offer more comparable pay to the private sector to retain the most qualified service men and women. Our resolution also gives thanks for their valiant service to our Nation. 
   Madam Speaker, this is a commonsense measure. But, unfortunately, our President has called this pay increase ``unnecessary.'' And yet 2 weeks ago President Bush said, ``America should do what it takes to support our troops.'' The President criticizes the spending priorities of this Congress but stands in the way of a pay increase for our troops. 
   I say the President should do what it takes to support our troops. This pay raise is long overdue and it is necessary, and President Bush's opposition to it is simply unconscionable. 
   Madam Speaker, with a 3.5 percent pay increase, we aren't talking about a lot of money. But for a private in Iraq making less than $16,000 a year in basic pay, that small increase would make all the difference in the world. For enlisted men with bills to pay and young children to support, several hundred dollars a year more is a big deal. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones) for his courageous support, Chairman Murtha, Chairman Obey, Chairman Snyder, as well as Chairwoman Davis and Chairman Skelton for their leadership on this issue. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   We owe it to those protecting our Nation and fighting for our rights to make sure that we support them and their families who are waiting at home. 
   This pay raise may mean less than $1,000 for some enlisted men and women, but for those with bills to pay and young children to feed, several hundred dollars is a big deal.

   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, 4 years ago I served in Baghdad, Iraq, with the 82nd Airborne Division, and I am proud of my service. 
   In 2006, the election was about change: change in Iraq, change here at home, change how we treat our veterans. Well, these are the problems that we addressed in this Congress: 
   One, the Walter Reed tragedy. Our answer? We passed the Wounded Warrior Act. 
   Two, underfunding of veterans in past Congresses. Our answer? We passed the largest increase in Veterans Administration history. 
   Three, the two signature injuries in Iraq and Afghanistan are PTSD, posttraumatic stress disorder and TBI, traumatic brain injury. Our solution in Congress, $600 million more than the President asked for to address these two injuries. 
   Later today, this House will take up our bill with Congressman Walter Jones to give our troops a 3.5 percent pay increase. Don't listen to the rhetoric. The President says that increase is unnecessary. I think it is exactly what this Congress should be addressing.

   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as an original cosponsor of this legislation and a strong supporter of the medical miracle of embryonic stem cell research. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is a woman named Shelbie Oppenheimer who is watching today in my district of New Hope, Pennsylvania, who simply wants to see her 8-year-old daughter Isabella go to her senior prom in 10 years. 
   Shelbie lives with her husband Jeff and their 8-year-old daughter, and over a decade ago, Shelbie was diagnosed with ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease. She was 28 years old. Shelbie vowed to fight the disease and looked at embryonic stem cell research as her best and perhaps only hope to fill her dream of seeing her daughter grow up.     
   Now confined to a hospital bed in her own living room, Shelbie continues to fight on. Though forced to speak through a respirator, she told me, ``PATRICK, my voice is too soft to be heard, so please tell my story.'' 
   There are countless stories of heartache and hope across America just like Shelbie's. Mr. Speaker, I know Shelbie is watching us today, and I hope we make her proud.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Arkansas, and point out when I was in an earlier deployment before Iraq, I was in Bosnia in 2002. Our soldiers on the ground there would often call the contractors Kellogg Brown & Root ``Kellogg Brown & Loot,'' because of the looting, of what they were doing to their own country when it comes to our fiscal dollars. And I am not trying to be cute or funny. That is a sad commentary on what is really going on over there in these deployments. 
   Mr. Speaker, when I heard my colleague, Mr. Donnelly, here from the great State of Indiana, and I know he went to the University of Notre Dame, I was with a colleague of mine on the phone yesterday. I was driving back from a memorial service for Private First Class Bobby Dembowski, who was a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division who was killed recently in Iraq. He was from Bucks County, in my district. 
   When I was driving back from his memorial service yesterday with a heavy heart, I called my buddy, who is also a University of Notre Dame graduate, Captain Kobe Langley. I called Kobe, Mr. Speaker, and I said to him, ``Kobe, I am coming back.'' He said, ``How are you doing, Murph?'' I said, ``Kobe, not too good. I am coming back from another memorial service for one of our heroes that gave the ultimate sacrifice.'' He said, ``Well, you got to keep fighting. You got to keep doing what you are doing.''     
   He asked, What was the press conference you gave the other day? 
   I said I was standing up to this administration. I have the great honor of serving on the Armed Services Committee. I know my colleague and my fellow Blue Dog Representative Donnelly serves on the Veterans Affairs Committee. We were both cosigners for House Resolution 162 because we want to hold this administration accountable when the Armed Services Committee says our troops deserve a 3.5 percent pay increase and there is already a wide gap between military pay and civilian pay. 
   The people who join the military are not trying to get rich. But if you are a private in Iraq, I don't think making $18,000 a year is too much to ask for. We were trying to give those privates and everyone across the board a 3.5 percent pay increase to lessen that gap. President Bush in writing said a 3.5 percent pay increase for our troops is, I quote, ``unnecessary.'' Unnecessary. A private first class making $18,000 a year in Iraq is unnecessary. It is too much money to ask for. 
   So this House bill in which the Speaker pro tempore, Mr. Ellsworth, and Mr. Donnelly cosponsored says a sense of the Congress is it should be a 3.5 percent pay increase. We support the troops and understand their sacrifice. We can find the money through PAYGO rules which the Blue Dogs believe in. As the gentleman from Arkansas says, $9 trillion is what we owe in debt. 
   So my daughter Maggie, who is home with my beautiful wife, when my daughter was born in Lower Bucks Hospital 6 months ago, she was born $29,000 in debt, a debt that we all owe combined, every man, woman and child, $9 trillion. 
   Some folks, when I am meeting folks in my district, they would say, Patrick, we are at war. Of course, it is going to cost money. I tell them this Iraq war has cost $450 billion, now up to maybe $500 billion. We owe $9 trillion to Communist China, to Mexico and to Japan. In March, 2007, the interest that we pay on that debt was $21 billion. 
   Now I know those folks at home who believe in what the Blue Dog Democrats believe in, of fiscal responsibility, of accountability. They say to themselves, wow, Congressman Murphy, $21 billion just in interest. 
   When I tell them how I used to be an educator at West Point and how we need to be more and more competitive in a global economy, I show them the numbers, we only spent $5 billion in education in March, 2007, yet $21 billion on the interest rate and the debt that we owe that we continue to rack up and rack up. 
   Finally, the Blue Dogs are taking such an incredible leadership role, establishing a PAYGO system and doing  the things necessary to put our fiscal house back in order. 
   Mr. Speaker, I know you cannot speak, but I know you are a Blue Dog, and I am proud that you are up there; and, Mr. Ross, I am proud you are one of our leaders of the Blue Dog Coalition. I am also proud of the freshmen Blue Dogs that I serve with, because we will demand answers and we will demand accountability of this administration and the next administration, hopefully a Democratic one, to make sure that we continue the progress that we are making in this 110th Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give voice to a terrible injustice. On any given night in America, nearly 200,000 veterans go homeless and twice as many will go homeless over the course of the year. This is shameful. 
   In my district in southeastern Pennsylvania, this problem is very real. There are more than 3,300 homeless veterans in Pennsylvania and at least 550 in the greater Philadelphia area alone. These are veterans who saw combat in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq. 
   As someone who spent 10 years in the Army and walked the streets of Baghdad, I cannot stand by while more of my fellow soldiers go hungry and seek shelter. Over the last 3 years, as many as 1,300 veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan have participated in homeless outreach programs by the VA in their community. Who knows how many others went without help. 
   That's why, Mr. Speaker, I proudly support the Veterans' Health Care Improvement Act, which looks after those who have sacrificed so much for our country.     
   This much-needed bill makes permanent a program to identify at-risk servicemembers to prevent them from  ever becoming homeless once they leave the military. With the rapidly increasing number of women veterans, the bill also instructs the VA to make their programs for homeless veterans more accommodating for female veterans. 
   I was proud to introduce these important provisions, and I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Filner), and the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Michaud), for bringing this bill to the floor and their leadership on this issue. These brave American veterans, who once faced down our enemies, shouldn't have to face one more night out on the street.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 257, supporting the goals and ideals of Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month. 
   By increasing awareness, we look to shine a spotlight on a disease that has historically received little attention from the Federal government: pancreatic cancer. It is the fourth most deadly cancer for both men and women, but research on pancreatic cancer is decades behind other cancers. 
   I was fortunate to have a group of my constituents from the 8th District of Pennsylvania teach me more about this devastating illness. They work with the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network and are fighting hard to raise awareness and improve patient services to beat this disease. 
   They told me that this year more than 37,000 Americans will be diagnosed and almost as many will die from the disease. It is difficult to recognize and with no early screening test, symptoms are often mistaken for other ailments. Because of this lack of early detection, 75 percent of those diagnosed don't survive longer than a year and only 5 percent survive more than 5 years. Pancreatic cancer shows no signs of slowing--with diagnoses and deaths increasing every year. Men and African-Americans are particularly at risk, but with no significant improvement in survival rates in the last 25 years, every American needs to be aware. 
   A number of treatments are in development. Patients can undergo chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, or experimental treatments such as chemotherapy drugs or vaccines. While doctors and scientists are working hard to find a cure, they need our help to fund their important research and assist in educating the public. 
   Mr. Speaker, with so many Americans diagnosed each year, we must act with urgency. We must increase awareness in our communities and across our country in order to intensify our focus to find a cure. Through educating the public about this quiet killer, we can increase early diagnosis and improve the prognoses and treatment of the disease. Mr. Speaker, it is time to face this disease head-on and fight back.

   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart. This week, nine of my fellow paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division were killed in Iraq. Nine more heroes killed, nine more paratroopers returning home in coffins draped in the American flag. 
   Mr. Speaker, Daniel Webster's words that are etched in the marble above implore each of us in this room, and I quote, ``To see whether we also, in our day and generation, may not perform something worthy to be remembered.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I know the task is daunting, but let this Congress be remembered for leading our country in a new direction in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, I was deployed to Iraq in 2003 and 2004. Nineteen of my fellow paratroopers I served with never made it home from the streets of Baghdad. I carry their names with me every single day to remind myself of the solemn responsibility we face each time the Speaker bangs down her gavel. 
   Nineteen men, including Specialist Chad Keith from Indiana. Nineteen guys who never made it home to their families. Specialist James Lambert III, from North Carolina. Nineteen all Americans who paid the ultimate sacrifice. Private Kyle Gilbert from Vermont. Nineteen men who are missed. Private First Class Marc Seidan from New Jersey. Nineteen men. Now we have nine more paratroopers to add to this list. 
   Mr. Speaker, how many more suicide bombs must kill American soldiers before this President offers a time line for our troops to come home? 
   How many more military leaders must declare the war will not be won militarily before this President demands that the Iraqis stand up and fight for their country? 
   How many more terrorists will President Bush's foreign policy breed before he focuses on developing a new strategy, a real strategy for fighting and beating al Qaeda? 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill says enough is enough. No more shortchanging our troops. No more open ended commitment in Iraq. No more refereeing a religious civil war. 
   Mr. Speaker, on the fourth anniversary of the war, I led this body in a moment of silence. Now my fellow Democrats offer a time line to bring our troops home. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are about to vote ``no'' on this bill, will you stand with us next year to offer a time line on the war's fifth anniversary? 
   How about a time line on the sixth? How about a time line on the 10th? Because that's what voting ``no'' does. It says no to the tough questions. No to accountability and no to providing our troops on the ground with a clear mission. 
   Mr. Speaker, I may be hopeful, but I am not naive. I hear Vice President Cheney taunt patriotic Americans who are concerned with the direction of our country. I see the President using his veto to hold our troops hostage to further his failed strategy in Iraq. I read the Bush Republicans' attacks questioning my patriotism and support for my fellow soldiers. But, Mr. Speaker, we have all heard these attacks before. 
   The American people know that President Bush and his allies are sadly out of touch. The American people know that supporting the troops means demanding accountability. The American people know we need a change. 
   Mr. Speaker, one of my fellow soldiers lost his brother in the World Trade Center on September 11 of 2001. This soldier is now in Iraq serving on his second deployment. And last week he sent me a message, unsolicited. It said, and I quote, ``Never did I think I would disagree with our foreign policy 5 years after my brother was murdered. Our latest mission here is to secure the Iraqi people. I signed up to secure the American people.'' 
   My fellow colleagues, this bill, this vote helps us secure the American people. For too long the American people have been craving leadership, craving accountability, and craving a new direction in Iraq. Let's give this to them today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2295, to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for the establishment of an Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Registry. 
   ALS, more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a particularly cruel disease and is always fatal, usually between two and five years after diagnosis. One of the very few trends researchers have been able to identify is that veterans are twice as likely to die from ALS as those who have not served in the military. However, Madam Speaker, it can strike at any time, regardless of age, race, gender or nationality. 
   This fight is personal for me, as my good friend Shelbie Oppenheimer, and her husband Jeff have long been advocates for those with ALS. 
   Shelbie was diagnosed when she was just 28 years old and has since spent countless hours educating friends, family, community members and elected officials. Shelbie has been fortunate--still fighting after 10 years. 
   The Oppenheimers have created a wonderful organization based in my district in Bucks County, Pennsylvania: Shelbie.org. 
   Along with many community partners, they work tirelessly to provide opportunities for the children of ALS patients. Jeff and Shelbie, along with their daughter Isabel, are a constant inspiration to me and I join them in the fight to turn ALS from a disease to a memory. 
   It is for Shelbie, Jeff, Isabel and countless others that I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill. This legislation will create, through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a single, nationwide ALS registry. This Registry is essential to advancing the search for treatments and the cure. 
   Since we don't know the cause or the cure of ALS, research is the key. Enabling researchers, doctors and patients to understand the trends and history of the disease is vital to moving forward. The Registry will gather data on the environmental and occupational factors that may contribute to the disease, including the age, race and ethnicity of individuals with ALS, the patients' family histories and other information that may be beneficial to advancing research and care. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join this fight and support the ALS Registry Act and vote yes on H.R. 2295.

   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois. 
   I rise today with pride to honor one of our Nation's finest sons. Nathaniel DeTample, Nate to his friends and family, Baby Boy to his National Guard unit, died in Iraq on August 9, 2005. He was 19 years old. 
   Nate was an Eagle Scout, an Eagles fan, a standout wrestler at Pennsbury High School, and a friend to all who knew him. Today, we pay tribute. 
   Madam Speaker, the legislation before us today will name the post office building in Morrisville, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, the Nate DeTample Post Office Building. 
   I am proud that this will be the first Pennsylvania post office named after an Iraq war veteran. His name will appear for all to see at 950 West Trenton Avenue, a sign of the spirit we honor. 
   Madam Speaker, today we give thanks to Nate and to his family for their service to our Nation. Nate joined the Pennsylvania National Guard to serve. He planned to be a police officer like his dad, but he never got that chance. He was always first in line to wrestling practice and always had a positive attitude. Bucks County Police Chief Ken Coluzzi said Nate was a nice boy and a fine young man who was going to be outstanding. It seems that is who is over there, overseas. There are a lot of outstanding young men and women who just want to do the right thing for their country, outstanding young heroes who put their lives on the line every single day.     
   Nate served in the Pennsylvania National Guard's Alpha Company, 1st Battalion, 111 Infantry, a unit that proudly traces its roots back to the founding of our Nation and the Minutemen of the Revolutionary War, a rich history that Nate honored with his unforgettable spirit. 
   Madam Speaker, his friend said in tribute that Nate was one of the nicest guys ever. You never saw him down. You didn't have to meet Nate to know what kind of man, what kind of soldier he was. 
   When it came time for him to be laid to rest, scores of people lined the streets to say goodbye and to give thanks, a true testament to his spirit, his sacrifice, and the impact he had on the lives that he touched. 
   Madam Speaker, Nate's mom and dad, Kim and Glenn, asked at Nate's funeral that all of us pray for Nate's fellow soldiers and their families. Today, before this great body, with great pride, I repeat their request, and ask that we make it our mission to honor the fallen and stand up for those who are still fighting. 
   With his service, Nate DeTample showed us true energy, faith, and devotion. His memory will light our world. 
   In closing, I want to share how Nate signed one of his letters home from Iraq: ``Rock Steady, Nate.'' 
   Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues join me in honoring one of those rocks of our community, Nate DeTample. Rock steady.

   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the immediate and unconditional release of Israeli soldiers held captive by Hamas and Hezbollah. As a former soldier myself, my thoughts and prayers are with Gilad Shalit, Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev and their families. Let them know that the strength and good wishes of this Congress and of our Nation are with them all. 
   I am proud to be a cosponsor of this resolution, which states in a clear, unequivocal voice that the United States stands with these brave soldiers and demands their immediate and unconditional release. The statement we make today is important not just for these three soldiers, but for the greater goal of achieving peace in the Middle East. 
   Mr. Speaker, this resolution makes it abundantly clear that neither the U.S., nor Israel, nor any of our allies will bow to the will of terrorist organizations. We will fight them at  every turn, we will never retreat, and we will prevail because the cause of freedom is just and righteous. As one of my heroes, President John F. Kennedy, once said, ``Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty.'' Today we renew this pledge. 
   This resolution also makes it clear that while we do not shrink from the fight against terrorism, we also recognize that this battle is one that cannot be won without diplomacy. While we declare that we will always support efforts to maintain Israel's identity as a Jewish state with secure borders, we also renew our commitment to achieving a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through the creation of a viable and independent Palestinian state living in peace alongside of the State of Israel. 
   In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, we are here to speak in a united voice to support Gilad Shalit, Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev. We pray for their safety and we hope that they will return home soon. As we do this, we realize that the stories of these three brave soldiers are a part of a larger conflict that has taken thousands of lives and has ravaged an entire region of the world for far too long. With this resolution, we take another small step toward a future that is free of this conflict, where both Israelis and Palestinians have a place to call home and where no more lives are lost to a needless cycle of violence.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 322, celebrating the 60th anniversary of the State of Israel. 
   Last summer, I was fortunate enough to visit Israel for the first time. For me as a practicing Catholic, it was a humbling experience to walk the same streets that Jesus walked over 2,000 years ago. Israel is a Jewish state, but Jerusalem is at the center of three world religions and when I was there, I felt like I was among friends. 
   I know first hand how badly America needs allies and friends in the Middle East. Having served in Iraq, I understand how important the Israeli-American relationship is. They are our most important ally and one of our great friends. They are our partners in peace and in war. And while we do not shrink from the fight against terrorism, we also recognize that this global battle is one that cannot be won without diplomacy. 
   The 60th anniversary of Israel's founding is a landmark moment. In her brief history, great soldiers, noble statesmen and women and inspiring leaders have made history by refusing to back down in the face of great adversity. 
   As we celebrate this historic day, we must also take time to remember those that have fallen in her defense. Brave men like my fellow paratrooper and fellow Pennsylvanian Michael Levin. Michael's story serves as an inspiration to me as he embodied and personified the values that America and Israel hold in common: Loyalty, honor and sacrifice. He left the comforts of America to serve in the Israeli Defense Force--and he died protecting the country and the people he loved. Americans and Israelis alike will always remember his courage and keep his memory in our hearts. 
   Today is also a day where we must pray for those Israeli soldiers being held captive by Israel's enemies. As a former soldier myself, my thoughts and prayers are with Gilad Shalit, Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev and their families. We pray for their safety and hope for their swift return. 
   Mr. Speaker, this significant moment is a time where we should also pray for peace and understanding around the world--but especially in the Middle East. We pray that in the near future, Israel and her neighbors will live side-by-side in peace and that no more lives will be lost in this needless cycle of violence and hate. 
   I am proud to stand with my colleagues in Congress and all of the families in my district as we pledge to always support efforts to maintain Israel's identity as a Jewish state with secure borders. We also commit ourselves to work diligently towards the creation of a viable and independent Palestinian state, living in peace alongside of Israel. 
   Mr. Speaker, Israel is truly one of our greatest allies and most trusted friends. She stands as a beacon of democratic values in a region of the world where those values are largely absent. Today, we celebrate the friendship that exists between our two Nations and look forward to strengthening and expanding our bond in the future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Ross for yielding me this time. 
   Just a few days ago we stood here, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, my chairman, Congressman IKE SKELTON, who has two sons who are currently serving in the military, who is a great leader in this Congress. In the Defense bill, we did several things. We wanted to make sure that the troops knew that we supported them. 
   When we stood there, Congressman Ross, we said thank you, Chairman Skelton, because you believe what all Blue Dogs believe, accountability and responsibility. It established those benchmarks, that oversight which is so needed right now. 
   So in the Defense bill that gave the troops a 3.5 percent pay increase, a pay increase because there is such a gap, such a disparity between the private sector and our servicemen and women and their salaries. When they join the military, they are not trying to make a lot of money. But the fact is that those privates who are making $17,000 a year, those privates that are leaving their wives and kids at home, many of whom have to survive on food stamps, those privates who saw what we did in the Defense bill, who said that is great, 3.5 percent pay increase, a couple hundred dollars a year. The President of the United States said, Private, thank you for your service to your country, but that is too much of a pay increase. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope the people at home are watching. The President of the United States said a couple hundred dollars more a year to a private making $17,000 a year is too much. 
   Now the Blue Dog Coalition believes in two things: one, fiscal responsibility; two, strong national defense. 
   How do the soldiers feel that are running convoys up and down Ambush Alley, scouting on the streets for roadside bombs and looking for snipers on rooftops, when they hear their President back at home, the President of the United States thinks a couple hundred dollars more a year is too much. The President says, hey, it would add up over the next 5 years, $7.3 billion; that is a lot of money. 
   But the same standard that the President uses where he says it is too much for the troops, it is not too much for the contractors who have proven that they mismanage over $9 billion of our hard-earned money, the contractors who don't want any accountability and don't want to see the light of day. 
   The President has threatened to veto the pay raise of our soldiers. I believe that is morally wrong during a time of war, especially when you are saying we are not asking for a 10 percent or 20 percent or 30 percent increase in their pay when they make $17,000, just a couple hundred dollars more a year, not even reaching $1,000 more. The President says no. 
   In the Defense bill that we passed that the President has said he will veto, and this was not some sly comment he said as an aside, the President pointed to a document and said, a 3.5 percent increase is too much. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask that everyone in America write the President of the United States and say 3.5 percent increase in pay for our troops is not too much to ask for; a 3.5 percent increase during the Memorial Day weekend when we honor their servicemembers is not too much to ask for. 
   This is a pattern, Mr. Speaker, that upsets me greatly, a pattern of neglect that this White House has for our troops. See, when I was in Baghdad in 138-degree heat and this White House and the Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld floated out the idea and said, Let's take away their imminent danger pay, their combat pay, a couple hundred dollars a month, because mission is accomplished. Let's take away their combat pay. It's over. 
   Now, fast forward 4 years later, the President says, hey, 3.5 percent is too much. This is a pattern of neglect of our troops. It is okay when the President wants to use our troops as props  for a fancy speech in the Rose Garden. But when it comes to budget time when budgets are moral documents, the President says, too much. I respectfully beg to differ. 
   When we look at the debt of our country, just under $9 trillion, with $29,000 that every single man, woman and child in the United States owes towards our national debt. In March, 2007, we paid $21 billion in interest alone. Does it get any better? No. Why? Because there is no accountability. There is no tightening of the belt. It is wrong to pass this debt, this $9 trillion of debt, on to our children. That is wrong. 
   Mr. Speaker, when I know my wife, Jenny, and daughter, Maggie, are home in Bristol, in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, when I know that they are watching on C-SPAN, I know that they know that their daddy and husband is fighting a good fight. They know that I cannot stand here in good conscience, Mr. Speaker, and allow this President to use our troops as props and yet can't give them a couple hundred dollars of pay increase to try to alleviate some of the pay disparity with the private sector. 
   I can't stand here in good conscience and pay our good tax dollars, $21 billion a month, just to pay the interest, without cutting off the spending spigot. 
   We need to rein in the spending of this country. The Blue Dogs are absolutely committed to doing that. We need partners from the other side of the aisle. We might be Democrats, and there might be Republicans on the other side of the aisle, but we are all Americans and we all owe $9 trillion in debt in America to foreign countries like Communist China and Mexico and Japan. 
   Enough is enough, Mr. Speaker. Enough is enough, and the Blue Dog Coalition, my brothers and sisters in this coalition, are taking the floor of the House of Representatives and all across America. We need the help of the American people to make sure people understand what is at stake. What is at stake is the future of America. What is at stake is the security, the financial security, of our country and the country that our children will inherit. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time tonight.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the RESTORE Act and to set the record straight on an issue that is close to my heart. 
   In May of 2007, three men from the 10th Mountain Division were captured in Iraq. They're names are Specialist Alex Jiminez, Private First Class Joseph Anzak, and Private Byron Fouty. I recite their names because the right wing attack machine never does. But these are the facts, and they're not pretty. 
   The intelligence community stood ready to help find these three soldiers. But for 5 hours, for 5 hours, the Bush administration could not decide what to do. When they decided to go ahead, no Bush administration official could authorize it, could be found to authorize it. But when they finally found the Attorney General in Texas, it took an additional 2 hours to authorize the surveillance, even though he could have granted the authority in just minutes. Hours of indecision and incompetence while these three soldiers went missing.    *.*.*.*.* 
   While the RESTORE Act can solve many problems posed by the current FISA law, it will not solve the problem in these soldiers' situations.

<DOCNO>Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (UNITED STATES-PERU TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement. 
   I oppose this bill because I come from a part of our country that has seen all the drawbacks of free trade without any of the supposed benefits. I oppose this bill on behalf of the countless Americans who spent years of their lives working in a steel mill or manufacturing plant whose lives were uprooted in the wake of NAFTA and CAFTA. 
   I represent the 8th District of Pennsylvania. My State has been one of the hardest hit by free trade agreements and the unfair trade practices of nations, such as China, that don't play by the rules. Bucks County was hit hard. Manufacturing jobs used to number in the tens of thousands, but by 2005, they had fallen nearly 35 percent. This devastation included major employers like US Steel, Jones Apparel, and Rohm and Haas--companies that now employ a fraction of what they once did. Each one of those lost jobs represents a worker and his or her family whose lives were turned upside down by so called ``free trade.'' Madam Speaker, free trade is not free if it costs American workers their jobs. 
   I believe that when everyone plays by the rules, American workers will beat out foreign competition every time. Unfortunately, not every nation plays by the rules and even worse, the Bush administration has done nothing to protect American workers from unfair competition. In fact, the President has gone out of his way to sign free trade agreements, like CAFTA, that harm American working men and women. 
   Madam Speaker, it is for that reason that I must oppose this bill. While this agreement paid heed to labor, health and environmental concerns for the first time in years, we need to back up words with action. Supporters of this bill are saying all of the right things and I am glad that these concerns were taken into account. However, when the livelihoods of American families are at stake, words simply aren't good enough. We need concrete action and this bill offers us no guarantees. 
   We are debating this bill under ``fast-track'' rules. That means that the Congress gets no say in the details of the agreement and that we simply must trust that the President is going to do right by American workers. This President has broken his word over and over again throughout his time in office and we cannot trust him again. We have seen the Bush administration repeatedly putting the interests of the few ahead of the needs of the many. 
   For example, if we had the ability to amend this trade agreement, I would fight to include the provisions of a bill I have introduced that would require national security reviews of trade deals before we agree to them. My bill, The Trade-Related American National Security Enhancement and Accountability, TRANSEA, Act also would allow for the suspension of existing trade agreements if the safety, health, and welfare of Americans are in doubt. I think these provisions would have made a vast improvement to the Peru Free Trade Agreement, but unfortunately because of fast track rules, we are prohibited from even trying to offer changes to make the bill better for American workers. 
   Madam Speaker, I am not an anti-trade crusader. Certainly, if trade is done the right way, with attention paid to labor, environmental and health standards, then it can benefit everybody from workers to business owners, both in the United States and other parts of the world. Unfortunately, with President Bush's disastrous record, we cannot trust him, to enforce the agreement in a way that will be fair to American working men and women. It is for these reasons, Madam Speaker, that I oppose this trade agreement.

<DOCNO>Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (THE NATIONAL DEBT AND THE WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - September 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas. It is an honor for me to be here tonight. 
   I would like to say to the gentleman from Arkansas, that is exactly right. One of the things I plan on talking about tonight are really two things, the small business tax cuts that we established in this Congress this past May, and also the Iraq Accountability Act, because I think it is telling. 
   There are a couple of housekeeping things if I may mention, Mr. Speaker. I know the gentleman from Tennessee was just speaking about an Eisenhower moment and talked about reaching out to those Americans from both sides of the aisle and letting them know about this common sense leadership we are trying to propose. What he mentioned was we need to listen and look at some common sense solutions. I think that is what people appreciate about the Blue Dogs. We are willing to reach across the aisle when need be to move our country in a new direction. 
   I know there are a lot of folks back home I know, some of which are my wife right now. My wife Jenny is at home. I left this morning. I spoke at the Rotary Club and I was at a school for the first day of classes starting back today back in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Then I had a meeting, and then I rushed down here in Washington. 
   It is an honor for me to be here tonight. It is tough as far as leaving your wife, and we are blessed with a 9 month old daughter Maggie Murphy, who we had her swimming out there yesterday. She was adorable. 
   I know this is a different form of public service. I know the gentleman from Arkansas mentioned that I served in the military. I am very proud of my military service. I am very proud that I wore that U.S. Army uniform for the first time back in 1993, and now that we are here in 2007, I am proud to be a Member of Congress. This is a different form of public service, but one just as important. I know the sacrifices that we have to give up, leaving our families to come down here to Washington and then to go back home on the weekends. It is a tough schedule, but one that we promised to do to the best of our abilities. 
   I know my colleague over here from New York, Mr. Arcuri, Mike Arcuri just got married the other day. I want to congratulate him on his marriage. I think he believes in what we all believe in, that we love our troops so much, I think he spent his honeymoon going over to see those troops in Iraq, leaving his new wife, Sabrina, to go over to those troops. 
   We had a conversation on this floor tonight when we were voting talking about his trip over there, how he went and let those troops know, especially the ones that are from New York, from his district, that he cares about them, that he took the time out of his schedule to be there with them, to break bread with them and let them know that he is fighting for them here in Washington. 
   I believe those troops understand what the stakes are right now. They understand that this United States House of Representatives, this body supports the troops 100 percent. We may disagree with our colleagues on the foreign policy and the foreign aspects of it, but never question the commitment and the honor that our troops are serving with. I believe that is why we all take time out of our schedules to let them know we care for them, to make sure that we draft the most effective policy to support them and do everything possible to make sure their families back at home know we are supporting them 100 percent. 
   Mr. Speaker, I wanted to talk first, because after I left that Rotary Club this morning and then I was at that opening day of school at the Abrams Hebrew School in Yardley, Pennsylvania. I went down the road to two small businesses that are in Yardley, Pennsylvania. My district, as you know are, is all of Bucks County, northeast Philadelphia and a small slice of Montgomery County. 
   But when you look at Bucks County, there are 60,000 small businesses in Bucks County. Ninety-nine percent of our businesses are small business. And  what we passed in this House, I am very proud about, is $1.3 billion in tax cuts for those small businesses. We did it not just writing a blank check and passing that debt that we talk about to our kids, we did it in a fiscally responsible 
   way, the way that Blue Dogs believe, a pay-as-you-go system. 
   Everyone is real quick to write tax breaks and tax cuts, but never figure out to how to pay for it. Just increase our debt. Increase our debt. When the President signs $1.7 billion in tax cuts, it sounds great. Everyone wants a tax break. I want a tax break. But how are you going to pay for it, Mr. President? Not on the backs of our kids. Not on the backs of the next generation. We need the pay-as-you-go. 
   So when my daughter was born 9 months ago, when Maggie Murphy was born, she was born in Lower Bucks Hospital, she was born in this country owing $29,000 to our national debt. We owe $9 trillion in this country. A lot of that debt we owe to foreign countries, China, Korea, Japan. We borrowed $367 billion from Mexico. 
   So that means per month, per month we average about $21 billion just to pay the interest on this debt. It is like a credit card. You have to pay interest on your credit card before you even get into paying the principal off. Per month we have to pay $21 billion in interest. 
   To make a comparison, budgets are choices. Budgets are moral documents. Per month in the Federal Government we spend $21 billion just on the interest, but we only pay $5 billion on the Federal level on education. And to keep America more competitive, we need to invest in education. So that is why it is important that we partner with small businesses. That is what we do with the $1.3 billion in tax cuts. 
   How it worked out, I had two business owners, one was a CEO, his name is Neil Matheson today, and when he started a business, he was the only employee. You fast forward it, now it is a 250 person business. They have 140 of those employees in my district, and I am proud that many of them live and work in Bucks County. I talked to him. And another president of a small business was Kevin Kruse. 
   I talked to Neil Matheson and I talked to Kevin Kruse, and I talked to them about the challenges they faced before I was running for Congress and then I talked to them when I became a Member of Congress. We passed this, and they talked about how important this bill was that we passed. 
   Per year, they commented, Kevin Kruse specifically commented, big corporations which employ Americans, big corporations can sell if they needed some money infusion, they can sell stocks or go public. Small businesses don't have that option. So they have to worry about their cash intake and their cash flow. 
   So what Mr. Kruse said today when I was with him, he said this tax cut that the Democratic Congress passed, that the Blue Dogs championed, saves my business $13,000 more in deductions per year now because we established it through the IRS Tax Code through a pay-as-you-go system. That is serious money. That is serious money. That is why they stood with me today when we talked about it. 
   Before I joined the House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker, I talked about more accountability and greater oversight in Iraq and over the Iraqi war operations. I am a proud Member of the Blue Dog Coalition. I have been calling for accountability in Iraq on the floor of this great body for 8 months now. In fact, some of my Blue Dog colleagues have been demanding common sense oversight on the floor of this House for more than 4 years before I even got here. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, the problem with these repeated calls for action is they seem to be falling on deaf ears down the road at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue at the White House. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American public and our families at home are demanding some answers. Earlier this year we introduced House Resolution 97, to set up a Truman-type commission to track fraud, waste and abuse in Iraq. This was after the reports from the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction came to the House Armed Services Committee, came to the committee that I have the honor to serve on, and he said there is $9 billion missing and 14,000 weapons that are missing in Iraq. But recently, the Government Accountability Office, again, nonpartisan, came and reported that now the number of weapons that are missing in Iraq went from 14,000 to 190,000. Think about that; 190,000 weapons, and 110,000 of those weapons were AK-47 rifles. 
   Now, when I was in the military when I joined, I used to sing a cadence when you are running in the morning, we call it PT, physical training. The cadence said, ``Used to date a beauty queen; now I date my M-16.'' 
   See, you held that M-16 rifle to you as if it was your girlfriend or your loved one, because you can never miss it. When you are in the field at night and you fell asleep and you had a few hours to catch some shuteye, you tied it around your leg so no one would steal it from you. 
   That is called accountability. That is what the Blue Dogs stand for. That is why I joined this organization when I came to Congress. I was honored to be selected and to be part of them. 
   You think about 110,000 weapons just missing in Iraq. Just missing. Imagine those weapons in the hands of Muqtada al-Sadr's militia. 
   The accountability is not happening in Iraq. It is not our troops' fault, it is the Iraqi people's fault, because they are not stepping up to the plate. You know, you lose a weapon in the U.S. military, you are probably going to be court-martialed. In Iraq, you are probably given a new one. That is a major difference and one that we can't stand for. 
   These rifles are like the ones I used to carry when I was in Baghdad, Iraq. When I was there four summers ago, Mr. Speaker, August was called fire month. The month of August in Iraq is called fire month because it gets so hot. Imagine our troops over in Iraq right now, in 130 degree weather, with all that equipment on, every day working their tails off to support and defend the Constitution of the United States of America, that oath that they took when they became members of our great military. 
   You look back at January when the President made the decision to escalate our troops over there. I spoke out against it. I thought it was the wrong policy. But the President overrode our decisions in Congress and he said, just give us 6 to 9 months for a political solution. 
   You look now, and I said then I am against the policy but I hope this surge works. I hope the escalation of troops works. I want our troops in Iraq to succeed. I spent months of my life there, and I care for the Iraqi people and I love our troops. 
   But now it has been 9 months. Now you look at what is really happening. They said 6 to 9 months to allow a political solution to happen. Nine months later, you had the Iraqi Parliament take a summer vacation. Take a summer vacation, when our troops are fighting every single day. 
   You had the Shia government that is in power now, before the Sunnis were in power, now it is the Shia, it is a democracy, they have to reach across the table and work with the Sunnis. They have got to put their personal beliefs aside for one Iraq. 
   So the Shia leadership, President Maliki said, okay, we are going to reach these benchmarks. We are going to do these commonsense things that we pledged to do now for years. They still haven't done them. Things like sharing oil revenue with the Sunnis, they haven't done them. 
   So what political solution do we have right now, Mr. Speaker? We have the Sunnis saying I quit. I quit. You don't see our troops quit. You see our troops standing up every single day. 
   For those listeners at home, you make sure when you see a troop, whether it is in a restaurant or airport or train station, you don't have to give them a long speech. You might not agree with the foreign policy of the United States of America. But I ask my fellow Americans, Mr. Speaker, to make sure that you tell those troops when you see them out there in every day America, say thank you very much for serving our country. That is all you need to say. It means the world to them. 
   I took my wife out, I had a date night the other night. I took my wife out, we went to Red Lobster. My wife's grandmother watched our little daughter. We went to date night, and, Mr. Speaker, after dinner she went to the restroom to use it at the Red Lobster.  
   I am waiting in the car, and waiting to get into the Red Lobster was a member of the Pennsylvania National Guard. He was there with his family. I took the keys out of the car. I ran up to him real quick. I was dressed not like a Congressman, I was just like a regular guy, just a regular shirt and I had shorts on him. I said to him, I said, hey, troop, I just want you to know that I appreciate your service to our country.     
   Then we started talking a little bit and at the end I told him I was a congressman and gave him my card. I said, If there is anything I can ever do, you let me know, and I will keep you in my prayers. 
   He got choked up and said, Thank you, Mr. Congressman, I appreciate that. 
   I told him, Just call me ``Patrick.'' You don't have to call me ``Mr. Congressman.'' 
   We have meetings in Washington on the Armed Services Committee. I am also honored to serve on the Intelligence Committee. We also have meetings of the Blue Dog Democrats. We talk about these things at the Blue Dog Democrat meetings. We care with every fiber of our being for these troops. 
   Mr. Speaker, I was at a meeting with the Blue Dogs at 5:00, or 1700 as they say in military time. I passed around a sheet talking about how can we take care of our troops. 
   When troops get orders to deploy, sometimes they don't have a lot of time. Sometimes they have rent. Well, they don't need to have an apartment if they are in Iraq or Afghanistan for 15 months, so they want to break their lease. There is Federal law, there is the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, so they can break their lease. It is a commonsense bill that this Congress passed. There is a bill that says expand that now to allow our troops who have cell phones, a 1-year or 2-year program, why not allow the troops to break their cell phone contracts. Their cell phones are from Verizon or Cingular, and they don't have cell phones over in Baghdad or in Afghanistan. That commonsense approach says let them break their cell phone lease under Federal law. That is the type of backing that they need. 
   To get back to the Iraq Accountability Act, Mr. Speaker, you look at what this Iraq Accountability Act has done to shed light on fraud, waste and abuse. The report that I just mentioned about the 190,000 weapons is a disgrace when you talk about accountability. 
   Last month, there were a total of 73 criminal investigations related to contract fraud in Kuwait, Iraq, and Afghanistan; 73 criminal investigations. That is 73 investigations on contracts totaling $5 billion. That is billion with a ``b,'' Mr. Speaker. The charges so far identify more than $15 million in bribes. If there is ever a time for a new direction in Iraq, now is the time, Mr. Speaker. If there is ever a time for accountability and oversight, now is the time, Mr. Speaker. 
   And as long as my fellow Blue Dogs and I are here in the House's great body, we will keep calling, we will keep fighting for what American families and what American troops deserve, and that is civilian leadership that is just as smart and savvy as those troops on the ground. 
   I want to thank again the gentleman from Arkansas, Mr. Ross, for allowing me to speak. I appreciate your leadership role with the Blue Dog Democrats. 
   When I was home, Mr. Speaker, and I was talking to those families in Bucks County, many told me, Mr. Congressman, I like that are you a Blue Dog and that you are standing up for fiscal responsibility and you stand up for change. I like the fact that you stand up for a new direction. I like the fact that you talk about that $9 trillion in debt that we have right now and how it is immoral to pass it on to our kids, because it is. I like the fact that the Blue Dogs stand up and say you have a pay-as-you-go system, not a pass-the-buck system. That is what happened before. That's leadership. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, to the gentleman from Arkansas, to my colleague from the great State of New York, it is a great honor to be among your midst as a fellow Blue Dog.

<DOCNO>Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (IMPROVING SCRA AND USERRA PROTECTIONS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the 21st Century Servicemembers Protection Act and to address the problem that my buddy and fellow paratrooper in the 101st Airborne Division brought to my attention, one that affects our deployed troops overseas when they return home. 
   Mr. Speaker, some cell phone companies and Internet service providers are not allowing deployed troops to suspend or terminate their contracts. Some troops, many troops, have had their credit reports damaged. We owe our brave troops better than this, and we need to do better for folks like Sergeant Patrick Campbell, who spent, on his first day back from deployment, 8 hours in a mall cell phone store the day he got back from Iraq trying to sort out his cell phone contract so he could call his loved ones and straighten out a wrongful credit report. 
   Mr. Speaker, our servicemen and -women must focus on completing their mission and returning home safely. They should not have to worry about creditors harassing their family or if a cell phone company is ruining their credit. 
   This bill also allows our heroes to keep their cell phone numbers so they can better reconnect with their loved ones once they return home. This is crucial when you look at one in five Iraq and Afghanistan veterans have symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder or TBI, traumatic brain injury, the two signature injuries of the Iraq and Afghanistan war. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is not a Democrat or a Republican issue. This is about doing what is right for our troops. 
   With that, I would like to thank Chairman Filner. I would like to thank Mr. Buyer. I would also like to thank Chairwoman Herseth Sandlin and Mr. Boozman for their leadership and bipartisan efforts on behalf of our veterans, and for including my bill in their legislation. 
   I am a proud Member of the 110th Congress, a Congress that worked in a bipartisan fashion for our veterans, the one that passed the largest increase in veterans benefits in the VA history; the one that passed the new GI bill for our troops, so they get 4 years of college education or technical school, and a Congress that now passes this great bill in the Halls of Congress.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6225. 
   I would like to thank Chairman FILNER and Ranking Member BUYER as well as Chairwoman HERSETH SANDLIN and Ranking Member BOOZMAN for their leadership on behalf of veterans and for including my bill, the 21st Century Servicemembers Protection Act, in this great legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, my bill addresses a problem that a JAG attorney in the 101st Airborne brought to my attention soon after my election to Congress. 
   He alerted me to the disturbing fact that some of our troops have had their credit reports damaged during their deployments overseas. 
   They are having trouble suspending or breaking their contracts with cell phone companies or internet service providers--even if they present deployment orders. 
   In fact, the JAG attorney who called me was able to suspend one of his own contracts during his deployment, but to do so he was forced to pay a costly fee. 
   Looking into this further, I also discovered that some financial institutions are slow or unwilling to reduce servicemembers' interest rates during deployments ..... even though these creditors are already required to do so by law. 
   Mr. Speaker, we owe our brave troops, and their brave families better than this. While facing the strain of long deployments, they should not have to face repeated harassment by collection agencies. 
   As we continue to send a new generation into harm's way, it is our duty to protect these brave troops and do right by their families. 
   Our servicemen and women should be allowed to focus on completing their mission and returning home safely--they should not have to worry about creditors harassing their family, or if their cell phone company is ruining their credit. 
   Mr. Speaker, my portion of this bill expands the existing Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to cover 21st century service contracts such as cellular phones, utilities, cable television, and internet access. 
   Quite simply, my measure will allow troops with deployment orders to terminate or suspend their service contracts without fee or penalty and it will force creditors who knowingly or negligently fail to reduce interest rates to face penalties. 
   While I believe this to be a serious problem faced by our troops, most service providers take steps to allow servicemembers facing deployment or change of station to terminate or suspend service without penalty, and I appreciate the input I have received from a variety of industries on this bill. 
   Most companies have programs in place, and train their customer service representatives to deal appropriately with these situations. However, I recognize that mistakes do happen, especially in large companies with millions of customers and many thousands of employees. 
   My intention is not to use the most severe penalties available under this bill to punish occasional innocent mistakes. Instead, the penalties that are included in this bill should be applied proportionally with consideration given to the frequency, severity, and intent of the violation or violations. 
   In instances where a servicemember is only minimally inconvenienced, and the serviceprovider promptly rectifies the situation, no criminal penalty may be necessary at all. However, when the violations are intentional and repeated, the full penalty available should be applied. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a veteran of the United States Army and the war in Iraq, I know how important it is that our troops be able to focus on accomplishing their mission without worrying about credit trouble back at home. 
   This is not a Democratic or Republican issue. This is about doing what's right for our troops. With that, I would again like to thank Chairman Filner and Mr. Buyer for their leadership.

   Right now in districts across America companies are trying to skirt the law and put our communities at risk.     
   In my district in Bensalem of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, a company is trying to construct a waste transfer facility despite widespread public opposition. A few months ago I stood with the leaders of Bensalem, Mayor Joseph DiGirolamo and State Representative Gene DiGirolamo, as we urged Congress to close this loophole that allows this end-run around local and State laws. 
   This is not a partisan issue, as these two Republican leaders of Bensalem will attest to. After all, ensuring that our neighborhoods are kept clean and safe isn't about politics; it is about doing what is right. With this amendment, we have an opportunity to protect our neighborhoods. I urge swift passage of this important amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (HONORING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF CATHOLIC SCHOOLS -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as an original co-sponsor and in strong support of House Resolution 51, ``Honoring the Contributions of Catholic Schools.'' 
   As a product of Saint Anselm and Archbishop Ryan, I know the vital role that Catholic schools, students, parents, and teachers play towards building a stronger nation. I know that I would not be here today without the guidance of Sister McFadden, the assistance of Ms. Erwin, or the countless other teachers, priests and nuns who helped shaped me into the man I am today. 
   Our Catholic schools instill a strong sense of community and service in their students: service to our God, to our families, to our towns and cities. And it is this spirit of service that leads so many to strengthen our communities: in our hospitals, schools, businesses and even in these halls of Congress. 
   President John F. Kennedy, the first and only Catholic President--and one of my political heroes--said: ``With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth God's work must truly be our own.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, though I have not been in this Chamber long, I have relied on the lessons I learned in the classrooms of St. Anselm and Archbishop Ryan to do what I believe is right. And I am honored that in the first 100 hours of the 110th Congress we have passed bills to lift millions out of poverty by raising the minimum wage and to protect our environment by investing in alternative energy. 
   But Mr. Speaker, the commitment to justice, peace and service taught in Catholic schools resonates far outside this chamber and is felt in countless, yet tangible ways in every comer of the nation. And it is only through everyday men and women simply trying, as President Kennedy so eloquently stated, to make God's work their own, is America the nation it is today. 
   That is why Mr. Speaker, as a proud former student of Catholic schools, I urge my fellow representatives to support this resolution honoring the contributions of these fine institutions to our communities and Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (THE ACCOUNTABILITY CONGRESS: THE 110TH CONGRESS -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Thanks, Congressman. I appreciate it. Thank you to the gentleman from Minnesota, and to the gentleman from Connecticut, my colleague, the other Congressman Murphy up there. 
   Today is an important day in our country's history. We are the new Congress, the 110th Congress, and we came together from all over the country to really change the direction of our country. 
   I am so proud that I wore the Army uniform for the first time in 1993, following in the footsteps of my father and my uncle and my grandfather and my brother, who serves in the Air Force, that we served with pride and gave it our best. 
   When I was asked to join the faculty at West Point, when I taught there, we took pride in ourselves in saying we are developing leaders of character for a lifetime of service. Yes, we were making military officers. Yes, they were tacticians on the law and the profession of arms, but they were leaders of character. They stood up for the truth. They stood up for justice. 
   When our Nation was attacked on 9/11 of 2001, many of us who were called to serve deployed for our country. And I am proud that I deployed twice, first to Bosnia and then to Baghdad, Iraq, as a member of the 82nd Airborne Division. 
   So, within the first 100 days of this Congress, as you mentioned, when we took the steps to say we are going to be coequal branches of government, you see, when I was at West Point, I taught constitutional law and I taught about what this country was all about, and it was that we have three coequal branches of government. 
   See, we did not believe in the theory of King George, one person being infallible, running a country. That is why we had the American Revolution. Our democracy evolved over 200 years to now, today, where we have leaders from both parties willing to stand up and say, enough is enough. Mr. President, we will not continue to give you a blank check while the Iraqis still sit on the sidelines. We will not sit there and say everything is okay when we understand what the truth is on the ground in Iraq. 
   When I was there in 2003, I remember when it was August. I remember having the combat gear on. I remember riding up and down in what is called Ambush Alley in 138-degree heat and wondering when that next roadside bomb might go off, scouting it out, looking, always being vigilant to make sure the men I was leading down that path were safe. 
   Now, what this 110th Congress has stood up to do and why I am so proud of the freshman class for doing is, when we had the emergency supplemental, the Iraq supplemental, we said, we will give you, Mr. President, every single dime, every single penny that you ask for to support the troops, but there is a policy attached. 
   No longer is there an open-ended commitment. No longer is there unaccountability. This is a different Congress. This is the 110th Congress. This is a Congress that will stand strong, stand together, even though we know the political attacks are going to come, even though we know it takes personal courage, and even though they are going to try and distort what we are actually going to try to do. And what we are trying to do is to hold the Iraqi people accountable, now, over 4 years later. 
   At 6:12 a.m. this morning, I got an e-mail from Iraq. It was from a former cadet that I got to know who lost his brother on 9/11. He said to me, Sir, this is the first time I have ever written you, but he said, I want you to know there are legions, legions of junior officers, now company commanders, in Iraq and in Afghanistan and all over this country that are watching you, that are watching this 110th Congress, and that you are saying thank God someone is standing up and speaking truth to power. He said, I would never think that 5 years after my brother was murdered at the World Trade Center on 9/11/2001 that I would stand up against the foreign policy of the United States of America when it comes to Iraq. I want you to know that I am keeping you in my prayers, and if there is anything, anything I can do to help your cause, to put our country back on the right track, I am there. 
   That is what is happening with all these Congresspersons here in Washington. 
   When I get letters from people in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, or northeast Philadelphia, and they say, thank God we have a Congressman that is going to stand up for us, for our veterans, thank God that they are speaking truth to power, that is what is going on. There is a movement, and it is a movement again to believe in America, a movement again to say, listen, we understand there are coequal branches of the government. We understand what the Congress is trying to do. We understand they are trying to do what is right. 
   And it is not about partisan politics. It is not about Bush Republicans versus Democrats. It is not about that. 
   I joke. My wife Jenni is at home. I just talked to her on the phone. My 4-month-old Maggie just laughed for the first time today. It puts it all in perspective. 
   But my wife was a lifelong Republican. She still considers herself a Republican. She said to me when we first met, and she gave me a hard time for being a Democrat, she said, you know, Patrick, I will support you, and I will support you for one reason and one reason 
   only, besides the fact that I am in love with you. She said, I was a YAFer. That is called a Young American for Freedom; it is a conservative wing of the Republican Party. She said, the Republican Party left me; I did not leave the Republican Party. 
   So when I talk about what we have done, what we have accomplished in the supplemental bill against all odds, because we remember, we were through this when we were voting for this, we understood when they said, why are you wasting your time trying to pass this emergency supplemental, putting a timeline on Iraq? Why would you do that? You know it is not going to pass. 
   I was there and talking to the press, and I said, I will give every cent, every fiber of my being, to talk to my colleagues together, all of us as one, and say how important it is to pass this. 
   Then when we passed it against all the odds, when they told us it wasn't going to happen, and we passed it, then they said, well, why did you do that? The Senate is never going to pass it. The Senate responded and the Senate took our bill, and now it is in conference and they passed it, also a supplemental bill with a timeline. 
   That is why it is so important that all of us do not lose hope, all of us continue to stand up and speak truth to power, all of us stand up and say, no longer are we just going to have an open-ended commitment in Iraq. 
   Because when you look at the full spectrum, some people say, bring all the troops home tomorrow; we don't care, just bring them all home tomorrow. Others say, it is the President, he is infallible; you can't ask any tough questions, you can't give him a timeline. You can't demand accountability from the Iraqis, who are still sitting on the sidelines 4 years later. 
   But this 110th Congress, made up of all races, of all sexes, of all parties,  came together and we said, this is a moderate approach, this is an approach that will change the direction in Iraq. When we look at how almost every day hundreds of people are dying there, and we said to the Iraqi people that we will support you, but we will not sit idly by. We will not stand idly by and watch you continue to sit on the sidelines, when our troops, our men and women who wear the military uniform of our country, continue to lead the efforts there when, now, it is 4 years later and it is imperative that they stand up for their country. 
   Because if we remember when it was the American Revolution, it was America's revolution; it was the Americans standing up. When it was the American Civil War, it was the Americans fighting each other. 
   So that is why all of us in good conscience cannot stand here while our brave young men and women serve in places like Iraq and referee a religious civil war. That is not what they were supposed to do. That is not in the national interests of the United States of America. That will not keep our families safe. 
   When we all vote, when we all take these so important and these crucial votes and these timely votes and these historic votes, when we vote for our families and for our constituents, we think about how is it going to affect our children and our children's children. How is it going to affect my daughter, Maggie Murphy, when she reads in the history books what we have done? How is it going to affect who we call Joe, that GI Joe, that soldier on the ground in the 138-degree heat in Baghdad, those members of the 82nd Airborne Division that I so proudly served with that are now back over there on their third deployment? 
   When I was there weeks ago, and I know some of my colleagues here were also just recently there, I talked to these guys. I talked to the guys I served with. I talked to the guys, Sergeant Juan Santiago, who left his wife and two kids at home, is now in his third deployment in Iraq. I broke bread with him over there. 
   I said to him when I was in Baghdad, he used to be Private Santiago, now he is Sergeant Santiago, and his nickname is Santi. I had lunch with him. I said, ``Santi, what is going on?'' And he said, ``Sir, it is like Groundhog Day, but 4 years later. They are still sitting on the sidelines. We are still doing everything for them. I don't know what it is going to take to get them to come off the sidelines.'' 
   What it is going to take is the political pressure so we are clear and we act as one; that we tell the Iraqis that the 110th Congress is different; that the spirit of America is there and we love you, but we cannot hold your hand. You need to stand up finally for your country. You need to stand up and secure your neighborhoods, secure your street corners. You need to be the ones that are leading those convoys up and down Ambush Ally, not our troops. 
   That is exactly what our supplemental did and what we will do when we vote on it after it comes back from conference in just a few days. 
   With that, I would now take it back probably to the gentleman from Minnesota, Mr. Ellison. Thank you.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of the 21st Century Green High-Performing Public School Facilities Act. 
   I want to thank Chairman Miller and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Baird) for his efforts to modernize technical schools. 
   Madam Chairman, faced with record gas prices and a dangerous dependence on foreign oil, we must harness new technology to meet our energy needs. To do this, we must prepare students of today to power the green collar workforce of tomorrow. 
   I am honored to have worked with Chairman Miller and Mr. Baird to ensure funding for this act goes toward modernizing career and technical schools, especially for the renewable energy industries. By giving technical schools a chance to modernize, we will help even more students become innovators, work together to end global warming, and bring green energy jobs to the American economy.

<DOCNO>Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, today, with this bill, we will vote to make a real difference and put a college education within reach of more students than ever before. My colleagues, Chairman Miller, Chairman Hinojosa, Mr. McKeon, and Mr. Keller, put forth legislation that we could all be proud to support. This is just the latest measure in the 110th Congress that has put forth more help for students to reach the American dream. 
   Mr. Chairman, it's time to be straight with American families about how much a college education is truly going to cost. We have seen the numbers and met the families who sit at their kitchen table and struggle to find a way to send their kids to school. 
   One thing, though, we don't hear much about, what is just as devastating to families, is the dramatic fluctuation in tuition from year to year. College costs have risen 40 percent over the last 5 years, but in several cases around the country a sharp jump in prices comes between the end of classes and the following fall. How are families supposed to plan when between finals and the first day of school tuition goes up more than $6,000? 
   Mr. Chairman, this amendment is about planning and predictability. With this measure, students and families will know how much their education is going to cost from the start, and that means fewer surprise tuition hikes and plenty of time to plan financially. 
   We not only give parents and students the time that they need, but we also give colleges and universities options and incentives for helping kids plan for and to afford college. 
   Our amendment gives colleges and universities two options on how to better inform students and families. Schools can either provide a fee schedule up front for all 4 years or a single-year fee schedule with detailed information about future costs, including financial aid. Through either of these options we can make planning for college a little easier. 
   Mr. Chairman, I don't believe it's too much for families to ask the university for a best guess as to what their child's education will cost. After all, families can figure out how much they're going to pay for a house, how much braces will cost for their kids' teeth, or what it costs to buy a car or plan for their retirement. They should be able to plan more appropriately for college. 
   I thank my colleague from North Carolina, Congresswoman Myrick, for standing with me on this amendment and being a leader on college affordability, and for my colleague from California, Congressman Cardoza, for his support. 
   I'd also like to thank Chairman Miller for his leadership and his tireless efforts to help families and students realize the American Dream. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to stand with us to put a stop to the uncertainty families face and give them this truth in tuition. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Does any Member claim time in opposition?

<DOCNO>Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PATRICK J. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, for the sixth time, I rise calling for a change of direction in Iraq. For the sixth time, I call on the President to stop sending our brave men and women to referee a religious civil war. For the sixth time I call on this administration to focus our efforts in fighting the central front on the war on terror by killing Osama bin Laden and destroying al Qaeda in Afghanistan. 
   Mr. Speaker, last week countless folks back in Pennsylvania stopped me and asked, Aren't you frustrated by this President who refuses to listen to Congress and the American people? 
   I told them, I am frustrated that our President refuses to follow the advice of military experts and the will of the American people. I am frustrated because my fellow paratroopers are still fighting and dying in the 138-degree heat of a Baghdad summer. I told them that I will refuse to stop fighting for the best policy for our troops and our families back here at home. 
   Mr. Speaker, leaving our troops in the middle of a religious civil war isn't resolute. It's reckless. No question that change is slow, but take heart, America. Change is coming. Congress is not going to stop. 
   President Bush, the legislative branch of government is back and we are not going to go away. We will change the course in Iraq and fight for a smarter global war on terror. 
   Some Republicans have questioned the patriotism of my fellow Democrats. Even former soldiers here in the House floor. But those types of Republicans are the exception and not the rule. In my short time in Congress, I have learned that most of my colleagues across the aisle are good, decent, and patriotic Americans. Mr. Speaker, I know how much pressure my friends across the aisle are under from the President, from their party leaders to just stay the course. 
   But I ask you as a soldier, as a father, and as a colleague to acknowledge what the status quo entails. That means additional warnings, walking to our desks here in the Halls of Congress, holding our breath and hoping we don't get word of another fallen soldier. 
   Mr. Speaker, I implore my Republican colleagues who know in their heart that we need a change. I implore you to think about how many more of these calls you have to make, how many more calls to wives, to fathers, to mothers we all will be forced to make if we don't take action. 
   I have heard the other side say 4 more months. This President has had his 4 months. He has had his 4 years and 4 months. In 2004, the President said we are turning the corner. In 2005, the Vice President said the insurgency was in its last throes. In 2006, that was the year in transition. And now in 2007, the President says just be patient. 
   In the last month alone in Bucks County, we have buried four of our finest sons. Four names have been added to the memorial board outside my office. I, for one, don't want to add any more names. 
   My Republican colleagues, you have the power today to stop these tragic phone calls, to stop adding faces and names to our memorials. Let's change the direction in Iraq and get back to fighting a smarter war on terror together, not as Democrats and Republicans, but as Americans.
