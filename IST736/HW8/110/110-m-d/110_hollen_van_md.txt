<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (CONSUMER ENERGY SUPPLY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I thank my colleague. 
   Mr. Speaker, what our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have not told the American people is if you look at the report from our own Department of Energy, they can see that drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge won't put one drop of new gas on the market for at least 10 years, and then it will only wind up having an insignificant impact on price 20 years from now. The American people don't have 20 years to wait. We need action, and this is an opportunity to provide that action by tapping into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in a responsible way to help bring down price. 
   After all, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is the supply of oil we put away for America's rainy day. There are over 700 million gallons of oil there, more than any other time in American history. And when it comes to the hurt that the American people are feeling economically, their rainy day is now. 
   This has been tapped into by the last three Presidents, including the current President, and if we responsibly just put a little bit of this oil away, we can provide relief at the pump today. Unfortunately, the President has resisted our call, just like he resisted our call to stop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve which he finally relented in doing. 
   We need to pass this legislation. This is not a long-term policy. We need to work together to make sure that on a long-term basis we tap the ingenuity of this country on renewable energy, energy efficiency, and responsible drilling, but Americans are hurting now. This is not a so-called ``mental recession'' as we heard from former Senator Phil Gramm. The pain is real, and we need to address it now. 
   You know, a few months ago I think we all saw a spectacle that made us shudder. We saw President Bush travel to Saudi Arabia to plead with their king to pump more oil. The Saudi king turned him down cold--no, President Bush. 
   I don't think we should have to go around begging other countries to pump more oil when we have a Strategic Petroleum Reserve of oil right here at home that has been set aside for a rainy day. Our rainy day is now. Let's pass this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Senate amendments to the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. 
   Five years ago, Congress showed leadership and passed legislation on a bipartisan basis to address the global pandemics of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. While enormous progress has been made since 2003, the number of people who are affected by these diseases is still staggering. The United Nations estimates that thirty-three million people are living with HIV/AIDS worldwide, with AIDS causing approximately 1.6 million deaths in sub-Saharan Africa in 2007. 
   We have a moral obligation to lead the fight against these global diseases. This legislation will authorize $48 billion over five years for our global HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria efforts. It will allow the United States to provide continued assistance for these pandemics in developing countries and will strengthen the health systems in host countries by giving them more flexibility to plan, direct, and manage prevention, treatment and care programs. I am also pleased that this legislation includes a provision that authorizes funding for the research and development of new tuberculosis vaccines, which have the potential to save millions of lives. 
   Mr. Speaker, we still have much work to do. I urge my colleagues to continue and reaffirm America's commitment to combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria by supporting this much-needed bipartisan and bicameral legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
    Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this stimulus package for the relief it provides over 117 million American families and the timely boost it delivers our slowing economy. 
   Let's be clear: As a product of genuine bipartisan compromise, this legislation does not contain everything one might have included in a stimulus package. For example, I support--and I hope the President will accept--the Senate's proposal to extend the relief in this package to low-income seniors and people with disabilities. That being said, this legislation proposes to put $145 billion into the hands of those who will use it to strengthen our economy, and it deserves our support today. 
   The centerpiece of this package is tax relief in the form of rebates of up to $600 for individuals and $1200 for married couples--with an additional $300 available for every dependent child. Importantly, it extends relief to 35 million hard-working families who make too little to pay federal income taxes but do pay payroll, sales, property and other taxes. These rebates will generate $1.26 in economic activity for every dollar we put back into the economy. 
   The package before us also encourages business investment by doubling the amount small businesses can expense for capital investments made in 2008 and by allowing all businesses to immediately write off 50 percent of depreciable plants and equipment purchased in 2008. Finally, it assists those facing foreclosure by increasing Federal Housing Administration, FHA, loan limits to $729,750 in 2008, and it provides greater liquidity to the mortgage market by temporarily increasing loan limits for single family homes at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from $417,000 to a maximum of $729,750. 
   For this initiative to be meaningful, it must be timely. Therefore, while I agree with many of the additional elements being discussed by the Senate--such as an appropriate extension of unemployment insurance for those who need it--we must not let prolonged arguments over these items delay swift enactment of the stimulus our economy so clearly needs. 
   If additional steps prove necessary, we will of course stand ready to act. But for today, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bipartisan agreement.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (HONORING SENATOR GWENDOLYN BRITT -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, the civil rights movement was full of heroes whose names we know and many whose names we will never know despite the depth of their sacrifice. 
   Just recently, this Nation remembered Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., whose good works are known to our Nation and to the world. 
   Today I am honored to remember and celebrate the life of another extraordinary civil rights leader who helped stand up against injustice in our Nation. 
   State Senator Gwendolyn Britt passed away recently, but she left behind an extraordinary legacy. She first stood up against racial segregation not in Montgomery, Alabama, but in Montgomery County, Maryland, at Glen Echo Park, just a 20-minute drive from this Capitol. 
   It was a hot summer evening in June 1960. Glen Echo Park was segregated at  the time, and Gwendolyn Britt, an African American, purchased a ticket to ride on the carousel. She was arrested that day, and her case went to the Supreme Court of this country. It was the first of many brave acts in standing up against injustice by Gwendolyn Britt, a person who changed our community and changed our country.  
   The civil rights movement was full of heroes, some whose names we all know, and many whose names we never learned despite the depth of their sacrifice. 
   Just recently we remembered Dr. Martin Luther King, whose name and accomplishments have become well known as part of our country's history. And we know the story of Mrs. Rosa Parks, who showed courage when others were silent. 
   Today, I am honored to remember and celebrate the life of another extraordinary civil rights leader, a woman who, like Dr. King and Mrs. Parks, never sought credit for her actions, but only sought to do what was right. 
   She was only 18 years old when the world first met Gwendolyn Greene. It was a hot summer evening in June 1960 when Gwendolyn Greene, a student at Howard University entered Glen Echo Park. At that time, blacks were not allowed to enter that amusement park. This park, incidentally, is within 20 minutes of the floor on which I am speaking, just outside the District of Columbia in Montgomery County, Maryland. 
   Ms. Greene joined a small group of young people at the gates of this popular local park, determined to introduce freedom and equality through desegregation to Montgomery County, Maryland. 
   Gwen Greene chose to stand up. Despite the fear these young people felt, despite all of the turmoil they knew would arise from their illegal action, they entered Glen Echo Park. Gwen bought a ticket for the merry-go-round, and bravely and boldly sat upon a spotted horse, refusing to move until arrested. 
   At that very moment, this young woman chose to effect change. She didn't take the easy way out; she didn't stick with what was comfortable and safe. Not even after a trip to jail and the United States Supreme Court--not even after again being arrested, this time in Jackson, Mississippi, and spending 40 days in jail for refusing to leave a ``whites-only'' waiting room at a train station--would she be dissuaded from taking her fight for equal rights around the Nation as a Freedom Rider. 
   Gwen Greene later married, became Gwen Britt, and the mother of two sons. She worked for the telephone company for many years. But the effect of her action at Glen Echo and as a Freedom Rider was not lost on her. As she said many years later, ``I became determined to do what I could to make a person's life better.'' 
   And, throughout her life, that's what she tried to do, eventually culminating in her election to the Maryland State Senate in 2002. There, she quickly became a leader on issues that matter, such as education, health care, and civil rights. As one of the State senators in my congressional district, I was pleased to work in partnership with her on issues and projects that benefited our constituents and our State. At every meeting, I was inspired by the courtesy with which she treated everyone and the collaborative spirit she brought to every issue. 
   Gwen Britt never shied away from standing up for those who could not stand up for themselves. She went about her life's work with quiet dignity and humility, accomplishing so much for so many. Many who have benefited from Senator Britt's work never knew of her courageous stands on behalf of justice and equality. Many never knew that this brave woman, this woman who rarely sought the limelight, made such a profound difference in so many lives. 
   Senator Gwen Britt was dedicated to doing what was right. She serves as an inspiration to us all to fight for what is right regardless of the consequences. 
   Webster's defines ``courage'' as mental or moral strength to venture, persevere, and withstand danger, fear, or difficulty. In Gwen Britt, this word is personified. 
   My heartfelt condolences go to Travis Britt, Gwen Britt's devoted husband and partner, and to their two sons, Travis, Jr. and John. Our country thanks you for sharing your wife and mother with us so that she could make a difference in our lives.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I thank my colleague, Mr. Pallone, for his leadership, and Chairman Dingell and the Energy and Commerce committee, Mr. Waxman, and so many others, who have brought this legislation to the floor, finally, after so many years and so many battles. This is a very important day for the American people. 
   The Food and Drug Administration, as we know, has the power to regulate and oversee all sorts of products that are sold today; many that are not addictive. Yet we have always had this big hole in that regulatory authority when it came to very addictive products of nicotine and the tobacco products. 
   On those issues, the FDA has been sidelined, and the result is the big tobacco companies have taken advantage of that opportunity and exploited it and they have marketed these tobacco products to generation after generation of young people through flavored cigarettes and tobacco products and on all sort of things. In fact, when you think about it, they have got to do that. In order to continue to make a profit, they have got to continue to hook one generation after another. 
   It's great that we are finally gathered here today to say to the FDA: You do have authority over this very important area. Let's make sure that future generations of young people do not get addicted. This has a huge cost to our society, obviously in dollars, but even more importantly, the people who die every year as a result of this. We have an opportunity today to begin to put an end to that cycle. 
   I am very proud that in our State of Maryland we have made progress on this on a State basis. We have tried to increase the tobacco tax to reduce tobacco use among young people and use those proceeds for health purposes. But you can't have every State fighting alone to have a successful national program. You need one entity that has this power to help protect the American people, especially the young people of this country. 
   I thank the committee for its leadership.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4040, CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this conference report and commend the conferees for their decision to prioritize public health in this final legislation. 
   At the end of last year, as the country was awash in reports of unsafe levels of lead being found in children's toys, I expressed the hope that this Congress' final CPSC Reform bill would embrace the improved recall notice and strengthened enforcement authority in the House-passed bill while going beyond the House-passed legislation to broaden the scope of mandatory product testing, enhance a family's right to know about dangerous and defective products on the market, and provide robust whistleblower protections for those courageous enough to bring serious safety hazards to light. 
   After months of negotiations, I am gratified that this conference report accomplishes all of these objectives. H.R. 4040 retains the House bill's original focus on ensuring meaningful public notice for product recalls and empowering states' Attorneys General to help enforce Federal law. Additionally, today's conference report requires mandatory pre-market safety testing for lead and other safety standards in toys, cribs and other children's products--without preempting stronger State protocols like those we have in Maryland. It requires the CPSC to create a searchable and user-friendly public database on deaths and serious injuries resulting from consumer products so that parents have access to the information they need to protect themselves and their children. And it provides important whistleblower protections to private sector employees who report violations of CPSC-enforced product safety requirements. 
   Finally, this legislation takes the long overdue step of banning lead above truly minute amounts from products intended for children under twelve, and it outlaws a number of dangerous chemicals called phthalates from children's toys and child care items. 
   Madam Speaker, this conference report represents a vitally important bipartisan agreement on behalf of America's families. I urge a ``yes'' vote.  
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, let me start by commending Chairman Peterson, Ranking Member Goodlatte and others on the committee for putting together the good compromise that we have today on the floor. I'm pleased to have worked with my colleagues ROSA DELAURO, BART STUPAK, JOHN LARSON, and others to try and establish greater transparency and accountability in our energy futures market so that we can wring out that component of the price that is due to excessive speculation. 
   Like any compromise, this bill doesn't contain everything that everybody wants, but it's a very important first step to getting at this issue that is affecting consumers every day. 
   Specifically, I am pleased that this legislation for the first time provides new authority for the CFTC to police the over-the-counter markets and take corrective action where necessary. It also goes a long way to cleaning up the current mess regarding bona fide hedging exemptions so that they are distributed based on true physical, rather than purely financial, risk. It also establishes position limits where necessary and at the same time safeguarding the importance of liquidity in the market. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman, the ranking member, and all the people who came together to take what I think is an important first step toward addressing this issue and thank the chairman for saying as new evidence becomes available and collected, we will go farther as we determine necessary.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3087, which requires the President, in coordination with the Departments of State and Defense, to transmit to the Congress a strategy for the redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq. The bill also requires the Secretary of Defense, not later than 60 days after the enactment of this act, and every 90 days thereafter, to submit to congressional defense committees a report on the status of this planning. In addition, the bill requires the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to brief these same congressional committees on the matters contained in the report. Furthermore, the legislation contains ``sense of Congress'' language that the contingency planning should: address the protection of Iraqi forces, Iraqi nationals, third party nationals and U.S. civilians who have assisted the U.S. mission, enhance the ability of the United States to fight AI-Qaeda and affiliated terrorist organizations, and preserve military equipment necessary to defend the national security interests of the United States. Additional provisions in the bill include supporting and equipping Iraqi armed forces to take full responsibility for their own security. 
   This resolution is an important component of Congress's oversight of the Iraq war, and compels the administration to engage with Congress on the planning for responsible redeployment of our combat troops. The President's Iraq policy of putting our brave men and women in the Armed Forces in the position of policing the streets of Baghdad and other Iraqi cities in the midst of a sectarian war is the wrong strategy and one that continually puts them in harms way. I will continue to advocate for an immediate start to the responsible redeployment of our combat troops from Iraq, but in the meantime, it is important to garner as many votes as possible within the Congress to send a strong message to the administration that it must begin to plan for a comprehensive redeployment of our forces to provide for the best possible protection of our brave men and women in uniform.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, this bill charts an ambitious, necessary and long-overdue new direction for energy policy in the United States. 
   After more than three decades, we increase fuel economy standards for cars and trucks, a commonsense step that will save $1,000 for American families at the pump, that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of taking 28 million cars off the road, and by reducing our oil consumption by half, half, of what we import from the Persian Gulf. 
   We have made in this bill an historical commitment to homegrown biofuels by boosting the renewable energy standards. We are enlisting America's families and farmers to build a sustainable clean energy future and have done so in a way that also protects our environment, like the Chesapeake Bay watershed. 
   To unleash the economic environmental benefits of our rapidly growing renewable energy industries, we include a strong renewable electricity portfolio standard that will reduce greenhouse gases and save consumers money. 
   We also include a fully paid-for $21 billion incentive package that redirects $13 billion in antiquated subsidies to our already profitable oil industry toward clean, green technologies. 
   To those who are thinking about voting against this bill, I would ask what kind of signal does that send to America? That the Congress thinks it's more important to continue yesterday's billion dollars of subsidies and giveaways to the oil and gas industry rather than invest in clean technologies? That we should wait another 30 years before making commonsense improvements in our fuel economy standards? That we should sit idly by while our national security is increasingly undermined by our addiction to foreign oil? Is that the message you want to send to America? 
   Refusing to act now would be irresponsible. Moreover, failing to see the opportunities that this bill brings and the challenges we face is contrary to the can-do American spirit that has propelled our Nation from the beginning. 
   Let's build a better tomorrow. Let's start with this bill and a new energy policy.

   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, President Bush has called upon the country for more domestic drilling. This bill says yes, Mr. President, let's drill. Let's drill in those areas that are already leased and already ready to go because what the President has not told the American people is that there are over 68 million acres of Federal lands already leased to the big oil and gas companies. They are not moving forward on those leases. They are sitting tight. They like the status quo. They're making record profits. Gas is over $4 a gallon. They like it that way. 
   What the President said is don't push forward on those already existing leases. Let's go up in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge. But what he hasn't said is the Department of Energy, his own Department of Energy, has found that we won't see one drop of gas on the market for another 10 years as a result of that drilling, and even then the price will be insignificant. 
   If we really want to get going now, two things we've got to do: One, we need to begin to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That's 10 days until it hits market. Not 10 years. Two, we've got to crack down on the speculators, and this Congress is going to move forward on that measure. We hope we have the President's support because he has said no to releasing oil from the SPR. 
   In the longer term, we have to do two other things: responsible drilling, and that's what this bill calls for, and we need to make that investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency. If we're going to truly reduce and crack our addiction to oil, especially foreign oil, we need to move forward on those fronts. 
   This is a responsible bill that says to the President, yeah, let's start drilling on all of those areas where the oil companies have the ability to do that. They're sitting on it. They like it that way. Let's send them a message.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the bipartisan, bicameral Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Reauthorization Act of 2007. 
   The CHIP Reauthorization Act will reauthorize and improve the very successful Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP, for 5 years. This bipartisan bill will preserve coverage for the 6 million children currently enrolled who otherwise would have no access to health insurance while, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), extending coverage to 3.8 million children who are not enrolled in the program. By reauthorizing this very important program, we will strengthen CHIP's financing, improve the quality of health care children receive, and increase health insurance coverage for low-income children. 
   I am pleased that this bill maintains the guaranteed dental coverage and mental health parity provisions that were in the CHAMP Act. Good oral health care is important to the overall health of children. No family should have to suffer the loss of a child because they lack the access to care, as happened in the tragic case of Deamonte Driver, a 12-year-old Marylander who died earlier this year when an infection from an untreated abscessed tooth spread to his brain. 
   This legislation increases the tobacco tax by 61 cents to a total of one dollar. Increasing the tobacco tax will save billions in health costs and is one of the most effective ways to reduce tobacco use, especially among young children. The 2000 U.S. Surgeon General's report found that increasing the price of tobacco products will decrease the prevalence of tobacco use, particularly among kids and young adults. In short, raising the tobacco tax will prevent thousands of children from starting to smoke and the proceeds of the tax will be used to provide health coverage for children. That is a win-win result. 
   The President has said that he will veto this bipartisan bill. Not so long ago in a September 2004 speech, he promised to expand coverage of CHIP to include eligible children who are not yet enrolled in the program. 
   Now the President has reversed course. In his July 2007 speech in Cleveland, Ohio, he forgot his 2004 pledge and stated, ``I mean, people have access to health care in America. After all, you just go to an emergency room.'' I am disappointed that he will wield his veto pen on such promising legislation. I hope he will reconsider his position and help Congress provide health insurance to millions of America's children. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this much needed bipartisan legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 470, a resolution supporting efforts to increase childhood cancer awareness, treatment, and research. 
   No child should have to experience and suffer the effects of cancer. And no parent should have to see their child suffer. I am proud to be working with Congresswoman Deborah Pryce on such an important issue. Together, we have introduced the Conquer Childhood Cancer Act. The Conquer Childhood Cancer Act would enhance and expand biomedical research programs in childhood cancer and establish a new fellowship program through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for pediatric cancer research. The bill would also increase informational and educational outreach to patients and families affected by pediatric cancer. 
   Over the last several years after a successful doubling of the NIH budget that ended in  2003, funding for NIH and the National Cancer Institute has been flat. As a result, many cancer clinical trials have had to be scaled back. The Children's Oncology Group, which is headquartered in my congressional district, has had to put 20 new studies on hold and decrease enrollment of new clinical trials by 400 children. This is going in the wrong direction. 
   Thanks to the past funding in childhood cancer research, we know that 78 percent of childhood cancer patients overall are now able to survive. Forty years ago it was a much different story--the cure rates for children with cancer were lower than 10 percent. This shows that by funding biomedical research we can save lives. Congress must increase funding for NIH and NCI so that it can continue the groundbreaking, life-saving research that will lead to new cures and treatments. 
   So, I not only urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 470, but I also urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Conquer Childhood Cancer Act and pass that much-needed legislation.

   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation to temporarily extend unemployment insurance benefits. 
   Whether we are in a recession or not, the point is clear: current economic growth has been so sluggish that the job market is weak and job prospects are poor. The recent May 2008 jobs report confirms this as the unemployment rate increased by one-half point to 5.5 percent, which was the biggest one-month increase in over 20 years. Since the first of the year, our economy has lost more than 300,000 jobs. 
   By providing an extra 13 weeks of jobless benefits to workers in every State who exhaust their unemployment benefits and another 13 weeks of benefits to those in States with high unemployment rates, we can help approximately 4 million unemployed workers meet basic needs such as food and rent while they continue to look for work at a time when the economy is languishing. And we can give our economy a much-needed boost. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, extending unemployment benefits would be one of the most cost-effective and fastest-acting forms of economic stimulus. 
   Madam Speaker, many Americans are struggling to make ends meet. With rising gas and food prices and a weakened labor market, we can help those hardest hit by this sluggish economy by providing them relief in passing this much-needed bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of final passage of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act and to commend Chairman Oberstar, Ranking Member Mica, and Subcommittee Chairwoman Brown and Ranking Member Shuster for their leadership in constructing this bi-partisan bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008--authorizes appropriations for Amtrak for FY2009-FY2013 and makes long overdue improvements and enhancements to the system. Millions of Americans rely on Amtrak and its local lines for everything from commuting to work to going on holiday. In 2007 alone, 28 million passengers rode Amtrak. Amtrak has become a critical part of the Nation's transportation infrastructure and every effort must be made to sustain the system as a safe and reliable source of transportation. 
   This bill authorizes $14.5 billion for commuter rail transit enhancements, a high-speed rail service route between New York and Washington, DC, and contains important reforms and operational enhancement. The bill also contains needed accountability measures and capital improvement funding. 
   To increase accountability, the bill requires Amtrak to implement a modern financial accounting and reporting system. Amtrak must also submit an annual budget and business plan. 
   With the passage of the Davis/Van Hollen/Hoyer amendment regarding WMATA, the bill also provides a more reliable source of funding for maintenance and improvement projects in the Washington, DC Metro area. 
   We all know that the Federal Government relies heavily on the Metro system to bring thousands of its employees to work each day: employees of our national security agencies, employees of the Department of Health and Human Services, and all the other Federal agencies that help provide services to the American people. But, the Metro system is also a critical link in any evacuation plan of the Nation's capital. 
   These are just a couple of the reasons the Federal government has invested billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars in WMATA construction and maintenance projects over the years. Since WMATA's creation, keeping the Metro up and running has become a national priority. 
   The Davis/Van Hollen/Hoyer amendment helps ensure the Metro remains a reliable source of transportation for Federal employees by authorizing $150 million a year in matching funds for ten years to help WMATA pay for critical improvement and maintenance. But, importantly, these matching funds can only be accessed when the local jurisdictions of Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia contribute their own funds from a dedicated source. 
   Currently, the Federal Government is at the whim of local jurisdictions on a year-to-year basis, as to whether they will uphold their part of this long-term Federal-local funding partnership regarding WMATA. 
   Our amendment specifically states that funds authorized in the legislation cannot be available until WMATA notifies the Department of Transportation that local jurisdictions have established a reliable source of funds to pay their share of Metro operating and maintenance costs. 
   Over the years, Amtrak has proven it is a critical and growing part of the country's transportation infrastructure. Last May, Amtrak ridership rose 12.3 percent from a year earlier, and ticket sales climbed 15.6 percent. Despite continued growth, Amtrak has not been reauthorized since 1997. 
   With the passage of this bill, we have an opportunity to end 8 years of starvation budgets that have strained Amtrak resources, frozen salaries and delayed capital improvements. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support final passage of this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Let me begin by congratulating Chairman Oberstar and Ranking Member Mica and the Transportation Committee for all the work they have done in bringing this very important legislation to the floor, and to my colleague, Mr. Davis from Virginia, for his leadership on this issue of the WMATA system, the Washington Metro system. I am pleased to join with him and others in a bipartisan basis from the Washington region to offer this amendment. 
   I think we all know that the Federal Government relies very heavily on the Metro system to bring thousands and thousands of Federal employees to work each day at our national security agencies, at the Department of Health and Human Services, and other Federal agencies throughout this region that help provide essential services to the American people. It's also a critical part of any evacuation plan in the  event of a national emergency that would require the evacuation of the Capitol. 
   That's one of the reasons the Federal Government has made large investments in the WMATA construction in the past and its maintenance, and that is why it's important that we continue to have a Federal role. What the purpose of this amendment is to protect that Federal amendment, because right now the Federal Government is at the whim of local jurisdictions as to whether or not they are going to make their payments into this system as part of a partnership. 
   What this does is it says, yes, the Federal Government will provide, authorizes up to $150 million a year in matching funds. Those funds may only be released when WMATA certifies and notifies the Department of Transportation that local jurisdictions have established a reliable and dedicated source of funding to do their share of the funds in partnership here. 
   It also increases accountability to protect that Federal investment by creating an inspector general to oversee WMATA's finances and adds four new federally appointed directors to WMATA. This is to protect the Federal investment that has been made and make sure the interests of the people in this area, consumers as well as the Federal interest, is protected. 
   This has passed the House. I want to stress this. This Davis provision has passed the House in the past in 2006. We passed it. It's been sitting over in the Senate. I just urge all our colleagues to come together in 2008 to do what we did in 2006 and adopt this important provision.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (CAROLINE PRYCE WALKER CONQUER CHILDHOOD CANCER ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I thank my colleague. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, the Caroline Pryce Walker Conquer Childhood Cancer Act of 2008, and I want to first and foremost thank my colleague, Deborah Pryce, for her leadership and commitment on this very important issue that affects so many children and families around our Nation. We're all very grateful to her for working to prevent other people and other families from facing the same tragic loss that she and her family experienced with the loss of a child, and I'm honored to have worked with her on this bipartisan piece of legislation. 
   I also want to thank Chairman Dingell, Chairman Pallone, Ranking Members Barton and Deal and their staffs for working to bring this legislation to the floor today and for their commitment on this very important issue. 
   I think that the title of this bill is a fitting tribute not only to Deborah Pryce's daughter, Caroline Pryce Walker, but also to the other millions of children who have courageously fought pediatric cancer and those who are bravely fighting pediatric cancer today as we speak on this floor. 
   I have had the opportunity to meet with many of those children and their families who are struggling with childhood cancer. One of them, Matthew Grossman, was diagnosed at the age of 13 with a very rare brain tumor. Before his diagnosis, he was a soccer player, a swimmer, a talented young musician from Bethesda, Maryland. Matthew underwent 7 months of chemotherapy, brain surgery, 6 weeks of daily radiation to the brain and spine, and two bone marrow transplants. 
   This brave young man has been in full remission since January 2006. He went back to school and rejoined his class, despite having been out of school for a year and a half. He recently celebrated his 17th birthday and continues to play guitar, perform in a band, and sing in his school's choir. 
   Matthew is one story out of thousands. Unfortunately, there are many children who are not as fortunate as Matthew. Cancer remains the number one killer of children under the age of 15 who die from disease in this country. Pediatric cancer, including brain tumors, comes in many variations. Each year there are about 12,000 new cases of pediatric cancer. And while the incidents of pediatric cancer has increased, the causes are largely unknown.  
   Thanks to past funding in childhood cancer research, we know that 78 percent of childhood cancer patients overall are now able to survive the disease. Forty years ago, it was a much different story. Cure rates for children with cancer was lower than 10 percent. This shows that biomedical research and funding that we've been able to do has saved lives, and it's also why we're here today to say we need to finish the job and continue the commitment because currently, the NIH has not received the funds it needs. 
   We know that the President's proposed budget this year has once again, unfortunately, been flat funded for NIH. Since the doubling of the NIH budget in the year 2003, that funding has not kept pace with biomedical inflation, and that has impeded our ability to delay and do the research we need into the onset of many diseases. If we fail to invest in innovative research at NIH, we will forfeit the opportunities to make ground-breaking, life-saving work to save lives. 
   The NCI currently spends approximately $170 million a year on pediatric cancer research. Much of this now goes to laboratory and pre-clinical testing. We also need to do the important work to invest in clinical trials. An NCI peer review group of scientists in 2002 recognized this and recommended $54 million in funding for pediatric cancer clinical trials. That level was never funded.

   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman. 
   That level was never fully funded, and since then, this funding has been cut. 
   Because Federal funding for pediatric research continues to drop, many critical trials have been put at risk. As many as 20 studies has been put on hold and enrollment in new clinical trials has decreased by more than 400 children. This is taking us in the wrong direction. 
   This act will enhance and expand pediatric cancer research activities at the NIH, establish a pediatric cancer registry, and increase educational informational and support services to patients and families affected by childhood cancer. 
   Madam Speaker, we can do better in our fight against pediatric cancer. Let's help give our children and their families the future they so deserve by passing this bill. I urge my colleagues, and once again, thank our colleague, Deborah Pryce, for leading by example in this very important area.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, as an original cosponsor of the House version of the Stem Cell Research Act of 2007, I rise in strong support for S. 5. 
   I firmly believe that stem cell research holds the promise of scientific breakthroughs and finding cures for life-threatening diseases that could improve the lives of millions of Americans. We should allow the expansion of federally funded research of human embryonic stem cell lines. This bipartisan legislation would accomplish that while establishing ethical guidelines. 
   This is an issue that affects every family in America. A majority of the American people support stem cell research. I was disappointed that the President exercised his first veto last year on a piece of similar legislation that has bipartisan support. The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007 will be soon on the President's desk for his signature. I hope this time the President will listen to Congress and the American people rather than to the extreme right of his own political party and not wield his veto pen on such promising legislation. We cannot put politics over the health of the American people. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my House colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.

   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Chairman, I am grateful for the opportunity to add my voice of support to our valued public servants at the Government Accountability Office, GAO. Just as Congress relies on the GAO for the gold standard of fair and even-handed analysis, so too must we ensure that our GAO workforce receives that same standard of fairness and even-handedness when it comes to matters of their own employment. 
   The issues that gave rise to the language in today's underlying Legislative Branch Appropriations bill are not new to the Government Oversight Committee on which I sit, or to the Federal employee community I am privileged to serve. Like many of my colleagues on the committee, I have received reports expressing concern about the process surrounding the recent Band II Restructuring Project, as well as the methodology used in the 2004 Watson Wyatt Worldwide, WWW, compensation study. In that regard, I am particularly troubled that the WWW study is being cited as the reason over 300 hard-working GAO employees who met or exceeded their performance expectations have been denied annual cost of living adjustments, notwithstanding public commitments to the contrary. 
   As a majority of GAO analysts have now exercised their employment rights to organize a union, it is critical that the requisite election process go forward expeditiously and without interference. I thank my colleagues for this opportunity to voice my support for the GAO workforce and the rest of our valued Federal employee community.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (AFGHANISTAN FREEDOM AND SECURITY SUPPORT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Let me begin by congratulating the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Lantos, and the ranking member, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, for their wonderful bipartisan work on this very important legislation, which sends a signal that the United States remains fully engaged in making sure we have a secure Afghanistan, and that we build on what has happened to date and make sure that we continue to have a situation that demonstrates a continuing investment by the United States. 
   I think if you look back over history, we made a big mistake, when we disengaged from Afghanistan, after the Soviet withdrawal. We had helped, of course, support the Mujahedin, the freedom fighters, that was the right thing to do. 
   But when the Soviets left Afghanistan, so did we. And that left a vacuum that the Taliban exploited, Afghanistan became a failed state, al Qaeda found a home there, and we know the rest of the story, the terrible attacks of September 11, 2001. Even to this day, we have not yet finished the job in Afghanistan in terms of hunting down al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, and essentially destroying the network that caused those terrible attacks of September 11, 2001. 
   But even as we continue that action, we need to make sure we provide for stability in Afghanistan for the longer haul, so we do not create another situation where other terrorists can take advantage of a failed state. 
   That requires we work in partnership with the Afghan government and the international community to make a long-term investment in Afghanistan's stability. That involves, making sure, that in addition to large infrastructure projects and important investments that we make, that we also make sure that we empower the Afghan people and make sure that they understand that we continue to have a stake and they have a stake, obviously, in their future and in building their economy. That's what this amendment that I am offering today relates to. 
   According to a recent GAO report, despite the expenditure of billions of U.S. dollars, reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan still have lacked a strategic focus. I know that is the major thrust of this bill, and I, again, want to commend our leadership for putting this important piece together. 
   As you know, this bill requires, among other things, that the President design a comprehensive interagency strategy for long-term security and stability. But in addressing these issues, issues that will impact heavily on the lives of ordinary Afghan citizens, it's essential that we make sure that we leverage one of Afghanistan's greatest assets in that decision-making process. That is the Afghan people themselves.     
   And while it does support local-led development programs such as the National Solidarity Project, the bill, I think, would also benefit and be strengthened by additional focus on involving the Afghan people at the local level in decision making. And that is why I'm proposing this amendment that requires the President to include as any part of his Afghanistan strategy an emphasis on empowering Afghan citizens in that decision making. 
   Economic development is a major source of concern, obviously, to the Afghan people. The CSIS, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, recently released the second in a series of post-conflict assessments of progress in Afghanistan and reported that, despite a marked improvement in the economy, Afghans continue to suffer from unsteady employment and economic insecurity. So this amendment addresses those issues. Just, again, emphasizes what I know is the overall  thrust of this legislation, the importance of making sure we include the Afghan people at the grassroots level in decisions that affect their future. 
   Again, I want to thank the chairman, Mr. Lantos, and the bipartisan support this overall effort has had; and I urge the adoption of the amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the National STEM Scholarship Database Act. In a time of global economic and scientific competition, we must ensure that our brightest young people have the resources to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math. 
   When students graduate from American universities with undergraduate degrees, they graduate with on average, $20,000 in debt. This undergraduate debt is a significant factor in a student's decision to pursue graduate school. And among science and engineering students, those who had debt from their undergraduate education were more likely to say they could not afford graduate school. 
   We cannot afford to limit the potential of these students, or those who find the cost of even an undergraduate education prohibitive. We cannot afford to have ambitious students with interest and aptitude in science or math or engineering shut out of our colleges. We need Americans with advanced degrees in the STEM fields to propel our Nation forward in discovery and innovation. 
   This bill makes it easier for students to find scholarships and grants to finance their educations. It does not require a significant investment from the Federal Government--although I believe we should make the investment in more Federal loans in the future. It simply creates a central location where students can learn about their options. 
   This is a common sense way to help students pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math. It is a simple, low-cost part of our competitiveness agenda, and I urge my colleagues to vote for it today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, 4 years ago President Bush sent our troops to war without a plan for success in Iraq, and without a plan to care for our wounded soldiers returning home. 
   During those 4 years, the old Congress rubber-stamped the failed policies of the Bush administration. The American people know well that when you ignore failure and bad decisions, you simply get more of them. 
   Today, we are demanding accountability for a change, accountability to ensure that our troops get the training and equipment they need, accountability to ensure that our wounded soldiers returning home are treated with a dignity that they deserve. We hold the Iraqi government accountable for taking the steps toward political reconciliation which they, themselves, have said are necessary to achieve stability. 
   The accountability measures in this bill track the recommendations made by the independent bipartisan Baker-Hamilton Commission. The President chose to reject those recommendations and, instead, to escalate the war in Iraq. 
   At the same time, the President has not paid adequate attention to those who were responsible for the attacks of September 11, 2001, al Qaeda, operating out of Afghanistan. 
   This bill provides additional resources for completing that mission and for holding those responsible who did attack us on September 11. Al Qaeda is still plotting against us. It demands accountability, it supports our troops, and it strengthens our national security. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time for a change and direction in Iraq. It is time to bring some accountability to the history of failed decisions we have made so we don't continue to make the same bad decisions going forward. The American people asked for and deserve a change in direction. That is what this bill does.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 327, the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act. 
   Mr. Speaker, the measures in this bill are designed to reduce the alarming incidence of suicides among our vets. According to a recent study conducted by Portland State University, male U.S. military veterans are twice as likely to commit suicide as men who haven't served in the armed forces. The report is a painful reminder of why we must adopt the measures outlined in this bill to assist our military personnel returning from Afghanistan and Iraq. 
   The Portland State study followed 320,000 men over age 18 for 12 years collecting data on those who participated in the National Health Interview Survey. The researchers found that men who had served in the military at some time between 1917 and 1994 were twice as likely to die from suicide than men in the general population. In addition, veterans who committed suicide were more likely to be older, white, better educated, and married. But the report offered few clear indicators for the high suicide rates. That in part is the purpose of this legislation--to locate the root cause of the high suicide rates and to reverse the situation. 
   There are approximately 25 million veterans in the United States, and 5 million veterans who receive care within the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA). Based on CDC data, VHA mental health officials estimate 1000 suicides per year among veterans receiving care with VHA and as many as 5000 per year among all living veterans. 
   Representative Boswell's bill is a bipartisan effort to get at the root of this troubling trend and to find solutions. 
   This bill requires the Veterans Administration to consider the special needs of veterans who suffer from post traumatic stress disorder and mandates the development and implementation of a comprehensive program to reduce the incidence of suicide among all veterans. 
   The bill accomplishes this by requiring that appropriate Veterans Administration staff are able to recognize risk factors for suicide and are aware of the proper protocols and best practices for responding to crisis situations involving veterans who may be at high risk. 
   The legislation also requires the designation of a suicide prevention counselor at each department medical facility and authorizes the availability of 24-hour mental health care; a hotline, staffed with trained mental health personnel; and expanded outreach and education services for veterans and their families. 
   We must put an end to this tragedy affecting the many vulnerable men and women who have worn our country's uniform and who serve this country proudly today. I believe this legislation is an important step in that direction, and I am happy to support it.

   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I thank my colleague. 
   Mr. Speaker, it was just about a year ago that the President of the United States came before this Congress and told the country that America is addicted to oil. He was right then and many of us were pleased to hear him acknowledge that very real fact. However, even as we all acknowledge the seriousness of the energy challenge we face as a Nation, the President and the last Congress failed to actually do something about it. We heard great words, but didn't see good deeds. In fact, rather than invest adequately in renewable energy and energy efficiency, we took the opposite approach. We gave greater breaks in taxes to the oil and gas industry even as prices at the pump went up and profits soared. That policy only served to feed the addiction to oil, not break that addiction. It made us more dependent, not less dependent on oil and gas and the volatile regions of the world that control the greatest reserves.  
   This is a time to change direction, to set a new course on energy policy, to say to the country: We're not just talking rhetoric. We mean what we say.

   Breast cancer affects virtually every American family. Most of us have lost a family member--grandmothers, mothers, aunts, sisters, and daughters--to breast cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates 178,000 women in the United States will be diagnosed this year with breast cancer. They estimate 40,000 women will die from the disease. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, accounting for more than one in four cancers diagnosed in women. 
   We must do everything we can to understand the causes of breast cancer so we can effectively prevent and treat it. Since its inception, the breast cancer research stamp has raised $53 million for life-saving research. Proceeds from the sale of the stamps fund research at the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense. By reauthorizing the breast cancer research stamp, we would ensure that this funding source for breast cancer research continues.

   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation that will bring greater transparency and greater accountability to the commodity futures markets, and I want to commend committee Chairman Peterson, Ranking Member Goodlatte, and subcommittee Chairman Bob Etheridge for coming together with the committee and others to pass and develop this bipartisan legislation which I hope we will all pass. I also want to thank and commend Rosa DeLauro, John Larson, and Bart Stupak for their leadership on this issue. 
   If there is one thing we should have all learned over the last couple weeks given the turmoil in our financial markets, it is that we need greater transparency and greater accountability. These are not just abstract good government ideals, these are tools that people need for responsible regulation of our financial markets, including our futures markets. They are absolutely necessary if we want to make sure that the CFTC and our regulators have the information that they need, especially when you are talking about the great impact that these things can have on our economy, as we are seeing every day on Wall Street. 
   The old adage that ``what you don't know won't hurt you'' is no longer a tenable position for this Congress. We need the information. With this legislation, for the first time, we will shine a light on the so-called dark markets and empower the CFTC to take corrective action where they find problems. 
   It provides for stronger position limits for energy commodities traded on regulated exchanges while ensuring that our futures markets continue to have the liquidity they need to function properly. No one has said there is not an important role for our futures markets, it is making sure that they are regulated properly to protect consumers and investors. 
   This bill will also rein in excessive speculation by ensuring that hedging exemptions are granted only to commercial market participants seeking to  hedge their actual physical risk, rather than to speculators facing only financial risk. 
   Mr. Moran mentioned the recent report by the CFTC, and I would point out there was a recommendation they made which really follows a provision that we make in this bill, and that is to make sure that we, with respect to the commodity swap dealers and index traders, that we remove the swap dealers from the commercial category of market participants. We do that in this bill. 
   Additionally, in recognition of the numerous instances where the same CFTC staff report found traders effectively circumventing position limits they would ordinarily face on regulated exchanges by going to the over-the-counter market, in some cases exceeding those established positions by substantial amounts, the CFTC report proposes requiring swap dealers to certify that they are noncommercial clients that do not exceed established position limits with their over-the-counter trades. We do that here. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have a fundamental choice here. It is a choice between transparency and keeping things hidden behind the curtain. It is a choice between whether we want our futures markets to reflect the fundamentals of supply and demand, or whether we want our futures markets to be continuously whipsawed by massive in-flows of speculative money. 
   We have a job to do. We have seen in recent days and weeks on Wall Street the effects of taking our eye off the ball and not providing regulators with the tools they need and them not following through with what they have. Let's make sure that we don't make that mistake in the commodities futures trading market. We have already seen the impact of not giving those complete tools. Let's make sure that those folks have what they need and are empowered to do the job on behalf of the American public. I thank the committee for their work on this.

   Mr. Chairman, our Nation faces great environmental challenges. We need to combat global warming, curb pollution, and expand conservation and energy efficiency. And to confront these challenges, we need to ensure that students graduate from our schools with an understanding of the environment. We need hands-on outdoor learning opportunities to inspire students to enter science fields and develop innovative solutions. 
   Today's bill extends the authorization for the National Environmental Education Act and enhances the Environmental Education and Training Program with teacher training and the opportunity for partnerships between teachers and working professionals in environmental fields. It also establishes the National Capacity Environmental Education Grant Program to assist States and local education agencies as they work to develop environmental literacy plans and student academic achievement standards. It encourages partnerships between states, schools, and institutes of higher education and creates and disseminates best practices for environmental education programs.  
   No Child Left Inside will give our students the opportunity to interact with and understand their environment. It will encourage their interest in science and prepare them to solve 21st century environmental challenges. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this bill.

   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of what I hope and expect will be the final version of this year's energy bill. While less comprehensive than the legislation passed by the House, it is nevertheless an historic accomplishment and worthy of this chamber's support. 
   For the first time in thirty-two years, we are increasing the corporate average fuel economy, CAFE, standard for cars and trucks to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. This single step will create 150,000 jobs, save consumers $22 billion at the pump and slash our nation's oil consumption by 1.1 million barrels a day--about half what we currently import from the Persian Gulf. Additionally, and importantly, this improved standard is the greenhouse gas equivalent of taking 28 million cars and trucks off the road. 
   To further reduce our dependence on foreign oil, this package includes a Renewable Fuels Standard, RFS, that expands our nation's domestic biofuel production to 36 billion gallons by 2022. I am especially pleased that this RFS includes a substantial requirement for advanced biofuels from a variety of different feedstocks, as well as robust environmental protections necessary to safeguard vital ecosystems like the Chesapeake Bay. 
   Finally, this legislation achieves meaningful efficiency improvements across the economy, makes government a part of the energy solution, and accelerates our research and development efforts into the clean, renewable energy technologies of the future. 
   As a sponsor of the Renewable Electricity Standard, RES, and a member of the Ways and Means Committee, I am disappointed that the House-passed RES and tax provisions have been stripped from this bill. Nevertheless, we can be justifiably proud of what we are accomplishing today--and I will continue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle until the rest of the job is done.

   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I thank my colleague and the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Mr. Peterson, for his leadership on this, along with our colleagues Ms. DeLauro, Mr. Stupak, Mr. Etheridge, Mr. Larson, and many others who have moved quickly to address the problems of rampant speculation in the energy futures market. 
   The title of this legislation is the Energy Markets Emergency Act, and what it does is direct the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the CFTC, to invoke its emergency powers to crack down on extreme speculation in the futures market. We all know that families across this country are facing emergencies in their family budgets, and it's time that the CFTC stepped forward and treated this like the emergency that it is. 
   Part of the rise in prices is of course due to supply and demand and the fact that China and India are boosting a demand. That's part of it. But the other part of it is in fact an increase in speculation, extreme speculation. There's been testimony before this Congress in front of the committee, subcommittee of Mr. Stupak, and on the Senate side and the House side by Professor Greenberger from the University of Maryland School of Law and many others that make it absolutely clear that a component of the increase in price does not have to do solely with supply and demand. 
   And the CFTC has the authority under the statute to invoke its emergency powers if market prices do not adequately reflect the forces of supply and demand. And I must say, Mr. Goodlatte, that it has not done that. This legislation does not say to the CFTC, Just keep doing what you're doing. The fact of the matter is, they haven't made that finding, they have not invoked their emergency powers, and there's some permanent issues we have to come back and fix. We have to finally close the Enron loophole. We need to deal with what's called the London loophole. We need to do some things on an emergency basis. 
   But if they invoke their emergency powers, they will have the authority to deal with those issues and close those loopholes on an emergency basis, and they have not done that. If they access and invoke these powers, they can put new position limits on, they can require greater margin requirements, they can even suspend tradings in certain funds. 
   So what this does is say to them, use the powers that you have; do not sit on your hands and do not stand by and refuse to enact your emergency powers because while they have taken certain steps, they have not made the finding that this bill essentially says which is that speculation is part of the problem. No one says it's all of the problem. But it is a part of the problem, and they therefore have the authority under existing law to invoke the emergency powers, and it opens up a whole set of new tools that they are not using. 
   So on this immediate basis, they can do everything necessary to address the problems of the Enron loophole, and they can do everything necessary to deal with the London loophole. They are not doing it today. We are directing them to treat this as the emergency it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 3685, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2007. Currently American workers are not entitled to protection from discrimination in the work place based upon their sexual orientation. As a result, it is legal to fire or refuse to hire someone simply because they are gay or lesbian. That is simply wrong! This country has a rich history of battling discrimination. Over the years Congress has banned employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability and age. However, our work is not done; we must continue to fight against injustice and extend basic workplace protection to gays and lesbians. 
   The American people do not support workplace intolerance. A Gallup poll in May of this year found that 89 percent of the American people support equal treatment for gays and lesbians regarding employment opportunities. The sexual orientation of an employee should not factor into the determination of one's competence to perform a particular job. American values are rooted in fairness and opportunities for all, in basic recognition that employment, free of discrimination, is a basic civil right, a human right that must be extended without regard to one's sexual orientation. 
   My own State of Maryland, in 2001, enacted a law prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. I was proud then to have worked on its passage through the State legislature. I am proud today to stand before the House and help pass this bill through Congress. Legislation to promote fairness in employment for gays and lesbians at the national level is long overdue. It is time to take action and extend equality to all Americans.

   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, many of my constituents are current or former employees of Government Sponsored Enterprises, GSEs, that provide residential mortgage services on behalf of the Federal Government. These employees are concerned that the Treasury Secretary's newly authorized control over their organizations may compromise their retirement benefits. I have consulted with Congressman Barney Frank, the Chairman of the Financial Services Committee, regarding this issue. Chairman Frank has assured me that in drafting this legislation he was careful to ensure that the Secretary's control over these GSEs will have no impact upon the retirement benefits of the rank-and-file employees who are not regarded as ``executives'' under the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. I greatly appreciate the Chairman's work to protect the benefits of these hard working employees.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I thank my colleague. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this long overdue bipartisan legislation, and I want to commend and thank our colleagues, PATRICK KENNEDY and JIM RAMSTAD, for their leadership, their passion, and their perseverance on this very important issue that is so important to millions of Americans around this country. 
   Last year, they traveled across this great land, holding a series of field hearings, listening to Americans in communities across the Nation, people from every walk of life. I had the privilege of hosting one of those hearings in my congressional district. The message from that hearing, as with the other hearings from around the country, was very clear, Congress needs to end insurance discrimination in mental health care. Both common sense and simple fairness require that mental health diseases be treated on an equal footing with other health conditions. 
   According to the National Institute of Mental Health, an estimated 26 percent of Americans suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder in any given year, and approximately 6 percent of our fellow Americans suffer from serious mental illness. Mental disorders are the leading cause of disability for individuals between the ages of 15 and 44. The good news is the science tells us that treatment works. The sad truth is that, for most Americans, health insurance coverage does not now cover the full range of their needs. 
   We know that for years, for years, employer-provided health care set stricter treatment limits and imposed higher out-of-pocket costs for mental health care. Congress took an important step in 1996 to correct that inequity through the Mental Health Parity Act. But problems remain, and that is the reason we have this very important legislation before us, because insurance companies were setting rigid, arbitrary caps on how they cover mental health. This legislation will finally stop those practices. 
   Mr. Speaker, Members of Congress have good health care coverage and mental health coverage. Let's give the same thing to the American people.

   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, today we commemorate the seventh anniversary of the most terrible terrorist attack ever on American soil. We remember those who suffered injury and mourn with the families who lost loved ones. 
   But we also remember the indomitable spirit of America that lit that dark day and the days that followed. The courage of the first responders and ordinary citizens who risked, and in some cases sacrificed, their lives to save others. The men and women of our armed forces who have worked honorably to defend our Nation from future harm. The millions of Americans who volunteered and supported efforts to rebuild New York and Washington and care for those who were injured there. 
   These individual acts of bravery and sacrifice remind us that even in times of fear and pain, the flame of liberty does not falter. In the face of grave threats, the world can stand together. And with the power of our ideals and the strength of our resolve, we can build a more peaceful world.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (TRADE AND GLOBALIZATION ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3920, the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act of 2007. 
   Growing global economic integration means the U.S. economy is more protected from domestic economic shocks because more people in more countries are buying American goods and services. But globalization can also produce harmful short term affects--such as when American jobs are lost as a result of trade. That is what H.R. 3920 is about. 
   H.R. 3920 helps those American workers who lose their jobs by no fault of their own as a result of trade and who need assistance in meeting the new challenges of the changing global economy. The types of assistance provided include additional training, long term education, short term income support, and health care. 
   The bill expands trade adjustment assistance to service workers including government employees who are laid off because of trade. When trade adjustment assistance started in 1962, U.S. trade in services was not significant. Today, the service sector comprises more than 70 percent of the U.S. economy. H.R. 3920 updates trade adjustment assistance to account for the size and growing significance of the American service sector. 
   The bill also expands assistance to more manufacturing workers by eliminating restrictions on what country a U.S. factory's jobs are moved to or whether the loss of jobs are ``downstream'' so that all workers impacted by trade are covered regardless of where the factory relocates or where the import competition came from. 
   H.R. 3920 also helps American workers adapt to the needs of the changing global economy by enabling them to upgrade their skills. This bill doubles training assistance and provides up to 130 weeks of additional income support for workers who require a longer educational period, such as when finishing a college degree. 
   Mr. Speaker, today the Peru Free Trade Agreement was reported out of the Ways and Means Committee by a vote of 39-0. Many of us supported the Peru FTA because of the landmark workers rights and environmental provisions negotiated this past May that were inserted in the agreement. They were also influenced and encouraged by H.R. 3920 because they, like myself, feel more confident that American workers harmed by trade will get the assistance they need to meet the new challenges created by a global economy. 
   I am proud to support H.R. 3920 the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act of 2007, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.

   The Dutch/American relationship is the longest unbroken diplomatic relationship in the history of the United States of America. The relationship actually began years before the Pilgrims landed in America as they first resided for almost 11 years in the Netherlands before sailing for the New World. 
   On November 16, 1776, only 4 months after declaring our independence from Great Britain, an American ship sailed into the West Indies Dutch harbor of St. Eustatius and was greeted by a cannon salute in recognition of the American flag. It was the first official recognition by any sovereign nation of the United States. 
   On April 19, 1789, Ambassador John Adams officially presented his credentials to Prince William of Orange, thus establishing the diplomatic ties between the United States and the Republic of the Netherlands that we enjoy today.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, let's be clear: we are facing this crisis today because of the reckless economic policies of the Bush Administration and its deregulatory ideology run amok. No one likes the choice before us. But we must deal with the world as it is today, not the world that might have been had the Bush policies not driven the economy and our financial system to the brink of collapse. If this rescue plan were simply an effort to indemnify Wall Street from the consequences of its own excesses, I would have none of it. Unfortunately, that's not why we're here today. 
   We're here because we cannot let the toxic contagion on Wall Street spill over to Main Street. We must not let the colossal failures of irresponsible corporate executives wipe out innocent small businesses and citizens who had nothing to do with this mess. At the end of the day, we are here out of the conviction that acting decisively now will mean less expense and pain than waiting for the crisis to get even worse. 
   Make no mistake: this legislation is a far cry from the original blank check the Administration so brazenly requested. Secretary Paulson and his successor at Treasury will have real time oversight regarding the decisions they make--and robust judicial review of those decisions after the fact. There will be no golden parachutes for the corporate executives whose poor judgment and failed leadership created this crisis. Qualified homeowners struggling to pay their mortgages will get the help they need to stay in their homes. The $700 billion authorized in this bill will be broken up and made available in separate tranches so that Congress can exercise ongoing oversight before additional funds are spent. And taxpayers will receive additional, vital protections in the form of a non-voting equity or senior creditor interest in the companies they are helping to rescue, a preferred position for distribution of assets should a company fail and the ability to resell the assets the government purchases at a potential profit once the markets recover. 
   In that regard, while no one has a crystal ball, the Congressional Budget Office has testified that it believes the final cost for this rescue package will be substantially less than $700 billion because the assets the government will be purchasing will have at least some value. Moreover, it is reasonable to expect that at least some of these assets could over time actually increase in value, giving taxpayers the opportunity to make money on their investments and help recoup the initial costs of this plan. However, in the event a full recovery of taxpayer funds is not complete within five years, this legislation requires the President to submit a plan that would impose a fee on the financial industry to make up the difference and make the taxpayers whole. 
   Finally, Madam Speaker, we would not be doing our job today if we did not assure our constituents that, even as we address the immediate crisis before us, we are firmly committed to analyzing what went wrong and fixing it so that this kind of crisis never happens again. In addition to the provisions in this legislation requiring a top to bottom review of our regulatory system, Congress--and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on which I sit--will immediately begin an investigation designed to give this Congress a comprehensive blueprint for 21st century regulatory reform.

   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S.1, the Honest Leadership, Open Government Act of 2007. S.1 contains the contents of an agreement between the House and the Senate in the reconciliation of provisions between the respective bills of these institutions to impose the highest standards of ethics reform on the House and the Senate and to restrict the influence of special interests and lobbyists. The American people spoke loud and clear in their demand for change on Capitol Hill. They conveyed a very strong message that an environment that accommodated Duke Cunningham and Jack Abramoff was unacceptable and that the culture of corruption must stop. As a result I urge the House to adopt this measure. This Conference agreement between the House and Senate contains some of the following provisions: 
   Bans lavish convention parties--prohibits Members of Congress from attending national political convention parties held in their honor and paid for by lobbyists or their clients. 
   Creates new transparency for lobbyist political campaign fund activity and other financial contributions--requires disclosure when lobbyists bundle campaign contributions for any federal elected official, candidate or leadership PAC; and requires lobbyists to detail their own campaign contributions, and payments to Presidential libraries, Inaugural Committees or entities controlled by or named for Members of Congress. 
   Ends K-Street Project--Prohibits Members of Congress and their staff from attempting to influence employment decisions in exchange for political access. 
   Imposes restrictions on corporate flights--requires Senators, Senate candidates and Presidential candidates to pay charter rates for trips on private planes; bars House candidates from accepting trips on private planes. 
   Expands public disclosure of lobbyist activities--requires lobbyists to file reports on their lobbying twice as often each year, and for the first time to file them electronically in a public, searchable database; and increases civil and criminal penalties for knowingly violating lobbying disclosure rules. 
   Creates Congressional Pension Accountability--Denies Congressional retirement benefits to Members of Congress who are convicted of bribery, perjury and other similar crimes.

   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5349, a twenty one day extension of the Protect America Act. I believe that this short term extension is necessary to achieve a long term solution to update our foreign surveillance laws in a manner that will protect the civil liberties of Americans. 
   I voted against the Protect America Act last August because I believe that it seriously compromises the civil liberties of Americans. I am still opposed to it as a permanent solution to our need to conform our surveillance laws to changes in telecommunication technology. Fortunately, it was scheduled to sunset in 6 months to provide additional time to correct our foreign surveillance law in a balanced manner. 
   The House passed such a balanced bill, H.R. 3773, the RESTORE Act, in November. I voted for this bill because I believe that it establishes the proper balance between the protection of civil liberties and the needs of our intelligence agencies to have access to critical information. Unfortunately, the Senate passed their bill yesterday giving us no time to reconcile the differences between the respective bills. Moreover, I have serious objections to the Senate bill which is dramatically different than its House counterpart. 
   Significant work must be done to harmonize these bills in a manner that will be acceptable to me. Consequently, it is necessary to provide additional time for the committees of jurisdiction to craft a balanced bicameral solution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I thank the chairman for his leadership. 
   Today we have arrived at a moment of truth on energy policy in this body. For weeks, our Republican colleagues have claimed they want a comprehensive piece of legislation, an all-of-the-above piece of legislation when it comes to energy policy. Now we have just such an initiative before us on the floor of this House, and they won't take ``yes'' for an answer. 
   It turns out that they want all of the above with a big asterisk next to it. It turns out it is all of the above, except let's not take away some of the taxpayer giveaways and subsidies to the big oil and gas companies and use those moneys instead for renewable energy and energy efficiency. 
   I think the American people know what a cozy relationship there has been between the Bush White House and Big Oil. I think last week we learned just how cozy that was between the Bush Department of the Interior and the oil industry. 
   This bill does two main things. First of all, it greatly expands opportunities for responsible offshore drilling in our country, and uses the royalties and proceeds from those drilling operations to invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency. 
   But let's not try and fool the American people. The Department of Energy has made it clear that even if you drilled on every square inch of this country today, you wouldn't see a drop in price of gas at the pump for a very long time and the price impact would be minimal. Why? The United States has 3 percent of the world's oil reserves and guzzles 25 percent of the world's oil. 
   You cannot drill your way to energy independence, which is why we have the second part of this bill, which is a huge increase in renewable energy and energy efficiency, why we establish a national 15 percent renewable energy standard by 2020. That is why we redirect the subsidies away from the oil and gas industry, who are making record profits, and invest that money instead in renewable energy and energy efficiency. 
   It is too bad that in listening to the debate today, that our Republican colleagues will not cease this opportunity to move forward together on what is a comprehensive plan. It is too bad that they refuse to break that connection with the oil and gas industry as a result of the provisions in this bill that say let's redirect those subsidies. 
   This is a serious challenge that our country is facing. This is a serious proposal that is put forth to bridge the differences and try to move forward together on an important piece of legislation for the American people. It is unfortunate, just listening to the debate, that some of our colleagues want so badly to have a political issue to take to this election that they refuse to come together as one in this body to actually get something real done. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve better than that. They deserve a piece of legislation that will move us forward on this very important issue.  They deserve for this House to support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I thank my colleague. 
   Mr. Chairman, let's start with something we can all agree on, that the Government of the District of Columbia should pass a local law that conforms to the recent Supreme Court decision. They have done that now. As of today, the Government of the District of Columbia has passed legislation that complies with the Supreme Court ruling. 
   So what is the issue before us today? It is not whether they should comply with the constitutional ruling, it is who gets to decide what new constitutional law they can put in place and whether or not this body should play D.C. City Council, or whether we should pretend we are 435 mayors of the District of Columbia and substitute our judgment for the judgment of the elected leaders of our Nation's capital. 
   You know, people in this body often talk about the importance of local decision-making, and we have to listen to the people close to the ground. That is great to say, but the actions, at least in the substitute bill, suggest that we are not serious in that respect about what we say because what this substitute bill does is takes away from the people of the District of Columbia the democratic rights that all of our constituents have in cities and States around this country. 
   Mr. Burton mentioned he lived in Virginia when he is near the Nation's capital and how he feels safe there. Virginia has a law that says you can only purchase one gun a month. So does my State of Maryland, one gun a month. 
   What this substitute bill says is the people of the District of Columbia, they can't pass the same law that the people of Virginia and people of Maryland have. That is absolutely wrong. 
   I represent a district that is a neighbor to the Nation's capital. This bill eliminates for the purpose of the District of Columbia the ban on interstate trafficking of guns that applies to every other jurisdiction of this country that not only puts at risk the people of the District of Columbia but puts a burden and a risk on the people of all the surrounding jurisdictions. Why would we allow that provision which applies throughout the country just to the District of Columbia?     
   Why are we substituting our judgment for the decisions of the people of the District of Columbia when they are conforming to the Constitution of the United States, including the most recent ruling? 
   Mr. Chairman, we should support this bill and oppose the substitute.

   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Tax Act of 2008 (H.R. 6049) for the innovation it will drive and the fiscal responsibility it represents. In our efforts to fashion a bicameral way forward on these important incentives, I sincerely hope that my colleagues in the Senate will take yes for an answer and forward this compromise package to the President without delay. 
   This pro-growth legislation provides $15 billion for tax incentives in the areas of renewable energy, energy efficiency and conservation. It extends the production tax credit for wind, biomass, geothermal and hydropower facilities and expands that credit to include the promising field of marine renewables. It extends the investment tax credit for solar energy, fuel cells and microturbines for eight years and similarly extends the residential solar property credit for another eight years while removing the existing $2000 cap. And it extends important energy efficiency incentives across the residential, commercial and industrial sectors--including accelerated depreciation of smart grid systems and related equipment--while expediting next generation transportation technologies like cellulosic ethanol and plug-in hybrids. 
   On the extenders side of the equation, this legislation maintains important provisions in the code ranging from the R&D tax credit to encourage business innovation to IRA charitable rollover provisions that support the good works of our non-profit sector to an above-the-line deduction for tuition costs and an enhanced child credit to help our families' budgets during these challenging economic times. Moreover, to meet our colleagues in the Senate halfway, this legislation extends these provisions for two years, as in the Senate bill, and then pays for it by delaying the effective date of an offset the Senate has in principle already agreed to. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is important, broadly supported, fiscally responsible legislation that needs to be enacted into law this year. I urge its immediate adoption.

   This legislation will grow our economy and create jobs by investing $34 billion in needed infrastructure improvements for our roads, bridges, water resources, schools, public transit, airports and housing. It provides $1.6 billion to accelerate advanced battery, renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies. And it offers a helping hand to our neighbors in need by extending unemployment benefits for an additional seven weeks, increasing food stamp support by $2.6 billion, bolstering our job training efforts by $500 million, and temporarily enhancing the federal match to state Medicaid programs in order to protect health care for our most vulnerable citizens.

   Borderline personality disorder is a serious mental health illness that centers on the inability of people to manage their emotions effectively. Approximately 4 million Americans suffer from borderline personality disorder. Its symptoms include destructive impulsiveness, rage, marked shifts in mood, bodily self-harm,  chaotic relationships, fears of abandonment, substance abuse, and unstable self-identity. Although it was officially recognized in 1980 by the psychiatric community, borderline personality disorder is at least two decades behind in research, treatment options, and education compared to other major mental illnesses. 
   Borderline personality disorder can have a devastating impact on people's lives. While some persons with this disorder may be functioning normally in certain settings, their private lives are often in turmoil. Others are unable to work and require financial support. If Americans would like more information on borderline personality disorder, I encourage them to visit the National Education Alliance for Borderline Personality Disorder Web site at www.neabpd.org or the National Alliance on Mental Illness Web site at www.nami.org. 
   Madam Speaker, this resolution acknowledges the pressing burden of those afflicted with borderline personality disorder and seeks to spread awareness of this under-recognized, and often misunderstood, mental illness. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2900, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. 
   I am proud that the headquarters of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is located in the Congressional District that I represent. I commend the hard working employees at FDA for their service and dedication to our country. However, serious gaps have been exposed in FDA's ability to protect the American public due to recent outbreaks of food-borne illnesses as well as high-profile post-market safety problems. It has become clear that FDA lacks the adequate resources to fulfill its vast and vital public health mission. 
   In light of these events, we need to ensure that the FDA has the necessary tools and resources to protect the American public from unsafe products. H.R. 2900 takes a good first step in providing FDA with those resources in reauthorizing the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). Since its inception in 1992, PDUFA has helped enable FDA to approve more than 1,100 new medicines and reduce review times for innovative drugs and biologics, providing patients and doctors with earlier access to breakthrough treatments. Congress must reauthorize the prescription drug and medical device user fee programs in a timely manner to avoid any workforce disruptions at FDA. Without this bill, FDA will not have adequate resources to fulfill its mission. In addition, the innovation and development of new therapies will be hampered if PDUFA is not renewed--the FDA approval process will be too long for new potential treatments. With this reauthorization, the FDA will be permitted to collect a total of $393 million in prescription drug user fees per year through FY 2012. 
   H.R. 2900 also expands the FDA's ability to monitor the safety of drugs after they have been approved and marketed. In addition, the legislation creates a public database for ongoing and completed clinical trials. It is important to have all the information about any drug during the trial stage be disclosed to the public so that doctors can make sound medical decisions and provide their patients with the best possible care. 
   I am also pleased that the legislation includes a provision that expands on the successful Critical Path Initiative. FDA established  the Critical Path Initiative in 2004 to improve the efficiency and safety of drug and medical product development. This provision authorizes the FDA to enter into Critical Path Public-Private Partnerships with universities and non-profit organizations to modernize the process to develop prescription drugs and other medical products. These collaborations will help the FDA move drugs and medical devices through the approval process in a quicker, safer and more reliable manner at a lower cost. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act is only one important step in providing FDA with the necessary tools and resources to do its job. Congress must also significantly increase federal appropriations to FDA so that the agency is able to fulfill its most basic responsibilities. Such an increase will not only make foods, drugs and devices safer, but it will also lead to a stronger, more effective FDA that can restore public confidence, speed innovation and ensure that America remains competitive in foreign markets. 
   I believe H.R. 2900 will help ensure the timely access to safe and effective prescription drugs and medical devices as well as improve the integrity of the drug approval process at FDA. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2900.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Let me thank the gentlewoman from Ohio for the time, and thank her for her leadership on education issues. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a good day for students around the country, and it is a good day for all Americans, and I commend the Education and Labor Committee for their good work on this legislation. 
   During the first 100 hours of this new Congress when we passed legislation to cut the interest rates on student loans in half, many of us stood in the well here and said, this is just the beginning. That was an important first step to making college more affordable and giving millions of students a chance to further their educations and to brighten their futures. 
   We stand here today to take the next step, the largest investment in student loans since the GI Bill. We are keeping the promise that we made to the American people and American students,  cutting interest rates on student loans in half and now increasing Pell Grants, raising the cap on low-interest Federal loans and making it easier for students who are being pinched by other costs to pay back the payments on their interest rates and their loans. 
   In addition, this bill makes it easier for young people to enter public service and serve their communities by extending loan forgiveness to law enforcement officers, first responders, librarians and nurses and giving more assistance than ever to undergraduates who commit to teaching in high-need locations or subject areas. As we make these very vital changes to give more opportunities to students, we do so in a fiscally responsible manner by cutting exorbitant fees to lenders. 
   Mr. Speaker, by opening the doors to college and maintaining a balanced budget, we are working to ensure the best possible future for our young people. By increasing the opportunity incentive to enter public service, we harness the ability and ambition of our best and brightest. And by helping students achieve advanced degrees, we are ensuring that the United States remains on the forefront of innovation and discovery in an increasingly competitive global economy. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think we would all agree, there is no better investment that we can all make than in the area of education. Students and middle America are feeling the pinch of rising costs in many areas. This helps provide them greater means to open the door of college and opportunity to more and more Americans. 
   I encourage my colleagues to join with all of us in taking this very important step for the students of this country and, indeed, for all America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, the chairman of the Education and Workforce Committee, Mr. Miller, for his work on this and other education issues, as well as my other colleagues. 
   It is interesting to hear people talk about the fact that this does not totally reduce the cost of going to college when, for the past many years, this body has not delivered on that commitment to the American people. 
   In the last campaign, we did make a commitment to reduce the cost of going to college, and this bill is a follow-through on that commitment, and we will reduce the cost. We know in this country that one of the greatest impediments we have to people getting ahead is the burden of the cost of college tuition, a burden that has risen dramatically over the years. 
   Right now, many students who graduate from college are faced with a big debt burden that takes a long time to retire, and even worse than that is the number of students who are deterred from even going to college in the first place because of the cost of going to college and the debts they will incur. This bill takes a significant step toward reducing that burden and opening up the doors of opportunities. 
   We lose some of the very best and brightest in this country who have the ambition to go out and learn, who are qualified to go out there, who have done the work and gotten the grades, and because of the high costs are prohibited from going forward. In fact, about 4.4 million students are essentially deterred from going to college it is estimated over the next 10 years as a result of these high costs. 
   So, yes, during the last campaign this was a very, very important issue to the American people. Instead of raising the costs of going to college, instead of cutting $13 billion from higher education as was done in the last Congresses, we said, we are going to turn that around; we are going to make it easier for people to go to college; we are going to open the doors of opportunity, not just because it is the right thing to do to make sure that every individual has the opportunity to reach his or her full potential, but because our Nation needs to make sure we do that in this competitive era.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the National Defense Authorization 2009. 
   This bipartisan bill authorizes $531 billion for the DoD and national defense programs of the Department of Energy and reflects Congress' commitment to supporting our troops and their families while protecting the national interests of the United States and improving the oversight and accountability of funding for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   I believe passage of this bill will be welcome news to our service members and their families. To help our troops readjust to civilian life and to help military families deal with the economic pressures here at home as a spouse serves overseas, the bill provides a 3.9 percent pay raise for all servicemembers and extends the President's authority to offer bonuses and other incentive pay. The bill provides tuition assistance to help military spouses establish their own careers, authorizes funds to assist area schools with large enrollments of children from military families, and reverses the rise in health care costs by prohibiting fee increases in TRICARE and the TRICARE pharmacy program. 
   As a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, where oversight of war contracting has been a priority, I am encouraged by language in the bill to increase transparency and accountability of federal contracts. The Defense Department has made over 180,000 payments to contractors from offices in Iraq, Kuwait, and Egypt. These payments are for everything from bottled water to assault rifles. But due to poor DoD accountability and oversight, billions of dollars of taxpayer money are unaccounted for or have simply gone missing. 
   Today, the DoD Deputy Inspector General told the Oversight and Government Reform Committee that, after reviewing approximately $8.2 billion in Defense spending in Iraq, they estimate that the Department failed to properly account for $7.8 billion. Additionally, the IG reported that the Defense Department has paid $135 million to Britain, South Korea, Poland, and other countries to conduct their own operations in Iraq. The DoD Inspector General tried to find out what this money was used for, but could find no answers. 
   The bill addresses the lack of accountability in war contracting in two ways. First, by requiring a separate budget request for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, it will be easier for Congress and American people to follow more closely how U.S. tax dollars are being spent. Second, with the passage of the Waxman amendment to the bill, anti-fraud measures will be enhanced and transparency in contracting Increased by limiting the use of abuse-prone contracts and by rebuilding the federal acquisition workforce. 
   I am also supporting this bill for the assistance it provides the many thousands of federal employees who work for the DoD and who are fearful of administration efforts to use the OMB A-76 Circular to compete out their jobs. I am pleased that I was able to help ensure that the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act included a provision that prohibits the Pentagon from undertaking, preparing for, continuing, or completing public-private competitions of federal jobs as directed by the Office of Management and Budget. The provision also overturns the mandatory requirement that the jobs of federal employees be re-competed every 5 years. 
   The Department of Defense has yet to issue guidance to the Department to implement past congressional A-76 recommendations nor has it listened to the recommendations of military commanders who have warned that these A-76 competitions are harming the Pentagon's mission. So, the National Defense Authorization Act again urges the Pentagon to immediately implement guidelines recommended by Congress. 
   Like most bills, this one contains provisions that I would not have included. However, on balance it is a good bill that strengthens our national security.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (ORDERLY AND RESPONSIBLE IRAQ REDEPLOYMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Iraq Redeployment Act which sets forth a realistic strategy for the responsible redeployment of our combat troops in Iraq. The Bush Administration has requested another $200 billion dollar blank check for the war in Iraq to pursue a flawed strategy that has no end in sight and which continually puts our brave men and women in the armed services in the middle of Iraq's civil war. 
   The indefinite presence of American forces in Iraq has allowed the different factions there to postpone making the difficult compromises necessary to achieve stability and political reconciliation. Our intelligence community has publicly concluded that the political situation in Iraq is getting worse, not better. We cannot ask our troops to remain in Iraq when the different Iraqi factions have refused to take the steps necessary to achieve a greater stability. 
   We must embark on a new direction in Iraq. That's what this legislation will do. It allocates $50 billion for the purpose of beginning to responsibly redeploy our combat forces out of Iraq by the target date of December 15, 2008. The troops that would remain in Iraq beyond that date would focus on the more limited missions of training Iraqi security forces, providing logistical and intelligence support for the Iraqi security forces, and engaging in targeted counter-terrorist operations against Al-Qaeda and affiliated groups. 
   As the legislation states, ``the primary purpose of funds made available by the Act should be to transition the mission of the United States Armed Forces in Iraq and undertake their redeployment, and not to extend or prolong the war.'' This bill also states that the reduction of our armed forces in Iraq ``shall be implemented in conjunction with a comprehensive diplomatic, political and economic strategy that includes sustained engagement with Iraq's neighbors and the international community for the purpose of working collectively to bring stability to Iraq''--a strategy recommended by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group that the Administration has failed to pursue with any vigor or urgency. 
   This legislation also prohibits the deployment of any troops not fully equipped or trained, and extends to all U.S. Government agencies and personnel the limitations in the U.S. Army Field Manual on permissible interrogation techniques. We must send a strong message to the world that we do not support or condone torture. 
   We are on the wrong path in Iraq. This bill provides a much needed change in direction that will strengthen our national security, improve our position in the region and bring our men and women safely home.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act, to strengthen and expand Head Start programs across the country. 
   Last Spring, we held a National Summit on America's Children here at the Capitol. We heard from leading experts on child development and neuroscience, who emphasized the vital importance of early childhood education. Early interventions can dramatically increase a child's chances for future success. 
   Head Start is based on this idea and it works. For more than 40 years, it has been helping to close the achievement gap and teach our children that they can succeed, regardless of background or family income. More than 20 million children and families have benefited from its services. With this bill today, we will open the door to more children to enter both Head Start and Early Head Start and will ensure that they are better prepared for kindergarten and elementary school. 
   Today's bill also recognizes the importance of early childhood educators, targeting new funding to improve teacher salaries and professional development. It ensures that teachers are highly qualified and able to meet the needs of children with disabilities and improves accountability for Head Start programs. 
   I also urge my colleagues to support the funding necessary to continue Head Start's success. Last week, we sent the President a bill increasing Head Start funding by 2.2 percent to simply help it keep pace with inflation. The President vetoed this funding. I encourage my colleagues to vote to override the President's veto to prevent Head Start program closures and ensure that children get the services they were promised. 
   I thank Chairman Miller, Chairman Kildee, and the Conference Committee for putting together this bipartisan piece of legislation, and urge its passage today.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this long overdue bipartisan legislation, and I want to commend and thank  our colleagues, Patrick Kennedy and Jim Ramstad, for their leadership on this very important issue that is so important to millions of Americans around this country. 
   The bill before us today is the product of their determination, perseverance and passion. They traveled across this great land holding field hearings listening to Americans from all walks of life. I had the privilege of hosting one of those hearings in my congressional district. The message from that hearing, as with other hearings from around the country, was very clear--Congress needs to end insurance discrimination in mental health care. 
   Both common sense and simple fairness dictate that mental health diseases be treated on an equal footing with other conditions. Unfortunately, employer-provided health care set stricter treatment limits and imposed higher out-of-pocket costs for mental health care for many years. The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity Act of 2008 will reverse this practice and ensure that group health plans do not charge higher co-payments, coinsurance, deductibles, and do not lower day and visit limits on mental health and addiction care than for medical and surgical care. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is completely paid for. Let us honor the spirit of Paul Wellstone and pass this much-needed legislation. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand, as an original sponsor, in strong support of the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights Act of 2008, a bill to prohibit creditors from using adverse information about a consumer or his credit as the basis for increasing his interest rate or fees. 
   Even in the best economic times, unexpected credit card fees can make it difficult for many strapped consumers to stay afloat. In the worst of times, these fees can push them over the edge into bankruptcy. For Americans struggling to keep pace with rising food costs and falling home values, this legislation equips consumers with significant new powers to help protect them from punitive credit card rate charges and fees. 
   The bill requires advance notice of credit card account rate increases and prohibits companies from imposing interest on credit repaid within the interest-free repayment time period. 
   The bill authorizes a consumer who receives a notice about a rate change to cancel the credit card without penalty or the imposition of any fee and allows consumers to pay any outstanding balance that accrued before the effective date of the rate increase. 
   The bill also authorizes a consumer to opt-out of over-the-limit fee programs and imposes restrictions on the frequency of over-the-limit fees. 
   Madam Speaker, this important bill comes before this House at an important time for American consumers. Our constituents need these protections. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chairman, this bill before us establishes many important incentives for consumers to make savings through the use of improvements in energy efficiency. However, I think we all understand that those incentives only work if consumers know about them and they are easily accessible, and that is what this noncontroversial amendment aims to do. 
   It simply adds a sixth policy option for States to consider in title IX of the underlying bill. It asks States and asks utilities to partner with us to promote the use of home energy audits, to educate homeowners about the financial and environmental benefits associated with residential energy efficiency improvements, and to publicize the availability of Federal and State incentives to make residential energy efficiency improvements more affordable. In short, this amendment represents a voluntary, commonsense way to drive consumers towards the very incentives we encourage them to use in this bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, this comprehensive energy package represents a long-overdue course correction and a new vision for energy policy in the United States. Today, we are beginning to make good on our commitment to redirect many of the wasteful subsidies away from already highly profitable oil and gas companies towards the renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies of the future. 
   These investments will reduce our dependence on foreign oil. They will help combat the growing problem of climate change by reducing our carbon dioxide emissions by 10.4 billion tons through the year 2030, more than the total of all tailpipe emissions from all of the cars on the road today. 
   As we generate cleaner power, we will also generate an estimated 3 million good-paying jobs over the next 10 years while investing in small business, economic development and high-payoff research at the Department of Energy. 
   And its energy efficiency provisions that we hope this amendment will encourage more consumers to go toward will save consumers if they take advantage of them, a staggering $300 billion through the year 2030, demonstrating once again that the cheapest kind of energy is the kind we never have to use. 
   Mr. Chairman, this amendment is designed to ensure that American consumers know of the new possibilities before them. Many who oppose this bill focus on what they claim America cannot do. Those of us who support this bill have great faith in the creative energy and entrepreneurial spirit of the American people and our capacity to find innovative solutions to the challenges we face. 
   I encourage my colleagues to adopt this amendment which is in the spirit of the overall bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chairman, I'm pleased to join my colleagues Representative JAY INSLEE and Representative WALTER JONES in offering this important bipartisan amendment today. 
   Our Federal workforce is comprised of hard-working public servants who deserve respect on the job and fairness in matters of personnel. Over the past several years, it has become increasingly clear that the Defense Department's alternative human resources regime known as the National Security Personnel System (NSPS) provides neither--and therefore should not be supported in this legislation. 
   The NSPS was originally authorized in the FY 2004 Defense authorization bill at the request of the political leadership in the Pentagon with the understanding that the new authority would be exercised consistent with congressional intent and in consultation with the legitimate representatives of the Nation's 700,000 DoD workforce. For all intents and purposes, that hasn't happened. The Pentagon has, for example, ignored Congress' requirement that an independent entity arbitrate certain disputes between management and labor. And DoD has brushed aside provisions mandating the use of a merit system protection board with independent judgment. 
   As a consequence, the NSPS has been mired in lawsuits, and this House has now acted twice to curtail the program: first, by passing an essentially identical limitation amendment by voice vote during consideration of last year's Defense appropriations bill; and second, by effectively eliminating authority for the NSPS in this year's Defense authorization legislation. If that weren't enough, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) recently reported that it couldn't even figure out how much money the Defense Department was actually spending on the NSPS because ``DoD has not established an effective oversight mechanism to ensure that all these costs are fully captured.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues' support for this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to rise today as an original cosponsor of the New Direction for Energy Independence, National Security and Consumer Protection Act of 2007 and the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2007. Taken together, this comprehensive energy package represents a long overdue course correction and new vision for energy policy in the United States. 
   Today, the House Democratic Leadership makes good on its commitment to redirect wasteful subsidies away from our already highly profitable oil and gas companies towards the renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies of the future. These new investments will significantly enhance our ability to combat global climate change, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, generate millions of new jobs and save consumers and businesses hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 25 years. 
   This package calls on the U.S. to reengage in the global effort to reach a binding global warming agreement. It reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 10.4 billion tons through 2030, more than the total tailpipe emissions from all the cars on the road today. It moves aggressively towards the development of carbon sequestration in order to mitigate the impact of the fossil fuels we will continue to use. And it asks the Federal Government, the largest single energy consumer in the country, to lead the way by becoming carbon neutral by 2050. 
   To begin the necessary process of weaning ourselves off foreign oil, we make an historic investment in biofuels, with opportunities for feedstock contributions from every region of the country. We provide grant funds for alternative fuel vehicles and additional support for service stations offering E-85 ethanol. And we help farmers deploy technologies like wind, solar and biomass to further distribute renewable energy production and revitalize rural America. 
   This legislation is a pro-innovation, job-creation machine. It increases loan limits for small businesses engaged in clean energy technology. It funds high-risk, high-payoff renewable energy research at the Department of Energy. And it includes worker training programs in areas like solar panel manufacturing and green building construction to ensure that our citizens are fully prepared to participate in the green workforce of the future. The payoff? An estimated 3 million jobs over the next 10 years. 
   The energy efficiency provisions in this legislation alone are estimated to save consumers and businesses a staggering $300 billion through 2030--demonstrating once again that the cheapest kind of energy is the kind you never have to use. 
   On the tax side, we extend the renewable production tax credit through 2013 to eliminate the planning and market uncertainty associated with the two-year extensions of the past. We expand manufacturer tax credits for energy efficient appliances and extend the current deduction for energy efficient commercial buildings. In an effort to allow States and localities to innovate and tailor clean energy solutions to the specific needs and opportunities of their jurisdictions, we provide new bonding authority for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects--providing my home State of Maryland with an allocation of $111 million to tackle these issues at the local level. And we finally do away with the infamous ``Hummer Loophole'' that has perversely subsidized the purchase of the most polluting, least efficient vehicles for far too long. 
   Mr. Chairman, along with Mr. UDALL, Mr. PLATTS and several of my other colleagues, I will also be offering an important bipartisan amendment today to establish a Renewable Electricity Standard for the United States. Renewable electricity standards aren't new. Twenty-three States and the District of Columbia already benefit from them. The European Union has set a goal of 22 percent renewable electricity generation by 2010. By contrast, the RES amendment we will be offering today proposes the substantially more modest goal of 15 percent renewable electricity production by 2020, of which 4 percent can be achieved through energy efficiency. Above and beyond the underlying bill, adopting this RES amendment is the single most important step this House can take today to address climate change, promote energy independence, create hundreds of thousands of good paying jobs and save American consumers billions of dollars on their future energy bills. 
   Additionally, I will also be offering a noncontroversial amendment to H.R. 3221 that would add a sixth policy option for States to consider in Title IX of the underlying bill. This language is intended to complement the existing residential energy efficiency incentives provided throughout the rest of the legislation by asking States and utilities to partner with us to promote the use of home energy audits, educate homeowners about the financial and environmental benefits associated with residential energy efficiency improvements and publicize the availability of Federal and State incentives to make residential energy efficiency improvements more affordable. In short, this amendment represents a voluntary, commonsense way to drive consumers towards the incentives we are hoping they will use--and I encourage my colleagues' support. 
   Finally, by the time we finish this legislation, I believe it is critical that we enact aggressive ``smart grid'' policies that create incentives to modernize the electric grid, something that is decades overdue. Smart Grid reduces CO  
   2 emissions by 25 percent and electricity usage by 10 percent according to the Department of Energy, DOE, and the Electric Power Research Institute, EPRI. By utilizing intelligent tax depreciation policy, and by modernizing existing DOE programs, we can immediately incentivize modernization of the electric grid and see the corresponding energy and environmental improvements.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - March 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to cast my vote to override the President's veto of the ban on torture. This bill would have prevented the CIA from engaging in acts of torture. The President vetoed this bill over the provision that specifically extends to U.S. intelligence agencies and personnel the current prohibitions in the Army Field Manual against waterboarding and other torture. 
   The human rights violations perpetrated by the Bush Administration against people detained by the United States have done more to compromise this nation's security than to protect it. We can protect our nation from acts of terrorism without compromising our values or the Constitution. 
   The use of torture by U.S. intelligence agencies to gain intelligence is repugnant on moral grounds. In addition, many experts agree that information extracted through torture is often unreliable and misleading. Moreover, as the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of staff, Colin Powell, has testified, torture will put our own troops at greater risk of torture. 
   In 2007, General David Petraeus stated that torture is wrong and that the Army Field Manual works. In an open letter to service members in May 2007, General Petraeus stated, ``Some may argue that we would be more effective if we sanctioned torture or other expedient methods to obtain information from the enemy. They would be wrong. Beyond the basic fact that such actions are illegal, history shows that they also are frequently neither useful nor necessary. Certainly, extreme physical action can make someone `talk;' however, what the individual says may be of questionable value. In fact, our experience in applying the interrogation standards laid out in the Army Field Manual ..... shows that the techniques in the manual work effectively and humanely in eliciting information from detainees.'' 
   At a February 29th news briefing to oppose the President's anticipated veto, retired Lt. Gen. Harry Soyster, former Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, stated, ``Experience shows that the Army Field Manual's approaches to interrogation work. The Army Field Manual is comprehensive and sophisticated. It contains all the techniques any good interrogator needs to get accurate, reliable information, including out of the toughest customers. . . If [individuals] think these [harsh interrogation] methods work, they're woefully misinformed. Torture is counterproductive on all fronts. It produces bad intelligence. It ruins the [interrogation] subject, makes them useless for further interrogation. And it damages our credibility around the world.'' 
   Moreover, 30 retired military leaders have pointed out that failing to prohibit harsh interrogation techniques endangers our men and women in uniform. In a December 2007 letter, 30 retired military leaders wrote, ``We believe it is vital to the safety of our men and women in uniform that the United States not sanction the use of interrogation methods it would find unacceptable if inflicted by the enemy against captured Americans. ..... The current situation, in which the military operates under one set of interrogation rules that are public and the CIA operates under a separate, secret set of rules, is unwise and unpractical ..... What sets us apart from our enemies in this fight ..... is how we behave. In everything we do, we must observe the standards and values that dictate that we treat noncombatants and detainees with dignity and respect.'' 
   Many retired military leaders have also pointed out that waterboarding is clearly torture and is illegal. For example, Retired Admiral Donald Guter, Judge Advocate General, wrote in a November 2007 letter, ``Waterboarding is inhumane, it is torture, and it is illegal..... This is a critically important issue--but it is not, and never has been, a complex issue, and even to suggest otherwise does a terrible disservice to this nation. ..... Waterboarding detainees amounts to illegal torture in all circumstances. to suggest otherwise--or even to give credence to such a suggestion--represents both an affront to the law and to the core values of our nation.'' 
   Finally, the use of torture has weakened our national security by eroding our moral standing and has cost us our ability to enlist the cooperation and support of other nations in our fight against terrorism, and places our military and diplomatic personnel at risk. This practice must be stopped. Overturning this veto would be a crucial first important step to restore our moral standing in the world. It is imperative that Congress tells the world in no uncertain terms: Americans do not engage in torture.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (RECOGNIZING THE 187TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF GREECE AND CELEBRATING GREEK AND AMERICAN DEMOCRACY -- (House of Representatives - March 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1024, which celebrates the 187th anniversary of the independence of Greece, one of our country's closest and oldest allies. A longstanding member of NATO, Greece has played a pivotal role in the stability and development of the Balkans and the eastern Mediterranean region. It has invested over $20 billion in the countries of the region, contributing to the increasing economic vitality of the area. Greece has also contributed to peacekeeping operations that have been sponsored by the United Nations, the European Union, and the Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe. In addition, it has closely collaborated with the United States in opposing and fighting terrorists and terrorist networks. 
   Ancient Greece was the birthplace of democracy, and our country's Founding Fathers took much of their inspiration from reading the philosophers of that time and place as they created a fledgling new democracy here in the late 18th century. A century later, many Greek immigrants began to arrive at our shores, bringing with them a steadfast determination to succeed in realizing the American Dream. The Greek-American community, strengthened by new waves of immigration, has contributed to our society in numerous ways; many within the community have become leaders in the field of commerce, academia, the arts, and politics. They have also been instrumental in fostering close ties between the United States and Greece. As we celebrate the independence of Greece today, we also celebrate the accomplishments of the vibrant Greek-American community.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2272, AMERICA COMPETES ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, in 2005, the National Academies released a report, Rising Above the Gathering Storm. Its authors, a team of scientists, academic leaders, and business executives, gave Congress a strong warning--unless we take comprehensive action, America will lose its competitive edge in the world economy. 
   Today, I am proud to join my colleagues in a bipartisan effort to respond to that call to action with the 21st Century Competitiveness Act. This bill addresses this century's challenges with new investments in education, research, and small businesses. It is a comprehensive way to ensure that America remains at the forefront of discovery and innovation. 
   We recognize the need to foster student potential and encourage them to enter the fields of science, math, technology and engineering. This bill invests in 25,000 new teachers, helping them pay for school and training them to enter our nation's classrooms and engage students in math and science. It increases the number of teachers who can teach Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate classes and push our students to work with more challenging curricula. It puts new science and math teachers in high-needs schools so we can reach more students. And it establishes public-private partnerships so business and community leaders can identify high-needs fields and help students pursue innovative careers. 
   We recognize the need to push the boundaries of current research, explore new ideas, and foster innovation. This bill puts us on a path to double funding for our research institutions--the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Department of Energy's Office of Science. Our scientists at these institutions are engaged in remarkable, ground-breaking work, and we must redouble our support to ensure that America continues to be a leader in scientific advances. This bill will also provide grants to young researchers at the early stages of their careers to allow them to pursue their ideas and encourage them to continue their study in U.S. institutions. And, recognizing the importance of research into new energy technology as we work to combat global warming and reduce our dependence on foreign oil, this bill creates a new Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy. 
   Finally, we recognize the importance of small businesses and entrepreneurial success in the development of our economy. This bill will double funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership over 10 years and will create a Technology Innovation Program to support revolutionary technology development at small and medium sized companies. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must take proactive steps to secure America's place in an era of global economic and scientific competition. This bill, by increasing the number of students entering STEM fields and stimulating exciting research at our national scientific institutions and in our business community, will do just that. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3195, the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, which would restore the original intent of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA. 
   The ADA has transformed this country since its enactment in 1990, helping millions of Americans with disabilities succeed in the workplace, and making essential services such as transportation, housing, buildings, and other daily needs more accessible to individuals with disabilities. It has been one of the most defining and effective civil rights laws passed by Congress. 
   Unfortunately, the Federal courts in recent years have slowly chipped away at the broad protections of the ADA which has created a new set of barriers for many Americans with disabilities. The court rulings have narrowed the interpretation of disability by excluding people with serious conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, muscular dystrophy, cancer, and cerebral palsy from the protections of the ADA. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 will reestablish these protections and make it absolutely clear that the ADA is intended to provide broad coverage to protect anyone who faces discrimination on the basis of disability. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill is an important step towards restoring the original intent of the ADA and helps ensure that all Americans with disabilities live as independent, self-sufficient members of our society. I urge my colleagues to support this much-needed legislation.

   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007 (H.R. 3). 
   This bipartisan legislation will provide countless number of Americans hope of finding cures for many life-threatening diseases. I strongly believe stem cell research holds the promise of scientific breakthroughs that could improve the lives of millions of Americans afflicted with a debilitating disease--such as Parkinson's, diabetes, spinal cord injuries, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular disease, and cancer--for which there is currently no cure. For these patients and their families, stem cell research is the last hope for a cure. 
   I wholeheartedly believe we should allow the expansion of federally supported research of human embryonic stem cell lines. The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007 would provide federal for a wider range of stem cell research while establishing ethical guidelines. In addition, the legislation would provide that embryos that are otherwise likely to be discarded can be used to develop treatments for debilitating diseases and life-saving cures. 
   I was extremely disappointed that the President exercised his first veto on a piece of legislation that has bipartisan support. A majority ofthe American people support stem cell research. In the last election, Missouri voters approved a ballot measure to allow stem cell research in that state. 
   It is expected that the Senate will pass H.R. 3. If that is the case, I hope the President will listen to Congress and the American people rather than to the extreme right of his own political party and not wield his veto pen on this promising legislation. We must put the health of the American people over politics. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is an issue that affects every family in America. I strongly urge my House colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN TO RELEASE DR. HALEH ESFANDIARI -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Tennessee (Mr. Tanner) for his leadership on the Foreign Affairs Committee and for our national security interests around the world, and I thank the chairman of the committee, Mr. Lantos, and the ranking member, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, for their bipartisan support in sending a strong message to the government of Iran that their actions are absolutely unacceptable and to pass this legislation to immediately and unconditionally release the Americans of Iranian descent that are being held by the government of Iran. 
   It was on May 30 of 2007, just a few weeks ago, the day after Washington and Tehran held their high profile talks with respect to Iraq that Iran turned around and charged three Iranian Americans, one academic, Haleh Esfandiari, a social scientist, Kian Tajbakhsh, and a journalist, Parnaz Azima, with spying, a charge which under Iran's Islamic law is punishable by death. 
   These trumped up charges are absolutely ridiculous. Haleh Esfandiari is a constituent of mine. She lives in Bethesda, Maryland. She is a 67-year-old Director of the Middle East program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Kian Tajbakhsh is a respected social scientist who is consulted by George Soros' Open Society Institute at the World Bank, and Parnaz Azima is a Radio Farda journalist. 
   The government of Iran accused these Iranian Americans of endangering state security and fomenting a, quote, soft revolution. These are ridiculous charges under any circumstances and clearly an excuse by Iran to once again take action in violation of international law. 
   Just to emphasize the point, Ms. Esfandiari is someone who has invited scholars and statesmen from Iran to the United States to conferences and events and has even been criticized by some members of the Iranian American community for being too soft on the current regime in Tehran. Mr. Tajbakhsh has consulted directly for the Iranian government and, working with the Open Society Institute, helped run its humanitarian health outreach program in Iran with full cooperation of the Iranian government. 
   The lists of foreign detainees doesn't stop there. Iranian American businessman Ali Shakeri, who is on the board of the University of California at Irvine's Center for Citizen Peacebuilding, was arrested on May 8 as he returned to the United States from visiting his ill mother, who died during his stay. 
   These detainees have dedicated their lives to building bridges between the Americans and the people of Iran. Their presence in Iran to visit their parents or to conduct humanitarian work poses absolutely no threat to the people or the government of Iran. 
   Their detention is a gross perversion of the rule of law. And the claim that  the Iranian government has made that they seek dialogue and improved relations with the West is belied by the actions they have taken with respect to these individuals. 
   So we call today upon the Iranian government to do as they say they want to do, which is to have a better relationship with the United States and the people of the United States and to immediately, unconditionally release these Americans.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Speaker, I rise in support of the second amendment to the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008. 
   Today, one quarter of subprime adjustable-rate mortgages are delinquent by 90 days or more. As a consequence, during 2007, foreclosure proceedings were initiated on about 1.5 million U.S. homes. The Federal Reserve has projected that the rate of foreclosures will grow even higher in 2008. 
   We know that many of these foreclosures are unavoidable. There are cases where investors choose foreclosure because a property's value has depreciated significantly, or a borrower's personal circumstances have changed. And, many times, as has recently become alarmingly prevalent, a borrower was put into a loan inappropriate for their circumstances. But, if a foreclosure is preventable, and the borrower wants to stay in the home, the economic argument for trying to avolid foreclosure is strong. 
   Foreclosures impose high legal and administrative costs. Foreclosures can destabilize communities, reduce area property values and lower municipal tax revenues. And, at the national level, foreclosures add to the stock of homes for sale, increasing downward pressure on home prices, which affects the broader economy. 
   In the past, mortgage defaults were usually triggered by a borrower's life event, such as the loss of a job, serious illness or injury, or divorce. But the widespread decline in home prices we are witnessing today is a relatively new phenomenon and lenders, servicers and policymakers will have to develop new strategies to meet this new challenge. 
   To be effective, our approach must closely target the borrowers at the highest risk of foreclosure while avoiding programs that give borrowers, who can make their payments, an incentive to default. 
   Th American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act will address these problems. The bill's second amendment contains several housing-related tax provisions recently reported by the Ways and Means Committee as part of the Housing Assistance Tax Act. 
   The amendment creates a refundable tax credit of up to $7,500 for first-time homebuyers that would serve as an interest-free loan, and provides an additional standard deduction in 2008 of up to $350 for individuals and $700 for couples for state and local property taxes. It authorizes an additional $10 billion in taxexempt bonds that would be used to refinance subprime loans, finance the construction of low-income rental housing, and support loans to first-time homebuyers. 
   To assist our men and women in uniform, many of whom have put themselves in harms way in service to their country, the amendment adds provisions from a measure approved by the Veterans Affairs Committee that extends to one year, from 90 days, the period following active duty service during which service members are protected from foreclosures. 
   This amendment will fully offset the cost of its tax provisions in two ways. First, by raising $8 billion through FY 2018 by requiring brokers to report their customer's basis in securities transactions, and second, by raising $3.2 billion through FY 2018 by delaying, until 2010, new rules allocating interest expenses between foreign and domestic sources. 
   Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand today in support of the second amendment to The American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008 and I urge my colleagues to join me.

   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1073 and the hard-working public servants it so deservedly recognizes today. 
   As the son of a career foreign service officer and a State Department analyst, public service--in all its forms--has always been a value in my family. Whether you're talking about soldiers putting themselves on the line for our nation, police and firefighters protecting our communities, scientists and researchers developing breakthrough medicines, or teachers and librarians educating our children, it should be clear to all who stop and think about it that America simply could not be its best without the ongoing courage, intelligence and efforts of its public servants. 
   That is why I believe so strongly in the enduring value of a robust, highly trained and dynamic civil service--and in pursuing public policies that can recruit and retain that kind of workforce. For me, that means pay parity for civil servants, a decent and dignified workplace across the government, genuinely fair rules for outsourcing competitions and benefit packages that will enable more of our best and brightest to pursue careers in public service over otherwise potentially more lucrative opportunities in the private sector. It also means generating a renewed sense of excitement and respect for public service careers in the culture. 
   Mr. Speaker, towards that end, I believe this resolution is well-deserved and a terrific place to start. I look forward to working more closely with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to put the spirit of today's resolution into action as we deliberate policy affecting our public servants throughout the rest of the year.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3773. This bill reestablishes the role of the Court into foreign surveillance if and when a U.S. person becomes a target of such surveillance. H.R. 3773 also authorizes the FISA court to review the ``minimization'' procedures used by intelligence agencies regarding the use of material that has been inadvertently intercepted. Moreover, this bill authorizes the FISA court to also review the ``targeting'' procedures that involve U.S. persons. Finally, the bill creates a commission to review the President's previous warrantless surveillance program and to report to Congress. It is important to note that H.R. 3773 contains no retroactive immunity for the telephone companies for their past accommodation to intercept the communications of U.S. persons without a court order. 
   After the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001, our security agencies worked to improve their intelligence operations to ensure that such a plot could never again be executed on U.S. soil. However, this Administration, rather than assessing the need to make adjustments to surveillance authorities, embarked upon an unauthorized secret program authorized by nothing more than Executive fiat and clearly outside of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA. The telecommunication industry was directed to comply with demands of the Administration with or without the requisite authority. Some telecommunications companies complied some did not. 
   Despite repeated requests from Democratic Members of Congress for the Administration to assess the limitations of the existing FISA law and to request necessary changes, the Administration refused to do so. Only after James Risen in 2006 exposed the fact that the Administration had been engaged in a massive domestic spying operation did the Administration begin to address the need to reconcile the program with some semblance of statutory authority. To that end, last summer the Administration identified a change in technology that warranted a change to the law. The change in the telecommunications industry has placed nodes and other technological backbones on U.S. soil regardless of the flow of information. Consequently, many foreign-to-foreign communications pass through the U.S. without involving U.S. persons. This technological ``touch down'' under existing law would require a court order and needed to be changed. 
   From that request for a technical change, the Administration, with the assistance of the Republicans in Congress, launched an initiative to virtually remove court orders for the surveillance of American persons. Moreover, the Administration launched an additional initiative to provide blanket retroactive immunity for all the phone companies and ISPs that intercepted communications in the absence of a legal authorization. This immunity was demanded without the disclosure of the acts that would be subject to such immunization. Currently, there are almost 40 lawsuits pending that have challenged the legality of the President's unauthorized surveillance program. 
   All of these past cynical efforts to engage in an illicit surveillance program have now transformed into a campaign to engage in a widespread cover-up of past illegalities. The Republicans and the President cloak their surreptitious activity in a cloak of national security. However, the American people know better. We all want to stop terrorism. We all agree that foreign-to-foreign communications should be intercepted without needing a court order. We all agree that merely because such a communication is transported through a device that sits on U.S. soil, it should not impose any impediment to the surveillance of these communications. Where we disagree is in the need to carry on an illegal program, to defy any accountability and then come to Congress to seek legislation that is purely designed to conceal wrongdoing. 
   The bill before us today accomplishes the following: 
   Provides for surveillance of terrorist and other targets overseas who may be communicating with Americans. 
   Requires the FISA court to approve targeting and minimization procedures--to ensure that Americans are not targeted and that their inadvertently intercepted communications are not disseminated. These procedures must be approved prior to surveillance beginning--except in an emergency, in which case the government may begin surveillance immediately, and the procedures must be approved by the court within 30 days. (This may be extended if the court determines it needs more time to decide the matter.)  
   Provides prospective liability protection for telecommunications companies that provide lawful assistance to the government. 
   Requires a court order based on probable cause to conduct surveillance targeted at Americans, whether inside the United States or abroad. 
   Requires an Inspector General report on the President's warrantless surveillance program. 
   Prohibits ``reverse targeting'' of Americans. 
   Explicitly establishes FISA Exclusivity--that FISA is the exclusive way to conduct foreign intelligence surveillance inside the U.S. Any other means requires an express statutory authorization. 
   Sunsets these authorities on December 31, 2009 (same as the PATRIOT Act sunset). 
   Moreover, this bill is as important for what it does not contain, i.e. retroactive immunity. This bill does provide telecom companies a way to present their defenses in secure proceedings in district court without the Administration using ``state secrets'' to block those defenses. Finally, this bill also establishes a bipartisan, National Commission--with subpoena power--to investigate and report to the American people on the Administration's warrantless surveillance activities, and to recommend procedures and protections for the future. 
   We all want to prevent the acts of terrorism. However, some of us believe that we can protect our Nation without throwing away all of the rules that have been designed to protect the Constitutional rights of Americans. The scare tactics that have been used by this Administration to further cloak their illegal programs are reprehensible. What is more is that these tactics are not even marginally credible. 
   The President's national security programs by and large have been a failure, his misadventure into Iraq on a quest for nonexistent weapons of mass destruction have led us on a path of a substantial loss of life, resources and moral standing in the world. Moreover, it has diverted our attention from those who did attack us on 9/11, Al-Qaeda and its Taliban allies who are regrouping and strengthening, according to declassified U.S. intelligence estimates, along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. In addition, the President's authorization to use torture on U.S. soil, as well as outsourcing it to foreign countries, by way of rendition, has compromised the security of our troops and diplomatic corps around the world. These practices have done much more to compromise our national security than to protect it. For these reasons, the President is not in a position to invoke national security on any grounds and certainly not to justify a warrantless domestic spying program and retroactive immunity for those who were complicit in this activity.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND MEDICARE PROTECTION ACT OF 2007--Continued -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the CHAMP Act, the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act. 
   The CHAMP Act reauthorizes and improves the very successful State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP. Created in 1997 by Congress with broad bipartisan support, the SCHIP program currently covers 6 million children who otherwise would have no access to health insurance. Despite its many successes, there are still more than five million children who are eligible for SCHIP, but not yet enrolled in the program. This bill seeks to cover those vulnerable children. 
   Unfortunately, President Bush's proposal seeks to turn back the clock and take us in the wrong direction. The President has proposed funding SCHIP at a rate that does not even take into account any increases for inflation or population growth. Under the President's proposal, more than 1.5 million children will lose SCHIP coverage and many States, including Maryland, will continue to face funding shortfalls. Indeed, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, CBO, has confirmed that the President's proposal would be too little to keep covering the children who are currently enrolled in SCHIP. 
   In contrast to President Bush's proposal, this bill will extend coverage to an additional 5 million children who are currently eligible for SCHIP but are not yet enrolled. I am also pleased that the bill provides for guaranteed dental coverage in SCHIP--good oral health care is integral to the health of children and no child should have to suffer because they cannot access adequate dental care. No family should have to suffer the loss of a child because they lack access to dental care, as happened in the tragic case of Deamonte Driver, a 12-year old Marylander who died earlier this year when an infection from an untreated abscessed tooth spread to his brain. I am also pleased that this bill provides important mental health coverage for children. 
   The reauthorization and improvement of SCHIP will benefit the approximately 136,000 children who are currently enrolled in Maryland's CHIP program and prevent Maryland from facing further funding shortfalls in its SCHIP allotment as has been the case in recent years. The CHAMP Act will also provide essential funding to Maryland to enroll 68,000 children in families with incomes under 200 percent of the federal poverty level who remain uninsured. It will also provide Maryland with a new option to cover more than 65,000 children who are aging out of Medicaid and SCHIP. And because of the bill, Maryland will have an increase in its SCHIP allotment of $99.7 million from last year, allowing it room to reach additional eligible but uninsured children. 
   Not so long ago, President Bush promised to expand coverage of SCHIP to include eligible children who are not yet enrolled. In his September 2004 speech to the Republican National Convention, the President stated--and I am quoting here, ``America's children must also have a healthy start in life. In the new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for the government's health insurance programs. We will not allow a lack of attention, or information, to stand between these children and the health care they need.'' 
   Now, the President has reversed course. In his July 10, 2007, speech in Cleveland, Ohio, he forgot his 2004 pledge and stated, ``I mean, people have access to health care in America. After all, you just go to an emergency room.''  
   I hope the President will reconsider his position and help Congress provide health insurance to 11 million children who are one of the most vulnerable segments of our society. 
   In addition to reauthorizing SCHIP, the CHAMP Act makes improvements in Medicare that will strengthen that important program. The legislation reduces overpayments to Medicare Advantage plans, which are paid, according to non-partisan CBO and other independent entities analysis, on average, 12 percent more than the cost of care in traditional Medicare. This will increase Medicare's solvency by two years. In addition, the legislation prevents the impending physician reimbursement cuts and provides positive updates in 2008 and 2009. Also, the bill will increase Medicare beneficiaries' access to preventive services by eliminating co-payments and deductibles for current and future preventive benefits and authorizing Medicare to add additional preventive services. 
   The CHAMP Act also increases the tobacco tax by 45 cents to a total of 84 cents. Increasing the tobacco tax will save billions in health costs and is one of the most effective ways to reduce tobacco use, especially among children. In short, raising the tobacco tax will prevent thousands of children from starting to smoke and the proceeds of the tax will be used to expand health coverage for children. That is a win-win result. 
   Mr. Speaker, the clock is ticking. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this much needed legislation.

   Head Start has been improving lives and increasing opportunities for children and families for more than 40 years. With this important program, we teach our children that they can succeed, regardless of background or family income. We open doors to millions and prepare them for future success in school and careers. 
   This bill provides much-needed amendments to Head Start that will improve workforce quality by increasing funding for staff salaries and professional development, and enhance coordination between early education and primary schools. It also strengthens standards and accountability to ensure that our children are getting the best quality care and education. 
   I am also pleased that this House defeated a divisive and misguided motion that would, for the first time, legitimize publicly funded religious discrimination in the Head Start program. It would have given taxpayer money to Head Start centers and allow those centers to exclude taxpayers from jobs solely on the basis of their religious beliefs. It would be a green light for religious bigotry. Its passage would have been bad for education and bad for religion and I joined the National Head Start Association, the Interfaith Alliance, and countless other secular and religious advocates of the Head Start Program in opposing it. I am glad that we have a clean bill to pass today. 
   I also urge my colleagues to not only vote for this bill, but to continue to advocate for Head Start by supporting full funding for the program. It is not enough to pass the legislation--we need to give our communities the resources they need to carry out our mandates. 
   I thank Chairman Miller, Chairman Kildee and the Committee on Education and Labor for their work on this important legislation, and urge its final passage today.

   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 3406, the ADA Amendments Act of 2008. This bipartisan legislation, which will restore the original intent of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, is long overdue. 
   The passage of the ADA in 1990 helped millions of Americans with disabilities succeed in life and the workplace by making essential services that most Americans take for granted more accessible to individuals with disabilities. It was truly a landmark civil rights law to ensure that people with disabilities have protection from discrimination in the same manner as individuals are protected from discrimination on the basis of race, gender, national origin, religion, or age. 
   In recent years, the Federal courts have erroneously eroded the protections for individuals under the ADA, which has created a new set of barriers for those with disabilities. This bill rejects the courts' narrow interpretation of the definition of disability, and makes it absolutely clear that the ADA is intended to provide broad coverage to protect anyone who faces discrimination on the basis of disability. It strikes a careful balance between the needs of individuals with disabilities and realities confronted by employers. 
   Madam Speaker, the Congress is taking an important step towards restoring the original intent of the ADA. By doing so, we will help ensure that Americans with disabilities can lead independent and self-sufficient lives. I urge my colleagues to support this much-needed legislation.

   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Senate amendment to H.R. 493, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. 
   This bipartisan legislation is long overdue. Recent scientific breakthroughs in sequencing the human genetic code have already transformed the battle against a broad range of medical conditions. Scientists have now identified genetic markers for a variety of chronic health conditions which will increase the potential for early treatment and prevention. However, as much as these advances will improve health care delivery in this country, it has increased the potential for employers and insurers to discriminate based on an individual's genetic makeup. Such a threat deters the public and science from taking full advantage of the life-saving and cost-saving potential of genetic research. 
   That why we need to pass this much-needed bill. Discriminating against someone because of their DNA is simply unacceptable. Mr. Speaker, I urge colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation so that Americans do not have to live in fear of losing their job or health insurance because of their genetic predisposition towards certain medical conditions.

   With gas prices now more than twice as high as they were the day President Bush took office, the American people can simply not afford a continuation of those failed policies that brought us to this point. They're looking to us to take specific steps towards strengthening our national security by reducing our dependence on foreign oil, cleaning up our environment, and creating millions of good-paying green collar jobs and saving on their costs at the pump. 
   Now the energy bill that this Congress passed last session was a very important step in the right direction. We improved automobile efficiency standards and provided greater incentives to renewable fuels and new economy-wide efficiency standards, and that will help ease the demand for fossil fuels and spur important energy alternatives. 
   However, we left a very important piece of that on the table because Senate Republicans and the White House refused to accept a very simple proposition. We want to take the $14 billion in taxpayer subsidies that the Bush administration and the earlier Congress gave the oil and gas companies and we say let's reinvest them in a new energy strategy that focuses on renewable energy and energy efficiency. And now on the other side they say no, we don't want to make that choice. We think the taxpayers, all of us and all the people around this country, should continue to subsidize oil and gas companies that are making record profits rather than making this choice. 
   Well, that's what this bill is about: let's make a choice. Let's use those resources to invest in over $8 billion in electricity generated from clean, homegrown renewable sources. Let's expand production of homegrown fuels like cellulosic ethanol and renewable biodiesel so that we can reduce our dependence on foreign oil. And let's empower consumers interested in being part of the solution by incentivizing the purchase of energy-efficient appliances and advanced plug-in hybrid vehicles. 
   There is a whole new energy frontier out there for us to seize upon if only we will make the right choices. And instead of looking backwards and continuing to subsidize companies with the hard-earned dollars of the American people, let's instead invest in an energy future that puts millions of people back to work in green technologies, that advances our national security interests by reducing our reliance on foreign oil, and which addresses major environmental concerns that we all face with respect to climate change. 
   That is the fundamental question at stake today. Let's make the right choice. Let's make a choice that the people's House can be proud of and support the American consumer and the American people, and not the special interests.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (NATIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST FUND ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chairman, first let me thank Chairman Frank and Subcommittee Chair Waters for their work on this important, bipartisan bill. 
   The National Affordable Housing Trust Fund will help provide funding for low-income families who, absent this assistance, may not be able to afford their own home. There are many dedicated Government agencies, non-profits, for-profits and community and faith-based organizations who will seek to participate in this important program. 
   To ensure that the most productive housing projects are funded--projects dedicated to funding sustainable, successful programs--I am proposing an amendment to introduce a measure of longer term accountability to the trust fund application process. 
   This bill establishes two levels of applicant-centered accountability: 
   A trust fund applicant must describe the types of projects he intends to support and must establish performance goals, benchmarks and timetables to help measure the projects' success--later, the applicant must produce a report describing the progress of those projects during that fiscal year. 
   Because the applicant is only required to report on his projects for that year, this process, despite its commonsense ambitions--effectively breaks the chain of accountability between the grantee and his projects at the end of the fiscal year. 
   This amendment will maintain that chain of accountability by requiring that any previous grantee who seeks funding from the Affordable Housing Trust Fund provide as part of his application a progress report on the previous projects funded by his organization with funds from this trust fund. 
   The Affordable Housing Trust Fund will produce billions of dollars worth of grants. HUD does not have the resources to monitor all the projects funded with these funds. The government will therefore have to rely on grantees to shoulder part of the burden. When grantees return for additional assistance each year, they will be required to update HUD on the success of their previous trust-funded projects. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support my amendment and help ensure that the real beneficiaries of this important program are the low-income families it was created to help.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (TAX COLLECTION RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from North Dakota for his long-time efforts on behalf of fair treatment for taxpayers in this country. I rise in strong support of this legislation, the Tax Collection Responsibility Act of 2007. 
   In addition to endorsing the practices that this bill provides for better collection and fairer collection for small businesses, I also believe it is high time we repeal an abusive and misguided debt collection program at the IRS. I am pleased to have worked on this issue for a number of years with my colleague from New Jersey (Mr. Rothman) and others. 
   I think we all know that it is not a new issue to this body. We tried private tax collection in 1996 and promptly abandoned it a year later, after which time the IRS Office of Inspector General found that private contractors regularly violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, jeopardized the confidentiality of taxpayers personal information, and cost the government a net revenue loss of $17 million. 
   Under the Republican Congress, this program was revived and came to the floor actually in a form that we did not have a chance to vote separately on it, because when the House has had an opportunity over the last 3 years to vote separately on this issue, this body on a bipartisan basis has said no to private debt collection. That bill never made it to the President's desk. But there is a good reason this House has said no to this program. That is because IRS officials themselves have acknowledged that using private debt collectors is much more expensive than having the IRS do the job. Today on the program that we are talking about, the IRS has spent $71 million and collected a net of $20 million. That is a losing proposition on its face. 
   Moreover, in her testimony before the Ways and Means Committee, the National Taxpayer Advocate, Nina Olson, whose job at the IRS is to look out for the fair treatment of taxpayers, recommended that we end this program and further pointed out, as others have said, that if you took the same amount of money and invested it in allowing IRS agents to collect the revenue, you would collect $1.4 billion instead of the $20 million collected so far in this program. 
   In addition, and I think this is an important point to make, when this Congress in the 1990s passed the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act, we specifically said that our public employees, our IRS agents, could not receive bonuses, could not receive special rewards for collecting more taxes because we want to avoid an incentive for abuse; yet that is exactly the premise this entire program is based on. It is based on bigger rewards in the sense for more taxes collected. That is what leads in turn to abusive tax practices that we have said we don't want our IRS agents to comply. In addition to the fact, the result is for every dollar collected under the private tax collection, 25 cents goes to a private company; whereas, with IRS agents, that dollar collected goes to the Federal Treasury for debt reduction and for investment in important public purposes. So it is a much better return for the taxpayer. 
   I would argue, Mr. Speaker, that it is very clear over the years that our repeated experiments in private debt collection have failed. If the IRS needs additional resources to collect uncollected revenues, and I think it does, we have heard from the IRS Commissioners in Republican and Democratic administrations alike, that a much better investment is to put those dollars into our public IRS agents. It results in less abusive practices. It makes sure that you also have the dollars come back where it belongs to the taxpayer and the public benefit.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 6599, a bill to fund U.S. military construction and maintenance and the operations of the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
   The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill appropriates a total of $118.7 billion  for military construction and veterans' programs, $10.3 billion more than the current level and $3.4 billion more than the President's request. This funding will provide compensation payments to millions of veterans and their survivors, pension payments and financial assistance to their widows and children, and is the primary support for their military related medical care. 
   The Veterans Department oversees the largest Federal medical care delivery system in the country, with 153 hospitals, 50 residential rehabilitation treatment centers, 135 nursing homes, and 1,089 outpatient clinics. The almost $94 billion set aside in this bill is a significant increase over the Administration's request and will help fund medical administration, operations and maintenance of medical facilities such as Walter Reed, and important medical, trauma and mental health research. This bill also provides the funding for the BRAC. 
   We all know there is a massive military base closure and realignment underway in this country. The potential for increased traffic congestion at these new military facilities, such as the one being constructed in my district in Bethesda, MD, can be disruptive for the citizens who currently live in these communities. I want to thank the Committee for working with me to insert language in this bill directing the Department of Defense to aggressively plan and budget for the Defense Access Roads programs that should help alleviate some of the pressure on the communities that are dealing with BRAC. 
   This nation has 23,500,000 veterans and 35,900,000 family members of living veterans and survivors of deceased veterans. That means close to 20 percent of this county's total population are potential recipients of veterans benefits. We have a responsibility to support the past and present servicemembers and their families who have served and sacrificed for us. Providing quality healthcare and decent living conditions for them and their families is the least we can do for these brave men and women. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this important piece of legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4137, HIGHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. I thank the Conferees for their work on this issue, and especially commend Chairmen Miller and Kennedy, Ranking Members McKeon and Enzi, and Senator Mikulski for their efforts in bringing this bipartisan legislation to the Floor today. 
   Mr. Speaker, 60 percent of new jobs require some post-secondary education. But paying for college can be a real challenge for many students and their families. In order to maintain America's competitive advantage, spur economic development, and fulfill the potential of our Nation's students, we must make college affordability and accessibility a priority. 
   This Congress has responded to that challenge. Beginning last year with the largest increase in student assistance since the G.I. Bill, we have worked to open the door to college for our Nation's best and brightest. And today, we continue that commitment. 
   The bill increases the maximum Pell grant again to $6,000 for 2009 and $8,000 for 2014. It also allows for year-round Pell grants to give students more options and allow them to complete their degrees earlier. 
   It furthers our ambitious Competitiveness Agenda by creating programs to recruit new science and technology teachers and collaborate with the business community to improve science, technology, engineering, math, and foreign language education. These important provisions will help ensure American innovation in the competitive global economy. 
   The Conference Report before us today aims to provide more transparency and clarity in the financial aid process by simplifying the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, creating a user-friendly website to centralize information about schools and costs, and ensuring that students and parents get easy-to-understand information about the terms and conditions of Federal and private loans. It also includes provisions to require schools and lenders to adopt strict codes of conduct to avoid conflicts of interest and protect students from aggressive lending practices. 
   Finally, the Conference Report includes provisions from the Teach for America Act, a bill I introduced with Mr. Castle, Ms. DeLauro, Mr. Regula, and Mr. Sarbanes. These provisions will allow Teach for America to expand its reach and put more qualified and enthusiastic teachers in our Nation's classrooms. 
   Mr. Speaker, today's bill will increase transparency, simplify the financial aid process, and make higher education more affordable. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it today.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Paycheck Fairness Act--for the basic promise of equality it upholds for America's women and the faith it keeps with the best of who we are as a nation. 
   The Equal Pay Act was passed in 1963 to enshrine into law the basic principle of equal pay for equal work. 
   Forty-five years later, we are here today because American women still only make $.77 cents for every dollar a male counterpart earns when performing equal work. Worse, African-American women earn only $.66 on the dollar, and Hispanic women a mere $.55. 
   This continued and persistent wage gap between men and women cannot be explained by differences in education, qualifications or experience. It is both unacceptable and un-American. And it must stop. 
   The Paycheck Fairness Act will move us towards our ultimate goal of eliminating wage disparity in the United States by clarifying that any employer's decision to pay a male employee more than a female employee must not be based on gender, must be job-related and must be consistent with business necessity. To avoid a repeat of the facts presented to the Supreme Court in the Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber case, this legislation also prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who discuss or disclose salary information with co-workers. And it strengthens the remedies made available to women who have been subjected to gender-based wage discrimination. 
   Mr. Chairman, in closing, I want to recognize my good friend and colleague Rosa DeLauro for her tireless leadership on this legislation. We owe it to our mothers, wives, sisters and daughters to pass it without delay.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (CHESAPEAKE BAY GATEWAYS AND WATERTRAILS NETWORK CONTINUING AUTHORIZATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by commending my colleague from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes) for taking the initiative on this important piece of legislation and for all his leadership in our effort to clean up the Chesapeake Bay and to Mr. Wittman for joining him in this bipartisan effort. 
   Before I say a few words about this bill, I do think it's important to point out that this body has now passed numerous pieces of legislation to try to address the energy crisis and the rise in gas prices around this country, including legislation to reduce our dependence on foreign oil by diversifying our energy portfolio. One of the things we passed out of this body to do that was to say we shouldn't be giving taxpayer subsidies, giveaways, to the oil and gas industry at a time when they're already making record profits and Americans are facing record prices at the pump. We should instead be using those resources to invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency. That's the direction this country needs to go. 
   The President was in Saudi Arabia recently having tea with the leaders of the Saudi Royal Family asking them to reduce prices. They said no. We need a long-term strategy. We passed that out of this House, and, unfortunately, the President said he's going to veto it  because he wants to keep giving those subsidies to the oil and gas industry rather than taking a new and different approach to our energy crisis. That's what this House did. Unfortunately, the President continues to block those efforts. 
   Now, we do need, as a country, to protect our beautiful and vital natural resources like the Chesapeake Bay. The Chesapeake Bay, as my colleague Mr. Sarbanes has pointed out, is the Nation's largest estuary. It is a national treasure; it's a natural treasure. And that's what this bill is about because the Chesapeake Bay is currently under assault from a whole host of sources of pollution. Point sources of pollution like the kind of pollution that comes out of a sewage pipe when it's not being adequately treated before it gets into the tributaries, like the Potomac River, the Anacostia River, the Susquehanna River; and nonpoint sources of pollution, the kind of pollution that washes off our driveways from oil dripping from cars or the pollution that comes off of fields that are under agricultural production. 
   Now, not long ago we passed in this legislature, in this Congress, the farm bill, and that farm bill provided vital additional help to our farmers, who are good stewards of our land. It provided them with vital new tools to help prevent that kind of nonpoint source pollution. And that will give them a vital boost in the years ahead in our effort to clean up the Chesapeake Bay and meet the goals that have been set. 
   But the other key element to sustain that support is to engage the public. And we mean not just the Department of Agriculture but the other departments and agencies of the United States Government like the Department of Interior and the National Park Service, who has played such an important role in raising the understanding of the public that we all need to be part of this effort to clean up the Chesapeake Bay. 
   In our State of Maryland, when you go down your roads and you see the systems where the water dumps into the pipes to take it out to rivers, it says this drains into the Chesapeake Bay. We have done a good job of trying to raise that public support. But this system, this whole effort, the Gateways effort that we are talking about in this bill, has also been a vital component of that to let people know what the Chesapeake Bay means to our region and to our country. 
   And it would be very shortsighted to end this program. What we need to do instead is to say, as has been said by others, that this program has worked in raising that public awareness, enlisting the support of students and adults, young children and senior citizens in this big effort to protect this vital estuary. And this Gateways program has been a very important component in that effort. We need to keep it going, and we need to make it permanent. 
   I salute my colleague from Maryland, JOHN SARBANES, for his tremendous effort in this region and for reaching out and making this a bipartisan effort along with Mr. Wittman, and I urge adoption of this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (TAXPAYER ASSISTANCE AND SIMPLIFICATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I thank my colleague from Georgia and thank him for his leadership on this important issue. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation, the Taxpayer Assistance and Simplification Act. It's a set of commonsense reforms designed to make the Tax Code a little more consumer friendly for hardworking Americans. 
   If the IRS has reason to believe that you've been a victim of identity theft, this bill says the IRS should let you know. 
   If you're entitled to an unclaimed refund, this bill empowers the IRS to do more to find you. 
   And if you need help with your taxes, this bill lets the IRS refer you to a qualified taxpayer clinic that can provide assistance. 
   So whether it's from eliminating nuisance paperwork to publicizing the earned income tax credit to clamping down on predatory ``refund anticipation loans,'' this bill, time and again, sides with the taxpayer. 
   I'm particularly pleased that it includes legislation many of us have worked on to end the practice of bounty hunting and terminate the program of contracting out the collection of taxes to private debt collectors. 
   Proponents of this program say it's necessary to close the tax gap. The facts just say they're wrong. The program, to date, hasn't returned a single dime of additional revenue to the U.S. Treasury. In fact, so far as we gather here today, it's been a revenue loser, an ideological driven black hole that has sucked $50 million out of the Treasury last year alone. And we would have been able to raise, and this is according to both Republican and IRS commissioners, we would have been able to raise $1.4 billion in revenue from people who hadn't paid taxes if we'd simply hired more IRS agents to do the job. And that's also the testimony of the National Taxpayer Advocate at the Department of Treasury. That's the person whose job it is to look out for the taxpayers, and she testified this is a bad deal for taxpayers. We should get rid of it. 
   And we shouldn't be surprised. We had a similar program in the 1990s that was ended because of abusive practices, and it failed to collect the money. Let's learn from history. Let's adopt this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from New York for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, the President says send him the money. Let's be clear. This bill provides every penny the President asked for to fund the troops in Iraq. It also provides for something the President did not ask for: funds to help improve the treatment of our wounded soldiers at Walter Reed and other places around this country. 
   It also provides something that the American people have now insisted on but the White House doesn't ask for, and that is accountability with respect to the war in Iraq. That is why the President doesn't like the bill before us. We know the White House has become an accountability-free zone. The White House got used to a Congress, the old Republican Congress, that gave the President a blank check, money without accountability. And this provides funding with accountability. That is why they don't like it. 
   Let us be very clear. If the President vetoes this bill, he will be saying ``no'' to ensuring that our troops have the training and equipment that they need. If he vetoes this bill, he will saying ``no'' to ensuring that we hold the Iraqi Government accountable to the benchmarks which the Bush administration and the Iraqi Government have said are absolutely necessary to achieve political stability in Iraq. If he vetoes this bill, he will be saying ``no'' to those additional funds for our wounded soldiers at Walter Reed and for our veterans health care system. 
   He will also be saying ``no'' to the additional funds that we put in this bill to the fight against al Qaeda in Afghanistan. Here we are so many years after the attacks of September 11, 2001. Al Qaeda remains a vibrant organization and Osama bin Laden remains at large; we provide funds to go after Osama bin Laden, additional funds; the President will be saying ``no'' to that. 
   And the President, if he vetoes this bill, will be saying ``no'' to the overwhelming sentiment of the American people who understand the failed policy and say we need to change direction. 
   Let's change direction. Let's say ``yes'' to this conference committee report.

   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I thank my colleague, the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Davis, for all he has done to support Federal employees and workers around this country. 
   Congratulations to Congresswoman Maloney for her leadership on this issue over many years. And congratulations on bringing this bill to the floor today. And to the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Waxman, thank you for all your efforts as well. 
   I want to join my colleague, the majority leader, STENY HOYER, in also commending our colleagues from the Virginia side of the river, Mr. TOM DAVIS, who's on the floor, as well as Congressman FRANK WOLF. We've all worked very well together on issues supporting Federal employees and trying to make the Federal Government a model employer, an employer we can be proud of, and someone that tries to set the standard, rather than bring up the rear when it comes to policies for employees and the workforce. 
   As I think people understand, we are going to face a severe shortage of Federal workers going into the future. Indeed, over the next 5 years, nearly a third of the 1.6 million boomer age members of the Federal workforce are expected to retire. We're going to need hundreds of thousands of new workers to replace those departing Federal employees, and it's going to be essential that we attract new, young workers into the Federal workforce in order to continue the job that they need to do for the American people. And that's one of the reasons why this is an important measure that we need to follow up on. 
   This is a benefit that is currently enjoyed by employees of most of the Fortune 100 companies today, so we are playing catch-up here at the Federal Government level. We are trying to compete with those in the private sector that are saying to young people, come work for us because we're going to provide you a benefit that doesn't require you to choose between taking a little bit of time to care for your newborn child, and getting a paycheck to help pay for your mortgage or for your rent or putting food on your table. And we think that it's important that people not have to make that choice. So yes, this is a very family-oriented, family-friendly measure. 
   Don't let anybody kid you, because we don't want people applying to the Federal Government to have to say, well, I'm not going to join because I'm going to be losing money to stay home for a short period of time to take care of a newborn child. I can go work at one of those other companies. 
   This is a time when we need more folks working in the Federal Government on critical issues like homeland security, like defense, like medical research. We need to replace those individuals who are leaving so that we can make sure that we have a vibrant Federal Government that can address the needs that we've asked of our Federal employees. 
   I congratulate, again, Congresswoman Maloney, the chairman of the subcommittee, chairman of the full committee. And I urge my colleagues to adopt what is a very family-friendly measure. We should be leading by example at the Federal level.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, this Emergency Supplemental bill presents the House with two very distinct amendments--and two very separate decisions. 
   The first amendment we are being asked to consider would provide $165.4 billion for the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. My position on the war in Iraq is clear. I believe the decision to invade Iraq was a mistake. And I simply cannot support giving this President a blank check to further mishandle our involvement in Iraq. Because this amendment does not include the conditions that were contained in the bill that the House passed, I will be voting no on this portion of the Supplemental today. 
   While I oppose this war, I have nothing but admiration and gratitude for our fellow citizens who choose to serve this Nation in uniform. It is in large measure because of my respect for their honorable service that I will be proud to support the second amendment before us today. 
   A centerpiece of this second amendment is a GI Bill for the 21st century. Just as a grateful Nation expanded opportunities for GIs returning home from World War II over 60 years ago, so now must our generation invest in our soldiers returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan so that they can get a 4-year college education. We have an obligation to invest in their future. 
   With the Nation's economy slowing, and our unemployment rate on the rise, this second amendment also appropriately includes a 13-week extension in unemployment benefits to sustain our fellow citizens and their families as they continue to look for work. 
   I am particularly pleased that this amendment places a moratorium on six Medicaid regulations that had threatened to cut needed services to those who rely on them--and that we have moved quickly to provide over $2.65 billion in disaster relief to assist in the recovery efforts after the tornadoes and flooding in the Midwest. 
   Finally, we can be proud that this amendment invests $550 million in critical scientific research to expand our medical knowledge, improve our energy efficiency and enhance our global competitiveness--including a $150 million investment in the National Institutes of Health (NIH), $150 million for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), $62.5 million for the Department of Energy's Office of Science, $62.5 million for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and $62.5 million for the National Science Foundation (NSF). 
   For these reasons, this second amendment is exceptionally worthy of our support,

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING WITHHOLDING OF INFORMATION RELATING TO CORRUPTION IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, the chairman of the committee (Mr. Waxman) for his important work in this area and moving the committee to take a look at this. 
   Look, the question is why does the Bush administration not want us to see this information about corruption in the Iraqi Government. One thing is clear, it is not that we are hiding something from the Iraqis that they don't already know. They know about the problem. In fact, we had Judge Radhi from the Iraqi Government who had been thrown out of his job because he was uncovering corruption testify. 
   So if it is not the Iraqis we are trying to shield this information from, why is it? It is pretty clear that the administration doesn't want the American people to hear it. I think they are finally  understanding that their position is untenable. 
   Just yesterday the State Department sent a letter saying: ``There is no Department `directive' prohibiting officials from providing Congress any information relating to corruption in Iraq.'' That is just flatly false. In fact, we have a copy of the directive right here. 
   Before the committee began its hearings, we asked for some State Department officials to come before the committee and talk about corruption issues. Well, the night before they came before the Oversight Committee, they were given this directive. Here is what it says. These are the areas which are red lined. That means these are the topics that they are not allowed to talk about in public: ``Broad statements/assessments which judge or characterize the quality of Iraqi governance or the ability/determination of the Iraqi Government to deal with corruption, including allegations that investigations were thwarted/stifled for political purposes,'' and it goes on. 
   It is very clear that the State Department did not want their representatives coming before the committee to tell the truth about Iraqi corruption. And since then, when their officials actually came before the committee during the hearings, they refused to answer questions, the broadest kind of questions. 
   Let me give you an example of questions that Ambassador Lawrence Butler, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, said he couldn't answer: whether ``the Government of Iraq currently has the political will or capability to root out corruption within its government.'' 
   That's an important question for the American people. 
   Also: ``whether the Maliki government is working hard to improve the corruption situation so that he can unite his country.'' 
   Another question that was put to the State Department representative by the committee: whether Prime Minister Maliki ``obstructed any anticorruption investigations in Iraq to protect his political allies.'' These are important questions to answer for the American people. These are questions that go to the heart of whether or not the policy in Iraq is succeeding or failing. They go to the heart of the question about whether the billions of dollars that taxpayers in this country have put into Iraq are being put to good use or whether they are squandered through waste, abuse, and corruption. 
   This resolution simply says let's not play games here. Let's not play games with the truth. Let's not try to hide the facts from the American people. The people of Iraq know well the problems they have with respect to corruption. In fact, some of their leaders have put their lives on the line and have had to flee Iraq when the government said they were getting too close to the truth. 
   But the people here need to know the truth, and the State Department and the Bush administration should not be using games to try and hide the facts and hide the truth from the American people on a very important issue.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND JOB CREATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I thank the gentleman. 
   This bill continues the new Congress' steadfast commitment to driving a clean energy revolution in our country and stimulating near-term growth in our struggling economy. 
   Gas prices are up around $4 a gallon. Climate change is a clear and present  danger. We need to wean ourselves off of largely imported foreign sources of fossil fuel. This bill charts that new course, the right course. It provides critical incentives for accelerated energy production from wind, geothermal, and hydropower sources. It includes investment tax credits for solar and fuel cell properties and a number of other factors. 
   To give our economy a boost, the legislation extends pro-growth policies like the R&D tax credit, and cuts taxes for millions of middle class families through a host of provisions including the expanded child tax credit. Mr. Speaker, this is a pro-growth, pro-environment, forward-looking and fully paid for package that helps move our country in a new direction. 
   Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to resist change. They had a monopoly on power in Washington for 6 years and did nothing. Now they have become the party of ``no,'' veto, and the status quo. Let's move in a new direction.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL CYSTIC FIBROSIS AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Congressional Cystic Fibrosis Caucus, I rise in strong support of H.. Con. Res. 299, which supports the goals and ideals of National Cystic Fibrosis Awareness Month. 
   According to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, which is located in my congressional district in Bethesda, Maryland, more than 30,000 Americans suffer from cystic fibrosis. Approximately 1,000 new cases of cystic fibrosis are diagnosed each year. It is an inherited chronic disease that causes thick mucus to build up in the lungs and other organs, causing life-threatening lung infections and serious digestive complications. 
   We have made significant progress in fighting cystic fibrosis, but there is still much more to do. In the 1950s, few children with cystic fibrosis were expected to live to attend elementary school. Today, thanks to past funding of cystic fibrosis research, people with cystic fibrosis can expect to live into their thirties and forties. While that figure is still unacceptably low, it is cause for hope for those living with the disease and their families. We must continue to fund cystic fibrosis research at the National Institutes of Health so that new treatments and, hopefully, a cure, can be developed in which people with cystic fibrosis can live a normal life expectancy. And we must continue to raise public awareness and education about cystic fibrosis, and to increase support for those affected by the disease. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a cosponsor of this resolution, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of overriding the President's veto of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008. 
   It is very unfortunate that the President has sided with the interests of certain big insurance companies against the health care needs of seniors. There are a number of important provisions in this legislation that will benefit more than forty-four million Medicare beneficiaries by preserving patient access to physicians, enhancing preventive and mental health benefits in the Medicare program, extending expiring provisions for rural and other providers, and improving assistance for low-income seniors. Unlike the President, Congress has put aside party politics and is protecting and preserving the health care that seniors depend on. 
   Madam Speaker, this is an issue that affects all Americans. I strongly urge my House colleagues to override the President's veto on this bipartisan legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support these important bills--the 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act and the Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Research Act--and to keep our Nation competitive in an era of global economic and scientific competition. 
   Now, more than ever, we must ensure that America remains at the forefront of discovery and innovation. To do that, we must engage our young people and encourage more of them to pursue careers in science, math, and engineering. These two bills accomplish that by fostering student potential in K-12 classrooms and by investing in long-term scientific research to keep more young scientists in our Nation's laboratories. 
   The 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science Math Scholarship Act would increase the number of scholarships for students majoring in the field of science, technology, engineering, and math who want to teach and would strengthen the skills of current STEM teachers by expanding professional development. These teachers would be better equipped to excite and engage students in math and science. 
   The Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Research Act would increase our investment in long-term scientific research and provide grants to young researchers. It would encourage our brightest young minds to think innovatively and push the boundaries of current research. Also, it will encourage young scientists to continue their study in U.S. institutions. 
   Mr. Chairman, these bills will help stimulate exciting research and increase the number of students entering the fields of math and science. They are an essential part of our competitiveness agenda, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for them today.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (PROTECTING THE MEDICAID SAFETY NET ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Protecting the Medicaid Safety Net Act of 2008. 
   Since its inception, Medicaid has been a joint State and Federal partnership to provide health care to the country's neediest and most vulnerable populations. Unfortunately, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, recently issued a series of Medicaid regulations that will significantly shift costs to States and restrict services to needy individuals. These regulations will force States to stop providing beneficiaries access to certain Medicaid services. 
   Among the damaging Medicaid regulations issued by CMS, I am especially concerned about the restrictive rules on targeted case management services that help people with disabilities remain in their community. Nearly 200,000 people in Maryland receive some type of Medicaid case management services, and these new rules will put more than $60 million in Federal funds for Maryland at risk. CMS also proposes to eliminate or severely restrict Federal Medicaid funding for rehabilitation services, graduate medical education, hospital outpatient services, safety net institutions, and school-based transportation and outreach programs. While CMS claims that the elimination of $20 billion in Federal Medicaid funding will create efficiencies in the program, it did not consult with Congress on these far reaching regulations. 
   With so many States, including Maryland, facing huge budget shortfalls and trying to figure out how to provide Medicaid services to their populations, now is not the time for the Federal Government to cut back on its share of funding. The legislation before us today would delay implementation of the regulations put forth by CMS so that Congress can examine their full impact. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have a responsibility and an obligation to our vulnerable citizens--low-income children, the disabled, and the elderly--to effectively provide access to adequate and quality health care services. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE MODERN STATE OF ISRAEL -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I thank the gentleman and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee and congratulate him on his leadership along with the ranking member. 
   Mr. Speaker, this year on May 14 we will mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the State of Israel. We will also celebrate the strong bonds of friendship and cooperation between the United States and Israel. Our country, under the leadership of President Harry Truman, was the first country to recognize the State of Israel. And he later said, ``I had faith in Israel before it was established. I have faith in it now. I believe it has a glorious future before it, not just as another sovereign nation but as the embodiment of the great ideals of our civilization.'' We need to maintain the special relationship we have with Israel based on shared values, common strategic interests, and moral bonds of friendship. Today, we honor not only that country's independence but the significance of what Israel stands for. 
   It represents the centuries-long yearnings of the Jewish people for a homeland of their own in the land of their forebears. The pogroms in tsarist Russia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and the Holocaust under the Nazi regime in the 1930s and 1940s made the idea of a Jewish people having a State of their own where they could feel secure and never again be subjected to such horrors and brutality even more compelling and necessary. 
   After many years of struggle, Israel emerged as an independent state. It gave refuge to tens of thousands of Holocaust survivors, many of whom had been languishing in temporary resettlement camps in Europe. The new State of Israel also became the home for Jews from scores of countries around the world. In a very short period of time, Israel developed a strong economy, became one of the leading countries within the world in terms of development, of scientific technology, and academic learning. 
   Since its creation, Israel has continually confronted hostile forces that threaten its existence, and the United States must remain steadfast in ensuring the security of Israel. 
   With the assistance of the United States, Israel was able to achieve peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan in the 1970s and 1990s, respectively. These agreements made Israel more secure and greatly lessened the chances for another Arab-Israeli war with those two countries. However, peace negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians, and friendly relations with its other neighbors, have proved to be more difficult. 
   It is my sincere wish that such negotiations will succeed, and that the Israeli people and all peoples of that troubled region will be able to live in a lasting peace. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope that all Americans will join me in congratulating the citizens of Israel and the entire Jewish community on the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the State of Israel.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (EARTH DAY -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1117 to celebrate the 28'' Anniversary of Earth Day, take stock of the progress that has already been made, and recommit ourselves with a sense of focus and urgency to the work that remains to be done. 
   We have come a long way since Senator Gaylord Nelson and Dennis Hayes organized their nationwide grassroots demonstration on behalf of the environment in the Spring of 1970. In the years that followed, Congress established the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; enacted the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act; and strengthened the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, among other critical initiatives. 
   To a large extent, these steps--and other like them--continue to form the foundation of our environmental laws in the United States. Unfortunately, recent years have witnessed an erosion to this foundation as regulatory agencies shirked their responsibility to enforce the law and existing statutes failed to keep pace with the magnitude of the environmental challenges we are confronting in the 25th century. 
   The New Direction Congress has now begun the necessary process of reversing that erosion and establishing a new baseline of federal commitment to stewardship from which the next chapter in American environmental leadership will be written. For the first time in over 30 years, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 increased the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standard for automobiles to 35 mpg by 2020. In combination with the economy-wide energy efficiency standards in the legislation, this step will reduce oil consumption by 2.4 million barrels a day--for a more than 25 percent reduction over today's usage--and save 5.3 billion metric tons in energy-related CO  
   2 emissions by 2030. It's important. But it's just a start. 
   We must move decisively to enact an economy-wide cap-and-trade program that achieves dramatic reductions in our greenhouse gas emissions by the middle of the century--and work with other nations around the  world to do the same. We must transition our economy away from its reliance on fossil fuels and towards the clean, green energy sources of the future, while making far more efficient use of the energy we currently use. We must update, strengthen and enforce bedrock laws like the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts. And we must act locally and individually in all of our communities to restore, protect and cherish ecosystems like the Chesapeake Bay on which all of life ultimately depends. 
   Mr. Speaker, the key decisions we make over the next several years will have a profound impact on the kind of America we leave to our children. I believe the vast majority of our constituents understand this and stand ready to do their part as we come together to build a more prosperous, healthier and greener nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the reauthorization of the Traumatic Brain Injury Act. 
   Traumatic Brain Injury, TBI, is a leading cause of death and disability in young Americans. Approximately 1.4 million people sustain a TBI each year in the United States. The most common causes of TBI are falls, traffic accidents, and assault. These brain injuries result in short-term or long-term disabilities and can severely impact how people live their lives. 
   Congress took an important step in 1996 by passing the Traumatic Brain Injury Act to promote brain injury research, education, treatment, and prevention. It is the only Federal law that specifically addresses the issues faced by persons with brain injury. This law has successfully improved access to health care and other services for individuals with TBI. Without the TBI Act, State governments and these individuals would be left to their own devices. 
   More recently, we have seen an increasing number of traumatic brain injuries in servicemembers returning home from combat operations. The programs in the TBI Act can help the thousands of troops wounded in combat and suffering from brain injury. We have an obligation to assist these soldiers, and I am proud that Congress has provided funding in the recent appropriations bill to address TBI in returning personnel. 
   The reauthorization of the Traumatic Brain Injury Act builds on the success of the original 1996 law by continuing to educate the public and provide much needed data on TBI for scientists, health care providers, and policy makers. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, today, the 2008 Olympic torch arrives for the first time on American soil. It almost didn't make it. After violence erupted in Paris and London between police and demonstrators protesting Chinese human rights abuses, there were serious discussions about ending the torch's journey across the world before it arrived in the United States. 
   Despite ongoing complaints by the international community about China's human rights abuses--and its restrictions on freedoms of speech--China refuses to take corrective action. 
   This resolution is an attempt to pressure the Chinese Government to address international concerns of human rights abuses in that country. This resolution is also a reaction to six decades of cultural and religious repression of the Tibetan people. Now is the time to bring the suffering of the Tibetan people to an end. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution to encourage the People's Republic of China to enter into discussions with the Dalai Lama and respect the human rights of all its citizens.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Management Act. 
   Imagine having a child with a food allergy who is at school and can potentially eat something that will cause a life-threatening or fatal reaction. This can especially be a very nerve-wracking experience for any parent when their child is away from home and spends most of their time in school. 
   This commonsense legislation was brought to my attention by many school-age children from my congressional district. They shared their experiences of what they have to do every day to manage their food allergies. They have to scrutinize everything they eat in order to make sure they avoid the allergy-producing ingredients. The least we can do for these children and their parents is to encourage school districts across the country to adopt uniform guidelines in managing the risk of food allergy and anaphylaxis, and develop emergency plans for children who suffer from this illness. This legislation would accomplish this goal by creating a new grant program to provide resources for those school districts who voluntarily implement these measures. 
   Madam Speaker, by passing this bill, we can help reduce the number of life-threatening allergic reactions and help children manage their food allergies. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Act. 
   Sadly, thousands of infants are born with a hearing loss each year. Fortunately, thanks to the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) program that was established in 2000, today approximately 93 percent of all newborns are screened. Many infants with hearing loss and their families have benefited from early identification of hearing loss. The EHDI program allows babies with hearing loss to develop normally and lead productive lives by ensuring that they will be ready to learn when they enter school. 
   However, many infants who are identified as having a hearing disability due to the screening tests do not receive timely follow-up care because of shortages in trained professionals needed for infant hearing screening programs. We must do better in ensuring that infants and their families have access to comprehensive hearing loss care. The bill seeks to accomplish this by presiding comprehensive information about family support, training, and information services to the family of children identified with hearing loss and ensure that they are given the opportunity to consider all the options of early intervention services, educational and program placements. 
   This legislation will improve on the successful Early Hearing Detection and Intervention program. I urge my colleagues to vote for this much needed bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (GENERAL LEAVE -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I thank my colleague. 
   Madam Speaker, it wasn't that long ago, in fact, it was September 2004, that President Bush told the Nation, and I quote, ``We will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for the government's health insurance programs. We will not allow a lack of attention or information to stand between these children and the health care they need.'' That's what the President said just a little over 3 years ago. He has, with his veto, changed his mind. He has turned his back on what he said to America just 3 years ago. 
   But what hasn't changed since he's changed his mind are the needs of a  million American children; in fact, the needs have only grown greater over the last 3 years. We see rising gas prices; we see rising grocery prices; we see rising prices of going to college; and, yes, we see rising prices for health care. In fact, many more people are not going to be able to afford health care for their kids today than before as people fight a tightening economic squeeze in the months ahead. 
   We are trying to work together on an economic stimulus package. We worked together on a bipartisan basis when this legislation passed the House and the Senate. It is time for us to work together for the children of this country and make sure they get the health care they need at this very important time. 
   You know, the American people are hungry for a change in direction. They're hungry for politicians who follow through and do what they said they were going to do, and this is something the President told the Nation he wanted to do. Now that we need it more than ever and more families and more children are struggling than ever before, we need to come together and fulfill the commitment that was made. 
   Madam Speaker, it's time to say ``no'' to the President's veto. This bill is paid for by increase in tobacco taxes. Let's make sure we don't spend our time looking out for the tobacco companies. Let's look out for the children of America. Let's say ``no'' to the President's veto and ``yes'' to this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chairman, let me begin by commending the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Mr. Frank, and the ranking member, Mr. Bachus, for crafting a bill that is before us today to help protect homeowners across the country and to stop predatory lending. 
   The amendment I am proposing is designed to protect consumers from bait-and-switch schemes perpetrated by a small number of unscrupulous lenders who have learned to exploit flaws in the existing system. Under the existing law we have today, lenders are required to provide homeowners with a good-faith estimate of their settlement costs, the costs they will have when they settle on a transaction. 
   However, under current law there is absolutely no penalty for lenders who are widely off in providing those estimates. We have many cases where you have a few bad actors who lure consumers to borrow by low-balling their estimate of closing costs only to jack-up those costs when it comes to the last minute at the settlement table. 
   This amendment would address this problem by saying that in the case of residential mortgage loans, the amount of closing costs may not exceed by more than 10 percent any estimate of the closing cost provided to the consumer in advance of closing. By setting that kind of ceiling, we reduce the chance that borrowers will be blind-sided by unexpected fees at closing. 
   The intent of this amendment is to protect consumers from negligent or fraudulent lenders and introduce greater confidence and certainty into the process. 
   Mr. Chairman, as currently drafted, I believe this amendment is too broad. We need to make sure we hold lenders accountable for estimates that are within their control, not those estimates that may be outside of their control. In a moment I am going to move to withdraw the amendment. 
   But before that, I would like to yield to the chairman of the committee.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, today Republicans in Congress ignored the will of the American people and rubber-stamped the President's veto of important funding for our domestic priorities. After 7 years of unrestrained spending and a ballooning deficit, the President and his Republican allies in Congress have, under the guise of fiscal responsibility, rejected a $6.2 billion funding increase  for education, health care, and workforce development, even as the President requests nearly $200 billion in unbudgeted, no strings attached funding to continue the Iraq War for another year. That is no way to balance America's checkbook. 
   Under the budget passed by the New Democratic Congress, we can take care of America at home--increase funding for our schools, offer more student assistance for college, invest in biomedical research at NIH, expand health care access, and help Americans compete in the global economy--and balance the budget by 2012. These priorities are America's priorities, and Democrats in Congress will continue to fight for them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand today to support the College Cost Reduction and Access Act. I thank Chairman Miller and the Conferees for their quick work on this Conference Report, and all the work they have done on this important legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, for years, American students and families have demanded relief from rising tuition and ballooning debt. The average student exits college with almost $20,000 in student loan debt, which, because of accumulating interest, can take years to pay. This debt is burdening our communities. When a student has tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt, it limits choices. Those students might not be able to take lower salary jobs in the fields where we desperately need them--as teachers or first responders. When two-thirds of our college graduates are in debt, it limits our economy. Those graduates have less money for a down payment on a house, less money to invest, and less disposable income. 
   Even worse, some students are deterred from going to college altogether when costs are too high. We lose some of the best and the brightest--those who are qualified to learn, who want to learn, who have worked hard and gotten the grades, but who run into financial barriers when it comes time to head off to college. 
   Today, we are bringing some relief. We are going to open the doors to college and help our young people reach their full potential. We're going to increase Pell grants to make college more affordable. We're going to cut the interest rates on loans in half so they're easier to pay off. We're going to institute income-based loan repayment, so graduates don't have to choose between paying their rent and paying off their loans. And we're going to expand loan forgiveness for those who enter public service, so we have more teachers, first responders and nurses. 
   We made a promise to the American people before the last election. We've been working to fulfill that promise from the first 100 hours of the new Congress. And today, as our young people head back to school, the House and Senate are going to see that promise through with largest increase in student loans since the G.I. bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the Senate amendment to the omnibus appropriations bill for an unconditional $70 billion for the war in Iraq. This amendment gives the President a blank check to continue a flawed strategy that has no end in sight. It does nothing to bring home our brave men and women of the armed forces serving faithfully in Iraq, many of them on their third tour of duty in that country, at considerable sacrifice and strain to them and their families. Nor does this amendment place any conditions on the Iraqi government, which has continually failed to pursue political reconciliation. Our intelligence community has publicly concluded that the political situation Iraq is getting worse, not better. Moreover, the indefinite presence of American forces has sadly contributed to Iraq's political stagnation because it has allowed the different factions there to postpone making the difficult compromises necessary to achieve stability and reconciliation. Meanwhile, our men and women of the armed services continue to die every day in Iraq's ongoing civil war. A strategy of more of the same is no strategy at all. 
   I have and will continue to vote to ensure that our troops in Iraq receive the support and equipment that they need. That is why in November I voted in support of the House measure to provide our troops in Iraq with an additional $50 billion. At the same time, this House legislation required the safe and responsible redeployment of our troops in Iraq. That legislation aimed to transition the U.S. military mission in Iraq. It would redeploy our combat forces out of Iraq by a target date of December 15, 2008. The House proposal, modeled after the approach recommended by the bipartisan Baker-Hamilton Commission of the Iraq Study Group, would focus the remaining forces on the more limited missions of training Iraqi security forces, providing logistical and intelligence support for Iraqi security forces, and engaging in targeted counter-terrorist operations against Al-Qaeda and affiliated groups. The House bill also called for a ``comprehensive diplomatic, political, and economic strategy that includes sustained engagement with Iraq's neighbors and the international community for the purpose of working collectively to bring stability to Iraq.'' 
   Instead of supporting the sensible approach passed by the House, the Senate Republicans, taking their cue from the White House, threatened to filibuster it. Now these same political elements have collaborated in sending us an amendment for more war funding with no accountability and no plan to redeploy our combat forces. This irresponsible approach will have the effect of prolonging the war, not bringing it to an end. 
   While I am opposed to another blank check for war funding in Iraq, I support continued military operations and reconstruction activities in Afghanistan. Moreover, my opposition to the Senate amendment does not extend to the underlying Omnibus, which--while far from perfect--was at the end of the day the best that we could do this year.

Like all products of compromise, it does not contain everything all of us would have liked. But it is a positive step forward in an area of public policy crying out for reform, and I am glad we are able to make this progress today. 
   Given recent press reports about unsafe levels of lead in children's toys, this legislation appropriately establishes the toughest lead standard in the world when it comes to children's products. Additionally, while not going as far as it ultimately should, H.R. 4040 subjects a much broader range of products to independent, third-party review. 
   I am also pleased that the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act reverses the recent underfunding of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, CPSC, by increasing its authorization to $100 million by FY 2011--including an additional $20 million to modernize the CPSC's testing lab. It is neither reasonable nor responsible to task an agency with a job as important as protecting the public health without providing the resources necessary to accomplish that task. 
   Finally, this bill takes concrete steps to improve public notice of product recalls and strengthen enforcement against bad actors in the consumer market. 
   As we begin discussions aimed at finalizing this legislation with the Senate, I hope we will be able to make additional improvements to this bill by broadening the scope of mandatory product testing, enhancing families' right to know, and including robust whistleblower protections for those courageous enough to Bring serious safety hazards to light. 
   Madam Speaker, the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act is a good start. I look forward to working with my colleagues to achieve the strongest possible consumer protection legislation in the months ahead.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2419, FOOD, CONSERVATION, AND ENERGY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2419, the 2008 Farm Bill Conference Report. This bill provides a breakthrough for the Chesapeake Bay by providing an unprecedented level of funding to aid in the cleanup of this national treasure. H.R. 2419 provides, for the first time, a bay specific program to ensure that farmers in the watershed will get their fair share of conservation funding. The Conference Report provides $188 million,  over 5 years, in bay-specific conservation funding. Moreover, the bill includes a baseline of funding in the amount of $438 million over 10 years. This will enable the program to be extended at the expiration of this 5-year bill. Additionally, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation estimates that farmers in the bay watershed will be eligible for an additional $252 million in national program funding in working land programs in addition to conservation set-aside programs. This funding will be over and above the annual conservation funding in the last year of the previous farm bill that provided $80 million to the Bay watershed. 
   I want to thank the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Collin Peterson, and the chairman of the Conservation Subcommittee, Tim Holden, for the programs and funding that they have provided to assist farmers in controlling sediment and nutrient runoff into the Chesapeake Bay. Moreover, the program would not have been possible without the support of the many Members of Congress on the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Taskforce. In addition, the work of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, in providing technical assistance and grass roots support, was essential to the success of the establishment of this program. The Chesapeake Bay Commission also provided assistance in the crafting of an initial legislation, CHESSEA, that helped galvanize the support of Members who are committed to restoring the health of the Bay. 
   The Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the U.S. Its watershed includes 66,000 farms with an estimated 8.5 million acres of land. The watershed contains 150 tributary streams and rivers. The watershed spans 6 States and the District of Columbia. Almost half of the nitrogen and phosphorus pollutant load in the bay is caused by agricultural runoff--from fertilizer and animal waste. 
   In 1987 there was the first attempt to clean up the bay with an agreement between the States and the Federal Government. The goal was to clean up the bay by 2000. When the deadline passed, a more detailed agreement was developed and the leaders of Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia, and the EPA pledged to fix the bay's water, its oyster population, its beds of underwater grass, and other environmental indicators by 2010--which will require the reduction of 110 million pounds of pollution. 
   Every environmental assessment indicates that the 2010 deadline will not be met and that the environmental condition of the bay is continuing to deteriorate. A recent report by the Chesapeake Bay Program's Health and Restoration Assessment found that most of the bay's waters are degraded, the bay's critical habitats, like grasses, are at risk and that many of the bay's blue crabs, striped bass and oyster populations are below historic levels. This bill provides the much needed resources to restore the Chesapeake Bay to its original vitality.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2008. 
   The bill supports NASA's missions and goals in space with a $20 billion authorization that, in addition to funding such important programs as the Hubble Space Telescope and the International Space Station, will also enable NASA to inspire a new generation of Americans through its plans for additional manned space exploration. 
   The bill continues other important NASA programs including its climate research programs which help us understand how solar radiation and human activities are affecting the Earth's climate; the Space Shuttle mission to the International Space Station to deliver the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (an instrument that measures cosmic rays and particulate matter in space); NASA's Science Directorate, which studies Earth and the solar system; and NASA's many inspirational educational programs. 
   The educational programs are of particular importance as current science and engineering workers across the country begin to retire. To help ensure that the U.S. continues to meet the growing demand for scientists, mathematicians and engineers, it is important that Congress supports programs that encourage more young people to pursue careers in the sciences. 
   I want to especially acknowledge one such program--the NASA Goddard High School Internship Program which has educated and inspired students across this country--including some from my district. The NASA Goddard High School Internship Program is a research intensive program allowing interns to apply science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines to ``real time'' research. The program enables students to work on projects relevant to NASA's goals and then share the results of their research with NASA management, personnel and fellow interns. 
   I commend NASA for the role it continues to play in helping maintain and strengthen the vitality of science and engineering in the United States and for its ongoing efforts to inspire, educate and engage our young people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, let me begin by congratulating the chairman of the Judiciary Committee Mr. Conyers, and the ranking member Mr. Smith, on all their work on this particular issue, and I want to thank them and the other members of the Judiciary Committee for reporting this bill out by unanimous vote, a unanimous bipartisan vote. And I also want to thank the other cosponsors of this legislation, including Mr. Meehan and others. 
   Madam Speaker, in the last election I think the American people sent Congress a very strong and unambiguous message, that it's time to change the way Washington does business. They said loud and clear that the status quo on Capitol Hill is unacceptable. The  American people want this Congress to hold the Bush administration accountable, and they want Congress to hold itself accountable. 
   They grew weary of a Congress that used the power of the majority to benefit narrow special interests at the expense of the public interest, and that's why on the very opening day of this new Congress, under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi, we immediately enacted a series of important reforms, gift bans, travel limitation, and greater transparency of the earmark process. 
   The lobbying reform bills that are before us today are the next important steps along the path to greater openness and transparency, and I think we would all agree that with greater openness to the public comes greater accountability for this institution. 
   Let's be clear. Lobbyists come before this body to advocate issues on behalf of their clients, and they serve a valid and important service of providing information and expertise on complex issues that we face. However, we know a number of recent scandals have demonstrated that lobbyists, some of them like Jack Abramoff, have been able to exercise undue influence in shaping the legislative agenda and the policies that come out of the Congress. 
   This bill, the Lobbying Transparency Act, deals with the role of lobbyists in the campaign fund-raising process. It requires registered lobbyists to disclose certain contributions that they bundle on behalf of candidates and political committees. 
   This bill involves simply the disclosure of information that the public has a right to know, and a vote against this bill is a vote to deny that public important information that they can use to judge the legislative process. 
   I think we all agree that Members of Congress are sent here to represent the public interest. We're not here to represent narrow special interests, and we should have a very simple test, a very simple standard in considering whether we're going to vote for or against legislation, and that test is, does that legislation advance the public interest. And the answer on this bill is unequivocally yes. 
   Let's fulfill our promise to restore the public trust by serving the public interest. I urge adoption of this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague. I also urge my colleagues to vote against the motion to recommit. 
   During the earlier discussion, Mr. Smith talked about how the bill that we passed last year out of the Judiciary Committee was a bipartisan bill. In fact, it was a bipartisan vote in the Judiciary Committee. But what he failed to mention, and in the spirit of bipartisanship earlier I thought I wouldn't raise, was when that amendment that was attached in the Judiciary Committee got to the Rules Committee, the Rules Committee took it out. So the lobbying reform bill that the Republicans brought to the floor of the House stripped out the amendment that Mr. Smith, number one, claims bipartisanship on right now. 
   Number two, the measure that we have brought before us today is, in fact, broader than the amendment that the Judiciary Committee voted on last year and, in fact, captures more bundling activity. It doesn't just capture very narrow bundling activities, it is broader, and, in fact, would capture a lot more of the bundling and disclose a lot more than the bill that Mr. Smith referred to. So, in fact, it is a very important step forward in terms of the public's right to know. 
   Finally, the purpose of dealing with the registered lobbyists is registered lobbyists register for a reason. They are paid to try and influence legislation before Congress. They are paid to try and influence Members of Congress with respect to legislation. So the whole purpose of this is to go get at that nexus. Registered lobbyists don't register to go lobby a PAC. They don't go register to lobby the NRA PAC or to go lobby an environmental PAC or go lobby a right-to-life PAC. 
   So this is drawn to get at the issue that we are trying to get out in this Congress, which is to change the way we do business here and to make sure that we address the nexus between registered lobbyists and the legislative process. That is the focus. This takes us out of that focus, so I urge that we oppose this particular motion to recommit.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, today I voted against the 2007 Supplemental War Funding Bill. I opposed the bill not for what it contained--but for what it lacked. The bill lacked strong accountability measures for the Iraqi government and omitted readiness standards to ensure that deployed troops are fully prepared and equipped for duty. While this bill represents an important step forward from where we were before the election, it does not go far enough. In the last election, the American public made clear that they wanted a change of direction in this war. This is not change enough. 
   On May 1, 2003, the day the President declared an end of hostilities in Iraq and Afghanistan, there were 142,000 American soldiers in Iraq. Today there are 155,000. On that day there had been 138 American casualties and 542 wounded in Iraq. Today the number of casualties is 3,476 and the number of wounded is 25,225. The Iraqi people have also suffered. The estimated number of Iraqi civilians killed by violence since May 2003 is between 53,000 and 63,000. The bill voted on today does little to reverse this course. 
   The Congress sent the President a bill that would have begun the process of changing worsening conditions in this war by holding the Iraqis accountable for taking the steps necessary to achieve political reconciliation and greater stability. The bill also provided additional funding to go after Osama bin Laden, the Taliban and al Qaeda. By vetoing that bill, the President missed an opportunity to change direction in Iraq and complete the job in Afghanistan. 
   By vetoing that bill, the President said ``no'' to ensuring that our troops had the training and equipment they need. By vetoing that bill he said ``no'' to ensuring that we hold the Iraqi Government accountable to the benchmarks which the Bush administration and the Iraqi Government have said are absolutely necessary to achieve political stability in Iraq. 
   We voted to give our troops every penny the President asked for and more. We also insisted on accountability to protect our troops. The President wanted the money without adequate accountability. Our troops deserve better and so do the American people.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (MEDICARE IMPROVEMENTS FOR PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS ACT OF 2008--Continued -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6331, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008. 
   Most importantly, this legislation prevents the impending 10 percent cut in Medicare payments to physicians for the remainder of 2008 and provides a 1.1 percent update in physician payments for 2009. The uncertainty of Medicare payments makes it difficult for physicians and their practices to plan for the expenses that they will incur as they serve Medicare beneficiaries. And in turn, beneficiaries will face increasing difficulties accessing physicians who accept Medicare. What we need to do is address this issue in the long term by reforming the flawed reimbursement formulas. By addressing this issue in the short term through 2009, we will provide Congress with the needed time to study and develop a long term solution to this problem. 
   Not only would we prevent cuts in Medicare physician reimbursements, the bill will make important and necessary improvements to the Medicare program by enhancing Medicare preventative and mental health benefits, improving assistance for low-income Medicare beneficiaries, and extending expiring provisions for rural and other providers. 
   And this legislation is fully paid for. It reduces Medicare Advantage Indirect Medical Education IME, overpayments, which are being paid twice: once to the teaching facility itself, and again to Medicare Advantage plans, with no requirement that plans pass the IME payment along to the teaching facility. H.R. 6331 will eliminate the needless double payment by still reimbursing the teaching facility directly for the higher cost of care, but ceasing IME payments to Medicare Advantage plans. 
   I am pleased that this legislation contains a provision that makes a technical correction to ensure that all physicians, including podiatrists, are permitted to perform required face-to-face examinations so that they are able to prescribe Medicare-covered durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics and supplies, DMEPOS. This provision corrects a drafting error in the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act that pointed to the wrong definition of physician in the Social Security Act when requiring face-to-face examination in order to prescribe DMEPOS items. 
   I am also pleased that the bill includes a two-year reauthorization of the Special Diabetes Programs for Type 1 Diabetes and the Special Diabetes Programs for Native Americans at current funding levels. It is vital that this successful program be reauthorized on a multi-year basis so that the National Institutes of Health, NIH, can invest in new research. Without this reauthorization, NIH would have to begin to shut down research projects that are currently underway. 
   Mr. Speaker, we owe it to provide and beneficiaries to make these modest improvements to the Medicare program now. This bill will protect our seniors. The clock is ticking. I urge my colleagues to support this much-needed legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING DANDY-WALKER SYNDROME AND HYDROCEPHALUS -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I thank my colleague. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, which supports further research and also activities to increase public awareness, professional education, diagnosis, and treatment of Dandy-Walker syndrome and hydrocephalus. 
   I, too, want to thank our colleague from New Mexico, Heather Wilson, for her leadership on this issue, her persistence on this issue. She has met with families from around the country who are struggling with Dandy-Walker syndrome, and I thank her for all the good work that she has done on this matter. 
   As we've heard, this is a very rare birth defect that's commonly associated with hydrocephalus. It can cause neurological damage that will delay development and cause severe developmental problems and sometimes lead to death. The Centers For Disease Control and Prevention reports that the Dandy-Walker syndrome may affect one in 5,000 infants, of which approximately 70 to 90 percent will go on to develop hydrocephalus. 
   The causes of this disease are largely unknown, and current treatment for Dandy-Walker consists primarily of treating the associated problems, the symptoms, rather than the syndrome itself. And as we heard, hydrocephalus is treated today much in the same way it was back in 1952, when this syndrome was first identified, by inserting a special tube called a ``shunt'' into the brain to drain off excess fluid. 
   We're here today because we think we need to focus more efforts and research in this area, that we shouldn't allow 1950s medical treatment to dictate how Dandy-Walker syndrome and hydrocephalus are treated. That is why we need to learn more about this syndrome and continue to raise public awareness about this condition. And that's why the National Institutes of Health should continue the current collaboration and research that they are doing and increase that effort. 
   I've had the privilege of getting to know a family with a child who has Dandy-Walker syndrome and hydrocephalus. While waiting for the birth of their child in 2005, Andrea and Eric Cole of Kensington, Maryland, learned that their son would be born with Dandy-Walker syndrome. Their son, Ryan, was born 3 months prematurely. He weighed 1 pound, 15 ounces. 
   On learning that there was no national organization or support network already organized to advocate on behalf of individuals with Dandy-Walker syndrome, Eric and Andrea took the necessary steps to found the only national nonprofit organization for Dandy-Walker syndrome, the Dandy-Walker Alliance. We're very proud that they are with us today. 
   The Dandy-Walker Alliance is an organization that's launched a variety of educational programs, publications, activities, and other efforts to raise public awareness and understanding of the Dandy-Walker syndrome. 
   Mr. Speaker, what we're trying to do today is send a message to families across the country who have members of their family who have Dandy-Walker syndrome, to let them know that they are not alone in this fight, that Congress is listening to their concerns, and that Congress is taking action to encourage all the resources that we can bring to bear through the NIH and other organizations to help fight this syndrome, and to make sure that those around the country who have not been heard until recently really have a voice, not just here on the floor of the Congress, but through the resources that we can focus on this very important issue. 
   So I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this resolution. Again, I congratulate our colleague from New Mexico, Heather Wilson, for her leadership.

My own plan for the redeployment of U.S. forces would not take this exact form. However, the general thrust of this plan is in the right direction. It establishes a timetable to extricate U.S. forces from a bloody, sectarian civil war while providing the flexibility to carry out other missions both inside and outside Iraq for the purpose of going after al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations with global reach. It also provides for U.S. forces to train and equip the Iraqi Security Forces, and to protect the U.S. Embassy and diplomatic missions. 
   Mr. Speaker, I preferred the approach taken by the House in the Supplemental Appropriations bill we recently passed. Unfortunately, the President vetoed that measure. He wants the funds without any accountability. We cannot give the President a blank check. While I do not agree with every provision in this bill, it sends the right message--it is time to end the President's failed policies in Iraq and change direction.

   It is long past time to pass this legislation. It is not a question of politics or political advantage, it is a question of civil rights--it is a question of whether we believe that those people who live in the city that houses our Democratic institutions, who often work in the Federal government, deserve equal representation in our legislative body. 
   There is simply no excuse to deny the hundreds of thousands of residents of our Capital City the right to equal representation in the United States Congress. They are citizens in every way. They pay the same federal taxes as anyone else, can serve in the armed forces, and are subject to the same laws of the land. What a terrible message we send when the people in the capital of the world's greatest democracy do not have a vote in the people's House. 
   I have the privilege or representing the district right next to Washington, DC, and it is simply wrong that when you cross the border from my district into Washington, DC, you go from a district where you have voting representation to one where you do not. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have before us a bipartisan compromise that extends full voting rights to our neighbors here in the District. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and finally end taxation without representation.

Mr. Speaker, this bill provides tax relief to more than 24 million American families and corrects a huge inequity where many people have been forced to pay taxes on phantom income, income they never earned. Today, we gather to fix two big problems left behind by the Republican Congress under President Bush. One is a huge middle-class tax increase that they left hanging over the heads of the American people, a tsunami, that if we don't act today, will crash down on 124 million American taxpayers. 
   The Republican Congress under President Bush could have addressed this problem. They chose not to. It just was not a priority for them. They instead spent their time providing tax increases that went to the very wealthiest Americans and left the rest of the country holding the bag of $9 trillion debt, a debt that costs the American taxpayer $3,300 each year to pay the service on that debt, the debt that they ran up.

   Today, we must fix two big messes the Republican leadership left behind when they were voted out last November. One is the huge middle class tax increase the Republicans left hanging over millions of unsuspecting Americans. This Republican tax tsunami will crash down on top of 24 million Americans if we don't take action today. 
   The Republicans could have stopped this middle class tax hit on their watch. Instead, for 6 years with President Bush, they spent their time and energy giving tax cuts to the very wealthiest Americans. On their watch, the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans got more than half the Bush tax cuts. That was their priority, and they left the rest of the American taxpayers holding the bag of a mushrooming national debt--a $9 trillion debt that costs every taxpayer $3,300 per year. That is the debt tax American taxpayers are paying to service the debt President Bush and the Republicans have run up on our national credit card. 
   Today, Republicans are proposing to increase the debt tax--to make Americans pay more in the end. Once again, they are willing to require our children to pay more debt tax in order to protect special shelters for about 50,000 of the wealthiest Americans. 
   Let's provide middle class Americans with tax relief in a fiscally responsible way. Let's pass this bill.

   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, on March 14th I voted in favor of H.R. 3773 which modernized the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This bill successfully updated the law to accommodate the current day communications technology while at the same time providing the much-needed protection of the court in sanctioning the surveillance of Americans. Moreover, the bill was also remarkable for what it did not contain; it did not provide retroactive immunity for telephone companies who are defendants in pending lawsuits. These suits have been brought to uncover the full extent of the Administration's program to conduct unauthorized surveillance on Americans. 
   I am deeply troubled that the Senate does not have the votes to pass the House bill. The Senate instead passed its own bill, S. 2248, which was unacceptable to me from the outset because it reduced the role of the FISA Court to merely review the procedures for targeting surveillance subjects and minimizing the information collected. Moreover, the Senate bill established retroactive immunity for the phone companies that have been used to carry out the Administration's illicit surveillance program. 
   To be sure, the Senate bill is completely unacceptable. Majority Leader Hoyer worked tirelessly to improve upon the Senate bill to forge an acceptable compromise. The bill before us today, however, does not go far enough to include sufficient safeguards of court involvement in the surveillance of Americans. Moreover, it continues to provide retroactive immunity for those companies that carried out the Administration's unauthorized surveillance. Finally, it fails to hold the Administration accountable for its past illicit surveillance activities and its disregard of the Fourth Amendment protections of Americans. As a result, I must vote against this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of the critical bipartisan Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. 
   We have a moral obligation to address the global pandemics of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. It was 5 years ago that Congress took leadership to address this crisis. Today, because of Congress's actions, the United States has become the leading provider in the world of HIV/AIDS assistance, treatment, prevention and care. 
   AIDS continues to be the leading cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa. The United Nations estimates that 33 million people are infected with HIV worldwide, with an estimated 22 million HIV-infected people in sub-Saharan Africa. Approximately 1.6 million deaths in sub-Saharan African resulted from AIDS in 2007. This legislation reaffirms our commitment to combating this deadly epidemic by reauthorizing the 2003 law and will give more flexibility to host governments in planning, directing, and managing prevention, treatment and care programs that have been established with our assistance. 
   I am pleased that the bill also includes a provision that authorizes funding for U.S. contributions to research and development of a tuberculosis vaccine. Tuberculosis is a deadly epidemic that faces our planet today. Nearly 2 million people die from it each year and approximately 9 million are diagnosed with tuberculosis annually. It is the largest killer of people with HIV/AIDS, accounting for one-third of AIDS deaths alone. The current tuberculosis vaccine is more than 85 years old and is unreliable against pulmonary tuberculosis. New tuberculosis vaccines have the potential to save millions of lives and would lead to substantial cost savings. 
   Madam Chairman, let us honor the spirit of the two men--Chairmen Lantos and Hyde--who guided the 2003 law through this body in bipartisan manner by passing this much needed legislation to combat these deadly diseases.

   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Chairman, I rise today as a member of the Green Schools Caucus to strongly support the 21st Century Green High-Performing Public School Facilities Act. 
   Our Nation needs new schools. The average American school is 50 years old and almost two-thirds need extensive repair. According the GAO, 14 million students attend schools considered below standard or dangerous. But in a time of state budget deficits, fewer dollars are going to school construction projects. 
   Today's bill will assist local school districts with the initial costs of construction and modernization and, by investing in energy efficient technology, will result in significant long term savings. Building green costs about 2 percent more than conventional construction, but can save 20 times that amount over the life of the school. 
   Moreover, green school construction yields substantial environmental benefits. Green schools use on average 33 percent less energy and produce less carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, and coarse particulate matter emissions. 
   With its investment in infrastructure, this bill provides an important economic stimulus. School districts have many projects ready to go. When this bill is passed, we will see additional jobs in the construction industry, including suppliers, architects, contractors, and engineers. 
   Madam Chairman, this legislation is a good, long-term investment that will improve education, reduce our energy consumption, and create jobs in local communities. I urge my colleagues to join me and support this important bill.

   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of overriding the President's veto of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007. 
   I was deeply disappointed that the President exercised his veto pen on a bicameral and bipartisan bill. Not so long ago, the President pledged to expand coverage of CHIP to include eligible children who are not yet enrolled in the program. In his September 2004 speech to the Republican National Convention, the President stated--and I am quoting here, ``We will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for the government's health insurance programs. We will not allow a lack of attention, of information, to stand between these children and the health care they need.'' With this veto, the President has reversed course and turned his back on America's children. 
   The CHIP Reauthorization Act would reauthorize and improve the very successful Children's Health Insurance Program for 5 years. This bipartisan bill would preserve coverage for the six million children currently enrolled who otherwise would have access to health insurance while extending coverage to 3.8 million children who are already eligible, but not enrolled in the program. The bill also includes guaranteed dental coverage and mental health parity in the CHIP program. By reauthorizing this very important program, we will strengthen CHIP by improving the quality of health care children receive and at the same time increase health insurance coverage to one of the most vulnerable segments of our society. 
   This legislation is paid for. It increases the tobacco tax by 61 cents to a total of one dollar. Increasing the tobacco tax will save billions in health costs and is one of the most effective ways to reduce tobacco use, especially among young children. In short, raising the tobacco tax will prevent thousands of children from starting to smoke and the proceeds of the tax will be used to provide health coverage for children. That is a win-win result. 
   Madam Speaker, we should do the right and moral thing and override this veto. I strongly urge my House colleagues to override the President's veto on this bipartisan legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (STUDENT LOAN SUNSHINE ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, in a time when most students graduate with at least $20,000 in debt, it is more important than ever that students can find loans with low interest rates that are easy to pay back. In the best case, students can get federal financial aid. However, more and more students have maxed out that aid and are turning to the private market. Many schools recommend lenders to help students and their families find loans. 
   Now, most schools do work in the best interest of their students, and choose preferred lenders based on the benefits they can give students. But, as we have seen, some unscrupulous lenders have schemed with certain unscrupulous staff of college loan offices to serve their own special interests rather than the interests of students and their families. 
   What is worse, the Department of Education knew about these cozy relationships between student loan officials and lenders and did nothing about it. This is indicative of the lack of oversight that has persisted at the Department of Education for the last six years. Some of us in Congress, a few years ago, worked to close a loophole in the federal student loan program that was costing taxpayers millions of dollars. We had to pass a law to force the Department of Education to act--they had refused to issue emergency regulations to stop the subsidy and save money for taxpayers and students. 
   And now, again, the Department of Education, when faced with a clear conflict of interest between lenders and schools, has failed to respond adequately. Congress must step in to make the rules clear. 
   This bill does just that. It clarifies appropriate conduct for schools. It encourages private loans to be competitive with federal loans. It makes students more aware of their options by making the student loan market less confusing and more transparent. 
   Perhaps most importantly, this bill will restore trust between students and their colleges. Students need to be able to trust that their school officials are giving them the best advice in the confusing world of student loans. The provisions of this bill, by requiring schools to disclose exactly how their preferred lenders are chosen, will reassure students and parents that schools are looking out for their best interests. 
   This bill will help students and parents get the best deal for their money. I encourage my colleagues to vote yes on the Student Loan Sunshine Act, and put in place a system that looks after students' interests, and is not plagued by special interests.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, let me start by commending Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member King and the Homeland Security Committee on a bipartisan basis for their good work on this piece of legislation. I have an amendment that I hope will be agreeable to all sides. 
   In January of this year, the TSA launched a Web site. Some of you may have seen it. It was called the Traveler Verification Identification Program, and it was designed to allow those passengers who were wrongfully identified on the no-fly lists or the selectee lists the opportunity to start the process of getting their names removed from that list. 
   The way you did that was you go and you log on to the TSA Web site and submit sensitive security information and personal information, like your Social Security number, the place and date of birth, your drivers license number and other personal identification numbers in order to demonstrate and prove to TSA that you were not a ``person of concern'' on their list. That was an important step forward, a positive  list. I think we have all heard the stories about individuals who were wrongfully placed on that list or whose identifications were mistaken for somebody else. So that was a good way to start to get people off the list. 
   But right after the launch of that program, they had to shut it down. The TSA had to shut down the site because, as was reported in The Washington Post and the high-tech magazine Wired, it was determined that the information that individuals were entering onto the TSA Web site was not secure, very personal types of information. Security experts found that the site lacked many of the basic measures necessary to protect personal information, no encryption devices, no other safeguards, and that the data being transferred to TSA was essentially vulnerable to being taken and used for identity theft and other purposes. 
   After these concerns were brought to the attention of TSA, they had to bring down the Web site. They put up another Web site and program in February called the Travelers Redress Inquiry Program. 
   Now, the TSA has said that it has made the necessary adjustments to protect this very personal and confidential information from exposure and theft, but it is not clear that they have taken all the measures that are necessary, especially in light of the fact that only last week we found out that a hard drive containing the personal data of almost 100,000 TSA employees disappeared. 
   Data security does not seem to have been taken seriously enough by the TSA. This amendment is designed to focus greater attention on that issue. 
   This amendment is very simple. It requires TSA to take the necessary steps required to protect the personal information submitted online by passengers, by our constituents, when they are seeking to remove their names from the no-fly list, the selectee list or other related lists. It is designed to get at a very specific problem that has arisen in recent months, and I urge its adoption.

If we could get this amendment passed, obviously as we go through the process, if there is some claim that this is going to cost billions of dollars, I wouldn't expect it would, but I would be happy to work with the gentleman.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support for the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007, H.R. 4. 
   This legislation is long overdue. Quite simply, H.R. 4 repeals the provision in current law that prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) from negotiating with drug companies for lower prices for those enrolled in Medicare prescription drug plans and instead requires the Secretary to conduct such negotiations. As it stands right now, Medicare is the only entity in this country that cannot bargain for lower drug prices. The states, Fortune 500 companies, large pharmacy chains, and the Veterans' Administration (VA) all use their bargaining clout to obtain lower drug prices for the populations they serve. 
   It is quite astonishing that the current law prohibits Medicare from negotiating for lower prices while the VA is able to negotiate for lower prices for veterans. By not allowing Medicare to negotiate for lower drug prices, the responsibility for moderating drug prices is in the hands of the private drug plans that participate in Medicare. With the failure of private plans to deliver lower drug prices, Medicare  beneficiaries end up paying higher out-of-pocket expenses. This failure is also a burden on taxpayers, as they pay approximately three-fourths of the costs of the Part D program. 
   We simply cannot rely solely on private market competition to secure lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries. In fact, a recent report conducted by Families USA found that Medicare Part D drug prices are much higher than those obtained by the VA. This comprehensive study determined that for half of the top 20 drugs prescribed to Medicare Part D beneficiaries, the lowest price charged by Part D insurers is at least 58 percent higher than the same drugs provided to veterans by the VA. It is obvious that the pharmaceutical companies participating in Medicare Part D have failed to achieve what former CMS Administrator Mark McClellan claimed, ``the best discounts on drugs.'' We can, and must, do better in lowering drug prices in the Medicare Part D program. 
   We must stand up for seniors and people with disabilities and give Medicare the ability to get the lowest possible prices for its beneficiaries. America's seniors and taxpayers will benefit from this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chairman, we all know that paying for college is often a daunting task for our Nation's students and families. It can sometimes be difficult to calculate the full costs and find ways to meet them. Far too many students graduate with too much debt--debts that can limit their choices and strain their finances. I am proud that this Congress has focused significant attention on this issue. 
   Last year this Congress passed the largest increase in student assistance since the Montgomery G.I. Bill. That increase was fully paid for by reducing subsidies to banks and lenders. Today, we continue our commitment to increasing access to higher education with the College Opportunity and Affordability Act. 
   This bill provides transparency and clarity in the often-confusing process that students and families face as they decide how to pay for college. It simplifies the Free Application for Federal Student Aid process and creates a shorter form for low-income families. It instructs the Secretary of Education to create a user-friendly website that centralizes information about schools and costs. It also makes sure that students and parents get easy-to-understand information about the terms and conditions of both federal and private loans. 
   The College Opportunity and Affordability Act also includes provisions from the House-passed Student Loan Sunshine Act, which requires schools and lenders to adopt strict codes of conduct to avoid conflicts of interest and protect students from aggressive lending practices. 
   Today's bill also furthers our Competitiveness Agenda, begun with the America COMPETES Act last year, by creating programs to recruit new science and technology teachers and collaborate with the business community to improve science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and foreign language education. 
   It continues our commitment to our Nation's military, creating new scholarships for active duty personnel and their families, providing support for veterans at college, and ensuring that they have fair access to student and housing aid. 
   I thank the chairman and ranking member for including many of the provisions from the Teach for America Act, a bill that I introduced last year with Mr. Castle, Ms. DeLauro, Mr. Regula, and Mr. Sarbanes. These provisions, combined with the amendment to clarify specific authorizing amounts that Mr. Castle and I offered today, will allow Teach for America to expand its reach with 8,000 corps members serving 680,000 children in 33 regions around the country. 
   Mr. Chairman, this bill will increase transparency, put more qualified teachers in our classrooms, and open the doors to college to our Nation's children. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to join my colleague, Mr. Castle of Delaware, in offering this amendment in support of Teach for America. And I want to recognize the efforts of Mr. Castle for his years of advocacy for this very important cause and thank Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon for their stalwart bipartisan support for Teach for America. 
   For many years, Teach for America has pioneered an innovative and very successful approach to teacher recruitment, placing over 17,000 outstanding college graduates in schools around our Nation, reaching over 2 million students. Many of those graduates remain in education after teaching as corps members, either as teachers or as principals, or remain otherwise active within our educational community. 
   This is a program that has received strong bipartisan support from this Congress, and the Teach for America Act, which authorizes the partnership between the Federal Government and this important program, was introduced on a bipartisan basis by a number of us, including Mr. Castle, Ms. DeLauro, who has been a champion of this issue, Mr. Regula, Mr. Sarbanes, and now has over 105 cosponsors. And I want to thank Chairman Miller and the committee for incorporating the major provisions of that legislation into the bill that is before us today. 
   This amendment proposes one change, which is the bill before us authorizes such sums as may be necessary for this program. And what this amendment does is seek to clarify our congressional intent with respect to the specific targets that we want to hit with respect to funding. It sets an authorized level of $20 million for fiscal year 2009 and $25 million for fiscal year 2010. And those are the levels that are consistent with the Teach for America's published budget. And with this funding, Teach for America can expand  from 5,000 members in 26 urban and rural areas around the country, to 8,000 members in 33 regions and serve 680,000 economically disadvantaged children. 
   This is an important, real impact. Teach for America has been forthright about its plans, and it raises about 80 percent of its funds from nongovernment sources. This amendment, of course, does not make this mandatory, but it clearly says that this is the intent of Congress to reach these levels. These are the levels necessary to get the job done and make sure we fund our share of this very important partnership. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, two separate headlines on the front page of today's Washington Post tell the sad story of two of the Bush Administration's biggest national security failures. First, its disastrous Iraq policy, and second, its failure to complete the mission against al Qaeda and the Taliban along the Afghan/Pakistan border. 
   One headline reads, ``CIA Said Instability Appeared Irreversible.'' The article describes how, on the same day last November, the Baker-Hamilton commission received two starkly different portrayals of what was happening in Iraq. One came from President Bush, who portrayed a rosy picture, and the other came from the man who President Bush put in charge of the CIA, General Hayden, who was responsible for providing a clear-eyed analysis based on cold facts. And what he reportedly told the commission was, and I quote, ``Instability of the Iraqi Government was irreversible.'' Irreversible, he said. 
   These starkly different portrayals of the situation go to the core of our problems in Iraq because the President has been in a state of denial. Happy talk is no substitute for a reality-based policy. And indeed, the President's decisions based on wishful thinking have led to decisions that have weakened our national security. 
   Yesterday, the U.S. intelligence experts confirmed the gloomy assessment that General Hayden made last November, and today's report to Congress confirms that the Iraqi Government has failed to make sufficient progress in key areas of national reconciliation. 
   The other headline on the front page of the paper today on Washington Post reads, ``U.S. warns of stronger al Qaeda and describes al Qaeda's growing presence and strength along the Afghan/Pakistan border and reveals the consequences of our failure to complete the job against al Qaeda in that area.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, we must insist that the Iraqis assume greater responsibility for their own future, and we redouble our efforts against those who did attack us on September 11, 2001. That's what this bill is about. 
   It's time to change direction. I urge my colleagues to adopt this bill.

   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chairman, throughout our history, American citizens have never hesitated to heed the call to service. They have answered in times of peace and prosperity, in times of war and recession. They have donated time and money and sweat--as much as they could, whenever it was needed. 
   When our Nation faced the Great Depression, President Roosevelt formed the Civilian Conservation Corps and put citizens to work for the national interest. When we faced political uncertainty in the world, President Kennedy challenged our young people to serve and dispatched the Peace Corps on missions of international aid and public diplomacy. And when neighbors have challenges, when communities struggle, or when the Nation sees tragedy, our citizens rally and lend a hand. 
   In recent years, we have seen some of the largest increases in volunteerism in history. This new trend is led by our young people, who are serving in record numbers. The number of college students who volunteer increased by 20 percent between 2002 and 2005. And the programs we consider today are a key part of that service. 
   Today's legislation will increase enrollment in AmeriCorps and establish ways to deploy AmeriCorps alumni in times of national need. It will establish an Office of Outreach and Recruitment to match new volunteers with service opportunities. It will create a new program, a Summer of Service, to encourage more young people to help their communities. It will strengthen our emergency preparedness and disaster response with improvements to the National Civilian Community Corps. And it will challenge our scientists, mathematicians, and engineers to meet our Nation's technical needs with creativity and innovation. 
   Mr. Chairman, Americans have made tremendous investments through national service. Let us, in turn, pass this legislation today to assist their efforts and continue their commitment to our Nation's future.

   Mr. Chairman, I think we all understand that no bill that comes before this House is perfect. But this bill represents a very careful balancing of important national priorities: protecting the family farmer, strengthening the nutrition program. And I want to thank subcommittee chairman Joe Baca for those efforts, land conservation, environmental protection and renewable energy sources, and all done in a fiscally responsible manner. 
   I am especially grateful and thankful for the efforts of Chairman Peterson and subcommittee Chairman Holden for their efforts to protect the Nation's largest estuary, the Chesapeake Bay. 
   The Chesapeake Bay comprises six States and the District of Columbia as part of its watershed. The scientists have told us that the health of the Chesapeake Bay is in grave danger unless we take action now. Almost 50 percent of the excessive nutrient pollution in the Chesapeake Bay comes from the runoff from farm operations. Our farmers want to be part of the solution to this problem. 
   This bill provides farmers on the more than 66,000 farms in the Chesapeake Bay watershed with the tools they need to help protect the Chesapeake Bay. It represents a historic leap in Federal support for our efforts to protect this national natural treasure, the Chesapeake Bay. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to thank again the members of the committee for taking this landmark step with respect to Chesapeake Bay protection. It is a national treasure. It is a bay, of course, in the backyard of our Nation's Capital. We need to lead by example. I thank the chairman, and I thank the committee.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I thank my colleague from New York. 
   Mr. Speaker, next month we will mark the fourth anniversary of the President's decision to launch a war of choice against Iraq. Many of us came to the floor of this House in the weeks before the invasion to urge the President to take a different course. The White House ignored those appeals for restraint. The President's mantra was, and these are his words, ``Bring it on.'' 
   For almost 4 years after the invasion, the President had a rubber-stamp Congress right here that never seriously questioned his misguided policies in Iraq. It was the ``see no problems, hear no problems, conduct no oversight'' Congress. 
   When the President stood below the banner ``Mission Accomplished'' aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln in May 2003, the rubber-stamp Congress believed the slogan, rather than the facts on the ground. 
   When Vice President Cheney declared that the insurgency was in ``its final throes'' back in May 2005, the Republican Congress accepted that verdict without question. 
   When the President unveiled his so-called ``Plan For Victory'' at the Naval Academy in November 2005, the old Congress dutifully parroted the talking points sent down from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. 
   The days of the rubber-stamp Congress are now over. This Congress will no longer serve as the mouthpiece for the White House. This Congress is finally standing up to do its job as a separate and coequal branch of government. 
   Mr. Speaker, the message from the last election was clear. The American people have an uncanny ability to cut through the slogans and get to the heart of the matter. They understood clearly that more of the same in Iraq was not working. And the American people understand what both General Casey and General Abizaid have told us: that the escalation of more troops in Iraq is not the answer; that it will make matters worse, not better. 
   Increasing the number of American troops in Iraq will put off the day when the Iraqis, the Shia, the Sunnis and the Kurds, must make the difficult compromises necessary to achieve political and national reconciliation. Putting more American forces in the middle of a bloody sectarian civil war will only lead to further violence and more American and more Iraqi casualties. It is time for the Iraqis to assume more responsibility, not less. 
   The Bush administration has been wrong about this war from the beginning and it is wrong with respect to its proposed course of action now. The recommendations of the bipartisan, independent Baker-Hamilton Commission provide for the responsible redeployment of our forces and represents the best way forward in Iraq. 
   And to those who would suggest that having this debate will undermine our troops, I say shame on you. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Peter Pace put that canard to rest just last week when he said, ``There is no doubt in my mind that the dialogue here in Washington strengthens our democracy. Period.'' 
   Our men and women fighting in Iraq understand the strength and vibrancy of this democracy, and they understand that it is our duty in this Congress to exercise our best judgment for America's national security. What has harmed our national security is not the  debate in Iraq, but the lack of serious oversight over the Bush administration's decisions and conduct. 
   What emboldens our enemies is not the exercise of our democracy, but misguided policies that have weakened our national security. 
   Our national security is weakened when our credibility around the world is undermined by false claims regarding weapons of mass destruction. Our national security is weakened when the chaos in Iraq allows Iran to greatly expand its influence in the region. Our national security is weakened when America's diminished standing in the world has eroded our ability to influence the actions of others. Our national security is weakened because we have diverted our attention away from completing the mission against the architects of 9/11, against Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda and the terrorist network that continues to operate along the Afghan-Pakistan border. 
   We must change course. We must strengthen our national security position, not compound the errors we have already made. That is what this resolution is all about. We hope the President will join us in that effort. Let's chart a new direction now together.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H. Res. 726, a bill responding to acts of rape and sexual violence in the Darfur conflict. 
   Rape and sexual violence are often used as weapons of war. It is estimated that between 20,000 and 50,000 women and girls were raped during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s; between 250,000 and 500,000 were raped during the genocide in Rwanda; and today, there are reports of wide and systematic rape and sexual assault of women and girls in the Darfur region. 
   The United States was the first government to refer to the killing in Darfur as genocide, but this has had little impact on ending the suffering. The suffering continues because the Sudanese government resists the efforts of the international community at every step and the Chinese government refuses to use its unique influence to force the Sudanese government to change its actions. In fact, China may even have prolonged the crisis by shielding Sudan against the collective efforts of the United Nations. The crisis is now in its 4th year with no end in sight and the suffering of men, women and children continues. That is why I am encouraging passage today of H. Res. 726. 
   H. Res. 726 requires the U.S. State Department and USAID to develop a women and girls Darfur initiative for the purpose of providing victims and potential victims of rape in Darfur, eastern Chad and the Central African Republic with much needed comprehensive and quality medical supplies and health services. 
   The bill also calls upon the Secretary General of the United Nations, the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, the African Union, the European Union, the Arab League and other nations to immediately take steps to ensure that a hybrid UN-African Union peacekeeping force is deployed that can properly protect women and girls from and respond to acts of rape and sexual violence.  
   We cannot stand still in the face of systematic and widespread rape in the Darfur region. The U.S. Congress has a moral obligation to reach out and do all it can to put an end to this tragedy. I strongly support this important piece of legislation and encourage my colleagues to do the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. VAN HOLLEN. (HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, today we consider the Senate Amendments to the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act to assist struggling homeowners, help stabilize the housing market and to help those homeowners who are being financially hurt by rising foreclosures in their neighborhoods. 
   Originally passed by this body in August of last year, this bill represents a compromise between the administration and Democratic and Republican congressional leaders, and retains most of its original provisions while incorporating the Administration's plan to provide explicit government backing for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The bill also provides emergency assistance for the redevelopment of abandoned and foreclosed homes to help stabilize the housing market and our neighborhoods. 
   To address one of the root causes of the mortgage crisis, the bill specifically targets the Federal Housing Administration and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
   The bill overhauls the FHA to increase the market share of mortgages they insure, raises loan limits for FHA-backed loans, boosts loan limits in high-cost areas, allows the agency to vary the premiums it charges borrowers based on their credit risk, and modifies disclosure requirements to provide more information concerning mortgage choices. The bill also creates a new independent agency to regulate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to place these entities into conservatorship or receivership in the event of a financial crisis. 
   In addition to providing assistance to home buyers and homeowners in the form of tax credits, and a reduction for real property taxes, the bill also provides assistance for low-income rental housing, and four billion dollars in additional Community Development Block Grant resources to help states and localities rehabilitate neighborhoods harmed by rising foreclosures. 
   Despite much evidence to the contrary, there are still many who think this bill is about bailing out Fannie Mae. As we all know, as mortgage defaults have risen and home prices have fallen, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have reported billions of dollars in realized and unrealized losses. Freddie Mac, for example, reported at the beginning of this month that if it had been forced to liquidate its holdings at the end of the quarter, it would have been left with a deficit of $5.2 billion. 
   It is crucial to American economic health that we work to keep these two important institutions on sound financial footing. According to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, due to the collapse of the housing bubble and the subsequent collapse in housing values, the vast majority of Americans are accumulating little or no wealth and are in danger of becoming completely reliant on Social Security and Medicare to support them in their retirement years. Since homeownership is the way most Americans accumulate wealth, and since Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac own or guarantee more than 40 percent of U.S. home mortgages, they cannot be allowed to fail. 
   This bill will help keep them from failing by increasing their available credit lines, allowing the Treasury Department to purchase their equity and allowing the Federal Reserve to reset their capital requirements. The funds provided by this bill will only be made available if the home loans these institutions guarantee default. By making additional financial support available to these institutions, Congress sends a clear message to investors that we stand by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and will not allow them to fail. If investors are reassured, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may not need to draw upon this funding. 
   Our economy is in crisis mode. The American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act is a necessary response to stabilize the housing market and to come to the aid of those Americans who are threatened by the rising number of foreclosures in their neighborhoods. 
   This is not a perfect bill--but it provides an urgent response to an urgent problem. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

   The 2008 State and Foreign Operations Appropriations bill reinforces the notion that foreign policy is about more than the use of military force and that foreign assistance and humanitarian aid are important components of foreign policy making. 
   The bill provides $949 million for Sudan, of which $210 million is for critical humanitarian and peacekeeping programs in Darfur. The remaining funds are for development assistance and to strengthen democratic institutions in southern Sudan. 
   Global health efforts also receive funding in this bill. The bill provides $5 billion for HIV/AIDS treatment, prevention and care programs around the world. 
   The bill also includes $501 million for clean energy and biodiversity programs worldwide. Educational and cultural exchanges receive more than $500 million to fund participation of over 42,000 individuals in educational, cultural, and professional exchange programs including Fulbright exchanges. 
   The bill also contains funding for programs in many countries around the world, including Pakistan.
