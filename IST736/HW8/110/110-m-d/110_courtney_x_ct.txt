<DOCNO>Mr. COURTNEY. (CONSUMER ENERGY SUPPLY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6578, the Consumer Energy Supply Act, which would require a 70 million barrel exchange of light oil from the SPR in exchange for heavier crude at a later date. I introduced similar legislation in May 2008 to exchange 50 million barrels of light crude oil. 
   I believe, it is critically important to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, SPR, to address our national energy crisis. The SPR was created to protect the United States from oil supply disruptions and is now more than 97 percent full, its highest level ever. Unfortunately, the Energy Department's Energy Information Administration announced on July 23, 2008 that non SPR crude oil stocks are down more than 55 million barrels from a year ago and distillate stocks are only a few million barrels above last year's levels. 
   As I travel around Connecticut's Second Congressional District and meet with my constituents, I hear from families, school administrators and businesses about their concerns with high energy prices. While gasoline prices continue to hover above $4 per gallon in eastern Connecticut, residents and heating oil dealers are also concerned about the price and supply of heating oil this year. 
   At an April 2008 hearing before the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, Melanie Kenderdine, with MIT and formerly of the Energy Department, testified that an exchange of 50 million barrels of light crude from the SPR ``could be expected to temporarily drive down oil prices without appreciably reducing the insurance value of the SPR in the near term.'' 
   In 2000, when heating oil stocks were low, the Administration undertook an exchange of 30 million barrels of oil from the SPR and the impact on prices was immediate. All of the oil was refined, despite worries about refining capacity, and crude oil prices dropped almost 20 percent. In addition, there were sufficient heating oil supplies that winter. 
   We need more oil on the market now to bring down the price of crude oil and gasoline and before the cold New England winter sets in. That is why I introduced my legislation and why I recognize that even more oil is needed on the market than my bill required. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6578.

<DOCNO>Mr. COURTNEY. (NEW ENGLAND NATIONAL SCENIC TRAIL DESIGNATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Chairman, I want to start by first of all thanking Chairman Grijalva who during this 110th Congress has shown that he is a true friend of the State of Connecticut with his advocacy on the 8-Mile River bill and now for the MMM Scenic Trail bill. 
   I also want to recognize Congressman Olver for his hard work on this issue, and Congressman Murphy and the other cosponsors of this legislation. 
   People are extremely excited who live in the area that will be affected by this trail. Again, I think it will be a wonderful step forward for New England. And as CHRIS said, reconnecting with its terrific natural beauty and natural heritage. 
   Four of the towns which this trail goes through touch Connecticut's Second District. Suffield, Durham, Haddam and Madison, at various points on the map that Congressman Murphy presented, are part of the national scenic trail. 
   This is a system, to sort of get back to the bill before us today and maybe away from some of the global issues which were just discussed, it was a system created in 1968. Twenty-three trails have been given designation by Congress during the last 40 years in a very nonintrusive way with no damage done to people's property rights, but in a way that is a partnership relationship between the Federal Government and local landowners and communities. 
   It is my understanding that the Governor of the State of Connecticut, Governor Rell, a Republican, is supporting a letter in support of the legislation. I think that is indicative of the feeling of the communities that are touched by it, certainly in the State of Connecticut, and particularly by the private, nonprofit Connecticut Forest and Park Association, which Mr. Bishop gave great praise to, and they deserve it for the work that they have done over the many years. 
   But I think it is important that when we talk about the work that they did, they are vigorous advocates and supporters of this legislation because they see it as consistent with the mission that they have carried out for 75 years, to keep the trail accessible to families, to individuals from all over the world. They deserve, I think, the biggest credit for their support for this legislation over the last few years. 
   Finally, I want to say in response to the prior speaker, the Members of the U.S. Senate from the State of Connecticut did support production of new sources of energy in the energy bill which was sent to the Senate. Production tax credits for geothermal wind and solar were paid for by taking away tax breaks for oil companies. Unfortunately, the opposition party in the Senate stripped those critical, important, necessary changes that our country is yearning for. We in the Northeast are as committed as any part of the country in terms of the need to transform our energy system so we will have a thriving economy that will be there for our children and our grandchildren.

<DOCNO>Mr. COURTNEY. (MAJORITY MAKERS -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Thank you, Congressman SUTTON, for yielding. 
   And I just want to follow up with my friend from the Armed Services Committee about the lack of strategic balance that presently is occurring right now in Iraq and Afghanistan. In late August, German authorities arrested three terrorists who were plotting a major attack on an American military installation in Germany. Where were they trained? Well, we know the answer. They were trained in northern Pakistan, in that region of the world where our own military and intelligence officials have identified the real threat to Europe and the U.S. in terms of where future hits are going to take place. 
   As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I was in Afghanistan in May. We had briefings from military commanders over there who have said that training camps are in full level of activity, and they made a flat prediction that we are going to see attempted attacks emanating from that region of the world. 
   Let's step back. We have 26,000 troops in Afghanistan; 165,000 troops in Iraq. Is this a strategy that is really aimed at what is in the national interest of this country? I mean obviously if we look at just recent events in terms of where arrests are taking place, where the real training is taking place to hit Europe and the U.S., the fact of the matter is it is in the northern part of Pakistan, which is an area that the Taliban is now pretty much able to move and operate unimpeded because we have a dysfunctional relationship with the Pakistani Government and the Afghan Government is too weak to basically police those borders. 
   And I think a lot of the debate that is taking place right now after the Petraeus-Crocker report, which is appropriately focused on whether or not the benchmarks that the Iraq Government set forth have been met and what is the level of wear and tear in terms of our Armed Forces, they are clearly important to discuss, but we also need to have an overall strategic vision about what is in the national interest of this country. And the fact is being involved at the level that we are at right now in a civil war in Iraq is not in America's national interest, and for the sake of our military families, as Congresswoman Shea-Porter indicated, and certainly for a safer, smarter foreign policy, we need to have a change in course and a redeployment. 
   Over the summer the New York Times did a study on the situation right now in terms of the mid-level officer corps of our Armed Services, our ground forces. In the 2001 graduating class from West Point, which just completed their 5-year tour of duty, 44 percent of the class have left the Armed Forces. That is the highest number in three decades. People need to think about that in terms of what is happening to the best and the brightest in our military. They are voting with their feet. They are leaving the armed services. And many commanders from the Vietnam era, General Shinseki being one of them, the Army chief of staff who had the wisdom and vision to predict that we would need hundreds of thousands of troops if we were going to truly police Iraq after Afghanistan, have spoken all across the country about the fact that what's happening in Iraq today is having the same effect, same negative effect, on our Armed Forces that the war in Vietnam had, which is a hollowed-out mid-level officer corps of our armed services. It took a generation to recover from that, and we are now seeing, with the exodus that is happening right now with, again, the best and brightest of our West Point graduates leaving our armed services, that we, for the sake of our own future, ground forces and military readiness, need to have a change of course in Iraq. 
   And Senator Webb has an amendment that's coming up, the Dwell Time Amendment, which will require the Armed Forces by law to make sure that our Armed Forces have the same amount of dwell time as they do deployment. I think that is an important step. I am very excited that it looks like we are going to get to the 60-vote number in the Senate and overcome a cloture, that we are going to start bringing some sanity back into our military and defense policy so that we don't destroy the greatest warfighting machine in the world. 
   And I know Congressman Welch from Vermont, my neighbor to the north and a good Red Sox fan, is also someone who has talked a lot about this issue in terms of the impact on our military families, and I would be happy to hear from Congressman Welch from Vermont.

<DOCNO>Mr. COURTNEY. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Chairman, 60 days ago I was still a small employer and a member of the chamber of commerce, which I had been for 25 years. And as someone coming from that background, listening to the claims from the other side about stripping workers of their right to a secret ballot or subjecting employers to coercion and duress, I was concerned about my good friends in the small business community who are wonderful people and work every day and have control of their own lives, that somehow we were harming them. 
   Read the law. Section (c)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act, which guarantees workers the right to a secret ballot election if a ``substantial number,'' only 30 percent, ask for it, is still preserved. It is not being repealed. 
   Secondly, this bill provides in section 2 that people who have claims of duress, coercion, fraud on the part of union organizers have an avenue, have a remedy with the National Labor Relations Board. 
   These cards are not the back of a napkin. There will be a process and a procedure which will be fair to employers and to workers. 
   What this bill is about is restoring balance in the law, which, as the chairman indicated, the facts demonstrate is hurting workers, and it is our job to restore that balance.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in full support of the civility provisions offered in part today as one of the new rules of the 110th Congress. I applaud the new Democratic leadership for offering this reform package, because our country needs a fair and functioning Congress if we are ever going to meet these huge challenges that we face as a Nation.  
   When my constituents in Connecticut's Second District voted for change, they knew to create that change. We need a legislative body that allows real debate and discussion, not a rush to judgment that deprives our democracy of good ideas. To achieve that goal, this rule will curb past abuses of this Chamber's processes. 
   This rule will prohibit votes being held open for the sole purpose of affecting the outcome, a practice that in the past damaged the public's confidence in laws passed by this institution. It will reform the conference committee process, a reform that will give all Members, the press and the American people, the opportunity to understand the content of legislation at its most critical moment, right before passage. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Gallup poll that came out recently December 19 ranked the Congress' performance that only 20 percent of the American people rated it good. It is time to fix the broken branch by adopting these rules.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Bishop-DeLauro-Courtney amendment. 
   It's unfortunate that it's necessary for the United States Congress to intercede into a pending matter before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. However, despite repeated warnings from independent, scientific, and public safety analysts that this application for a floating liquid natural gas facility in Long Island Sound needs more investigation, FERC has refused every request for more time to study the implications of this facility in one of the most populated areas of the United States. 
   The need for more time was highlighted again just a few weeks ago with the release of a 43-page report by the Government Accountability Office that looked at the public safety consequences of a terrorist attack on a tanker carrying liquid natural gas. GAO reviewed what would be the effect of a liquid LNG spill and explosion. 
   The bottom line: more research is needed. Experts disagreed on what would happen if there was a cascading failure of an LNG tanker, and GAO recommended that the Department of Energy study this issue more thoroughly. 
   GAO's report should settle the question of whether applications such as Broadwater should proceed. If DOE determines from an expert opinion that a cascading failure would cause a hazard beyond 1 mile, then this application is fatally flawed, literally. At some point it is incumbent on the Congress of the United States to act upon the recommendations of the GAO, which is an agency funded and created by us as an independent branch of government. 
   When GAO says that it is premature to conclude that LNGs are safe in populous areas of our Nation, then we have an obligation to act on that advice. This amendment accomplishes that goal. I strongly urge its passage.

   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, last week President Bush threatened to veto a bipartisan agreement that will provide health insurance to 10 million of America's children. 
   Before acting on this threat, the President should talk to our Nation's Governors, 43 of whom support a robust reauthorization of children's health insurance, known as SCHIP, set to expire this Sunday night. Governors such as Republican John Huntsman of Utah, Republican Tim Pawlenty of Wisconsin, Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, and Republican Jodi Rell of my State of Connecticut have all endorsed protecting this program, which the bipartisan agreement will accomplish. 
   Make no mistake about it; the President's plan will disqualify millions of American children from SCHIP coverage in the future. We already know, in Connecticut, 5,000 children will be kicked off the existing SCHIP program if his plan goes through. 
   Mr. Speaker, Republican and Democratic Governors together recognize the importance of a strong SCHIP program. It is time for him to listen to these Governors and back off his veto threat.

<DOCNO>Mr. COURTNEY. (ESTABLISHING A WELCOME HOME VIETNAM VETERANS DAY -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 189, a resolution that will honor the veterans of the Vietnam War in eastern Connecticut and across our country by calling for the establishment of a ``Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day.'' 
   As we know all too well, the Vietnam War was a painful and turbulent period in our Nation's history. Our military involvement there from 1965 to 1973 came at a time of great upheaval and change that divided our Nation. By the end of the war, more than 58,000 members of the Armed Forces had given the ultimate sacrifice. Much has rightfully been done to honor these lost heroes in the 30 years since the end of the war, including a breathtaking memorial not far away from this Capitol on our National Mall. 
   However, thousands of our troops came home after serving our country in Vietnam  only to be barraged by anti-war and anti-military sentiments rising from the deep and conflicting passions over our involvement in the conflict. As a result, thousands of young men who served our Nation were denied the welcome home they deserved--a painful memory that I hear about even today when I speak with Vietnam veterans. 
   Today, 30 years after they returned home, those dark days of war still haunt the veterans of Vietnam. Yet, I have been amazed by the strength and dignity of the Vietnam veterans community in eastern Connecticut. Since the end of the war, these proud men have been unmatched in taking care of their own and supporting one another. This past April, over 100 eastern Connecticut Vietnam veterans gathered once again in Norwich, CT for the 7th Annual Vietnam Veterans Day Commemorative Ceremony. I was proud to join them for the ceremony and to honor their service and sacrifice. 
   Regardless of what one thinks about our involvement in a military conflict, there is no doubt that any American who wears our Nation's uniform deserves a hero's welcome when they return home. That is why I am proud to support the resolution before us today, which expresses the sense of the House that there should be a day set aside every year on March 30 to honor the service of our Vietnam veterans by establishing a ``Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day.'' I sincerely hope that this simple resolution will provide our Vietnam veterans with the recognition they have so long deserved.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Chairman, it is an honor to stand in support of the Afghan Freedom and Security Support Act. 
   Exactly 1 week ago, I was in Afghanistan with a congressional delegation from the Armed Services Committee and had the opportunity to see firsthand both the progress and challenges that face the people of Afghanistan. It is a land of contrasts. On the upside there is a healthy political life. President Karzai, who met with our delegation, is clearly a dynamic, moderate, engaged leader who has a national government which is clearly focused on trying to move the country forward. There are clear signs of economic life. The shops were open. There was traffic. Schools were being built. Roads are being constructed, 16 percent growth of GDP over the last couple of years and a clear commitment to strengthening and building the Afghan army and police. In fact, our delegation was present at a graduation ceremony for the Afghan national police and handed out the diplomas to the young cadets who were taking on these important critical duties to Afghanistan's future. 
   There clearly are challenges, however. The reappearance of the narcotics trade; the resurgence of the Taliban; and the challenges in the border areas of Pakistan, which our military are fighting very bravely every day. Seven soldiers lost their lives the day that we were there because of the struggle that is still going on with the Taliban. 
   What is clearly needed, and this bill addresses it, is a strong, long-term commitment by this country to continue the efforts that have been made with our international allies, NATO allies, who were present also during our trip. French Marines, Scandinavian troops, Germans who are taking responsibility for control of some of the PRTs in the different provinces. And, clearly, lastly, most importantly, is the economic aid that is so critical to defeating the rise of the narcotics trade and defeating the Taliban. As one of the generals stated to us, where the roads end, the Taliban begins in Afghanistan. 
   Flying from Kabul to Jalalabad, we actually tracked a new road which was constructed by Chinese contractors that had heavy truck traffic and again showed that there were real opportunities in growth in that area which this bill will continue to build upon, and I applaud the chairman for his efforts and urge its unanimous passage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Chairman, I want to commend Chairman Miller for getting out ahead of the student lending issue before it becomes a full-fledged crisis. In March, the Education and Labor Committee heard testimony from the Secretary of Education, Margaret Spellings, and we urged her to take steps then to ensure student lending contingency plans were in place in the event of further troubles. Frankly, I was disappointed to learn that she and her team were only ``monitoring the situation.'' 
   It is imperative that students have uninterrupted access to student loans in the event that the mortgage crisis and credit crunch further ripple through the economy. Just yesterday, Citibank's student lending division announced it was going to stop lending at many  higher education institutions, though they wouldn't name which ones. This is troubling news since Citibank is the second largest originator of federal student loans. 
   I met with the Connecticut Commissioner of Higher Education and the Director of Financial Aid at the University of Connecticut last month and let me tell you--they are taking this issue seriously. Financial Aid offices across the state are communicating to students and families to finalize their education financing now. I have also personally taken part in getting the word out to my constituents as well. 
   Thankfully, Connecticut students also have backup from the state's own loan agency, the Connecticut Higher Education Supplemental Loan Authority, with $31 million to lend. 
   Right now, we don't know how deep the effects will be, but it is prudent that students and their parents are given some relief now. This bill will steer borrowers away from costlier private loans and give parents more time to pay off PLUS loans. And it is crucial that Secretary Spellings has the authority now to advance federal funds if necessary. 
   The federal government rushed in to bail out Bear Stearns. It is only right that we make sure that the federal government is ready to assist millions of students and families if the need arises.

<DOCNO>Mr. COURTNEY. (CELEBRATING THE 120-YEAR PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND STATE VETERANS HOMES -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 1335, introduced by my friend and colleague Mr. HODES, which rightly celebrates the 120-year partnership between Government and State veterans homes. 
   State Veterans Homes are a critical part of the care our veterans receive after serving our country. In my State of Connecticut, the State Department of Veterans Affairs has provided care for Veterans and their dependents for 144 years, since the opening of Fitch's Home for Soldiers and Their Orphans in Darien, Connecticut on July 4, 1864--the first such facility in the Nation. In 1940, the Fitch home became the Connecticut State Veterans hospital and was relocated to Rocky Hill, Connecticut, where Connecticut veterans today continue to receive a spectrum of care and assistance they so urgently need from dedicated professionals and volunteers. 
   In just a few weeks, Connecticut veterans will benefit from the opening of the first major new facility in Rocky Hill in over 65 years. The new veterans care facility will provide modern, state of the art care for Alzheimer's and hospice patients. From the new rooms that provide patients with long-needed privacy, to expanded lounge areas and family dining facilities that allow veterans to spend time with their families in a private and comfortable setting, the new facility will ensure that Connecticut veterans receive the dignified treatment they deserve. This exciting improvement was made possible by a strong Federal commitment to the State Home Construction Grant Program, which for 44 years has helped States like Connecticut meet the ever-increasing needs of our veterans by investing in long-term capital improvement projects. 
   I had the honor of visiting the Rocky Hill facility just this past weekend, where I attended Stand Down 2008. This one-day event is an annual outreach and support program that helps needy and homeless veterans to receive services and information from over 30 State, Federal and private organizations all assembled in one location. During my visit, I observed countless volunteers from organization across the State helping needy and struggling veterans receive a variety of services, including medical screenings, dental exams, legal assistance, housing referrals, assistance with Federal VA benefits and disability claims, job counseling and training, financial assistance and debt counseling; education programs and services and everyday necessities such as free haircuts, clothing and supplies. 
   At last year's Stand Down, 750 needy veterans came to Rocky Hill to receive assistance. This year, that number is expected to reach 900 or more, an increase largely fueled by the growing needs of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the impact of the economic downturn on our neediest veterans. Our State Commissioner of Veterans Affairs, Dr. Linda Schwartz, has helped bring new life into this yearly event, making it an effective way to ensure that veterans have access to the services and care they need. Under her leadership, Connecticut is stepping up to ensure that no veteran who has served their Nation is left behind. Yet, as gratifying as it was to see veterans being helped at Stand Down, the growth in the number of veterans taking advantage of the event is a stark reminder of how much more our Nation must do to ensure that our promise to those who have served is fulfilled. 
   I ask all my colleagues to join me in thanking the countless professionals at the Connecticut Department of Veterans Affairs, volunteers and organizations that came together at Connecticut's Stand Down in helping to make a difference in the lives or our veterans.

<DOCNO>Mr. COURTNEY. (FRESHMEN DEMOCRATS CELEBRATE COMPLETING 100-HOUR AGENDA -- (House of Representatives - January 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. I want to follow-up on your opening comments on the heels of the prior group that was here that seemed to suggest that freshmen were being suppressed in the opening 100 hours of the 110th Congress. As we all know, nothing would be further from the truth. 
   Our level of participation in the floor debate and in the design of this agenda could not have been more robust and full from the beginning of the process to the end.     
   Where we, I think, learned our information about the content of that agenda was on the campaign trail talking to the people in our district. These are ideas that have been out there for a long time. If anything has been suppressed or held back, in fact, it was the 100 hours agenda, not the process or the new Members of Congress that are again beginning our time here in the House. 
   As an undergraduate in Boston, I used to walk by Powder House Square in Cambridge past the home of Tip O'Neill who at that time was Speaker of this body, the predecessor of the gentleman in the chair. He was a wonderful man. He is certainly not maybe the typical blow-dried politician of the 21st century but he had a street wisdom that I think still resonates to this day. Of course, he coined the most famous phrase, which is that all politics is local. I was asked by a local reporter about where does this 100 hours agenda fit into the district. When are you guys going to start dealing with the Second Congressional District where I come from, eastern Connecticut. 
   The fact of the matter is if you go down this list of the 100 hours agenda, you can find exactly where in eastern Connecticut it matters, starting with homeland security. In my district, we have the Port of New London. We have more of Long Island Sound than any other congressional district in Connecticut. There are thousands of container cargo ships that every month pass up and down the Race in Long Island Sound. Today we have a situation where only a tiny fraction of those containers have been screened before they have reached that point. This is a large population center in our country. Yet despite the fact that the 9/11 Commission recommendations were out there telling us that we need to go a safer direction in terms of screening that cargo, it wasn't done by the prior Congress. 
   Secondly, the commission recommended that we would have funding based on need, not politics. It was one of the recommendations that the Chairs of the commission in their fifth year anniversary of 9/11 pointed to as the biggest failing of the prior Congress. Yet in the State of the Connecticut where we received almost $60 million funding in homeland security funding 3 years ago, it had dropped to $15 million last year, leaving first responders high and dry in terms of the investment that they were trying to make in communications equipment and systems that would actually protect the people of our area. New York and the World Trade Center is not very far from my district. We lost people in the Second Congressional District on 9/11 and H.R. 1 right out of the box did everything in the world for my local community, my district, in terms of making us safer and stronger as a district and as a State. 
   In terms of student loans, my district is the home of the University of Connecticut, Eastern Connecticut State University, three community colleges, Mitchell College, Conn College. As Mr. Wilson indicated, this bill will literally make a difference between whether or not students go to college and stay in college or not. It is as simple as that. There was probably no other decision of the 109th Congress that was more out of touch than the decision to cut by $12 billion aid for student loans. What we did a couple of days ago was take a big step in terms of reversing that damage to the system. 
   On the Education and Labor Committee on which I sit with Congresswoman Hirono from Hawaii, we are going to follow up on that down payment to address Pell Grants, to revise the reauthorization of the Higher Ed Act to make sure that we build a system that will create a workforce for the 21st century. 
   Those are just two small examples where we kept faith with the voters. And with Speaker O'Neill's famous words about all politics is local, I think our class was a big part of that process over the last week. It has been terrific working with all of you and I think it is going to be a great time ahead of us in the 110th Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of Chairman Peterson's bill, which is a logical follow-on to Tuesday's energy bill that had two goals: number one, to bring immediate relief to consumers; and, two, to bring long-term solutions to America's energy challenges. This bill will go a long way to bring accountability to the price of a critical commodity, oil, which is the lifeblood of our economy. 
   The facts are clear, before energy commodities trading was exempted from CFTC oversight, about 70 percent of the energy futures trading was done by energy companies, 30 percent was done by speculators. Today those numbers are reversed, and the trading volume has increased sixfold. 
   As an old friend of mine, who has been in the scrap metal business in Willimantic, Connecticut, for 30 years said, commodity markets were never intended to be investment markets. Yet that is what they have become, and consumers and small businesses cannot keep up with the huge price swings occurring every day with no apparent connection to supply and demand. 
   These huge price swings have a direct result on my constituents in eastern Connecticut who are facing dire circumstances if home heating oil remains at high and unstable prices this fall and winter. It is time that Congress took additional steps to make sure that all markets, including foreign boards of trade, operate with CFTC oversight. We must bring transparency and stability to energy trading. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. COURTNEY. (NO CHILD LEFT INSIDE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Chairman, this is the ultimate friendly amendment to this very solid bill, on which I commend the gentleman from Maryland for his leadership. Based on Mr. McKeon's positive comments earlier, I should probably make this very short and sweet. 
   In a nutshell, what this amendment does is it encourages organizations that apply for this environmental education grant program to describe on their application for Federal grants how they have partnered or how they intend to partner with a State or with a local park and recreation department. 
   As was mentioned in the earlier colloquy, Park and Recreation Departments all over the country already are very involved in environmental education programs, and that certainly holds true also for State park systems. 
   In Connecticut, we actually have a program, by coincidence, called the No Child Left Inside Program, which was instituted in 2006 by the Republican Governor of Connecticut, Jodi Rell, and by her outstanding commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, which again is following exactly the same mission that Mr. Sarbanes' bill is following, to encourage children to get outside, to experience nature, to learn about nature, and to hopefully stimulate an interest in environmental science, which again, as has been said many times here during the earlier debate, is an important way to make sure that we get children engaged and involved in science, technology, engineering, and math, which the education committee has spent many hours wrestling with because we clearly have an educational system which is not producing enough scientists and engineers to meet the workforce challenges of our country. 
   The Connecticut program utilizes State park systems which, again, are perfectly established right now to provide trained personnel, transportation equipment and programs funding to again provide a very solid and an enriching experience in nature. They work together with school systems in a variety of programs. 
   The Appalachian Connection program, which again uses the Appalachian Trail which goes through Connecticut, works collaboratively with school systems to bring children out to the Appalachian Trail. It's just an extraordinary part of Connecticut's environment. 
   In Bolton, Connecticut, they have the geography in October program. In Preston, Connecticut, there is a recycling program, which again is operated through the No Child Left Inside Program. 
   There are many examples of where working in collaboration between the State's park system and local school boards has really, again, provided a perfect model and an example of what this legislation seeks to achieve. 
   The National Recreation and Park Association and local parks departments all over the country have endorsed this amendment. It's a ``may'' not ``shall'' amendment, so it is purely voluntary in terms of encouraging local school districts to participate.     
   In conclusion, I just wanted to comment on some of the prior discussion regarding the energy needs of this country and how come we are taking up a bill like this. 
   In my State, where we have an active nuclear power plant that provides 40 percent of the power of the State, we build nuclear submarines in my district, if you talk to people in the industry, an industry which in America has not built a nuclear reactor since 1973, in fact the biggest challenge is not financing or national energy policy, because we have over 20 new applications for new nuclear reactors before the NRC today. If you talk to the people in the industry, their biggest challenge is human capital, that the average age of a nuclear engineer in this country is over age 55. 
   Because of that gap, which has existed because for a million different reasons, if we are really serious about promoting nuclear power as an avenue in the future, and with the cap and trade debate that is looming on the horizon in the future I believe it is going to be part our energy portfolio, the fact of the matter is we have to get serious about getting kids engaged and involved in science and engineering. And Mr. Sarbanes' legislation is all about that. It is exactly focused on the real energy needs that we have in this country, which is to create the scientists and engineers that are going to provide the solutions in all of the above avenues. 
   Madam Chairman, with that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, yesterday on the ``Lee Elci Show,'' in New London, Connecticut, Bill from Groton called in while I was on and informed us that to lock in for next winter in Connecticut, it costs now $5.80 a gallon. 
   Mr. Speaker, we've heard a lot about the hardship of high gas prices. If home heating oil stays at those levels, there will be a catastrophe this winter in terms of keeping people alive because they cannot afford those prices. All of the proposals we've heard from the other side are going to take 20 years, even if it goes perfectly according to plan. People need relief now. 
   President Bush, with one stroke of the pen, could release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We would have more oil into the market in 13 days. That's the type of short-term relief that consumers, particularly in the northern parts of this country, need if they are going to survive this winter. 
   We doubled the size of energy assistance in the Democratic budget. The Bush plan would have cut energy assistance incredibly given the fact that these prices are going through the roof. We need Democratic priorities to provide short-term relief and long-term solutions for the American consumer.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Wellstone Parity Act. This legislation will move our country forward to a more intelligent,  humane, and cost-effective health care system. 
   Intelligent because it recognizes a scientific fact, that mental illness and disease can be diagnosed and treated like any physical illness and disease. 
   Humane because it will provide relief and care for millions who suffer needlessly. 
   And cost-effective because providing access to primary mental health treatment saves much more expensive catastrophic health care costs and increases productivity of workers suffering from illnesses such as depression and alcoholism. 
   This is not just a theoretical claim, Mr. Speaker. States like the State of Connecticut, which I come from, have had an operational parity bill for a number of years. It is precisely because of that fact that the carefully crafted language surrounding ERISA by the Education and Labor Committee was designed to protect existing parity laws for State-regulated health care plans. We did not want to have a bill that resulted in States ending up going backwards rather than forwards, and commissioners from States like Wisconsin and Connecticut weighed in and advised our committee to, again, make sure that we design the ERISA language carefully to protect State-regulated plans. 
   Finally, this legislation adheres to fiscally sound PAYGO rules. And on that note, I would again salute the work that's been done and will work to make sure that these policies in the bill will not stifle research and development for new medical cures and treatments to help those suffering from mental health and addiction problems. 
   Again, I urge passage of this strong, bipartisan legislation. It is long overdue that our country move in this direction.

   In eastern Connecticut, where I come from, the price of gas has reached its highest level in history, $3.26 today, up 31 cents from a month ago, and more than $1 since February. 
   The Government Accountability Office reported on Tuesday that the increasing gasoline prices have cost consumers an extra $20 billion this year, and we are only in May. That is a tax on consumers. It is a tax on small businesses. It has a ripple effect all throughout our economy. 
   And this is not just about driving over Memorial Day weekend. This is about whether or not energy prices are going to cripple the ability of this economy to grow and thrive and prosper. 
   It is time to put accountability into the system. The Stupak bill is not price controls, it is a system to make sure that the price is a fair one and is justifiable according to market conditions. Those are the tools that we are giving to the Federal Trade Commission.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I have got a feeling that people in this Chamber have heard more about the Eightmile River in Connecticut than they probably ever wanted to. But I want to thank Chairman Grijalva and Chairman Rahall, intelligent, thoughtful people who understand the 10 years of hard work that has taken place in the communities of Salem, Lyme and East Haddam, Connecticut, to get to this day is worth proceeding and moving forward. 
   There are 168 rivers in this country that have been designated as Wild and Scenic, and the Federal Government has not swept in and seized property as part of this program. This is a program which is aimed at preserving water quality and species, and it is very clear in the act that the government will waive any powers of condemnation if they are satisfied that there are zoning and wetland regulations in place which will accomplish those goals. And that is exactly the situation here. 
   These three towns have wetland regulations which have been on the books before the application for Wild and Scenic status ever took place which the Parks Department checked off on its box as adequate to achieve the goals of this program, and thus the statute specifically states that the condemnation powers shall not apply to this property. 
   When this issue came up 3 weeks ago, newspapers back home looked at it and just said the claims of the other side are just not true. And that is why the Republican Governor of the State of Connecticut, Jodi Rell; the Republican First Selectman of the Town of Lyme; the Republican First Selectman of the Town of Salem; and the Democratic First Selectman, who's a pretty good guy too, have all come out in support of this legislation because it has been a grassroots community effort, bipartisan, property owners and public officials, to make the Eightmile River part of the family of rivers in this country which have been identified as worth preserving for our children and our grandchildren. 
   The bill that was drafted by nonpartisan staff follows the basic legislative format that this Congress has followed in the past for Wild and Scenic status. In fact, the prior Congress which was controlled by the Republicans, the 109th Congress, proceeded on a river designation in the State of New Jersey without any of the language which is included in the motion to recommit. If it was such a big deal, why didn't the other side, when they were in control, actually adopt that language? 
   I think, frankly, folks, we are talking about politics here and not policy. And again I want to thank Mr. Grijalva for his strong support.

   Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Clay. I also want to thank Congressman Westmoreland for his kind words in support of H.R. 3325, which I'm the sponsor of, to name the post office at 235 Mountain Road in Suffield, Connecticut, after Corporal Stephen R. Bixler, who at the age of 20, on a second deployment in Iraq, lost his life serving our Nation. 
   As the prior speakers have indicated, this young man was not with us long, but made an extraordinary mark on all who knew him and served with him, particularly in his home of Suffield, Connecticut, which is a small Connecticut town of 14,000 people. It was founded in 1749 before our Nation even was born, and his family on his mother's side goes back three generations. As you can imagine, in a tight-knit, small community, he was well-known despite being a quiet young man because of his work in the community as an Eagle Scout. He was a varsity track athlete and an outstanding student. 
   He had a twin sister, Sandra, who graduated with honors from the University of Connecticut; and, clearly, Stephen could have followed that same path. But he followed a road less traveled, and he enlisted for the Marines before he even graduated from Suffield High School and, as I indicated, was on his second tour of duty when he lost his life on May 4, 2006. 
   His funeral at Sacred Heart Church in Suffield, which was attended by Archbishop Mansell from the Hartford Archdiocese, was an extraordinary outpouring of support from his community. And all I can say is that event was not the end as far as the town was concerned. They have held many ceremonies in memory of Stephen. They named a stretch of road in Suffield in his memory. 
   And it is fitting that the post office, which is the only Federal building in Suffield, should be named in his honor. His father has been a letter carrier for 35 years in the United States Post Office; but to be sure, our office solicited requests from the community to make sure that there was actual support in town. We had an outpouring of support: 170 letters came in, again, people who knew him as a young child all the way up through his time in the Marines, and I will submit letters from the Governor on down in support of this measure at this point.

Those prices are 72 cents higher than last year in New London County, 42 cents higher than just last month. Commercial fishermen on Long Island Sound have seen their fuel costs double, truck drivers have seen their diesel prices more than double in the last year. 
   Dozens of Members of Congress have written to President Bush asking him, with one stroke of the pen, to change the delivery schedule for the Strategic Petroleum Oil Reserve, which is a tried and true practice that he himself exercised in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina which brought down the price of gas by 40 cents at a time when the price per barrel was $75. Today, at $120 per barrel, it is time for President Bush to listen to the people of this country, Members of Congress, who are asking him to exercise his power to bring down the price of gas. And our Congress, the Democratic-led Congress, is going to keep the pressure on the President until he listens to the people of this country and avoids smothering our attempts to bring this country out of recession with the economic stimulus package.

We are the higher ed district of the State of Connecticut. New loan assistance and aid through grants in the amount of $130 million will be coming to Connecticut as a result of this measure being passed, which, again, is great news for my district. 
   Frankly, this bill is about something more than just parochial priorities, which are very important to my district. It's also about the change of direction that this new Congress is keeping faith with with passage of this legislation. 
   When I campaigned last year as a challenger in the closest race in America, the decision of the last Congress to take $12 billion out of the higher education account and use it to raise interest rates on student loans for the  purpose of making sure that the Paris Hilton stratum of American society was going to get their tax cuts was a perfect symbol for how out of touch the prior Congress was with the needs of America. 
   Passing this legislation will keep faith with the voters who had the courage to vote for change.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, H.R. 5, introduced by Mr. Miller in the opening hours of this Congress, begins the critical work we must do as a Nation to build an economy that is based on an educated workforce. 
   Make no mistake about it. The economic health of our country will turn on whether or not our children have the educational tools to compete and succeed. And make no mistake about it, all the present trends in access to higher education point to danger. 
   The bipartisan National Conference on State Legislatures issued a report last month which described higher education in America as a system in crisis, largely due to the Federal Government's declining commitment to keeping higher education affordable. 
   Coming from a congressional district that is home to the University of Connecticut, this finding comes as no shock. Students and their families all testify to the same grim condition: tuition has gone up 41 percent since 2001, college costs have gone up faster than health care over the last 25 years, and in Connecticut, college is increasingly becoming the sole province of the well-to-do. 
   According to the Hartford Current, 58 percent of Connecticut's young people from the top income tier are in school, and only 16 percent in the lowest are enrolled. Students are leaving college burdened with record levels of debt, and many are forced to leave early because of economic hardship. 
   Even though all these disturbing trends are occurring, the last Congress did the unthinkable. It cut $12 billion of Federal assistance for college loans, pushing up the rate of interest for students. No other budget decision of the last Congress demonstrated how disconnected its priorities were than this cut, which hurt not only just students but America's future. 
   H.R. 5 will begin to repair the damage of the 109th Congress' harmful cuts to student hopes and America's economic future. It will reduce the rates of student loans by 50 percent over a 5-year period, and it will do it in a fiscally responsible manner with offsets, not an increase in the deficit. 
   Chairman Miller deserves great credit for H.R. 5 and represents a down payment on the efforts of the Education and Workforce Committee to strengthen, and not weaken, our economic future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, stigmas surrounding mental health illness have negatively impacted disease acceptance, and in turn, access to quality care and treatment. For too long, members of our eastern Connecticut community and Americans across our nation have suffered the consequences of these inequalities in our health care system. Today, we have the opportunity to ease access to quality care and treatments for those with mental illness by passing the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (H.R. 6983). 
   In 1996, the Mental Health Parity Act codified the first national mental health parity requirements, mandating that annual and lifetime dollar limits on coverage for mental health treatment be no less than those for physical illness. While this legislation marked a monumental achievement with improving access to mental health care and treatments, more must be done. 
   Throughout the 110th Congress, the House and Senate have worked on mental health parity legislation that will extend coverage requirements beyond those established in the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996. The Mental Health Parity Act (S. 558) introduced in the Senate and the Paul Wellstone Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (H.R. 1424), which I cosponsored in the House, both extend coverage mandates to include equity in copayments, deductibles, as well as in- and out-of-network coverage. On March 5, 2008 and September 17, 2007, the House and Senate respectively passed H.R. 1424 and S. 558 with bipartisan support. The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act reflects a compromise between the House and Senate bills, and more broadly, an equitable standard for mental health care coverage. 
   Mr. Speaker, nearly one in four Americans suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder. By passing the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act we recognize the prevalence and seriousness of mental health illness as well as the need for expanded coverage. I ask my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of this critical legislation.

   Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, the long-festering situation at Walter Reed's Building 18 is nothing short of a national scandal. I am pleased that the new 110th Congress is taking critical steps this week to investigate problems at the facility, and hold accountable leaders that allowed these conditions to deteriorate to this disgraceful state. 
   Last week, I met with veterans from my district to express deep concern about the lack of adequate transportation for veterans, the increasing length of time it takes for veterans to receive benefits or access health care and the stagnant funding of the VA system over the last 6 years. And they describe a system unable to cope with increasing patients at a time of war. 
   The challenges faced by these Connecticut veterans are emblematic of a military and VA health system swamped by the influx of wounded from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and shortfalls of funding to adequately care for them caused by the misplaced priorities of the last Congress. 
   In the first days of this new Congress, we took an important step to address this problem by providing an additional $3.6 billion for veterans health care, yet as my constituents related, there remain critical issues that need to be addressed as we move forward. The men and women who serve this country deserve nothing less than a health care system worthy of their service and sacrifice.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Thank you, Congressman Lynch, for letting me join in on today's resolution. 
   I come from the southern end of Red Sox Nation in eastern Connecticut. We are still closer to Fenway Park than we are to Yankee Stadium or Shea Stadium, so it's still safe for me to publicly speak out on this resolution. 
   As someone from a multigenerational Red Sox family like Mr. Capuano, we suffered and worried and have terrible memories, but obviously this is not our fathers' Red Sox any more.     
   This is a great team that combined a lot of new players, Dustin Pedroia, ``Jake'' Jacoby Ellsbury, Daisuke Matzusaka, along with the 2004 veterans of the last World Series, to again have another great exciting season, particularly the ALCS where they came back down 3-1. 
   As Mr. Capuano said, Red Sox Nation extends far and wide. Last March I was on board the USS Alexandria, a nuclear submarine out of Groton, Connecticut, under the ice in Alaska. I spent a day driving around with a great crew, professional and just so impressive in the work they do for our Nation. Sat down for breakfast after sleeping onboard the ship and was immediately confronted by the sailors who said they had only one question for me. I figured it was the war on Iraq, health care. And the one question was, Yankees or Red Sox? I was able to reassure them that I was a Red Sox fan, since they all were as well. 
   But one of the sailors indicated to me that he was coming up for re-enlistment and his dream was to do it in Fenway Park in front of the Green Monster. When I came back to Washington, we contacted President Lucchino of the Red Sox, who bent over backwards for this sailor and his family, his fiance, and they did, in fact, stage a re-enlistment ceremony in front of the Green Monster, wearing the 2004 ring as he signed the papers, committing himself again to our Nation. And I just want to read from the Boston Globe the comment of Petty Officer Vecchione who said, ``It's a sacred place. I had the ring on my finger as if I was married to the Red Sox for a few minutes.'' 
   And I think really what that incident showed, though, is that we have a management who sees that it's a two-way street in Red Sox Nation. We love our players, but they love their fans; and that's why we have such a great fan base who are so passionate about this incredible team that goes back to the early days of baseball. 
   And I appreciate again the bipartisan support and even the support from some Members who root for other teams in this resolution and urge its passage.

It took persistent leadership to, again, get 61 measures all here, ready for vote and final passage and transmittal to the White House. 
   Included in this bill, section 344, is the language which was included in H.R. 986 legislation, which we debated and passed last July, the designation of the Eightmile River in Connecticut, Wild and Scenic designation. This is an effort that has taken 10 years in the State of Connecticut. It's a river that is 8 miles long, extends from East Haddam through Salem, into Lyme, and then to Hamburg Cove on Long Island Sound. 
   It is one of the most pristine treasures in a highly densely populated part of the country, one of the original colonies, where we respect property rights dearly in the State of Connecticut. Over that 10-year period, a balanced process was followed, which brought consensus among all the communities, bipartisan support, the Republican Governor of Connecticut, the entire delegation from Connecticut, and particularly Senator Dodd, who led the fight in the Senate for passage. And the communities who have worked so hard to preserve this extraordinary body of water are, again, anxious and excited to see final passage, which will take the Eightmile River and make it part of the family of rivers that have received the Wild and Scenic designation over the 40 years of that act's existence in this country, 160 rivers. 
   Again, I want to salute the Resources Committee for the hard work that they did to make sure that the Eightmile River plan will now become a reality.

   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, in the wake of the Vietnam War, retired General Colin Powell outlined the Powell Doctrine, which stated simply that any future military action should include ``massive force and a plausible exit strategy to avoid endless entanglement.'' 
   As we now know, from the very start of military operations in March 2003, President Bush fought the war in Iraq with an inadequate number of troops and never had an exit strategy, but simply believed the ideologues in the White House that Iraq would blossom into a self-governing democracy. On every score, his policy ignored the Powell Doctrine. 
   The President's veto on Tuesday of this week failed the test of the Powell Doctrine again. He rejected the plausible exit strategy outlined in the Iraq supplement, namely, a responsible redeployment of our troops out of Iraq's civil war 15 months from now, and instead reembraced his own policy of endless entanglement. 
   The people of this country deserve more than the political spin contained in the President's televised veto. We need to see his own plausible exit strategy, and, frankly, we need to see it from those who voted to sustain his veto, as General Powell put it. But, even more important, our soldiers and their families who are bearing the brunt of this war deserve a President who heeds the lessons of past military mistakes, not one who keeps repeating them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman Woolsey for her leadership by managing this resolution this afternoon and for Congresswoman Foxx's strong support that she just articulated very powerfully. 
   As Congresswomen Woolsey and Foxx stated, the statistics that the resolution lays forth clearly show the grave seriousness of this problem of child abuse all across America. In addition, though, just to the horrible trauma to the victims of child abuse, which by itself would be reason to fight this problem, society pays a huge price due to the high incidence of alcoholism, depression, drug abuse, eating disorders, and criminal behavior that has been clearly shown to occur in the later lives of too many children who were abused and neglected. 
   Recent statistics, for example, show that 14 percent of all men in prison in the United States were abused as children and 36 percent of women in prison were abused as children. And it is easy sometimes to get very discouraged about the numbers that just seem to suggest a problem that is growing almost out of control. In Connecticut, the State where I come from, for example, in between 1990 and 2003, the incidence of reported child abuse actually doubled. But I would suggest that perhaps we should look at those numbers in a different fashion, because what is also happening out there is that as a country, we are prepared, as never before in the past, to confront this issue. Mandated reporting laws now require that doctors, mental health providers and professionals in all arrays of professions that deal with families and children are now required by law to report incidents of abuse which in the past would have been swept under the rug. And that is one of the reasons why the number of cases are going up. 
   In addition, I think we should also be encouraged by a smarter and more effective approach that is being developed to fight child abuse, the multidisciplinary teams that are pulling together police, social workers, prosecutors, health care providers, nurse practitioners and doctors who are now systematically working together to make sure, number one, that complaints are dealt with accurately, but also that victims are diagnosed, treated and interviewed in an organized fashion so that there is more effective prosecution of cases. 
   If it seems as though I may be a little bit passionate about this issue, it is because my wife, Audrey, has been a pediatric nurse practitioner for 18 years in Connecticut, has worked at Saint Francis Hospital at Hartford and Windham Hospital as part of the multidisciplinary team, again, that is employing the best techniques possible to make sure that complaints are handled intelligently, swiftly and also in a comprehensive fashion so that prosecutions are not lost or neglected due to the fact that we don't have systems in place to make sure that the cases are handled in an effective manner. 
   This resolution, I think, adds to both of those positive trends by putting the spotlight on this issue to make sure that we, as a country, are prepared to confront the issue, to talk about it openly, to talk about the numbers that are out there and the terrible consequences that we face as a society when we don't deal with the issue. 
   So hopefully this year, like prior years, as Congresswoman Foxx indicated, April will act as a month where awareness will continue to grow, that we are going to continue to, as a society, deal with this issue honestly and frankly so that, A, we will protect our children who are our most valuable national treasure, and, B, that we will have systems that are prepared to effectively prosecute and punish perpetrators, and finally, that we are going to treat and care for people who have been abused in such a terrible fashion, because it helps not only them, but it helps American society. 
   So again, I applaud Congresswoman Woolsey for bringing this measure out on the floor this afternoon and I urge unanimous passage when it comes up for a vote later this evening.

   Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise in the well today to talk about an event that occurred last weekend on Saturday in Tolland, Connecticut, which is a suburban town about 20 miles east of Hartford. 
   The Connecticut State Dental Society held an open free clinic under a program called Mission of Mercy, which is a group of dentists around the country that organize operatories and equipment to go into communities and basically open the doors and say anybody who needs dental care, come and we will take care of you. The advertising for this event in Connecticut was modest. There were some TV public service announcements, there were some small notices in the press. 
   The Dental Society had organized about 180 dentists, a number of hygienists and staff to be with the group that morning. Much to their amazement, people started lining up for this event at 6 o'clock the prior evening, Friday evening, and by 4 o'clock in the morning, when the dentists actually arrived to start setting up the operation, there were already 350 people waiting in line to get their care. By 5 o'clock in the morning, the crowd had grown to the point where the Connecticut State Police had to come out and actually turn people away. 
   At about 5:30 in the morning, the heavens opened up. There was thunder, lightning, and it rained, it was pouring rain, hard rain on the crowd, and none would leave, because they were terrified of losing their place in line and being deprived of the opportunity to get an extraction, to get a filling, to get their teeth cleaned, because they were so desperate to get dental care. Looking at the pictures in the press the following day of people literally huddled in the rain waiting to try and get an opportunity to get their teeth taken care of, it really made you wonder what country are we living in. 
   Tolland, Connecticut, where this is being held, is suburban Connecticut. This is not a distressed area. This is not an urban area with large pockets of chronic poverty. It is a suburban area with working families and working individuals who definitely earn a paycheck and provide a standard of living that would be described as middle class for themselves and their families. But when I joined the dental clinic later in the day around 1 o'clock in the afternoon, 800 people were at that point lined up to be served. They had turned away hundreds of others. People were waiting in the stands of a gymnasium, waiting for an opportunity to get their teeth taken care of. 
   Now, why am I talking about this on the floor of the United States Congress? The reason is because there is  legislation that has been sitting on the President's desk, the SCHIP bill, the children's health insurance extension, over which there has been a lot of fighting and debating going on in this Chamber over the last few months or so. 
   One of the overlooked parts of that legislation is that in addition to standardizing a 300 percent poverty threshold so that working families would have an opportunity to have their children covered by health insurance, it would also strengthen the dental coverage under the SCHIP program. 
   If you talk to any dentist or any healthcare provider in this country, they will tell you that under the existing SCHIP program, the dental coverage is inadequate. That is why in those stands in that high school gymnasium there were families with children who have never had their teeth cleaned, who needed in some instances to have their teeth extracted because of the fact that they have no other type of decent coverage for their dental care. 
   Unfortunately, President Bush has twice vetoed this legislation, legislation that has been endorsed by the March of Dimes, by the Catholic Hospital Association, by the American Medical Association, by the Pharmaceutical Association of America, a broad consensus of stakeholders in the healthcare system that have come together and said if there is one area of dispute that we ought to agree on as Americans, it is that children should have their health insurance covered. In particular, we should make that sure that oral and dental healthcare is done in a fashion to make sure they are going to have a lifetime of decent dental care. Because if you talk to anyone who is in pediatrics, they will tell you that dental care, dentistry care, is essential to making sure that a young person will grow and thrive. 
   Well, what we saw in Connecticut on Saturday is I think a perfect example of how broken the system is. What is frustrating to me, and I think so many others, is that we have an opportunity with a piece of legislation to make a real difference in the lives of young children in America, to make sure that they will not be stuck in the pouring rain and in thunder and lightning, so they can get access to what I think almost any reasonable person would describe as basic, fundamental, decent healthcare. 
   Madam Speaker, I have a copy of the Hartford Courant coverage of this extraordinary event that took place in Connecticut from the Sunday Hartford Courant edition which I am going to ask to be made part of the Record. I would just like to read the final passage of the article, which described a 67-year-old Stafford Springs woman, which is, again, a suburb of Connecticut. 
   ``As she walked back to her parking lot with no umbrella, soaking wet from the rain, struggling to catch her breath from the walk, the woman said she had come to get her tooth pulled, but already knew she would never get in. Like the others, she can't afford dental insurance.'' When she was asked what she was going to do, she said, ``Just going to pray, I guess.'' 
   She should be able to ask for more than that. She should ask for real action by this Congress to pass healthcare legislation so that Americans will get the care they need. 
   Madam Speaker, I include the article for the Record.  
   Many Turned Away From Free Dental Care Clinic  
   The line of taillights glowing in the pre-dawn darkness snaked back nearly a mile from the old Tolland High School on Saturday. 
   Closer to the school, people were walking along the side of the road, a steady stream of dark silhouettes rising out of the morning mist like refugees in a war zone. 
   There were elderly couples clutching their canes, hunched-over veterans, single mothers with young children in tow. A woman on crutches limping along. 
   It was 5 a.m., and they came by the hundreds, a throng of pilgrims with a common goal--free dental care. 
   Some heard about it on the radio, others saw it on TV or read about it in the newspaper. Connecticut's Mission of Mercy, the first ever single, large-scale free dental clinic to be offered in the state. 
   ``This shows we have a broken system and have to find some way to correct it,'' said Dr. Bob Schreibman, a Glastonbury pediatric dentist and one of the Connecticut mission's organizers. ``This is not a solution. This is a stop-gap measure to address people's immediate needs. This points out there is a huge need even in this, the richest state in the country.'' 
   Inside the school, more than 190 volunteer dentists were waiting along with 800 volunteers. Free fillings, check-ups, extractions. No questions asked. 
   The high school's cafeteria and gym were outfitted like a field hospital, with 60 dental chairs shipped in from the Midwest, portable X-ray machines and boxes upon boxes of latex gloves and sterilized dental tools. 
   The crush of patients was so large that by 7 a.m., people were being turned away. 
   When Carol Dingledey, executive director of the Connecticut State Dental Association, arrived to set up at 4 a.m., there were already 350 people outside the door. Some came the night before and camped out. Others drove hours in the dark hoping to be seen. 
   ``It just goes to show you how many people don't have dental insurance,'' said Mary, a 70-year-old woman, standing in a line of about 100 people outside the school at 5:30 a.m. 
   Leaning on her cane, Mary, who didn't want to give her last name, said she spent her entire life working and raising nine children and grandchildren. Now on limited income, she can't afford dental insurance, never mind pay fees out of her pocket. She hasn't been to a dentist in eight years. Her teeth hurt. She needs a filling, and a cap had come off. 
   ``I've never been on welfare; I've never had to struggle to get by,'' Mary said. ``But here it is. This is the bottom of the line. I'm just trying to get by.'' 
   About a half-mile away in the parking lot of the new Tolland High School, where organizers had set up a shuttle parking area, Rhonda Slattery, 54, sat in her motorized wheelchair waiting for her husband, Joe. They had just finished the hourlong ride from Barkhamsted and weren't sure the school bus shuttling people to the make-shift clinic was handicapped accessible. 
   ``I'm just amazed at the number of people here at this hour of the morning,'' said Rhonda Slattery, whose limited Social Security disability income makes it difficult for her to afford dental care. 
   As she spoke, the sky opened up and it started to rain. Hard. 
   Inside the school at 7 a.m., what could be the largest waiting room in Connecticut was packed to its 700- seat capacity. The auditorium was full of people: more retirees, working people, college kids, entire families. Some huddled under blankets. Others sat quietly, waiting for their number to be called, many of their faces swollen or creased in pain. 
   In the triage area just outside the auditorium, dentists peered into people's mouths with portable flashlights. Nurses and dental assistants hustled about--checking blood pressures, taking X-rays, injecting Novocain. 
   In the gymnasium, down the hall the high-pitched whine of dental drills floated above the crowd as dozens of dentists treated patients. Those awaiting care sat in the bleachers, then moved to metal folding chairs before reaching the dental chairs. A squad of stand-by dentists stood off to the side, scrubbed and ready, waiting to replace their peers when their hands cramped and they needed a break. 
   The two-day clinic opened at 5 and the work would not stop until 5 p.m. Today it continues from 5 a.m. to noon. 
   Sitting among the throng were Susan and Brian Boyce of Eastford, both 41, who came to the clinic with their seven children--from age 12 down to 11 months. (The baby was just along for the ride.) Brian is an executive director at the Porter and Chester Institute. Susan is a registered nurse who stays home with the kids. 
   But they don't have dental insurance and with annual dental check-ups costing more than $1,000 a year, paying for even routine dental care is difficult, they said. 
   ``The dentists don't take payment plans, they want the money up front, and that's a big chunk of money when you try to go every year,'' Susan said. 
   Shortly after 7 a.m. the clinic was maxed out. Organizers began turning people away at the door. The backlog was so deep that it would take the rest of the day just to treat those already there. Later in the morning, the clinic reopened briefly, and another 100 or so patients were let in. It abruptly closed again by 10 a.m. 
   For some, the clinic is a blessing, a reprieve from their aches and pain. But for those who didn't get inside, the struggle continues. Many in the pre-dawn dark turned back upon seeing the long line. 
   ``It's pretty bad,'' said one 67-year-old Stafford Springs woman, as she walked back to the parking lot with no umbrella, soaking wet from the rain. Struggling to catch her breath from the walk, the woman said she had come to get her tooth pulled at 5 a.m. but already knew she'd never get in. Like the others, she can't afford dental insurance. 
   As she climbed into her car, the woman was asked what she was going to do. Water dripped off her hair as she wearily shook her head. 
   ``Just going to pray, I guess.''

<DOCNO>Mr. COURTNEY. (IMPROVING HEAD START ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of Congressman Sestak's amendment which flushes out, I think, the direction that this bill is taking, which is to try and improve the quality of teachers by mandating bachelor's degrees and associate's degrees over a very short period of time. 
   For a lot of the teachers in the Head Start program, though, this still begs the question, which is, how do you pay for it? 
   Higher education costs have gone up 40 percent over the last 6 years, and unfortunately the prior Congresses took no action to raise the size of Pell Grants. And we have obviously taken  some steps towards reducing the cost of interest rates under the Stafford Student Loan program, but for many teachers, the challenge of paying for higher education costs, in Connecticut the average salary for Head Start teachers is $24,000, and the Sestak amendment goes right to the heart of trying to make this new requirement affordable. I believe it is totally germane and central to the intent of this Head Start reauthorization bill. This amendment belongs there, and I strongly urge the Members to support passage of the Sestak amendment.  
   I want to thank Congressman SESTAK for offering this important amendment today. It would provide concrete assistance for early childhood educators in Connecticut and around the country to attain their bachelors degree. As you know, the Head Start bill before us increases teacher qualifications--half of teachers nationwide have a BA by 2013 and all new teachers have at least an associate's degree beginning in 2009. 
   This amendment also provides a strong incentive for students to enter the field and for established early childhood educators to remain in the field. Loan forgiveness of up to $10,000 is contingent upon at least 3 years service in a Head Start facility. Too often, our best and brightest educators are forced out of the profession because the salaries cannot keep up with individual and family economic demands. 
   In Connecticut, where the median Head Start salary is approximately $24,000, going back to school to attain a higher degree to satisfy the new teacher qualification requirements would be an economic hardship. 
   While I am pleased to say that Connecticut met the national goal of having at least 50 percent or more of its teachers having an associate's degree in early childhood education by the year 2003, the financial burden to now attain a bachelor's degree will be high. 
   We all know that college costs are rising and the last thing we want to do is encourage more debt. That is why I am so supportive of this amendment. 
   The need for committed, enthusiastic, and qualified Head Start teachers is on the rise. In Connecticut, there are more than 25 Centers serving more than 8,000 children. Poverty levels in many parts of the state are rising. Children receive valuable educational enrichment in Head Start programs, ensuring that they are on the path to educational success in elementary school and beyond. We cannot afford to leave children unprepared and we cannot afford to lose our best and talented teachers either. 
   This amendment provides the incentive to enter or remain in the early childhood education field and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, in December, Senator McCain admitted that he is not an economic expert when he stated ``The issue of economics is not something I've understood as well as I should.'' He went on to say, though, that he had Alan Greenspan's book. Well, clearly, Senator McCain should listen to Greenspan, who called this week's financial news a once-in-a-century type of financial crisis. Unfortunately, Senator McCain was not listening because his response to the catastrophic economic events of this week was ``the fundamentals of our economy are strong,'' and he called for the oldest, lamest Washington trick in the book--the creation of a study commission. 
   We don't need a commission to know that 600,000 Americans have lost their jobs in the last year, that the median income for working Americans has fallen over $2,000 a year over the last 8 years. Those are not strong fundamentals. 
   Mr. Speaker, at a time when every economic expert agrees that our economy is in crisis, we need someone in the White House who is ready and willing to act now to fix it, and clearly, that person is not Senator McCain.

<DOCNO>Mr. COURTNEY. (ADA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Americans With Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), S. 3406. I want to commend Majority Leader Hoyer and Chairman Miller for moving this bill so quickly after Senate passage late last week. 
   As the Education and Labor Committee said in its report on H.R. 3195, this bill provides ``an important step towards restoring the original intent of Congress. The scope of protection under the ADA was intended to be broad and inclusive. Unfortunately, the courts have narrowed the interpretation of disability and found that a large number of people with substantially limiting impairments are not to be considered people with disabilities.'' 
   Unfortunately, the ADA has been misinterpreted by the courts resulting in a narrow view of those eligible to receive certain reasonable accommodations including individuals with learning disabilities. Historically, certain individuals with learning disabilities seeking accommodations in higher education--including high stakes exams--have seen their access to testing accommodations severely undercut by testing companies not willing to consider and support that learning disabilities are neurologically based, lifelong disabilities that may exist in students with high academic achievement because the individual has been able to cope and mitigate the negative impact while simultaneously being substantially limited in one or more major life activities. 
   Too many individuals with documented learning disabilities, including dyslexia, are denied access to easily administered and often low-cost accommodations that would make the critical difference in allowing them to demonstrate their knowledge. These amendments to the ADA do not provide any special treatment, but rather, ensure that each individual with a learning disability has every opportunity to apply for and receive a reasonable accommodation so he/she can move forward in his/her chosen educational and career paths. 
   This bill continues to reinforce what we stated in our bipartisan committee report, that ``the determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity is to be made on an individualized basis.'' There should be no attempt to discriminate against a class of individuals based on any one disability. For example, people with dyslexia are diagnosed based on an unexpected difficulty in reading. This requires a careful analysis of the method and manner in which this impairment substantially limits an individual's ability to read, which may mean a difference in the duration, condition or manner of reading--for example, taking more time--but may not result in a less capable reader. 
   Together, we can ensure that the ADA is accurately interpreted to provide access to accommodations for those that have appropriately documented disabilities. By supporting and fostering the academic potential for these individuals, we reap the benefits when talented, ambitious and creative individuals are able to fulfill their education dreams and contribute in a meaningful way to our society.

<DOCNO>Mr. COURTNEY. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, today we are here, exactly 100 days after a historic watershed election in this country, in which the American people spoke loudly and clearly that they wanted a new Congress to rise to its constitutional duty and hold this administration accountable for its war policy in Iraq. The day I was sworn in as a new Member of Congress, I accepted this responsibility, and I rise today in opposition to the President's escalation of the war and in support of H. Con. Res. 63. 
   Make no mistake about the significance of what is happening this week. America's new Congress will go on record for the first time in opposition to the Bush administration's 4-year legacy of mistakes and misjudgments in Iraq. This will be in sharp contrast to 8 months ago when the prior Congress did exactly the opposite. That Congress lined up in lockstep with a war resolution written by and for the White House. 
   That resolution completely brushed over the misleading and manipulated intelligence that got us into this conflict, the strain of this war on our brave men and women in uniform, and the drain on our Nation's military readiness that is undercutting critical efforts in Afghanistan and our overall defense infrastructure. Instead of doing their constitutional duty, the 109th Congress instead just rubber-stamped the administration's rhetoric and failing policy. 
   Opponents of today's resolution are claiming that it will damage our troop's morale. As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I believe the opposite is true. 
   Let us be very clear about where the 20,000 new troops will come from. President Bush cannot simply dial 911 and 20,000 fresh new troops appear. This escalation can only happen by extending the deployments of soldiers already in Iraq, beyond their promised commitments, or accelerating the arrival of preexisting rotations. Upon close examination, it is clear that the impact of this surge lands squarely on the backs of our men and women in uniform who have already borne an unfair burden. 
   As we debate this resolution, there are nearly 1,900 men and women from my State of Connecticut, including 962 from Connecticut's National Guard, serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. They have all honored our Nation with their service and sacrifice, and they have done all that has been asked of them and more, and their families have shown awe-inspiring strength in their absence. 
   Earlier this month, I was forwarded an e-mail from a constituent serving in Iraq which demonstrates the consequences of these unsustainable policies. In it he described how the morale in his unit fell when they found out that their tour was being unexpectedly extended another 4 months. He wrote: 
   ``These guys have seen so much of the fighting here. To see the looks on these soldiers' faces was heartbreaking. A lot of these guys had plans made already with their loved ones, like weddings, trips, or family that traveled from far away to see them get off that  plane. There are children that were all excited, holding signs they made, waiting to see their fathers again only to have that shattered. How much more can soldiers like this take? These guys deserve the right to go home. They earned it.'' 
   Letters like these demonstrate the real impact on our troops from the President's policy. And they are reinforced by the testimony I have heard at Armed Services. Over and over again, we have heard about the deterioration of our military readiness caused by overdeployment of our troops. Consider that today, as a result of the strain of the war, we currently have no active duty or Reserve brigades considered combat-ready in the Continental U.S., leaving our Nation dangerously unprepared and vulnerable if needed to respond to other global threats or domestic emergencies. 
   Despite the huge costs to our troops and our national defense, the President has opted to aggravate the holes in our defense with a plan to escalate the number of troops in Iraq. And for what? 
   Yesterday, I read the new classified National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq. What I found in this report was the same as the unclassified version that has been reported in the press; that we have a deteriorating security situation in Iraq whose fundamental causes were identified as political, not military. This finding completely dovetails with the findings of the Iraq Study Group who came to the exact same conclusion. 
   Instead of absorbing the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group report and the National Intelligence Estimate and surging diplomacy and political solutions, the President instead has opted to escalate the war by sending 21,500 more troops into the middle of a violent sectarian conflict. 
   Where are the plans to equitably divide oil revenue or revisit the Iraqi Constitution which was left incomplete 2 years ago, or the push to create a real power-sharing arrangement between the Shia and the Sunni? Nowhere do we see any effort to get to the root causes of the violence. Instead, the Bush plan is more of the same, asking our brave troops to do the impossible, settling a sectarian conflict that goes back centuries in time. 
   President Bush has made his choice. Now it is Congress' turn as a coequal branch of government to make ours.     
   I firmly believe that the passage of this resolution will go down in history as the first stirrings of life from a Congress that has been in an Iraq stranglehold for 4 long years. It is an honor to be part of this history on behalf of one of the districts that had the courage to vote for change last November 100 days ago, and I will support resolution 63.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, what a difference 6 weeks makes. On March 14, under Mr. Miller's leadership, the Education and Labor Committee held a hearing on the question of student loan availability. And at that time, Secretary Spellings from the Department of Education came in and said that the administration was merely ``monitoring the situation,'' and expressed some diffidence and confusion about whether or not in fact the Federal Government really had a role to play in terms of being lender of last resort. 
   During the last 6 weeks, what we have seen is the collapse of Bear Stearns, we have seen lenders withdrawing from the student loan market, and a clear signal that the subprime mortgage crisis is in fact extending to the student loan market. In Connecticut, the Connecticut Commissioner of Higher Education Mike Meotti and the Director of Financial Aid at University of Connecticut, who I met with, confirmed the fact that they were seeing some withdrawal from the market and a need to step up their activity in terms of giving students more help as they enter a very challenging year, again, because of what is happening in the financial markets. 
   This legislation, which now the administration has come around in support of, will in fact strengthen the Direct Student Loan program and will confirm that the Federal Government will in fact be a lender of last resort so that it will make sure that, in August and September, students and families will not be running into difficulty and will in fact be able to go to college in the fall. 
   The Federal Government acted swiftly to help Bear Stearns, an investment bank which frankly morally and ethically didn't deserve the help. Millions of students, however, do. And this legislation, which will clearly confirm that the Federal Government has a role to play going into the summer months as students reach out to get financial assistance, that in fact the doors of colleges and universities will remain open. 
   I applaud Mr. Miller for his leadership going back to last March 14 and ensuring that passage of this bill will occur on a bipartisan basis.

   Bill O'Neill is today recognized as one of the giants of Connecticut history. He served as Governor from 1980 to 1982, and was a leader who had a commonsense, compassionate vision of government, raising teachers' salaries, rebuilding our roads, and creating a pathbreaking prescription drug benefit for seniors. 
   In Connecticut over the last 2 weeks, there has been an outpouring of affection for the Governor and his wonderful surviving wife, Nikki, partly because of his great work for the people, but also because of the plainspoken, humble way he carried himself in the State's highest office. 
   As the Irish would say, Bill O'Neill never put on airs. And that is why last week, at a funeral service at St. Patrick's Church in his beloved East Hampton, the same church he served as an altar boy and the same church he faithfully attended for over 70 years, people from all walks of life came to pay tribute to him and Nikki and honor a man who set a beautiful example for us all, of service, decency and compassion. 
   I ask my colleagues to join with me in honoring Governor O'Neill's contributions to Connecticut and offer sincerest condolences to his family and friends.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, from 2001 to 2006, the cost of higher education exploded in this country. It went up 40 percent, destroying the dreams of too many young people and damaging our economy. During that time period, the Congress turned a deaf ear to that issue. The Pell Grant program had been basically frozen, and the interest rates for the Stafford Student Loan Program incredibly was increased. 
   Last year, under Mr. Miller's leadership, we passed the College Cost Reduction Act which addressed those two problems. This year we are finally addressing a piece of legislation that was 5 years overdue, the Higher Education Reauthorization Act which, as the prior speakers have said, will do many good things in terms of holding colleges and universities accountable for high costs, and also cleaning up unethical lending practices which had cropped up, and many students, so desperate to find access to money, fell victim to.

   Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, in 2001, when President George Bush took office, the size of the United States Navy consisted of 315 ships and submarines. Today, the size of that Navy has fallen to 276 ships and submarines. Despite this shocking decline and the damage, the damage, that it has done to our shipbuilding base in this country, the President continued to propose a shipbuilding budget this year which will continue that deterioration. 
   If his shipbuilding plan continues, for example, the size of our Virginia-class attack submarine fleet will fall below 40 submarines, starting 7 years from now, and will stay there for 15 years. That is far below what the Navy has warned us is an acceptable level for a submarine fleet to meet its mission request. 
   I rise in support of this Defense bill because it will stop the decline that has occurred over the last 6 years of America's Navy and will invest $588 million in an advanced procurement for a Virginia-class attack submarine and stop the bathtub effect of the decline of the submarine production schedule which the President proposed. 
   Madam Chairman, I applaud Chairman Skelton and Chairman Taylor for their efforts to restore the size of our Navy.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Hunter defense authorization bill, whose primary mission under the leadership of Chairman Skelton is to restore military readiness to America's Armed Forces. As has been stated earlier this evening, the bill focuses on investing in short-term readiness, with increased commitment and investment to reset the ground troops of this country as well as the National Guard. But as Mr. Hunter indicated in his opening remarks, it also looks over the horizon to deal with military readiness issues that are not being addressed and have been neglected for far too long. 
   One of those is the size of the American Navy. When the Bush administration took office in 2002, the size of America's Navy was 315 ships and submarines. It has declined to 276, and, shockingly, that number is going to in fact accelerate, because we are basically living off a legacy fleet that was built during the Reagan area. 
   Last year, I was proud to be part of an effort that turned around this decline. We invested $588 million in advance procurement to the Virginia class submarine program, the most successful shipbuilding program according to both the Navy and outside experts, and this year we continue that effort with Mr. Hunter's leadership on a motion at the committee to add to the Seapower Subcommittee's $300 million advance procurement. His motion, the Hunter-Courtney amendment, added $422 million, and we are now moving the Navy's shipbuilding schedule to two submarines a year starting in 2010 with this legislation. 
   The industrial base is ready for this challenge. We know that from again the testimony from both Virginia and Connecticut. My district is the home of the Electric Boat, which is, again, one of the most successful shipbuilders in the country in terms of the Virginia class program. The last submarine, the USS New Hampshire, was delivered with 1 million fewer man-hours in terms of production compared to the prior submarine that they built. 
   This investment which this legislation represents will allow this country to again be ready for long-term challenges. The world is changing, there are new maritime forces that are growing in different parts of the world, and I strongly urge support and passage of the Hunter defense authorization bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. COURTNEY. (EXPRESSING APPRECIATION OF CONGRESS TO THE FAMILIES OF MEMBERS OF ARMED FORCES -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Current Resolution 295, which expresses the deep appreciation of Congress to the families of members of the United States Armed Services.     
   Over 2 million American men and women are serving in the Armed Forces today. These military men and women have parents, spouses, and children who are being asked to sacrifice their time with their loved one. Given the high operational tempo, these families have faced continued and sustained separation from their servicemember, many of whom have been deployed more than one time. 
   Living without the support of a beloved servicemember can be a daily struggle, and especially so for young children. Even so, our military families rise to the challenge with incredible strength and perseverance. These families are proud to know that the sacrifices that they and their loved one makes are to serve the country they love. 
   When a member returns home, it is our military families who are there for warriors. They provide our first line of defense to ensure that warriors who are wounded or need assistance receive the help that they have earned and deserve. Families are often the first to identify the needs of their loved one and to help ensure that those needs are met. Many families have made tremendous sacrifices to support their wounded warrior, often giving up their own personal goals to ensure that our wounded warriors are well cared for. 
   Military families are also unsurpassed in their devotion to their military communities. We depend on military family members who volunteer to support units and other families. As the demand has only increased over time with repeated deployments, the responsibilities that these family members have undertaken has also increased tenfold. These are Americans who answer the call in their hearts to serve the men and women who protect our homeland. Their strength, compassion, and unselfish sacrifice truly epitomize all that is good about the American spirit. 
   House Concurrent Resolution 295 is our way in the Congress of expressing our sincerest appreciation to our military families for the unwavering support that they give to the men and women who serve to keep the United States safe. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this very important resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. COURTNEY. (RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INTEGRATION OF THE ARMED FORCES -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 297, which recognizes the 60th anniversary of the beginning of the integration of the Armed Forces. 
   Our military men and women are representative of the fabric of American society. They originate from every region of the world and represent the beautiful diversity of our planet. They bring forth with them a wide array of diverse talents and skill sets that has long made the U.S. military the superpower it is today. 
   House Concurrent Resolution 297 celebrates the 60th anniversary of President Harry Truman's 1948 executive order declaring that the equality of treatment and opportunity for all persons in the Armed Forces was the policy of the President. We celebrate this seminal event in our Nation's history for installing the democratic ideals of equality in our military and our country. 
   During the Second World War, the Tuskegee Airmen broke the color barrier within the Armed Forces to become the first black pilots, navigators, and bombardiers. It was the impenetrable code created from the Navajo language and utilized by the Navajo Code Talkers that helped save lives in the Pacific. Japanese American soldiers volunteered to serve in uniform while their families were held in concentration camps in the United States. It was the ingenuity of refugee scientists escaping anti-Semitism in their homeland that led to the American acquisition of nuclear technology. Diversity has made our Armed Forces and our Nation safer and stronger. 
   Unfortunately, our Armed Forces was once a place of discrimination and segregation. Many Americans of African, Asian, and Hispanic descent who served in the Armed Forces struggled against frequent episodes of racism and bigotry. Often these American servicemembers felt that they were fighting two wars, one against a foreign enemy and the other against racism from within their own ranks. 
   Despite great adversity, Americans of minority descent proudly served with honor and bravery, above and beyond the call of duty. We in Congress recognize their contributions and honor them for their sacrifices. The bravery and sacrifice of all members of the Armed Forces, regardless of race, color, or creed, will always be a matter of national honor. 
   Today the multi-racial makeup of our troops is a testament to the democratic ideals that all Americans hold dear, that all men and women are created equal. Our diverse forces serve as a proud example for the rest of the world in these times of racial and religious intolerance. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this important resolution.  
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. COURTNEY. (RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CROSSING OF THE NORTH POLE BY THE USS ``NAUTILUS'' -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as the author of House Resolution 1067, I rise today in strong support, which honors an important anniversary not only to my district but to our Navy and our country. 
   In June 1958, the USS Nautilus (SSN 571), the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, departed Seattle, Oregon, as part of a top secret operation called Operation Sunshine. Unknown to many at the time, the Nautilus was embarking on a historic mission that took it on a course north to the arctic ice cap. At 11:15 p.m. on August 3, 1958, the boat became the first vessel to cross the geographic North Pole when Commander William Anderson, Nautilus' commanding officer, announced to his crew: ``For the world, our country, and the Navy--the North Pole.'' 
   This historic crossing of 90 North took place at a critical time in our Nation's history: the Cold War was heating up; the Soviet Union had seemingly laid claim to space with the launch of Sputnik; and many Americans and many around the world were looking for something to rally around, a sign that we were not ceding big ideas and notable achievements to others. Nautilus' sonar man, Al Charette, one of my constituents, described their journey as an effort to out-Sputnik the Russians and they did it. 
   Few on board the Nautilus realized the scope of their achievement. They were simply sailors doing their job and doing it well. However, on reaching the North Pole, the Nautilus clearly demonstrated our undersea superiority and opened the region to decades of scientific research and exploration. 
   The crossing of the North Pole was praised by numerous world leaders at the time, being described by President Eisenhower as a magnificent achievement from which the entire free world would benefit. A ticker tape parade was held in honor of the crew in New York City. The Nautilus became the first naval vessel in peacetime to receive the Presidential Unit Citation for its meritorious efforts in crossing the North Pole, and Commander William R. Anderson was awarded the Legion of Merit. 
   In the 50 years since, the United States Navy and Coast Guard have repeatedly followed in the footsteps of this historic voyage. Dozens of U.S. submarines, in addition to specially fitted vessels and general aircraft of the United States Coast Guard, have journeyed to the top of the world in service to their country and to reinforce our Arctic presence. These submarines and their intrepid crews have broken through the surface, charted new courses, and expanded our knowledge of the Arctic. 
   I myself have had the unique opportunity to see this work firsthand when I traveled aboard the USS Alexandria, a Groton-based submarine, to observe the 2007 Ice Exercises in the Arctic Circle. While the technology and capabilities of our submarines has changed in the 50 years since the Nautilus' journey, the unmatched skill, the dedication and the talent of our submariners continues to allow our Nation to retain an important presence in this critical part of the world. 
   I just want to add, Mr. Speaker, having the opportunity again to be onboard a submarine under the ice just reinforces to me anyway the incredible accomplishment of the Nautilus. At  the time, scientific opinion believed that it was physically impossible for a submarine to pass under the North Pole because of blockages by the ice and the shifting movements of the ice under the North Pole. This was a vessel which was completely and utterly alone at the time. If there was any accident, if there was any problem, basically they were completely on their own and had no means of any type of rescue or support. 
   Built and launched at Electric Boat in Groton, Connecticut, on January 21, 1954, the Nautilus was the first vessel in the world to be powered by nuclear power. After claiming their historic milestone at 90 North and returning home to Naval Base New London, the Nautilus continued to establish a series of naval records in her distinguished 25-year career, including being the first submarine to journey 20,000 leagues under the sea. 
   The history and legacy of the Nautilus is not the only meaningful story to my congressional district but to the entire submarine force and to our Nation. Today, the Nautilus proudly serves as a museum where visitors from around the world come to learn about both her history-making service to our country and the role of the submarine force in securing our Nation. The Nautilus truly helped set the tone as the standard bearer for the submarine force, and achievements like the crossing of 90 North both proved the capabilities of our Nation at a critical time in our history and raised the bar for all who came after her. 
   Too often the critical achievements of our submarine force, our silent service, go unnoticed. The resolution today rightfully honors not only the officers and crew of the Nautilus but all those who played a part in her success, from the highest levels of our government, to the countless support ships and personnel who helped her along the way, and finally, the talented workforce at Electric Boat who gave us the first and finest submarine in our history. 
   I would like to enter two articles from the New London Day into the Record, one highlighting the opening of the new exhibit at the Submarine Force Museum in Groton and an editorial praising the achievements of the Nautilus and her crew.     
   I will also enter into the Record at a later date a list of the crew who journeyed to 90 North so that their names will be tied to the historic achievements in today's resolution. 
   I want to thank the Commander of the naval submarine base in New London, Captain Mark Ginda, who first planted the idea for this resolution in my staff's mind. And in addition, since I introduced H. Res. 1067, my office has received nearly 50 e-mails from individuals all across the country who served or whose loved ones served aboard the Nautilus' journey to 90 North. I want to thank them for their comments and their strong support. In particular, I want to thank Captain Anderson's widow, who I met at the Farragut Square anniversary service for the submarine force earlier this year, who was just an incredibly gracious, wonderful person who has done everything that she can to make sure that the memory of this incredible achievement is brought forth to young people all across the country and is a strong supporter of our Navy. 
   And most especially, I want to recognize the veterans of the Nautilus' journey to 90 North that I am privileged to represent here in Congress. We are all proud of them and the legacy they have established for our submarine force and our Nation. 
   H. Res. 1067 is a much-deserved recognition of the important role the submarine force plays in the security of our Nation, and I urge its passage.  
   50 Years Later, ``Nautilus'' Crew Still Feels It Could Repeat Polar Feat  
   GROTON.--Former USS Nautilus crew members say it does not seem like 50 years have passed since they made their historic crossing of the North Pole under the ice cap, and that if the Navy would kindly give them another nuclear power plant, they could man their ship and head back out to sea. 
   ``When you first join the Navy and look forward to 20 years and retirement, you say, `That's forever.' I put 28 in and it seems like it all happened just yesterday,'' said Al Charette, a sonarman on board for the North Pole trip. ``Every time we have a reunion, the crew thinks we should go out and get that ship underway. We're ready. We're still a crew.'' 
   ``We remember each little feature of rigging it for dive. We feel very confident we could do that again,'' said Jack Kurrus, an engineman also on the trip. ``Wouldn't it be nice to go to sea one more time?'' 
   Nautilus (SSN 571) left Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on July 23, 1958, under top-secret orders to conduct Operation Sunshine, the first crossing of the North Pole by a ship. About 10 months earlier, the Soviet Union had launched the first artificial satellite into space. 
   ``We wanted to out-Sputnik the Russians,'' Charette said. 
   The crew of 116 men reached the North Pole at 11:15 p.m. on Aug. 3, 1958. They received the Presidential Unit Citation, the first ever issued in peacetime. 
   Charette, Kurrus and another former crew member, Joe Degnan, were at the U.S. Navy Submarine Force Museum Friday for the unveiling of a new exhibit that commemorates the 50th anniversary of their voyage. The exhibit, which includes artifacts and previously unpublished color images, runs through March 2009. 
   The successful 1958 trip was not the Nautilus' first attempt to cross from the Pacific to the Atlantic over the top of the world. 
   The crew was in the Arctic a year earlier to see how the submarine would operate under the ice. When the ship lost power to its gyrocompasses, Cmdr. William R. Anderson gave the order to turn back because there was no way to fix the ship's position. 
   ``We spent 72 hours trying to find our way out and that was really, really scary,'' Kurrus said. 
   Nautilus visited the Pacific in 1958, under the cover of teaching those in the Pacific Fleet about nuclear submarines. The submarine headed to the North Pole but encountered heavy ice and shallow water on the way. At one point, the 320-foot submarine had just a few feet of water over its sail and about 20 feet below the keel. 
   The crew returned to Pearl Harbor and waited a month for the ice to break up and melt before making another attempt to go to Portland, England, by way of the North Pole. 
   Kenneth Carr, who was then a lieutenant and later retired as a vice admiral, said it was ``pretty routine on board'' as they neared 90 degrees North on Aug. 3, 1958. 
   Carr said he asked the scientist on the trip, ``how will we know we crossed the pole?'' Dr. Waldo K. Lyon pointed to a machine with a green dot going around in a circle. 
   ``He said the dot would stop and go in the other direction, and it did,'' Carr said. ``It wasn't anything dramatic.'' 
   Once the Nautilus surfaced, Anderson sent a message to the Navy--``Nautilus 90 North.'' 
   ``I'm not sure we really appreciated the depth of what had just happened, and I think it was a long time before any of us realized it,'' Charette said. ``All we knew was when we ended up in England, everyone and their brother wanted an autograph.'' 
   Those on board nicknamed themselves PANOPOs, an acronym from the phrase from the Pacific to the Atlantic via the North Pole. A ``Welcome Home PANOPOs'' banner is one of the artifacts on display in the new exhibit. Sarah Martin, who works at the Naval Submarine Base, was the graphic designer for the exhibit. 
   Several events are planned at the museum leading up to the anniversary, including a book signing and lecture by Alfred McLaren about the USS Queenfish on July 12 and by Don Keith about the Nautilus on Aug. 2, and a ceremony on the Nautilus Aug. 3. 
   The Nautilus Alumni Association is planning a reunion Sept. 25-28 at the Groton Inn and Suites.   
   Wonder of ``Nautilus'' 
   Even after 50 years, the feat of the men and their boat, USS Nautilus, is astounding. Crossing the North Pole under the polar ice cap in a nuclear-powered submarine constituted much more than the single event itself. The voyage unlocked the tremendous potential of submersibles powered in a way that they could travel indefinitely on a mission. And imaginations soared. 
   There has followed one generation after another of nuclear submarines, each more capable than its predecessors, but the pioneering brilliance of Nautilus remains a marker for naval historians. So, too, does the relentless pursuit of excellence that characterized Adm. Hyman G. Rickover's direction of the Navy's nuclear power program. 
   As reporter Jennifer Grogan's feature story June 30 revealed, the voyage also created an impenetrable bond among the crew and officers of Nautilus. At the time of the trip, few in civilian life quite understood the magnitude of the Nautilus' accomplishment. But succeeding classes of submarines have made clear the almost limitless capabilities of these boats. 
   The self-confidence and optimism displayed by the veterans in Ms. Grogan's story is a modem expression of the morale of the crew that ventured north in 1958. Those men and the imagination that conceptualized their voyage are a credit to the Navy's versatility and technical skills. 
   That is why it is especially fitting that the Nautilus, open to the public, resides here next to the Submarine Base, an interesting naval laboratory for all to see. If you haven't yet taken the time to pay a visit, we urge you to do so.  
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. COURTNEY. (HONORING THE SERVICE AND SACRIFICE OF THE 101ST AIRBORNE DIVISION -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1080, honoring the extraordinary service and exceptional sacrifice of the 101st Airborne Division, more commonly known as the Screaming Eagles. 
   On August 16, 1942, the day the 101st Airborne Division was activated, Major General William C. Lee observed that ``The 101st has no history, but it has a rendezvous with destiny.'' Since that day over 60 years ago, the 101st Airborne Division has distinguished itself time and again. 
   Currently headquartered at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, the 101st Airborne Division has faithfully answered America's call to service and has a distinguished history as the only air assault division in the world. The division cleared the way for the 1st and 4th Infantry Divisions at Omaha and Utah Beach on D-day in Normandy. 
   One of the most notable of the Screaming Eagles' achievements was the defense of Bastogne, Belgium during the Battle of the Bulge, where the division was surrounded by advancing enemy forces who demanded their immediate surrender. Brigadier General Anthony McAuliffe led the 101st through the siege, which was broken on December 26, 1944. 
   The division again proved its laudable skill and courage fighting bitter battles in Vietnam. The 101st established an extraordinary helicopter force of troops trained and ready for combat in Vietnam. Dense jungle and uneven terrain made the use of helicopters highly desirable for maneuverability and aided in the Tet Offensive. 
   The 101st Airborne Division (Air Mobile) was designated the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) in October 1974. The Screaming Eagles continued their rendezvous with destiny by faithfully completing combat missions in the Middle East, and humanitarian and peacekeeping missions in Rwanda, Somalia, Haiti, and in Bosnia. During the 1990 invasion of Kuwait, the division  conducted the largest air assault in history. 
   Today, the 101st continues their history of exemplary combat service to our Nation in Iraq and Afghanistan. Thousands of men and women proudly wear the patch of the Screaming Eagle on their right shoulder as they deploy to defend the liberties that we enjoy here in the United States. Today, we recognize the Screaming Eagles and the hundreds of thousands of their brethren in uniform who volunteer to defend our Nation each and every day. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. COURTNEY. (STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE FILL SUSPENSION AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Strategic Petroleum Fill Suspension and Consumer Protection Act and I am pleased to be a cosponsor of H.R. 6022. 
   As I travel around eastern Connecticut, I am confronted with families, business owners, truckers, farmers and fishermen who are struggling to maintain their lives and livelihoods. 
   Rising oil and gasoline prices are choking our economy. Food and consumer goods are rising as fuel prices rise, bringing additional pain to many people across our country. 
   In my hometown of Vernon, CT, the price of a gallon of gasoline hit $3.99. I am now hearing that some older gasoline pumps throughout the country are not even programmed to go above $3.99. 
   The bill before us today is simple, straightforward and effective. Instead of continuing to add 70,000 barrels of oil per day to fill an already stocked Strategic Petroleum Reserve, SPR, H.R. 6022 would instead, put that oil on the market to ease supply and price. And we should absolutely not increase the fill rate to 76,000 barrels per day like what the Administration has planned for later this summer. 
   Petroleum economists expect that gasoline prices could decline by as much as 24 cents if we stopped filling the SPR now. The SPR is 97 percent full with over 700 million barrels of oil; in March 2003, when we went to war in Iraq, the SPR stood at 599 million barrels. 
   Diverting oil from the SPR is something that the President has done in the past. When he directed the Secretary to stop filling the SPR during the summer of 2006, he did so by saying, ``every little bit helps.'' At that time he further stipulated that the SPR was at a level that could weather any supply disruption during that summer. In 2006, the SPR stood at approximately 688 million barrels, less that what is there today. 
   I have written to President Bush several times asking him to divert oil from the SPR, but as yet, he has refused to heed my and my colleague's requests. 
   Our constituents need relief from rising oil prices and diverting oil from the SPR will achieve that goal. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6022.

<DOCNO>Mr. COURTNEY. (EARTH DAY -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, today our Nation joins with countries from around the world to celebrate Earth Day. Today, communities large and small, collectively come together to recognize past progress and develop new strategies to improve future environmental health. On this day of global environmental reflection, I rise to recognize two outstanding schools in my district, Woodstock and Brooklyn Middle Schools, which have worked to make eastern Connecticut a cleaner and more environmentally conscious community. 
   Between March 20 and April 10, 2008, Woodstock and Brooklyn Middle Schools embarked on a project, the ``Bad Bag Competition'', which explored the prevalence of plastic bag use in our country as well as its environmental implications. Plastic bags are everywhere, from grocery to department stores, and every year Americans consume an average of 100 billion. In order to produce our annual demand for plastic bags, 12 million barrels of oil are used. Reducing national demand for plastic bags has clear environmental benefits. 
   Throughout the ``Bad Bag Competition'', students from Woodstock and Brooklyn Middle Schools collected and recycled used plastic bags and educated our neighbors on the importance of using reusable bags. At the end of the competition, when all the bags were counted, Woodstock and Brooklyn Middle Schools collected 43,836 and 66,100 bags respectively. The petroleum that was used to produce these bags, which collectively totaled 109,936, could have fueled a vehicle for 7,853 miles. 
   Mr. Speaker, these students have exemplified the spirit of Earth Day. These students not only modified their own choices to be more environmentally responsible, but encouraged our neighbors to do the same. The impact of this project on our eastern Connecticut community has been great, and the multiplier effects are even greater. I ask my colleagues to join with me and my constituents in recognizing these students' achievements and to choose reusable bags instead of the proverbial ``paper or plastic.''

<DOCNO>Mr. COURTNEY. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2669, COLLEGE COST REDUCTION AND ACCESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Conference Report to accompany H.R. 2669, the College Cost Reduction and Access Act. I thank Chairman Miller for shepherding this bill through the House so that it can be signed into law by the Prdent. 
   This legislation marks the single largest investment in higher education since the 1944 GI bill and at no new cost to taxpayers. The investnent is available because this new Congress cut excess subsidies that the federal government pays to the student loan industry. 
   As I travel around eastern Connecticut, I hear from so many students and families about their concerns with the cost of higher education and the amount of debt they are taking on to finance that education. Unfortunately, students across the country are graduating with about $18,000 of debt upon graduation. This debt can have a crippling effect on young adults as they embark on their career path after graduation. 
   I often refer to the Connecticut district I represent as the higher education district. For this reason, I am pleased to be a member of the Education and Labor Committee and the Higher Education, Lifelong Learning and Competitiveness subcommittee. My district is home to the University of Connecticut, Eastern Connecticut State University, Mitchell College, Connecticut College and Lyme Academy. In addition, Asnuntuck Community College, Three Rivers Community College and Quinebaug Valley Community College are located in eastern Connecticut. 
   Students have access to a myriad of educational opportunities in eastern Connecticut and this legislation before us today will expand the Pell Grant program that so many students rely on--the maximum value of the grant will grow by $1,000 to a maximum value of $5,400 in five years. The Pell Grant Program is so important that during committee consideration of H.R. 2669, I offered an amendment to boost funding by $900 million. I am pleased that the Conference agreement invests in the Pell Grant program even more. Further, and of paramount importance to so many families, the interest rate on loans will be cut in half from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent after four years. 
   The College Cost Reduction and Access Act also provides loan forgiveness for people after 10 years of public service in areas such as law enforcement, first responders, fire fighters, nursing and early childhood education. 
   This new Congress continues to keep faith with a promise to chart a new direction for this country. This Congress is showing its mettle by breaking down barriers to affordable education and boosting middle-class families. 
   If we are to maintain our competitive advantage in the world and ensure that more Americans achieve economic prosperity, we must make higher education attainable and affordable. I urge my colleagues to support the College Cost Reduction and Access Act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of Mohegan Indian Chief, Ralph W. Sturges. Chief Sturges died on September 30, 2007, in New London, Connecticut, at the age of 88. 
   A lifelong resident of Connecticut, Chief Sturges was a renaissance man whose commitment to community and Nation knew no bounds. During his early life, he worked for the Civilian Conservation Corps and joined the U.S. Army's intelligence division during World War II, where he subsequently earned a Bronze Star for his outstanding service. 
   After the war, Chief Sturges worked tirelessly for Federal recognition of the Mohegan tribe, which finally occurred in 1992. Because of his efforts, he was elected ``Chief for Life,'' which he faithfully worked as an ambassador of goodwill during the extraordinary growth of Mohegan Sun Resort and Casino as a world-class destination. 
   While his passing brings sadness to the Connecticut community, his legacy and contributions will be remembered for generations to come. I ask my colleagues to join with me and my constituents to honor his life and offer condolences to his family.

   If he looked comfortable in the podium today, there is a reason for that. For 10 years he served in Connecticut as the deputy speaker of the House of Representatives, someone with whom I served as a colleague on the Human Services Committee and have seen up close the work and impact that he has had in the City of New London and across the State of Connecticut. 
   He is joined today by his family, who is here, his wife, Jessie; his three children; his son, Bertram, who is a sergeant major in the U.S. Army, serving today in Washington, DC, but also served our country in two deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   Again, Wade leads a congregation, the Trinity Missionary Baptist Church in New London, Connecticut, which I have had the opportunity to visit a number of times. It is an energetic, warm congregation, which is clearly being led by a wonderful person whose impact has been felt, not only in that congregation, but the City of New London and the State of Connecticut. 
   Again, it's a pleasure to welcome him here today and get us off to a good start.

   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 978) expressing support for the designation of the week of March 3-7, 2008, as ``School Social Work Week'' to promote awareness of the vital role of school social workers in schools, and in the community as a whole, in helping students prepare for their future as productive citizens.

<DOCNO>Mr. COURTNEY. (SCHOOL SOCIAL WORK WEEK -- (House of Representatives - February 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 978, a resolution to recognize the week of March 3-7 as National School Social Worker Week. 
   School social workers have long played a critical role in schools in the community as a whole. They are professionals with training in social mental health intervention who work with youth to address their emotional, social, and developmental needs. For example, students in elementary school are just beginning to develop their academic self-concept and their feelings of competence. School social workers help students build their confidence as learners. 
   In middle school, many new challenges arise. During this passage from childhood to adolescence, middle school students are characterized by a need to explore a variety of interests connecting their learning into the classroom to its practical application in life. For these students, school social workers provide proactive leadership that engage all stakeholders in the delivery of programs and services to help students navigate the challenges and achieve success. 
   And in high school, students begin separating from parents and exploring and defining their independence. They face increased pressure regarding risk behaviors involving sex, alcohol, and drugs, while exploring the boundaries of the more acceptable behavior and mature, meaningful relationships. School social workers help make them concrete and compounded decisions. 
   On top of this, school social workers must be responsive to the range of challenges that young people face every day such as poverty, disability, discrimination, abuse, addiction, bullying, divorce of parents, loss of a loved one, and other barriers to learning. 
   School social workers are also on the front lines when disaster strikes, such as the Southern California wildfires or Hurricane Katrina, as well as other traumatic incidents such as the atrocities on 9/11. There is a documentation of the growing need for school districts to expand mental and student support services in schools. The numbers indicate that only 1 in 5 of the 17,500,000 children in need of mental health actually received those services. 
   Many students go underserved primarily because the national average ratio of student-to-school social workers is far beneath the 400-1 ratio recommended by the School Social Work Association of America. 
   Mr. Speaker, this resolution serves to recognize the treasure that is the school social worker and acknowledge the priceless role that they play in guiding our students' success in the ever-changing world of the 21st century. 
   I urge my colleagues to resoundingly pass this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. COURTNEY. (CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION MONTH -- (House of Representatives - February 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 930, which will designate February 2008 as ``Career and Technical Education Month'' and recognize the important role career and technical education plays in the instruction of America's students. 
   Today, over 15 million students participate in career and technical education programs. Career and technical education programs offer diverse courses in subject areas that support the development of a competitive economy, and the courses are constantly evolving to meet the needs of the global market. For example, the Cisco Networking Academy has focused on giving students across the Nation hands-on activities within its 18 programs to prepare students for career opportunities in telecommunications and continuing their education. 
   Another such institution is Marshall Academy. This CTE program at this Fairfax, Virginia, high school strives to expose students to various career paths through a full line of technical and professional courses. Classes in business management, auto services, criminal justice, and culinary arts are bolstered through business partnerships with companies such as Microsoft, Sheridan Hotels, and Ford Motor Company. Career and technical programs like these are responsive to the business needs of the community and set students on a successful path for the future. These programs can be found throughout communities across the country and are integral to ensuring America's place in the global economy through the integration of science, math, and literacy in technical course work. 
   The success of CTE can be seen in the data that we have in students who participate in CTE courses. We know that students who take career and technical education courses are more likely to stay in school and, while there, obtain higher grade point averages than their peers. And we also know that when a course combines rigorous academic content with technical subject matter, students are encouraged to actively engage with their studies. 
   Additionally, career and technical education programs are an effective means of linking high schools with community colleges. These links introduce students to future learning opportunities and ease the transition to a post-secondary education. 
   Lastly, programs such as these help foster a highly educated and skilled workforce through internships, job shadowing, and other cooperative work experiences. These courses provide a foundation of skills that prepare students for gainful employment in the United States. 
   Studies have shown that students who participate in career and technical education programs have better employment opportunities and earn more than their general education counterparts. 
   I am encouraged by the many gains students have made through career and technical education programs and believe that a skilled workforce is paramount when competing in a global economy. In my district, there are four CTE school programs and I think like all Members across the country, they are extremely impressive institutions with great committed faculty and students who are totally motivated and engaged in the special skills that they have the opportunity to get a head start in terms of their future job growth and their job opportunities. 
   Mr. Speaker, once again, I express my support for Career and Technical Education Month, and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I rise today in support of H. Res. 944, honoring the service and accomplishments of Lieutenant General Russel L. Honore, United States Army, for his 37 years of service on behalf of the United States. 
   And let me first take a moment to thank Representative David Scott of Georgia for helping us to recognize General Honore and getting this resolution to the floor here today. And I want to certainly allow him the spotlight in terms of talking about this extraordinary gentleman. 
   Very briefly, he is a native of Lakeland, Louisiana, graduated from Southern University and A&M College in 1971. Upon graduation, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army. 
   During his career, General Honore has served a number of infantry command positions in the Army, including tours in Germany and as commanding officer of the Second Infantry Division in Korea. He had also seen action in Iraq and Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm and served as Vice Director for Operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff here in Washington, DC. 
   Through his efforts and command, he was responsible for the training and deployment of a half million National Guard and Reserve members. In addition, he led the Joint Task Force Katrina following the hurricane's destruction of the gulf coast in 2005, where he commanded all active duty troops from all branches dedicated to storm recovery operations. 
   This Nation owes a debt of gratitude to General Honore for his commitment to the defense of our great Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. COURTNEY. (MISTAKES MADE IN AIR FORCE TANKER CONTRACT -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, last week it was revealed that the Air Force made a serious mistake in comparing the costs of tanker aircraft proposals offered by Northrop Grumman/Airbus and Boeing. 
   When the Air Force awarded this $40 billion contract to Northrop Grumman/Airbus, it repeatedly said that the cost of the two planes was one of their top selection criteria. However this latest revelation, supported by both companies, undercuts the Air Force's assertion that they picked the most cost-effective aircraft and casts doubt on whether the two planes were evaluated fairly on the other criteria. 
   Take, for example, fuel usage. The Airbus tanker uses 24 percent more fuel than Boeing, about 400 gallons more per hour, and over 2 billion gallons of fuel each year. Yet the Air Force continues to claim that the Airbus tanker is the best value over the long term. 
   At a time of soaring fuel costs that calls into question whether the most cost-effective choice was made for our taxpayers and our airmen for a plane with a lifespan of 40 years, the selection of tanker aircraft will have far-reaching implications for our Nation's industrial base and our security. The Air Force must get it right and rebid this critical decision.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I express my strong support for House Resolution 51 offered by Mr. LIPINSKI of Illinois. As both a Catholic and product of Catholic schools, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this resolution which recognizes January 28th to February 3rd, 2007, as Catholic Schools Week. 
   Connecticut's Second Congressional District is home to nearly 30 Catholic elementary and secondary schools. From the southeastern corner of the district in Pawcatuck and Saint Michael's School, to the district's northwestern corner and the Enfield Montessori School, Catholic schools are an important part of the fabric of education in eastern Connecticut. The Archdiocese of Hartford and Diocese of Norwich deserve credit for making its schools accessible throughout the State. 
   As a graduate of Northwest Catholic High School in West Hartford, Connecticut, I know firsthand the academic rigor and discipline that Catholic schools demand. They provide their students with strong scholastic backgrounds and prepare them for life's many moral challenges. 
   Catholic schools deserve recognition for their contributions to our country. Today more than 2.4 million students are enrolled in Catholic schools, and 27 percent of those students are from minority backgrounds. Furthermore, Catholic schools emphasize strong community development and service. In my hometown of Vernon, Connecticut, students at St. Joseph School and St. Bernard school are active in the community visiting nursing homes and collecting money and clothes for the less fortunate. 
   I thank the National Catholic Educational Association and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops for designating January 28th to February 3rd, 2007 as Catholic Schools Week. And I thank Mr. LIPINSKI for offering this important resolution. The country's Catholic schools are certainly meritorious of such recognition.

<DOCNO>Mr. COURTNEY. (EIGHTMILE WILD AND SCENIC RIVER ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I, first of all, want to commend Mr. Sarbanes for his superb summary of this legislation and the context in which it occurred and was introduced this year with the full support of the Connecticut delegation on a bipartisan basis, the Republican Governor of Connecticut, Jodi Rell, who was supporting the bill, and the Connecticut State legislature, which also passed a resolution in support of this measure. I also want to thank Chairman Rahall and Ranking Member Young for helping us bring this bill to the floor and also in particular subcommittee Chairman Grijalva and Ranking Member Bishop for helping this bill through subcommittee and raising important issues, which, as has been pointed out, strike particularly close to home since the City of New London, which was a party to the Kelo case, was the locus of that decision and obviously caused great concern about property rights all across the country. 
   This bill, however, though, I believe is a balanced bill which represents more than 10 years of hard work by local citizens and elected officials to protect this important river and its intact watershed. The Eightmile River takes its name from the distance between its mouth at Lake Hayword to the Connecticut River and Long Island sound. It is unique in that it is a virtually free-flowing river over its entire run. The entire 62-square-mile watershed has a large forest cover and excellent water quality and is home to diverse fish populations and rare species. It is quite rare for a river of this size to be intact throughout its entire watershed, especially in areas so close to the coast of Long Island Sound and in such a densely populated State as the State of Connecticut. 
   After securing the go-ahead for a wild and scenic river study approved by this Congress in 2001, local officials and advocates decided early on to base the study on a watershed approach, rather than looking at specific areas of the river. 
   The wild and scenic study identified six outstanding resource values including its watershed ecosystem, natural communities, and cultural landscape. It concluded that the 25 miles of the meandering Eightmile River should be recommended for designation as ``scenic'' under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. 
   A management plan was approved by the three towns of East Haddam, Salem, and Lyme. And as I mentioned earlier, the General Assembly in Connecticut also joined in support for that management plan. And I will enter into the Record letters submitted by the First Selectmen of Salem and East Haddam, again bipartisan letters of support for this measure dated within the last about 48 hours or so.  
   SELECTMEN'S OFFICE, 
   East Haddam, CT, July 6, 2007. An Act Concerning Designation of the Eightmile River Watershed within the National Wild and Scenic River System.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Chairman, it was Presidents' Day weekend when The Washington Post story broke with the appalling and embarrassing story about the conditions under which our soldiers were living within the military health care system. I think as Americans, nothing could be more shocking and embarrassing than the notion that our own soldiers were isolated within the outpatient services of the military health care systems, in conditions with rotted walls, holes in the ceiling, mold growing. And I would give Mr. Skelton and the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee all the credit because on March 8 the Armed Services Committee held a hearing, looked at the flaws that existed in the system and have come out with this legislation, which will do a lot to make sure that people will not be alone and isolated, with more case managers, with advocates that will be there, and a 1-800 emergency hotline to make sure they won't be, again, alone and isolated. 
   I do think, as Mr. Hunter indicated, probably the biggest problem that is facing returning soldiers right now is the transition from the Department of Defense to the Department of Veterans Affairs. In the State of Connecticut today, the waiting period is over 600 days for over 2,500 veterans in the State of Connecticut trying to get their claims processed. And in section 10 of this bill, which will require a physical transfer of the files, the medical records of people leaving the Department of Defense system into the VA system will make sure that we are going to make a dent in reducing the length of time, which literally is threatening people's mortgage payments, their credit rating, and it is inexcusable that people who have served this country are being treated this poorly. 
   There was an amendment offered by myself on the Armed Services Committee which will also include State Veterans Affairs departments in that handoff because we have many benefits, property tax benefits, educational programs, preferential hiring within our State, like many other States, which returning veterans should be included and informed of immediately. I want to thank the chairman for including that language in the bill and strongly urge its passage.

   Mr. COURTNEY. Just to follow up on the chairman's remarks, it sounds like crocodile tears to hear people talking about underfunding IDEA and title I when last December we had a chance to override the President's veto of the education spending bill, which would have put a serious commitment by this Chamber towards those programs which, indeed, have been underfunded for far too long, but unfortunately, too many Members on the other side of the aisle upheld the President's veto and broke, again, the promises to local communities to pay for Federal mandates. 
   We have a national challenge facing this country, a national energy challenge, national education challenge, and that's what this national bill is focusing on. 
   In Connecticut, the Eastern Connecticut State University Institute for Sustainable Energy did an inventory of school buildings a couple of years ago. They found that 90 percent of the buildings were constructed before 1978, completely energy inefficient. If we could get to an Energy Star rating of 50, which is a very modest rating, we would save 40 percent, not 20 percent, but 40 percent energy costs, which is precious dollars for local communities that are distressed and don't have a property tax base to pay for that kind of investment. 
   This program is focused with a title I formula to needy school districts. We're not just taking dollars and throwing them up in the air across the United States of America. We are helping the communities that need the help and can't afford to invest in green technology. 
   We have districts in my part of Connecticut, Quaker Hill Elementary School, that are making that type of investment, but we need to help the districts that can't afford to do it. 
   That's why, with a title I-based formula, this legislation will accomplish that task. I urge the Chamber's full support.

   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, in 1991, as chairman of the Connecticut House Human Services Committee, I brought out to the floor of the Connecticut Assembly legislation which created a manufacturer's rebate for the State's Medicaid and Connpace prescription drug programs that provide coverage to seniors. The rebate gave the State an 11 percent discount off the average wholesale price of medications purchased by Connecticut. At the time we heard all the same arguments in opposition that are being used today, that rebates were price controls, they stifle R&D, that the State would be left with a restrictive formulary denying needed medications for the elderly. We went ahead and passed that bill, and I can say with pride today that this measure has saved Connecticut taxpayers tens of millions of dollars yearly and resulted in no, I repeat no, harm to Connecticut's seniors or the State's pharmaceutical industry. 
   I point this history out not to pat myself on the back, although I am proud of that legislation, but rather to confirm that H.R. 4's plan for price negotiations is not just a theory but, rather, legislation that is grounded in real life, empirical, successful experience. 
   For those of us who have fought this battle at the State level, this debate is like Yogi Berra's ``deja vu all over again.'' For the fiscal health of Medicare and for the physical health of our seniors, let's vote for H.R. 4.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. Thank you, I want to salute you for organizing this Special Order tonight on the very day where this new Congress rose to its constitutional duty and stood up for the American people who made a watershed historic change last November in terms of expecting us as Members of Congress to lead the way to a new direction in Iraq. The vote again today followed a succession which all of us here as new Members have been part of. I think it is fitting that we are here to discuss that change as the people who really made a difference in terms of changing control of this body. 
   The vote today was, as members of the Armed Services Committee and Ms.  Shea-Porter knows this, was all about what has happened to the military readiness of this country. 
   Chairman Skelton is a passionate believer that this war has almost destroyed the ground forces of this country, the Army and the Marines. This was driven home to me during the July 4 recess. A young man, Army-enlist soldier, came to our district office. In one hand, he had his orders for redeployment, his fourth redeployment to Iraq. He had been to Iraq for two 1-year stints, and an additional stint of 7 months in Afghanistan. So over 4 years, 2 year and 7 months, he has been in a combat zone and barely been home for any rest time. 
   In his other hand, he had a bag filled with prescription medicine for anti-anxiety conditions. Zoloft was one of his prescriptions, which is a very serious medication for that type of condition. Yet we have a situation where he is being sent for the fourth time back into a combat zone. Luckily, our office was able to arrange for him to be seen by a psychiatrist, and a report was prepared which showed that he had full-blown post-traumatic stress, and we are making arrangements with the Army to ensure that he is not sent back into that situation. 
   But that is the dirty little secret about this surge policy, that we are forcing people who are not physically fit because they are not getting adequate rest time at home and, in many cases, who are mentally ill and being sent back into combat zone because of the taxing of our Armed Forces. It has reached the point where they have no other choice but to try and send people who again are well outside any normal guidelines in terms of rest, training and equipment which the Army has set up. 
   This bill today which we voted on and passed by an ever-increasing margin with each succeeding vote here, is an attempt to say as a Nation and as a Congress, which has the constitutional duty to raise the Armed Forces, that we have a duty to change course in Iraq to ensure that we have Armed Forces that are capable of addressing the real national security interests of this country.     
   Certainly being in the middle of a civil war in Iraq is not consistent with the national security interests of this country. 
   As Congresswoman Shea-Porter pointed out today, the front page of the Washington Post has pointed out that al Qaeda now has reached the level of strength that it had before the events of 9/11, that there are training camps in Pakistan that have been allowed to flourish because our eye was taken off the ball with the invasion of Iraq when we should have finished the job in Afghanistan back in 2002 and 2003. 
   We are now in a situation, as Mr. Arcuri just said, we are, in fact, as exposed and as vulnerable as this country was at the time of September 11 because of the outrageous, misguided policies of this administration. 
   This bill, which we voted on today, which sets out a very measured, responsible policy that will change course in Iraq, I think answers all the questions of the doubters and the cynics that we don't have an answer for what happens after a change of course that occurs in Iraq. This is not about Vietnam revisited where people are going to be evacuated in helicopters. 
   This bill lays out a responsible plan for real change in Iraq that addresses the need to approach this problem on a regional basis in the Middle East and reintroduces a diplomatic measure that has been sorely lacking in terms of this administration's policy over the last four-and-a-half years. 
   So, again, I think as new Members who are part of the new majority that have helped revive life in this branch of the government, which was a near rubber stamp over the last 4 years, it is important that I think we are here tonight to reemphasize what took place here in this chamber and to restate our mission to keep faith with the voters that took place last fall and make sure that we have a real change in policy in Iraq. 
   I'd like to yield now to Congressman Ellison from the State of Minnesota who's again part of this new majority here in Congress.

<DOCNO>Mr. COURTNEY. (DISCUSSING THE WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COURTNEY. One day last week, this past week, in Hartford, Connecticut, General Eric Shinseki came and spoke the to World Affairs Council in Hartford. He, speaking of courage, was the chief of the Army at the outset of the Iraq war, was asked the question by the Armed Services Committee, how many forces it would take to secure Iraq after the invasion. He said, hundreds of thousands of troops. 
   As we all know, what happened to him was that because the neoconservatives to dominated the administration at the time didn't want to hear that type of reality; instead, they were wedded to this view, that you could win the war on the cheap. 
   He was bounced out of the Army, after an incredibly distinguished career, decorated combat veteran in Vietnam, one of the people who did an incredible amount of work to bring our Armed Forces back after the debacle of Vietnam. 
   He spoke to the World Affairs Council on Monday and talked about what happened in the wake of Vietnam in terms of our Armed Forces, that the disillusionment and, you know, just the negative fallout that occurred in terms of people enlisting in the Army, departing well before their planned careers were going to actually come to fruition, caused great damage to the Armed Forces that took decades to recover, and that we as a Nation had finally gotten to a point where we had  not just people at the top level but also at the middle levels of the Army who had really gotten a strong, competent force back into place. His concern is that this war in Iraq is going to result in the same damage as an institution to the Army and the Marine Corps. 
   We are seeing it in terms of people departing the service, the mid-level officer corps. We again saw another example where the Army failed to hit its recruiting goals last month. 
   This bill today that we voted on was all about trying to repair the damage that has been done to the military readiness of this country, and General Shinseki, who I think will go down in history as a prophet in this country, as hopefully somebody who still has service to give to this Nation, maybe in a new administration some time or in some other role, is reminding us that we are at grave risk. 
   Again, the quality people, I know we saw it in Iraq when we went and visited, just wonderful, wonderful people serving in uniform in Iraq, helpful, smart, independent minded. But right now they are trapped in a policy by the administration that is basically telling them that their service is just being used in a way that shows no respect for their own wonderful qualities. 
   It is one of the main, most important reasons that this bill today that we voted on has got to get passed and signed into law. We have got to keep chipping away with vote after vote over the next few weeks or so to make sure that the gathering numbers we are picking up on these measures are going to get us to the point where real change is going to happen.

   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, last week, during my work period at home, my district office in Norwich was visited by a young Army enlisted man who had in one hand his orders for his fourth deployment over the last 4 years. Over the last 4 years, he did two 1-year deployments in Iraq and one 7-month deployment in Afghanistan. 
   In his other hand he held a bag of medication, anti-anxiety medication, including Zoloft, because of the post-traumatic stress which we got actually diagnosed from a treating psychiatrist a few days later, which confirmed that his deployments have taken him to the breaking point. That is the dirty little secret about this surge policy, which is that we've broken the ground forces of this country. 
   This legislation crafted by Mr. Skelton, whose number one focus as chairman of the Armed Services Committee is always about raising and maintaining an armed force that can protect our national interest, is desperately needed, primarily for the people who have borne the disproportionate share of this war, which is the people who serve in our uniform and their families.

   Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route National Historic Trail Designation Act, a wonderful piece of legislation which will preserve both our country's rich history but also its unique environment. 
   In the spring of 1781, French General Rochambeau and his army of nearly 5,300 men embarked on an expedition from Newport, Rhode Island, to Yorktown, Virginia, to aid General George Washington and the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War. After traveling through Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, General Rochambeau joined forces with General Washington in Philipsburg, New York, forming a  Franco-American alliance. The Franco-American forces then traveled through New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, eventually arriving at Yorktown. At Yorktown, General Washington and the Continental Army, with the aid of General Rochambeau and his men, secured a decisive victory against General Cornwallis, effectively igniting a successful end to the American Revolutionary War and laying the groundwork for the creation of our new Nation. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Newport to Yorktown route that General Washington and General Rochambeau led their forces through reflects an indispensible piece of American history. Today, we have an opportunity to preserve this historically and ecologically significant route by passing the Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route National Historic Trail Designation Act. The legislation, introduced by my esteemed colleague, Representative Maurice Hinchey, will amend the National Trails System Act to designate the route as a national historic trail. Under this legislation, the Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route National Historic Trail will preserve a corridor approximately 600 miles long, from Newport to Yorktown in nine States and the District of Columbia. The Washington-Rochambeau Trail will include a section in my district in eastern Connecticut. 
   During General Rochambeau's journey to Yorktown, communities in Connecticut served an invaluable role with ensuring the success of General Rochambeau's mission, supplying necessary supplies to his troops. In June of 1781, General Rochambeau and his men began their march through Connecticut before joining forces with General Washington in Philipsburg, New York. In eastern Connecticut, the army established camps in Plainfield, Windham, and Bolton before arriving in Hartford. On the return trip, in October 1782, the Franco-American force again marched through the State after victory in Yorktown. In total, General Rochambeau's army made 47 stops in the State between the journey to and from Yorktown. The Washington-Rochambeau Trail will preserve these sites and educate residents and visitors on the significance of this piece of American history. 
   Mr. Chairman, as urban sprawl continues to threaten the integrity of this route, the passage of this legislation is needed now more than ever. Many of Connecticut's avid historians and devout naturalists are anxious to celebrate the bill's passage. As a cosponsor of this legislation, I ask my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of the Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route National Historic Trail Designation Act, to ensure this historic route is preserved for current and future generations.
