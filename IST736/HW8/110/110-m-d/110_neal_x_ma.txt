<DOCNO>Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, I want to first congratulate the Speaker and Chairman Rangel and Chairman Frank for negotiating this economic stimulus bill which will provide relief to working families and businesses in these difficult times. 
   The bill provides $100 billion in tax relief to working families, targeting this relief to families that really need it. A family earning between 10 and $20,000 will see their taxes cut by 50 percent. For New England families facing rising energy bills, this is well-timed relief and cash in the hands of those most likely to use it to spur on economic growth. 
   Like others, I believe we can and will do more. But I'm a strong supporter of the legislation that's in front of us and urge its adoption. 
   Some have quibbled with the impact of this stimulus, but I believe this is how the Congress should respond in a troubled economy. Abe Lincoln noted that ``The legitimate object of government is to do for a community of people whatever they need to have done, but cannot do at all in their separate and individual capacities.'' 
   Working families, businesses, homeowners, and investors are hurting. This quick infusion of cash to low- and middle-income families, to small businesses and large businesses where necessary, making capital purchases, will jump-start our economy in a quick and efficient way. 
   Is it perfect? No. 
   Is it possible? Yes. 
   Is there more work to be done? Certainly. We will come to that as well in late winter and early spring.     
   This is good work and the leadership should be commended. Mr. Rangel, Mr. Frank, and Speaker Pelosi all should be acknowledged for the work. 
   I thank our friend from Hartford, Connecticut (Mr. Larson) for giving me time.

   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Mr. Leader, most of us are institutionalists here, and we have great regard for this body, and I think we're all a bit discouraged when the regular order does not proceed, and my friend, the minority leader, spoke eloquently of what he feels to be a process that's been limited. 
   But the concern that many of us have is that for 6 years at the Ways and Means Committee, the minority could not pass one amendment. Not one amendment passed in what should be the most deliberative committee in this House, and there were no protestations from the other side that were ever raised. 
   In this instance here on the housing bill, there were two Republican amendments that were accepted. The vote was 30-5, I believe, or 35-5. So there was a process. Actually, people got to talk at the Ways and Means Committee who disagreed with the outcome of the bill, and I understand how the minority feels in this instance. 
   But I wish that there had been some voices raised during those years about what was happening to shut down the process in the Ways and Means Committee, and Mr. McCrery has moved vigorously to change the tone, as Mr. Rangel has included him in everything at the committee level.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Congressman Murphy and thank Congressman Shuster, as well as Jim Oberstar, a long time friend here, for offering the support to this proposal that it deserves. 
   Establishing a New Haven-Hartford-Springfield commuter line would do much to improve the transportation needs of the Northeast Corridor. In addition to contributing to the national effort to reduce carbon emissions, this commuter line would greatly promote economic development for the cities and towns along the line. Union Station, with the help of Mr. Oberstar's committee, is now underway and great work we expect to happen there in Springfield. 
   Mr. Chairman, Connecticut has already dedicated funding for the commuter line and is in the predevelopment phase. And today, the Massachusetts House is expected to approve a $1.3 billion transportation bill authorizing $90 million for the commuter developing road transportation line from New Haven to Springfield. A New Haven to Springfield line would also allow for more connections to existing Amtrak routes as well as other planned commuter rails, such as a Boston to Springfield line, which would further extend economic benefits to the region. 
   Due to improved service, Amtrak ridership has increased in the past few years, and commuters want this progress to continue, particularly in light of gas prices. The Murphy amendment will help maintain this progress and promote this much-needed commuter line. The benefits of incorporating new commuter lines with Amtrak is undeniable and worth the investments. 
   Commuter rail service would help other industrial cities like Springfield to better connect with regional economies and offer a smarter and cleaner transportation option. 
   Thanks to the individuals who have stood with us today, and I hope the Murphy amendment will be successful.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, last Saturday in Dublin, the national executive of Sinn Fein voted in favor of holding a special Ard Fheis on January 28 to vote on a motion supporting police and the rule of law. 
   For those who remain committed to lasting peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland, bringing this peace process to a successful conclusion, it was a development that would have been unimaginable just 10 years ago. 
   On both sides of the Irish Sea, the decision by Sinn Fein was welcomed as historic and important. The Taoiseach of Ireland, Bertie Ahern, called it a landmark and timely decision. The British Secretary of State for the North, Peter Hain, called it a hugely significant move of seismic proportions. 
   Mr. Speaker, as someone who has been involved in this process for three decades, I would describe the action by Sinn Fein as remarkable. It is a reflection of the leadership of Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness. At a critical moment, they honored their commitments and once again kept their word. A vote taken by the executive last week is just the latest example. 
   No one should minimize the difficulties this decision is causing Sinn Fein leadership on the ground, but for nationalists and republicans the issue of policing has been a long and troubled history. I am confident that the special Ard Fheis will see it as a defining moment in Irish history and vote to support policing and the rule of law.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. McDermott for yielding me this time. 
   After I got done hearing my friend from Pennsylvania speak, I was reminded once again of a recurring theme in this town from Republicans: have they ever met a special interest they didn't love. 
   The struggles of Big Oil: profits last year of 117 percent. Remember as we heard these arguments just a couple of minutes ago from those champions of the average guy, as they would have you believe today, these are the people who in a craven moment in the closing days of the 109th Congress tied an increase in the minimum wage to repeal of the estate tax, conveniently forgetting about that individual who had to work one day a week at minimum wage just to fill their gasoline tanks. 
   This is good policy. It is sensible, and it speaks to the idea of returning $14 billion to the Treasury that will be redirected to renewable and energy-efficient programs resulting in a cleaner and more efficient America where both consumer and business reap the benefits. 
   Advancing progressive energy will wean us off of foreign oil, which all Americans agree is needed. It has been said that American needs another Manhattan Project, not to create weapons of mass destruction, but to create masses of jobs by harnessing America's technological innovation. 
   We all know how many jobs have been lost due to foreign competition, and we are going to continue to lose them if we fail to make the necessary investments in energy technology and the people who are behind the research and its development. 
   Put the American people and their interests first here. The idea that we would drill on public land and not seek some sort of compensation for the Federal Government, relief for the taxpayer, is ridiculous.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Lantos and certainly Chairman SMITH for bringing this resolution to the floor today. 
   One of the reasons that American foreign policy has triumphed in Ireland has been because this was done in a bipartisanship way, a bipartisanship way, the way American foreign policy formally was conducted. And the success that we have enjoyed in the North of Ireland has largely been indispensable due to the involvement of America, and revisiting these cases, as Mr. Smith has requested and Mr. Lantos has sanctioned, is terribly important. 
   Think of these murders, cold-blooded murders, shooting down attorneys who were providing a common defense for suspected, suspected, members of the IRA. Never was there ever indication that they were members of the IRA; they were suspected members of the IRA, and they were not entitled to a common defense under the former justice system in the North of Ireland. So, the attorneys are murdered as well as the suspected members of the IRA. 
   What is notable about this is what occurred last week. Many of us in this Chamber, Members of this House, have been involved in cases dating back to Gibraltar, to Birmingham, and to a series of other cases which we in this House brought forward. It is Members of this body that demanded that the British Government bring these cases to light and be put under the magnifying glass of critical analysis. And now we find that not only was there collusion on the ground, there was collusion at the highest levels of the British Government where the military gave information to paramilitaries on the loyalist side, who then cleared the area so that attorneys could be targeted for assassination. That is how far reaching these murders were. 
   What is also significant is this: It is because of this Chamber that the IRA and its political ally Sinn Fein had the courage to proceed with not only disarmament but, just as importantly, they decided to join policing. And let me just say this about policing today in the North of Ireland. One section of the community used policing to keep the other section of the community in line. That is what this was about. 
   And now the faith that has been offered by the Good Friday Agreement, again in a bipartisan sense, has allowed us to proceed and to move forward. And it could not have been done without people like Mr. Smith. And I could go on and on with Members of this Chamber, and Mr. Lantos again offers support to this initiative today. 
   So it is terribly important. And I want to thank all of you, and Mr. McCord, the chief constable from the North of Ireland will be in my office tomorrow to answer questions from the Members of Congress

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, today we're voting on a historic trade agreement with Peru. Let me thank CHARLIE RANGEL and SANDY LEVIN for the diligence they demonstrated in negotiating with the administration. 
   This trade deal is about exports. Make no mistake about it, Mr. Speaker, the labor and environmental provisions in the Peru FTA are big steps towards a more progressive trade policy where trade benefits are spread more broadly in a global economy. 
   Regarding labor, the FTA includes a fully enforceable commitment that Peru adopt and maintain the five basic international labor standards. Peruvian President Garcia has already implemented changes to Peru's legal framework to allow compliance with international labor standards. A key provision allows the United States to challenge any violation of Peru's commitments to labor standards. Like the labor provision, the environmental provisions in the Peru FTA are also unprecedented. This legislation before us not only makes significant steps in the right direction, but it also moves aggressively in stopping illegal logging. 
   In addition to the significant reductions in tariff and nontariff barriers to U.S. exports, again, it's about exports, the agreement also includes important provisions relating to generic medicines, government procurement, and investment protections. 
   Mr. Speaker, the importance in progress associated with the Peru FTA will allow a lot of Democrats tonight for the first time to vote for an FTA. I know the decision is not easy, but it's a testament to the new and improved course that American trade policy has undertaken, which reflects the best of American values. 
   Mr. Speaker, the legally binding labor and environmental standards in the Peru FTA is a universe apart from CAFTA. This is not CAFTA. This is not NAFTA, which only received a handful of Democratic votes. Implementation of the FTA will give momentum to other efforts to secure forward-thinking FTAs. 
   This is the result of CHARLIE RANGEL and SANDY LEVIN's hard work and dedication, and I urge support of this legislation.

   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. First, let me thank Congressman Frank; he did a good job under very difficult circumstances, as did Mr. Rangel with the tax extenders that are part of this bill. 
   This is imperfect legislation, like much legislation that comes to the floor of this House, but we need to pass it today. 
   The national principle here is at stake. If there's a hurricane in Louisiana, we all come to the aid of the American family. If there's a forest fire in California, we all come to the aid of the American family. If there's a blizzard in New England, we all come to the aid of the American family. And that's precisely what this legislation does today. 
   Next week, when people are having difficulty getting a car loan, trying to refinance their mortgage or looking at their 401(k) plan, we acknowledge that they are all members of the American family, and we attempt today to come to their aid. 
   There is relief here for alternative minimum tax victims; 25 million people will benefit. Twelve thousand businesses are waiting for incentives for the R&D credit. Four million families and three million teachers are waiting for their deductions for education expenses. Thirteen million children in low-income families can finally claim the child tax credit. 
   This is a piece of legislation that helps the American family.

   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. I would like to thank the gentleman for yielding and I would like to ask him a question about the bill. 
   It is my understanding that the bill is designed to give all banks, especially community banks, which are very important in central and western Massachusetts, and because they are heavily regulated don't have any problems, regardless of size or organizational structure, ordinary tax treatment for certain holdings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock. Banks, and in particular some State-chartered institutions, are allowed to hold such stock in passive investment vehicles where the bank is the majority investor under Federal law. 
   I encourage the chairman to work with the Secretary of the Treasury to ensure that all institutions have access to this relief, if he agrees it is intended to have an expansive reach.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I want to acknowledge Mr. Levin's role, in not only the construction of this legislation, but the role that he's played, I think, in trade issues. 
   I rise in support of the Trade and Global Assistance Act of 2007. Otherwise known as TAA, this program has been successful in transitioning workers who have been displaced by foreign trade into new jobs. Many workers and businesses in my home district in Massachusetts have already been beneficiaries of assistance provided by TAA. 
   The bill we're considering today will provide extended and expanded benefits and do so for more workers. It will also expand the critical health care coverage that these displaced workers and their families need. 
   The bill doubles the current funding amount for retraining of workers for new jobs. But what might be the most exciting new feature in this proposal is the manufacturing and redevelopment zones which are very similar to the popular enterprise and empowerment zones that many American cities have had great success with. These new manufacturing zones will provide businesses with a host of incentives to redevelop in areas that have suffered substantial reductions in manufacturing employment. 
   TAA extension and expansion should go hand in hand with more free trade agreements. As one who is a supporter of the Peru Free Trade Agreement, which the committee of Ways and Means has just approved, TAA is the safety net we need to enact in a case-  by-case opportunity to give benefits to workers and industries who have been displaced or disrupted because of these agreements. Of course, it is our hope and intent that all free trade agreements lift all economies and industries of both participating countries. But if businesses are impacted and workers are impacted, we must have TAA to retrain that workforce for the jobs of the future. 
   I urge full adoption of this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. I want to applaud the work of my friend, Chairman BARNEY FRANK, in negotiating this agreement on behalf of the House. Compared with the proposal of a week ago from the Bush administration, this agreement has much improved. 
   I have already heard from a number of my constituents this morning who oppose the bill and I understand their opposition. I think it is clear that we are not done with this matter. There is more to do, and even under this bill, Congress will revisit the agreement in 5 years to determine whether the taxpayers are due some repayment from the industry saved by this bailout. 
   At this time, though, it is important that we proceed forward with this limited authority, which is only provided with substantial oversight. It is an appropriate balance and that is why I will support the bill. 
   But as I said, there is more to be done. John F. Kennedy said that victory has a thousand fathers, but defeat is an orphan. It is true that no one has stepped forward to claim responsibility for the economic quandary we find ourselves in. But if we simply look back to the last time the financial services industry teetered on the brink of disaster, we can see roots that lead to the crisis we confront today. 
   A decade ago, Long Term Capital Management, a billion-dollar hedge fund lost half its value due to sour derivative contracts and the Federal Reserve Chairman had to arrange a bailout. Complexity is the name of the game in the derivatives market, and that fact has not changed over the last decade. Derivatives are financial products with a value derived from an underlying asset, such as a stock or commodity. The accounting and tax rules regarding these products, though, are anything but clear and that part of the game has also not changed over the last decade. 
   I am concerned about one section of the bill we are considering today which would grant the SEC authority to suspend mark-to-market accounting. This accounting rule requires companies to declare the market value of assets. With financial products, this may differ from the purchase price. Plus, the value might be hard to determine until the contract expires some time in the future. However, in valuing derivatives, I believe it is important that there be transparency in the market, and mark-to-market accounting is probably the closest to the actual value and is therefore, an essential tool for investors. Think of it this way: if someone asked you for a loan and their only asset is their house which could be sold for $100,000, would you care that they had paid $200,000 for it a year ago? 
   Should we care about accounting rules for derivatives? Well, clearly yes. It would be easy to assume regulators are taking care of these issues, but recent events show us that is not the case. It would be easy for us to dismiss the threat of derivatives since only sophisticated investors hold them, but as Warren Buffet warned in 2002, ``Derivates are financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal.'' 
   In March, the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures, which I chair, held a hearing on the taxation of derivatives. At that hearing, I referred to the threat of AIG directly as one reason our hearing was timely. AIG had just the week before devalued its holdings by $5 billion because of one complex derivative--the credit default swap. I asked the Treasury Department, which appeared before my subcommittee that day, what guidance we might expect on the appropriate tax treatment of credit default swaps, since in their absence, investors were free to choose whatever seemed most convenient. Treasury said it was still under review. 
   Taxpayers and investors need clarity in the market with respect to these complex products. While some may blame mark-to-market accounting for the problems of individual companies, it merely exposed that these companies were holding worthless paper. And I believe news like that is better known earlier rather than later, and to all investors, not just insiders. 
   The global market for derivatives exceeds $500 trillion in notional value, according to the Bank for International Settlements. Hedging risks via derivatives is a normal practice of businesses, but the ``Wild West'' trading in these products must be addressed by regulation and transparency. Of course, all businesses would prefer to choose whichever accounting method makes them look the most profitable to investors and the least profitable to the IRS. But we need consistent rules and a system of valuing businesses which is fair to investors, regulators, and the tax collector. 
   A decade ago, I stood on the floor lamenting the near-crisis that Long Term Capital Management had created. I chastised Congress for ignoring the request of the regulator, CFTC, which had asked for more oversight over derivatives. Since then, we have seen Enron collapse and now our current crisis. Will things be different this time? I certainly hope that is the case. But changing the accounting rules mid-game, I believe, is a move in the wrong direction. I hope that the SEC will take the long view on this and study the issue before reversing any current accounting rules meant to provide greater transparency. 
   In 1999, I filed legislation to strengthen the constructive ownership rules so that investors in a hedge fund via a derivative could not avoid current taxation on income earned. This legislation was directly aimed at Long Term Capital Management and based on legislation my colleague and friend Representative Barbara Kennelly had previously filed. In 2002, I filed legislation to end the game of corporations betting on their own stock via derivatives. The Tax Code does not allow corporations to claim gains or losses when trading in its own stock, but that provision can be avoided through derivative transactions. This year, I filed legislation to require current taxation on prepaid forward contracts, as investors had been taking the position that no taxation was appropriate until the end of the contract, which could be 30 years hence. 
   I will continue my efforts to bring transparency to these products and to end the tax game on derivatives. Further, this bill affords us the opportunity to implement a regulatory structure that will result in a healthier market. On both fronts, I hope we will see action.

<DOCNO>Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, as the House considers tax legislation to promote the development and deployment of alternative and renewable energy technologies, I rise today in support of the proposed plug-in electric drive motor vehicle tax credit and, in particular, making the tax credit even more robust and immediate by including in the credit road-certified two-wheel vehicles and low-  speed neighborhood electric vehicles. I support the underlying bill, but hope as it progresses that this clean energy incentive may also be included. 
   I know that House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rangel and the House Leadership are committed to renewing existing energy tax provisions and enacting new incentives for environmentally-friendly, domestic energy production. And I believe that the tax credit for plug-in electric drive vehicles is a critical component of that commitment. This tax credit will encourage the ongoing efforts to develop and bring to the marketplace the technology that will be necessary for these vehicles to become a common occurrence on our roads and highways. Tailpipe emissions from the combustion of gasoline and diesel fuel are by far the largest contributors to climate change and the air quality problems that exist in many regions of our country. This tax credit will go directly at addressing these issues by displacing foreign oil with electricity that is domestically produced with--it is my hope--a significant and growing renewable component. 
   The plug-in electric drive vehicle tax credit is so vital to our alternative and renewable energy priorities that it should begin working as soon as it is enacted, but it can only do so by expanding the credit to include both road-certified two-wheel vehicles and low-speed neighborhood electric vehicles, which are now in retail production. These vehicles are specifically designed to address the short-haul transportation needs of urban and suburban communities. Because the first mile of a trip creates the most tailpipe emissions, these vehicles can play an important and significant role in mitigating the unique contribution of urban and suburban transportation to our air quality and climate change problems. 
   If enacted, the plug-in electric drive motor vehicle tax credit will be an important element of our policy to encourage the development and deployment of alternatives to the consumption of foreign oil. As the manufacturers of electric drive two-wheel and low-speed vehicles already are demonstrating, this policy also has the added benefit of creating quality jobs here in the U.S. 
   While the technology for plug-in electric cars is still being developed, road-certified two-wheel vehicles and low-speed neighborhood electric vehicles can begin reducing our reliance on foreign oil today, and including these vehicles in the tax credit will help develop a consumer market for them, just as the credit will help create a market for plug-in electric automobiles and trucks that are expected to come on-line in a few years. 
   Again, I thank the Speaker and Chairman Rangel for their important work on the critical issue of ensuring our Nation's energy security.

   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume, and I want to thank Chairman Rangel. 
   Let me stand in support of this energy and tax extenders legislation we are considering today. I have been here for 20 years. This is a good piece of work. I want to thank Charlie Rangel for his hard work on this legislation again and again and again. 
   This is the sixth time we are going to send this energy package over to the other body. But they keep moving the goalpost. And every time they move the goalpost a few yards farther, we still pass the bill. We keep meeting their demands, and they keep saying it's not good enough. A clean AMT patch is on the way to the Senate. It's already been declared dead on arrival. It seems in the other body they can't take ``yes'' for an answer. 
   As my colleagues here know, this bill contains extensions of popular tax incentives that expired at the end of last year. This has to be done. This needs to get under way. 
   I want to thank Chairman Rangel for asserting the constitutional responsibility of the House of Representatives in moving this legislation and within this body, the Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over this matter. 
   In my home State, 94,000 teachers will get a deduction for their out-of-pocket expenses for classroom supplies, 1,000 businesses in Massachusetts will get some credit for the millions they spend on research here in the U.S. 
   The R&D tax credit is important. Without this bill, 121,000 families in Massachusetts cannot take a deduction on their college tuition expenses. 
   This bill includes a number of popular and forward-thinking incentives for energy efficiency. There are many well-crafted positions and provisions in this bill. There is not enough time to mention them all this morning. 
   Let me conclude by simply saying that Chairman Rangel has crafted a very balanced bill which does no harm to the Federal Treasury. It asks that hedge fund managers pay a bit more, and it delays an international tax break that hasn't gone into effect yet. It is responsible legislation. 
   I urge support of this bill, and let's send a strong message to the Senate and to the President. We want this tax relief bill done now, and we can do it in a fiscally responsible way. 
   Madam Speaker, with that I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, the provisions of H.R. 7060, the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008, provides tax relief by extending generally for 2 years various energy tax incentives and other temporary tax provisions. I have asked the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation to make available to the public a technical explanation of the bill, JCX75-08. The technical explanation expresses the committee's understanding and legislative intent behind this important legislation. It is available on the Joint Committee's Web site at www.jct.gov. 
   Madam Speaker, the Senate has not sent a bill over to us. None of us got elected here to defer to what the other body happens to think on any given day. We have repeatedly sent them good legislation over the course of the last year and a half, only to have it summarily rejected. 
   I want to submit today, I bet you during the course of Mr. Camp's career, along with mine, that will be the last time he quotes the majority leader of the United States Senate on a piece of legislation. 
   This is a responsible bill, and it is the constitutional prerogative of the House of Representatives to originate this legislation. What is the sense of being on the Ways and Means Committee if you defer to the other body on these matters? We have separate responsibilities for good reason, and that's what we are entertaining today. 
   A reminder--there is no Senate bill to consider. They have not sent one over. How about the idea that they have said if they don't have the paperwork by 11 o'clock, they're not going to consider this bill. Why be on the Ways and Means Committee? Why be a member of the House of Representatives? 
   We have done a good job with these legislative matters and sent them back to them responsibly. We have rules here, and we adhere to them. That is the fundamental difference. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

Since when do we submit here without asking any questions of the executive to the whims of what they might want to do? 
   I want to say this today. The reason that historians will write about the last 7 1/2 years being as difficult as it has been for the American people, including what is in front of this Nation today, is because the minority today, who were the majority for the first 6 years of the Bush administration, they abdicated their responsibility. 
   The job of this body is to occasionally ask a question of the President of the United States. Instead, it was, ``Yes, Mr. President.'' 
   ``Can we move quickly enough, Mr. President?'' 
   ``Weapons of mass destruction? Yes, Mr. President.'' 
   ``Invasion of Iraq? Yes, Mr. President.'' 
   ``$2.3 trillion worth of tax cuts? Yes, Mr. President.'' 
   ``Regulations thrown out the window? Yes, Mr. President.'' 
   Since when do Members of this body ask themselves is it okay with the United States Senate? Is it okay with the President of the United States? 
   Our job here is to help the 660,000 people that sent us here, and that means occasionally clearing your throat and saying, ``No, Mr. President.'' 
   This bill addresses many fundamental issues for the American people. The R&D tax credit is very important. When the Senate says to us they're not going to act on our legislation if we don't get it over there by 11 o'clock, they haven't even submitted a bill to us to act upon. 
   This deference all of a sudden to the United States Senate surprises me. We have a separate responsibility here to move forward with what we believe to be in the best interest of the American people and not to accept automatically what the executive branch says or what the Senate says. 
   I've been associated with some good legislation, and from time to time perhaps in this body over two decades, some not-so-good legislation. This, Mr. Speaker, is a good piece of legislation, and the minority was included in the writing of this legislation.

   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I'm honored to serve as chairman of the Select Revenue Measures Subcommittee. That subcommittee reviews tax legislation that has been referred to the Ways and Means Committee. We take this responsibility most seriously. Raising or lowering the tax burden on families and businesses has a real impact, both on those individuals and on the economy. 
   I was concerned when I heard debate last week suggesting that the House had changed our procedural rules for considering tax increases. The gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price) mistakenly stated that the House rules no longer require a supermajority for tax rate increases. 
   The House rules on this subject are exactly the same as they were under the last Congress. The rule was written by the Republican majority back in 1997 and has remained unchanged. 
   I simply wanted to ensure that the record was entirely clear on this subject.

   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, imagine Republicans today saying that they don't trust local government and local decision-making. As a former mayor, let me tell you, that is where much of the great creativity and innovation takes place, in America's cities and town halls. 
   There is an opportunity here to experiment. This is using a Republican argument. What might work well in Arizona might not work well in Connecticut, or vice versa. This is an opportunity to hear from the mayors of America, to hear from the town halls, to hear from legislative leaders and Governors. They are the people every day who make important decisions. 
   Are Republicans saying at this moment they have contempt or mistrust of local decision-making? That has been almost the phrase that they have adopted for the last 25 years: ``turn decision-making back to local government.'' There are different regional problems that demand different regional solutions, and this offers the opportunity. 
   Lastly, our friend, the gentleman from Pennsylvania, said it was good for the blogosphere. One thing we know about Republicans, if they thought they could drill for oil in the blogosphere, they would give it a go.

   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support an energy bill that puts our country on a greener energy path. The tax provisions will expedite the adoption of green energy from solar, wind, biofuels, geothermal and other environmentally friendly sources. 
   The $16 billion energy tax package helps energy stakeholders and communities to invest in renewable sources as well as energy conservation and efficiency. 
   One of the new and more progressive tax provisions is an energy conservation bond program which helps municipalities finance conservation projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Massachusetts stands to receive over $76 million through this program and since the largest cities and counties are given priority in this program, Springfield, Massachusetts, would be eligible for $1.8 million in bonding authority helping to lead the way to a greener Massachusetts. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation takes an innovative approach to new technologies and ideas to promote greener energy. The incentives are not narrowly focused on energy industry players alone. Consumers are also given incentives to make energy-efficient investments in their homes and properties, which represents a holistic approach to lessening our reliance on fossil fuels and towards a greener, cleaner America.

   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, I am delighted that this bipartisan legislation to assist our veterans is before the House today. It also is certainly of great assistance to our active duty military and Reservists and indeed their families. The bill we are considering today is the product of a joint hearing held last month by the Select Revenue Measures Subcommittee led by myself and the Ranking Member English and the Income Security Subcommittee led by Chairman McDermott and Ranking Member Weller. We heard from a number of veterans advocates, military families groups, the Social Security Administration, Members of Congress and others who discussed their proposals to either enhance tax provisions or reduce burdens on those who serve or volunteer for America. 
   The bill we are considering today, which passed out of the full committee last week, is a product of those deliberations and will go far to assist those serving this country, again, emphasizing support for their families. This country is fortunate that so many soldiers and sailors have been willing to sacrifice for our defense. We must remember, once again, that this is a shared sacrifice. The families of someone serving this country can suffer financially, as well as emotionally, during extended tours. Congress has a responsibility to ensure that the Tax Code and other income security provisions do not create problems but, rather, solve them for military families. That is exactly what this bill will allow us to do.

   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   First of all, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. English) for the usual courtesy that he extends to all Members of this body, and particularly those of us who are on the Ways and Means Committee. I also wish to acknowledge Chairman Rangel and Mr. McCrery who worked to accommodate suggestions from several Members of the House. We thank those Members, both Republicans and Democrats, for generating many of the good ideas contained in this bipartisan bill. 
   Let me describe some of the provisions in this bill. The bill makes permanent the current provision waiving the 10 percent withdrawal penalty for those called up to active duty who need to tap into retirement accounts. 
   The bill allows families to roll over amounts received as death gratuity benefits into Roth IRAs or education savings accounts. 
   The bill makes a number of changes related to supplemental security income or SSI eligibility and military service. 
   And the bill makes permanent the special rule treating combat pay as earned income for the purposes of the earned income tax credit, or EITC. 
   The bill also provides a number of changes to allow employers the flexibility to extend benefits to workers called up to duty and will expand certain provisions that provide mortgage assistance to veterans through qualified bond programs. 
   The bill also includes incentives for those who volunteer their services Stateside, such as firefighters and emergency responders. 
   And for those who had an opportunity to attend our hearing and listen to the moving testimony by the widow of a Reservist whose pension was cut in half because he did not ``return to work'' after being killed in action, you will be pleased to know, as all Members of the body will, that this bill we are considering today fixes that problem for good. 
   The British leader Benjamin Disraeli noted, ``The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example.'' Let us set our own example today of a Congress that responds to families in need. Let us show our heroes and their families that we acknowledge and appreciate their service. 
   Not only do I encourage support for this bipartisan bill, I want to reiterate what was stated a few moments ago by my friend, Mr. English. This is a very firm example of what happens in this House of Representatives when Members put aside differences and proceed with the common principle that American veterans deserve help. So let us show our support for this legislation. I urge adoption of this bill.

   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking Mr. Frank. In the 30 years that I've known him, I've yet to meet anybody who has done a better job of mastering the most arcane detail of complicated housing policy. In fact, in some measure, we're here today because of the energy that he's brought to the task at hand. 
   Mr. Speaker, I also rise today in support of this housing assistance tax package which has been reported by the Ways and Means Committee. I want to thank Chairman Rangel for his leadership on this very important national issue. 
   There is little doubt that the sagging housing industry, now at historic lows, has been a drag on our national economy. This legislation would stimulate that industry and help families who have been caught up in this struggling economy. 
   This legislation provides tax credits for first-time homebuyers, and it boosts credits for construction of affordable housing. It allows families to deduct property taxes who couldn't do so before.     
   It increases mortgage revenue bonds and it allows the States to refinance troubled subprime loans. 
   This assistance is targeted to those who need it most. It will also help bring economic stability to our communities. And these provisions are revenue neutral, I emphasize ``revenue neutral,'' using a provision from the President's own budget to pay for much of the cost. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill has been endorsed by the Home Builders, the Realtors and State Housing Administrators. It passed with the support of 12 Republican members of the Ways and Means Committee, including my friend and the distinguished ranking member, Mr. McCrery. It is broadly supported, it's bipartisan in nature, and I am proud to bring it to this House today. 
   There are but two changes to our amendment. One is a package of technical improvements from the Financial Services Committee to better coordinate the various housing tax and HUD programs. The other is--and I hope that everybody will listen to this suggestion--a provision approved by the Veterans Affairs Committee to extend from 90 days to 1 year the protection against foreclosure for servicemembers returning from active duty. I can't imagine that there is a voice in this body who would not be supportive of that initiative, the idea that in Afghanistan and/or in Iraq, that a servicemember who is doing all that's asked of him or her every day would find themselves facing mortgage foreclosure because of their military service. 
   As chairman of the Select Revenue Measures Subcommittee, again I stand in strong support of the legislation that's before us today. It includes a number of improvements to the affordable housing program. 
   Our subcommittee considered these provisions last summer. And at the urging of housing officials, developers, and advocates for low-income families, they have all been included in the Ways and Means amendment that we consider today. I urge its adoption. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I was asking a Member of the minority last evening, ``Is it possible to be an aggrieved Member of the majority?'' In these instances I think you can be an aggrieved Member of the majority. 
   But I want to emphasize a very important point: This legislation received overwhelming support from the minority in the committee, and I think based upon news accounts this morning that there was some conflict in two major dailies as to whether or not the administration would, in fact, veto this legislation, but I can't overstate enough this simple point: There was ample opportunity for the minority to participate in the debate at the Ways and Means Committee; and, in fact, they succeeded in amending the legislation that has come to the floor today, and every voice was heard. 
   Mr. Speaker, with that I would like to yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Berkley).

   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, let me see what I can do to lift the spirits of the gentleman from New York, my friend, Mr. Reynolds. 
   In fact, I think what is sad is that you are leaving us, that you're retiring. And I was searching hard to figure out the meaning of that acronym, based upon the fact that the Ways and Means Committee took this legislation up, and I want to reiterate, for the fourth time today, 12 of the 17 Republicans on the committee voted for the very bill that they are now all saying they are going to oppose. Forgive me. That is sad. How can you come to the floor and argue against the proposal that you voted for in the committee when you agree with just about every part of the bill?     
   That's what's before us here. We have heard these arguments, and they have all said, we support most of what's in the bill, but they are prepared because of an institutional constraint with the Senate to vote against the legislation that they favor. 
   In my home State of Massachusetts, it's sixth in the Nation in foreclosure activity. In Springfield, the largest community in my district, 300 homes have been foreclosed this year and over 2,000 mortgages will reset to higher interest rates by the end of next year. 
   In response to the worsening housing crisis, Massachusetts this month initiated a new law that extends the foreclosure moratorium from 30 to 90 days. Other States are taking similar action, but, like Massachusetts, they need help from Congress. 
   Reports seem to suggest that the housing slide won't turn around until 2010. These tax provisions we are considering today for families and communities will help turn it around, I hope, much sooner. It certainly will help our economy and markets in general. 
   The President's housing proposals really haven't worked. It's time for the Congress to act. We are often accused of having a short memory, but I think all Members in this chamber remember the recent government-backed bailout of Bear Stearns, yes, the bailout of that mom-and-pop operation called Bear Stearns. If we can, with great urgency and enthusiasm, come to the aid of Wall Street, we have no excuse not to help the people who reside on Main Street. 
   I hope that my colleagues will support this legislation, and I ask unanimous consent to yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank).

   My friend, Mr. McCrery, said if we had had an opportunity to vet this issue. Let me remind the audience, the Republicans required us to read the bill. The Ways and Means Committee spent 6 hours reading the bill. To argue that somehow there was not an opportunity to vet the issue when we read the bill is akin to setting the fire and calling the fire department. That is the argument we are being asked to embrace.

   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Let me commend Mr. Rangel again for his continued leadership on a very important national issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, this morning's New York Times headlines tell part of the story: ``Gas Prices Soar, Posing a Threat to the Family Budget.'' Gas prices have been soaring for the last 2 years. Last evening's newscast led with, ``What's Happened to Gasoline Prices?'' 
   If you live in the Northeast, Mr. Speaker, you know what's happened to low-income and middle-class families during this winter heating season. They are struggling to pay energy costs that have skyrocketed in the middle of a harsh winter. 
   The elderly are particularly vulnerable at a time when they are trying to secure medicine, food and other daily necessities. Circumstances similar to this were evident last week when HHS belatedly released $40 million in emergency contingency funds from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP. 
   By the way, for our Republican friends who might have forgotten, it was Congressman Silvio Conte, a Republican, who helped to inaugurate the LIHEAP program here in Congress that has done so much good for all Americans. 
   We can and should do more so that struggling people don't have to fear the possibility of going to bed in a cold house. In a Nation that has been blessed with so much, we ought to be able to agree on the necessities of food and medicine and shelter, and, yes, to make sure people don't go to bed in a cold house. 
   This bill offers important incentives for renewable and efficient energy programs, as well as energy conservation. 
   We held hearings last year on all of these initiatives. They were met with standing-room-only audiences. People are anxious to explore the advantages of alternative energy resources. 
   This legislation in front of us today helps to invite a debate and a discussion about where we need to go as a Nation. This important legislation calls attention to the opportunity to promote progressive energy and cost savings for the American family. 
   Whether it's clean, renewable energy bonds for municipalities, something I am particularly excited about, and my guess is even those who don't like this bill today on the Republican side, they will encourage their municipalities to take advantage of these opportunities should they arise. 
   It also offers a residential energy-efficient property credit. It offers improved incentives for businesses to deploy wind, solar, geothermal and other promising technologies. 
   I would think if you were a Member of Congress from Texas, you certainly would like the incentives that are offered here on the basis of wind power. 
   This legislation will put us on a path to cleaner, greener and stronger families and a stronger America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   I rise in support of the AMT Relief Act of 2007. We are here again in an effort to protect 23 million American taxpayers from higher taxes on April 15. Almost 19 million of those taxpayers have never paid AMT before, and some indeed have not even heard of AMT. With this bill, we can ensure that it stays that way. 
   My district alone will see an increase from 7,300 families hit by AMT to 67,000 people hit by AMT. We have individuals across this country, including Maggie Rauh from my district who is a CPA and who testified that her family income is at $75,000. She takes the standard deduction. They have three children. She is going to pay AMT. That family trip to Disneyland next year is on hold. 
   Joel Campbell of Loudoun County, Virginia told the committee that his family had to choose between saving more for retirement or paying for college. Higher taxes because of AMT are forcing middle- and upper middle-income families to make these difficult choices. 
   So we all agree that AMT should not be affecting these working families, but we cannot agree on how to do it. And that is the point: Everybody agrees that it has got to be fixed. The Republicans propose to borrow $50 billion; we intend to proceed with paying for this issue. When I hear the argument that we should forget about it because it was never intended to hit middle-income people, as Mr. Rangel noted, I would like to try that on my creditors. 
   The Republicans believe that we should not offset this tax increase for middle-income people. Indeed, the President's budgets for the last few years have all counted on this revenue, and he projects next year precisely the same thing. 
   We made a pledge earlier this year to the American taxpayer that we would do no harm to the Federal budget. So if we lower tax revenues, we have to make up for that loss and not add to the deficit. That PAYGO pledge is difficult and painful, but most sensible. 
   The bill that we bring before the House today is a smaller package than before. The expiring provisions and the carried interest revenue raisers are gone. In the face of opposition to our offsets, we cannot retain this package because of the expiring tax provisions. It is my hope that we can turn to these provisions again in the near future and perhaps, if necessary, make them retroactive, indeed. 
   This bill provides that offshore hedge fund managers not enjoy unlimited deferral from any taxation on their compensation. We have all seen the news reports of these hedge fund people deferring hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation offshore because of a tax loophole. This bill closes that loophole, and it gives tax relief to 23 million families. 
   The bill also provides that a corporate tax shelter abuser be subject to new rules requiring economic substance in transactions. Let me interpret. It has to be for real. By cracking down on tax shelter abusers, we are able to provide tax relief to the families of 13 million children in minimum wage households who get little or no refundable child tax credits. 
   The bill is simple. The bill is straightforward. Despite some opposition, we are going to persevere in our path to responsible tax cuts. Ecclesiastes teaches us that the race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong. That does not affect our conviction here that we intend to persevere on the right path. We stand by our pledge to the American taxpayer and hope to convince others to join our battle today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I think we've done a good job of balancing small business tax incentives with an increase in the minimum wage. 
   Both workers and employers come out winners. And because the bill is revenue neutral, the taxpayer also wins. 
   The bill provides a few billion dollars of tax relief in the first few years while businesses are absorbing the minimum wage increase. 
   These tax benefits include a 1-year extension of the WOTC, Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which is a credit for employers who hire the hard-to-employ. 
   Eligible workers include those from low-income communities, or those on public assistance, or veterans who simply need a boost in getting back into the workforce. 
   Our bipartisan bill also doubles the WOTC credit for hiring veterans with service-connected disabilities. 
   The bill also increases and extends the small business expensing allowance so that small business owners can write-off capital expenditures. 
   A small business owner buying equipment or new computers can immediately recoup the cost, rather than depreciating the asset over several years. 
   And the bill allows businesses to continue to take a full ``tip credit'' for their tipped workers. Otherwise, with the increase in the minimum wage, these business owners would lose a significant amount of the tip credit right away. 
   I applaud the work of Chairman RANGEL and Mr. MCCRERY who drafted this bipartisan bill. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. I thank the gentleman for yielding the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is pro-environment, it's business friendly, and it's paid for. 
   I don't know how anybody on the other side can mention the words ``alternative minimum tax'' with a straight face. They had sufficient opportunity in the last session of the Congress to vote for a responsible alternative minimum tax repeal. I know. I authored the legislation. They all voted against it. 
   I want to thank Charlie Rangel today for his hard work. There are a number of business and individual tax incentives that lapsed in January of this year. There was urgency to getting it done, and we did precisely that. In my home State of Massachusetts this means that 94,000 teachers will get a deduction for out-of-pocket expenses for classroom supplies. It means that a thousand businesses in Massachusetts will get some credit for the millions they spend on research here in the United States. Without this bill 121,000 families in Massachusetts cannot take deduction for college tuition expenses. 
   This bill provides significant and real tax relief to millions of families nationwide and for some very low income families it will provide a new benefit. There are 111,000 children in Massachusetts whose families will get a higher tax credit because of this bill. 
   There are an additional 32,000 children and families in Massachusetts who are currently shut out of the child tax credit because of the threshold for earnings that must exceed rises each year for inflation. They're simply too poor for the tax credit. This bill lowers the threshold so that these working families can benefit from the child tax credit just like other families. 
   These are well-crafted positions, and we don't have time to mention them all. But I want to tell you in the 20 years I have been in this House, this is one of the best pieces of legislation that I have been associated with. It provides tax relief, but at the same time it's pro-environment. 
   I hope that Members of this House on both sides will support this legislation.

   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. I yield myself 1 minute, Madam Speaker. 
   Madam Speaker, my friend, the gentleman from New York, said the Republicans are blamed for this and the Republicans are blamed for that, and the Republicans are blamed for this. Let's make it clear. They ought to be blamed for this. It is the Republicans in the Senate, it's the Republicans in the House, and it's the Republican at the White House that have caused this moment. They want to borrow the money. They talk about finding common ground. The easiest loophole to close that I have been part of in the last 19 years is the one that we've offered on this floor for wealthy hedge fund managers who hide money on the island nations to avoid taxes. We're asking them to pay for a middle-class tax cut for 23 million people. 
   Let me repeat: The Republicans in the House, the Republicans in the Senate, and the Republican at the White House, they have all opposed that measure. That's why we're here today at this moment to get this done. 
   It has been their intransigence and their unyielding position on insisting that this money be borrowed when the minority has had its day in this House of Representatives. That's why we're here, and that ought to be eminently clear to the people that are watching today.

   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, I'm here in reluctant support of this legislation. In this process of governing, you oftentimes reach a difficult intersection. Sometimes you do not have the luxury of either supporting a bill you like or opposing a bill that you don't like. Sometimes you have to support a bill that you do not like simply because it has to be done. And that is the crossroads at which we find ourselves today. 
   We have sent to the Senate what was possibly the easiest of offsets: closing a loophole so that wealthy hedge fund managers cannot hide money in offshore accounts. But the Senate minority joined by the President and a group  here in the House of Representatives have rejected on theological grounds any provision that raises revenue. 
   Some 160,000 troops are in Iraq, 26,000 in Afghanistan, and at some point we're going to have to pay for these wars. We are borrowing $2 billion every 7 days to fund the war in Iraq, and that's a bill our children and grandchildren will have to pay. And yet, and yet, we cannot ask the hedge fund managers to stop hiding money in offshore accounts. That's what this debate is about and has been. They are hiding money, scheming to avoid taxes in offshore accounts. 
   I support this bill in front of us today. We need to protect 23 million working families from being hit by higher taxes via the alternative minimum tax. But without fiscal responsibility here, and we've abandoned it when it comes to the alternative minimum tax and closing down an offshore tax haven, we have little choice. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Blumenauer for yielding the time. And I want to acknowledge Chairman Rangel and JIM MCCRERY today for the manner in which they moved this legislation and how swiftly they addressed the issue that is looming across markets here in America and has had, in fact, an international impact. 
   In my home State of Massachusetts, foreclosures have risen by 66 percent over the last year. Recent studies have estimated that one in five subprime mortgages from the past 2 years will result in foreclosure. That means more than 1 million homeowners will lose their opportunity to hold on to the American Dream. But even more distressing will be the tax bill if the lender is kind enough to forgive part of this debt. 
   We want to do all that we can to keep them in their home and to work out some arrangement to help them keep paying, even if that means forgiving a part of the tax debt. But with the tax bill looming, many might even argue that that could be counterproductive. So that's why I'm enthusiastic about supporting the legislation that's on the floor today. 
   This bipartisan bill, and I emphasize, the most bipartisan bill in the last 7 years on the Ways and Means committee, this bipartisan bill would change the current tax law and provide that homeowners would not be taxed on the portion of forgiven debt if due to financial hardship or decline, and I emphasize decline, in the value of the home. 
   It simply makes good sense to do this. The bill has been endorsed by the Realtors Association, the homebuilders, the mortgage bankers, and most importantly, members of the American family. 
   This is a commonsense proposal. I hope we're all going to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank Chairman Rangel and Chairman Oberstar for their tireless efforts in trying to seek a long-term funding solution for our Nation's aviation programs. 
   Last year, I was honored to chair a hearing in the Select Revenue Measure Subcommittee where we heard from all sides on this issue, including the chairman and ranking member of the Transportation Committee and Aviation Subcommittee. Unfortunately, our colleagues on the other side of the Hill have not been able to secure an agreement, and that's really why we're here today to provide some additional time for negotiations. 
   H.R. 6327 extends the financing and spending authority for the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. The trust fund taxes and spending authority are scheduled to expire on June 30, 2008. H.R. 6327 extends these dates at current rates for 3 months through September 30, 2008. 
   Previous legislation extending these taxes were unanimously reported out of the Ways and Means Committee with bipartisan support. The substitute amendment makes one change from the bill as introduced. It deletes section 5 which would have transferred $8 billion to the Highway Trust Fund. This provision would prevent cuts in highway programs next year. CBO has informed us that it would have no budgetary impact. 
   While that provision enjoys significant bipartisan support, a number of Republican Members have indicated strong opposition. It is imperative that we enact the FAA provisions this month. To ensure that we have the necessary two-thirds support to pass this bill today, we decided to remove the highway language. This bill will keep the Airport and Airway Trust Fund taxes and operations in place until a long-term FAA reauthorization act is signed into law.     
   The bill also includes a number of authorizing provisions under the jurisdiction of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which worked with Ways and Means to develop the legislation. 
   The most important of these is the Airport Improvement Program, or AIP. This program funds grants for projects throughout the country. Many of our airports rely on this program to help finance critical modernization and expansion efforts. 
   The bill would extend the AIP for another 3 months. The other authorizing provisions are also 3-month extensions. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a temporary extension of an essential funding mechanism for our aviation programs, and I urge its adoption. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, one of the things I'm going to do today after listening to my friend, Mr. McCrery, is to go back to my office and call Citigroup, that holds my mortgage, and I'm going to apply that logic when I tell them that I'm no longer going to bother paying the principal, because I just want to forget about the bill; that the bill is just gone. And I expect them to say to me, we're going to use the logic that Congress uses when it comes to paying the Nation's bills. 
   I'm in full support of this legislation, and I think we need to stand up to theology today and address it with fact. Without the extension of these important tax provisions, there's going to be a real impact back home. Ninety-four thousand Massachusetts teachers who took the deduction for out-of-pocket classroom supplies totaling $23 million in expenditures, they're going to lose that deduction. 
   Without this bill, 121,000 Massachusetts families who took the tuition deduction for higher education costs, totaling $317 million in expenditures, they're going to lose their incentive for higher learning. 
   If we don't pass this bill, 1,000 businesses in Massachusetts that took the research and development tax credit totaling $10 million, they're going to lose this credit. 
   We have to pass that bill so that 192 low-income military families in Massachusetts who claimed the earned income tax credit while in the combat zone, totaling $2 million in earnings, are going to keep that credit. 
   And further, Massachusetts school districts which receive $6.5 million in bond authority for school construction, they're going to lose their assistance without this bill. 
   And let me speak briefly to the issue of AMT. For a decade and more, I've been at this issue. The Republicans have said to me time and again, you're absolutely right in what you're trying to do. We're quibbling over the solution today. But there's a reality, and the reality is that if we don't do this, 125,684 taxpayers subject to AMT in Massachusetts will increase to, listen to this number, 770,336 people for the 2007 tax year. This means in my district alone 7,000 families to 67,612 will begin to pay AMT if we don't undertake this action today. And half of those 60,000 paying AMT this year will earn between 100 and $200,000. And another third will earn between 75 and $100,000. 
   This legislation is middle-class tax relief. These are the people that need our help. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Engel for yielding. 
   Last Saturday in my hometown of Springfield, Massachusetts, I spent the day welcoming back 150 brave American soldiers from the 181st Engineer Battalion of the National Guard who just completed a year-long deployment in Iraq. Their mission was to provide security for their fellow servicemembers and to protect military facilities. This group included members who possessed the Bronze Star, the Combat Action Badge, and the Purple Heart. Every Member of this House and Senate has participated in ceremonies similar to this across the country. We might have our differences about the war, but we find common ground in our steadfast support for these soldiers both in Iraq, on their way to Iraq, and around the world. And that is one of the reasons I intend to vote in favor of this bipartisan resolution today. 
   There is a reason that the framers of our constitutional system chose in Article I to establish that Congress is the first branch of the government, to oversee the Executive. One of the reasons that we are here today is because the majority at the time never asked a question of the Administration. Everything the Administration said, the Republican majority at that time in Congress went along with. 
   I am mindful of the thousands of soldiers who have died, more than 3,200. I am mindful of the 21,000 today who have been wounded. I am mindful of those who continue to serve our country bravely and honorably, and that the burden of this war has fallen on these troops and their families. There has been very little sacrifice asked of the American people. 
   But those who have sacrificed deserve a frank and honest debate about President Bush's policy. This is the debate we should have had 4 years ago. 
   You cannot edit history. We know today there were no weapons of mass destruction. There was no enriched uranium from Niger. There was no connection to al Qaeda. We were not welcomed as liberators in war. And 3 1/2 years later, the mission has not been accomplished. 
   Madam Speaker, like the vast majority of the American people, I agree that the war in Iraq is going badly and getting worse. I attach great significance to the National Intelligence Estimate. The overall security situation in Iraq has deteriorated, as they have said, with 2006 being one of the deadliest years to date. The war has increased Islamic radicalism around the world and has helped to destabilize the entire Middle East. By any objective standard, Iraq has descended into something worse than a civil war, as noted by the Iraq Study Group, and our American troops are caught in the middle. And let us call it for what it is: a civil war. 
   Yet President Bush, nearly 3 years after declaring an end to major combat operations in Iraq, is sending another 20,000 American troops into battle. And Vice President Cheney, in the face of insurmountable evidence, continues to declare that Iraq is a success. 
   As we debate this resolution today, it is clear that support for the war is at a tipping point. Our intelligence community, speaking collectively in the recent NIE, they believe that the future of Iraq is grim. And, most significantly, our distinguished military commanders believe it is time for a new direction. General Powell, General Zinni, General Batiste, General Gregory Newbold, and others have all expressed concern about the future of Iraq. These are individuals who were involved in the planning and execution of the war; and, obviously, they do not like what they see.  
   Even former director of the National Security Agency under President Reagan, retired Lieutenant General William Odom, acknowledged on Sunday that ``the President's policy in Iraq is based on illusions, not realities.'' 
   I do not believe that public opinion alone should shape public policy, but no one should underestimate the intelligence of the American people. They are convinced that ``stay the course,'' as President Bush has suggested, has not succeeded. 
   Every Member of Congress wants our soldiers to succeed in Iraq. No elected representative in this institution would ever seek to undermine our servicemen and women. But the facts are clear. The war in Iraq is the most important issue facing America today, and our constituents are entitled to know where their representatives stand on the way forward. That is why this debate, finally, is so important. Just as the debate in 2002 led us into the war with Iraq, perhaps this conversation with the American people that we are having today will begin the process of bringing our troops back home. 
   More than 4 years ago, I came to the floor of the House with deep reservations about granting President Bush unlimited powers to authorize this invasion of a sovereign country. It is the best vote of opposition that I have offered in my 19 years in this House of Representatives

   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself so much time as I might consume.  
   Mr. Speaker, Finance Committee Chairman Frank and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rangel have asked the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation to make available to the public a technical explanation of this legislation. The technical explanation, JCX-63-08, expresses the committee's understanding and legislative intent behind this important legislation. It is available on the Joint Committee on Taxation Web site, at www.jct.gov. 
   Mr. Speaker, I stand today in support of H.R. 3221, the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008. 
   I want to begin by commending Mr. Rangel, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and Mr. Frank, the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, for their tireless efforts on behalf of this bill. It has certainly not been an easy task. 
   With bank failures and foreclosures continuing to headline the news, the pressure to respond has been most remarkable. I have seen it in my back yard. Massachusetts is the sixth in the Nation community for foreclosure activity. In Springfield, the heart of my district, 300 homes have been foreclosed this year, and over 2,000 mortgages will reset to higher interest rates through 2009. In response today, we have a tax title with broad bipartisan support. 
   The tax provisions in this bill are an appropriate mix of incentives for home purchasers, owners, renters, for builders, developers and lenders. Quite simply, they help the housing and real estate industry regain their footing; and they offer struggling home owners a lifeline. How critical that provision. 
   This bill offers hope that if we can get this industry up and moving again, and provide security for distressed home owners, maybe the economy will respond and get back on track as well. We all know how important the housing industry is, not only to American economic security, but to overall economic gain.     
   The provisions in the tax title include: 
   A $7,500 refundable tax credit for first-time home buyers which is available for purchases through next July. 
   An additional standard deduction for property taxes for those who do not itemize. I can't emphasize how important that provision is and how well received it will be. It will be a huge benefit, especially for seniors who have paid off their mortgages but still face property tax bills. 
   A temporary increase in the low-income housing tax credit, which provides affordable housing for working families in all 50 states. 
   A temporary increase in State-issued mortgage revenue bonds and a provision allowing the proceeds to be used to refinance certain subprime loans. 
   The tax title of this bill is fully paid for with three previously approved offsets. I want to just point something out. We have had significant Republican support in the past for these offsets, meaning simply that Republicans have supported the pay-for provisions that we've used. 
   First, the bill uses the Bush administration's credit card reporting proposal which obligates third-party financial institutions that process credit card payments to report to the IRS on annual credit card receipts to a business. 
   Second, the bill delays for 2 years the worldwide interest allocation rule. This tax benefit was enacted in 2004 but delayed until 2009. We simply push off for 2 years a benefit these companies haven't used yet to claim more foreign tax credits and lower their U.S. tax bill. 
   Finally, the bill limits the exclusion of gains on vacation homes. This provision will limit the exclusion of gains to the amount of time a vacation home was a principal residence over the total time owned after January 1, 2009. 
   Mr. Speaker, these tax provisions, along with the provisions brokered by Mr. Frank, are urgently needed. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   As is always the case with legislation that comes to this floor, there are parts of it that some of us don't care for. But he addressed the issue of urgency. The Secretary of the Treasury spoke to the issue of urgency. President Bush dropped his veto threat. And a reminder, the people that are responsible for the tax title portion of this legislation voted for it 35-5 in the Ways and Means Committee. 
   This is complex legislation. There is a virus that is moving through the housing market across America. The result is everywhere for us to see. 
   The softening of markets everywhere are directly related to what's happened in the housing market. We have a chance today to stem the tide of those effects. We should take advantage of it.

   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The provisions of H.R. 7005, the Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008, as scheduled for floor action today, provides alternative minimum tax relief. 
   Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rangel and the ranking member, Mr. McCrery, have asked the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation to make available to the public a technical explanation of the bill. The technical explanation expresses the committee's understanding and legislative intent behind this important legislation. It is available on the joint committee's Web site at www.jct.gov. 
   I want to thank Mr. Rangel for his diligent work on a flurry of last minute bills here. There is some urgency to the bill we are debating today. I also want to acknowledge, to his everlasting relief, that this is the last time Mr. Reynolds will have a chance to speak on the issue of the alternative minimum tax. 
   If we do not pass this legislation today, 25 million families will pay higher taxes this year. That is right, this tax relief is for this year. I might add to this conversation that one of the nice things about this bill, despite how tumultuous these days have been for Members of Congress and for the American citizens watching what has happened to their 401(k) plans, this legislation actually provides middle class tax relief. The current patch expired at the end of the last year, and it is urgent that we pass this relief now. 
   Of those 25 million families facing higher taxes, 84 percent of them earn less than $200,000. In my constituency alone, families paying alternative minimum tax will rise from 8,000 to 69,000 if we do not enact this patch, and only 500 of those unlucky 69,000 people earn more than half a million dollars annually. Clearly, the alternative minimum tax is not the millionaire's tax it was designed to be. 
   For the last decade I have sought to repeal or radically reform the AMT because of the unfairness it wreaks on our progressive tax system. The AMT patch we are considering today costs more than $60 billion, and a reminder to all, next year, $70 billion. But unlike the version we considered earlier this year, we should acknowledge, this one is not offset. Despite partisan efforts in outreach to the other side on the issue of fiscal responsibility, we have, unfortunately, been unable to find common ground. We have run up against the reality of the closing days of Congress, and this legislation simply must be accomplished. 
   Again, I want to congratulate Chairman Rangel on crafting a responsible bill and one which picks up on the good work of our colleagues, Mr. Van Hollen of Maryland and Mr. Johnson of Texas, on the issue of incentive stock options. For a decade, Mr. Johnson and I have tried to find relief for those taxpayers unfortunately caught with a massive AMT bill on phantom stock gains, and today's bill provides relief by abating penalties and interest on underpayments and by allowing quicker recovery of AMT credits. 
   The bill we are considering today is a true hold-harmless patch because it not only extends but increases the AMT exemption level. It also extends protection from AMT for taxpayers with personal, nonrefundable credits, such as education credits and the dependent care credits. Otherwise, taxpayers might lose these essential credits to AMT. 
   I urge adoption of this bill, Madam Speaker. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, I appreciate my friend, Mr. Dreier's, comments, about the alternative minimum tax and how we are going to proceed today, but, let me be blunt, over my objections for the last 8 years, what we talked about today is simply this for the American people that might be viewing this discussion, we are going to borrow the money. I object to it, but I have tried time and again to find concurrence on the other side with a common way forward and have been unsuccessful. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like to yield 2 minutes to the gentlelady from Nevada, a very valued member of the Ways and Means Committee, Ms. Berkley.

   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, I want to agree with some of what Mr. Reynolds said, but I also want to remind the American citizenry today, we have now borrowed hundreds of billions of dollars to fix the alternative minimum tax, only to discover that a temporary patch is hardly a fix. 
   Think of what we might have done had we adhered to some fiscal rectitude and actually paid for this legislation as opposed to borrowing the money. 
   The reality is, in a legislative body, that there are some days that you can't get the votes to do what you would like, and this is one of those days. 
   But be mindful as we proceed to the next session of the Congress that the request for fixing the alternative minimum tax, or patching the alternative minimum tax, you will be out $70 billion, the following year $80 billion, maybe more. Then when you calculate the interest that attends to the issue, we quickly find that we will be at $500 billion to have temporarily patched alternative minimum tax, when we have offered a remedy here to do away with it? 
   We can argue about percentage of GDP that results in taxation to administer the Federal Government. I have heard that argument. The difficulty with that argument is that it doesn't take into consideration the reality of what we might have done in the intervening time to address the issue. 
   We have put very thoughtful pieces of legislation to permanently repeal it, to put it behind us once and for all, alternative minimum tax, only to discover that we have had difficulty securing the necessary cooperation to get it done. So, I will be standing here next year, talking about alternative minimum tax, asking for a permanent repeal. I hope, in the atmosphere of tax reform, that we might accomplish that task. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York, a classmate of mine from 1988, my friend, Mr. Engel.

   Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, let me, as I close, acknowledge the work of Chairman Rangel. He has given me considerable latitude not only on this issue but on a range of other issues within the jurisdiction of the committee. We have come up with some pretty good pieces of legislation during the last couple of years. 
   What is striking about this debate is we find ourselves in the same predicament where we will once again convene next year to discuss it. Mr. Rangel's legislation that I helped to author actually repealed the alternative minimum tax and did it in a responsible manner. The fact that we are here today because we couldn't find enough numbers in the House to move forward on the proposal, I think, demonstrates the frustration that we all feel with what has now become a very onerous position for the Congress to entertain. 
   But I do want to thank my friend, TOM REYNOLDS. And he is my friend. We probably on tax policy disagree on where the sun rises and the sun sets, but it is an example of a friendship  that has been able to supersede any of those differences because after the debate of this House is over, socially he has been a good pal for a long time. And I have the impression that he is not going to miss debating alternative minimum tax when he is back in New York. His position has been steadfast in this arena on the issue of AMT, and we have really worked hand in glove with one minor difference: I think rather than borrow the money, I think we should pay for it. And at the same time, I must tell you, he has been a good and humorous friend along the way, and we will miss his presence in the House and on the Ways and Means Committee. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the resolution.
