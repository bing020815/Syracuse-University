   Mr. INSLEE. Of course we need a long-term energy plan that can wean ourselves off this addiction to oil. President Bush said we are addicted to oil, and he turns around and says let's just get more addicted to oil. 
   I don't understand why the Republicans then voted against our bill to call for new clean energy sources of electricity so we can electrify our car and not have to burn oil. I don't know why they voted against our tax package that would allow tax breaks for companies like the Sapphire Energy Company that's making biofuels out of algae. That's a long-term solution to this problem, but we have got to have a short-term solution too. 
   I will tell you this, listening to my Republican colleagues, if you run out of gas on a dusty rural road somewhere, you better hope it's not a Republican Congressman who pulls up and basically comes to your aid and says, I can't help you now, can't help you next week, can't help you next year. I'll be back around here in 10 years. Then maybe we'll do something about it. Because that is all they are suggesting, and that is a plan doomed for failure. We can't wait 10 years for solutions to this problem. We need solutions that will work. 
   Let me suggest that the evidence is very, very clear about doing very small releases from the SPR, and I was shocked to learn how successful this can be. I went to a bipartisan war game at the war college last week with some of my colleagues, and we war gamed out what would happen if there was an interruption of our oil supplies due to overseas disruption. 
   Let me tell you what I learned since then: Small releases from the SPR can have huge ramifications for the price of gasoline. Look what happened in 1990 during Desert Shield when the first President Bush allowed release. Here is what the Energy Department concluded: 
   ``The rapid decision to release crude oil from government-controlled stocks in the United States and other OECD countries helped calm the global oil market, and prices began to moderate. When the 1991 SPR drawdown was announced in connection with Operation Desert Storm, the price of oil immediately dropped $8 a barrel.'' 
   Now why does this small less than 10 percent change in SPR, how can it have these enormous ramifications? The answer has to do with human psychology. These markets are driven by  psychology, and that's why the three times we have been done this before, all the last three Presidents, including this President, has achieved reductions from 5 to 30 percent within 30 days in the price of oil. 
   Don't allow Americans to be told they have got to wait 10 years for relief. Let's act now in conjunction with the legislation we are going to pass eventually to tamp down speculation. Democrats have both a long-term and a short-term response. Pass this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, I appreciate some of my Republican colleagues' discussion of some alternative energy, but it hasn't been an ``all of the above'' voting history for them; it has been a ``none of the above'' voting history when it comes to the vast sources of energy. 
   We know America is a bold country, not a timid country. But an energy policy that revolves around exclusively offshore drilling is a timid policy. The large swaths of energy we need are not off the coast, they are in the sunshine falling on our land, the wind blowing in the Midwest, the geothermal below our feet, the wave and tidal power; these are the vast swaths of energy. 
   Yesterday, right around this building, I drove a plug-in electric hybrid car. That is the future, using electricity driven by the sun. And I wish my Republican colleagues would just take a look at the USA Today newspaper yesterday that talked about the enormous strides being made in solar energy. We need a bold policy that can truly get us out of this pickle. That's one based on energy sources, not the timidity of the Republican Party.

   Mr. INSLEE. Was this part of the secret Dick Cheney task force to come up with an opposition to have a little transparency in the speculation markets? Secrecy does its worst work in the dark, and that's what happened in the Cheney secret energy task force. And why should we allow these speculative markets to continue in the dark? 
   The people who support this are not a bunch of hemp smoking Communists. The Air Transport Association, the people whose industry is on the verge of disaster, realize we have to rein in this rampant speculation. These are capitalists, CEOs, accountants who know that we've got to get to the root of this speculation. 
   And I don't understand, when it comes to energy, my Republican colleagues are against virtually every solution. Speculation, they're against it. Opening the SPR, they're against it. Solar energy in our REC standard, they're against it. Wind in our tax bill, they're against it. Electrified cars in our CAFE, they're against it. They're the none-of-the-above caucus.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, every revolution has a start. May 25, 1961, John F. Kennedy, with full confidence in Americans' ability to innovate, said we are going to go to the Moon in 10 years. 
   Skip ahead a few years, December 6, 2007, the day we are starting a clean energy revolution to give America economic growth through technological progress, and that progress is happening all across America. In every State, that progress is going to take place, because this bill is going to help innovators. 
   Let's take a quick run-through where: In Michigan, where General Motors plans on building the plug-in hybrid that you can drive 40 miles with zero gasoline and get 100 miles per gallon with batteries designed in Massachusetts. 
   In Florida, California, Arizona, Mississippi, a whole host of States, where the Ausra Technology Company has designed a solar thermal process to make C02-free solar energy within 10 years to be competitive with coal-based electricity. For those who say we can't do energy everywhere, where the sun shines, solar thermal energy will work, including in my State, the State of Washington. 
   We move forward, virtually every State in the country has the potential for biofuels, and here is a picture of the Imperium Biofuels Company. It is located in a former dying timber town of Grays Harbor, Washington. It is the largest biodiesel plant in the world, something America can be proud about, that we will expand. 
   And lastly, emerging technologies, some of which people have not heard about. This is a picture of a wave power buoy on the coast of Oregon. We have enough energy in the Pacific coast in a 10-by-10 mile stretch to power all of the electrical needs of the State of California. And this doesn't even start to talk about gains from efficiency. 
   This bill will help Americans insulate their homes, make sure they are using fairly efficient lighting, and make sure that their furnaces and air conditioning are efficient. And a new report just out this week says that we can cut by 50 percent our growth. Pass this bill and start this clean energy revolution.

   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, slavery in this country did not end in the 1860s. It still exists because we all are still enslaved by oil. It is an addiction. George Bush himself said we are addicted to oil. But his answer is to increase the addiction, to go back to the dealer just for one more stick of the needle. That is not a long-term energy supply response to this crisis. 
   Americans need a choice of new energy supplies beyond oil, which is the only way to break this addiction, which is the only way to drive down price, which is the only way to have an alternative to oil. 
   I had in my office yesterday the Interdale Company, building one of the first lithium ion batteries, and the A123 Battery Company; they are going to provide the battery for the GM-VOLT. We have to provide freedom from this oil addiction by having a policy that gives Americans choice of new electric cars, new algae-based biofuels. That's a vision for choice and freedom in this country. That's what we should be doing. And we will be starting today.

   This legislation is especially important to my home State of Washington because it will cut in half the number of uninsured kids in Washington State. It does that by fixing a long-standing inequity that punished Washington and 10 other States because we provided coverage for kids just above the poverty line, and we fix that long-standing inequity tonight. 
   If you're a Member from the State of Washington, Wisconsin, New Mexico, Connecticut, Wisconsin, Rhode Island, Minnesota, Maryland, New Hampshire, Vermont and Tennessee, vote for this bill and you can go home telling your constituents we fixed this long-term unfairness. 
   I'd like to thank Chairman Dingell for including a 100 percent permanent fix in the House SCHIP bill that we passed in early August. I'm grateful that we retained that fix, and I hope we'll make sure that we do this on a permanent basis ultimately. 
   So we need to pass this bill tonight, extend coverage and fix that inequity.

   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased my friend, Mr. Boehner, made reference to the idea of ``promoting our resources,'' a quote from Daniel Webster. 
   What is the single resource that America has, the only resource that America has that can really bring down the price of fuel and break our addiction to Middle Eastern oil? There is one secret resource that we can promote. And that is the resource of intellectual capital, creativity, and innovation. We know that just poking more holes in the ground cannot solve this problem. We have got 25 percent of the world's oil. We have 3 percent of the oil in our land. 
   What can solve this problem is innovation, innovation like the A123 Battery Company in Boston that is going to allow us to drive electric cars, Phoenix Motorcars, Inc., that is going to have an electric car that will get 100 miles just on an electrical charge, the Sapphire Energy Company that has developed a gasoline from algae-based sources. We need to develop the resource of intellectual capital. 
   The optimists on this side of the aisle are doing that. The pessimists on this side of the aisle want to remain addicted to gasoline. That is a path that is doomed to failure. Let's be optimists and solve this problem.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, I support this rule, in part, because it allows Congress to finally rein in an out-of-control policy by the administration in Iraq. 
   For too long our Congress has stood by while an administration has pursued a course in Iraq fraught with peril, with no plan for its conclusion, with no plan for resolution, with no meaningful plan for international involvement, to end this problem in Iraq. While Congress has not reined in this administration, the American people have been raising a hue and cry for relief from this negligent lack of plan in Iraq. 
   I came across, a few weeks ago, some work that some citizens had done to provide an exit strategy from Iraq. This is a plan called A Responsible Plan to End the War in Iraq. It was organized by a group of citizens, a woman from Carnation, Washington, named Darcy Burner. It is endorsed by considerable military thinking, endorsed by Major General Paul Eaton, U.S. Army, retired, former Security Transition Commanding General in Iraq; Dr. Lawrence Korb, a former Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Reagan administration; Brigadier General John Johns, specialist in counterinsurgency and nation-building; Captain Larry Seaquist, U.S. Navy, retired, former commander of the USS Iowa and Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Policy Planning. 
   Here is a plan that has considerable parallels to the amendment we will be allowed to offer to finally having some responsible plan to end the war in Iraq. A meaningful timetable, a statement about permanent bases, meaningful requirements for not overburdening our military. It's time, simply, for Congress to act. This rule allows us to do so. We should pass it.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (FIVE REASONS WHY THE AIR FORCE'S DECISION TO AWARD AIRBUS A CONTRACT DOES NOT ADD UP -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, before I start, I want to express my honor for the gentleman from Colorado in the chair today, who did extraordinary work in leading the Congress to green building standards and the introduction of a bill today, and I appreciate his leadership on this. Thank you for leading on this issue. 
   I come to the floor today to address my concerns about this misbegotten decision by the U.S. Air Force to ignore great work by Americans with a consortium building the Boeing 767 aerial refueling tanker, in fact, sending American tax dollars and American jobs out to Europe. And I want to express the five reasons why this decision does not add up. 
   There is a particular odor about this decision. It needs to be revisited one way or another. We need to have an American tanker built by American workers to be fair to American service personnel and taxpayers both, and I want to go through the five reasons why this decision does not add up. 
   Reason number one: There is no sense on this green Earth why the American Government has sued the Airbus Corporation, asserting that they have violated international trade laws because they received illegal billion dollar subsidies, and at the same time another agency of the Federal Government, the Air Force, turns around and gives that same corporation that our own government has declared is acting illegally contrary to international and American law--turns around and gives them a $40 billion contract. It is most unfortunate that at least one person in the other Chamber specifically said that we can't take into consideration these subsidies. It is absolutely ludicrous for the American Government to sue this company in one court, saying they violated law, and then turn around and give them $40 billion. That's exactly what has happened here. It makes no sense. This does not add up. 
   Reason number two: Boeing has been building these tankers successfully, hundreds of tankers, without difficulty. And instead of going with a proven, tried and true American contractor, the Air Force has decided to accept the risk of a company that's never made an aerial tanker, building it in a way that it has never been built, in factories that do not exist, in multiple countries with a supply chain that has never been proven. We cannot and should not tolerate that risk of this risky decision. 
   Reason number three that this does not add up: It does not add up because all estimates have concluded that the Boeing 767 is 24 percent more fuel efficient overall, looking at all the emission statements, 24 percent more fuel efficient. Well, for anyone who has gone to the pump recently, let me suggest that it doesn't make sense to be buying a product that is a gas guzzler when we know that fuel prices are going only in one direction. A study performed by the Conklin & de Decker analyst company concluded that by going with Boeing instead of this Airbus monstrosity, we would save the American taxpayers $30 billion in fuel costs. At the same time when we're trying to wring efficiencies to deal with global warming and reduce fuel costs, this decision is buying the gas guzzler rather than the fuel-efficient aircraft. This does not add up. 
   Reason number four: The Air Force basically decided bigger is better. Bigger is not always better. They said they told Boeing and Airbus that they wanted a medium-size plane. Boeing provided them a medium-size plane. In the middle of this process, they decided they wanted a bigger airplane. Bigger is not always better, and I will tell you why. It's going to cost the American taxpayers over $2 billion to remodel all of these hangars all across America to try to fit this large airplane in. This is real money from real taxpayers that was not considered in the lifecycle costs. It does not add up. 
   And the fifth reason is lifecycle costs. The Air Force, what they did was they looked at original acquisition costs and downplayed the lifecycle costs associated with fuel costs, maintenance costs, hangar remodeling, and all the other things associated with these airplanes. When you make an acquisition for the American taxpayers, you need to look at the entire lifecycle costs, not just the upfront acquisition costs. It does not add up. 
   So here are five reasons that this Congress ought to get up on our hind legs and blow the whistle on this misbegotten decision. It doesn't add up. We need to change this decision.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (GLOBAL WARMING -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I have come to the floor this evening with Mr. Cleaver of Missouri, and perhaps others will join us, with a message of optimism in the face of a great challenge that our country faces. And we have faced many challenges, but one of the more pressing for ourselves and our grandchildren is the issue of global warming, this concern that our increased carbon dioxide and other gasses is going to result in significant climactic shifts. And the science, of course, has been very disturbing recently about this threat. 
   But we have come to talk about a message of optimism that our country ought to have in our ability to solve this problem. And it is a large problem. It is perhaps certainly more global than we have ever had outside of war. But we today want to talk about why we believe America is ready to face that challenge, why we believe America is capable of succeeding in beating global warming, and why we believe the effort to defeat global warming will ultimately benefit the United States economy by allowing us to lead the world in new clean energy technologies. 
   And I would like to, in preface to our comments today, just set the stage about what the challenge is and why we believe the solution is one that Americans are fully capable of obtaining. 
   First, the challenge. The challenge, of course, is that we have created a condition where we may double the concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere by about 2050, twice as high as carbon dioxide has ever been since before pre-industrial times. And, of course, all of the scientists in the  world agree that carbon dioxide is a global warming gas, and it does stand to reason that if you double the amount of this global warming gas, you could have problems in your climate. And, unfortunately, the evidence has become more and more disturbing. 
   Just last week, the Goddard Space Science Department at NASA came out with a new report authored by lead author James Hansen that said, ``If global emissions of carbon dioxide continue to rise at the rate of the past decade, this research shows that there will be disastrous effects, including the increasingly rapid sea level rise, increased frequency of droughts and floods, and increased stress on wildlife and plants due to rapidly shifting climate zones.'' 
   This is not a quote from some fellow living in a tepee. This is NASA. The agency that sent an American to the moon has been looking at what is happening right here at home on Earth and has concluded that, indeed, we have trouble; and what is very disturbing is that the most recent science has been more disturbing. 
   We were briefed by Dr. John Schellenhuller, who is the lead scientist in Europe on this subject, last week, who told us about the increasing melt in the Arctic that has increased in severity, about the melting tundra. The rate of the melt of the tundra is melting much more rapidly than was anticipated even a year ago; and, of course, that can release methane gas, which is even 16 times worse for global warming than even carbon dioxide. My local scientists at the University of Washington in Seattle have confirmed these findings. 
   So, basically, we have got an issue that we have got to deal with. And right now there really is a race going on in the world of tipping points. These scientists have told us that we are approaching tipping points where the climate can tip into regimes where we would have uncontrollable global warming and that that could happen in as short as shortly after the next decade. 
   But we have another tipping point which we believe we are about to cross over here in Congress, and that is a tipping point where the U.S. Congress will tip from sort of an approach of the ostrich, where we had our head in the sand, to tip over to the approach of the American eagle, where we will have a new vision about a new clean energy technological future for this country. 
   So we are here tonight to say that that new approach of optimism is one that will prevail starting next Wednesday when the Energy Subcommittee in the U.S. Congress will start discussions about a new clean energy future for this country. 
   I will be introducing a bill in about a week called the New Apollo Energy Act, which will come forth with a whole suite of ideas about how to adopt new clean energy solutions. And, of course, we call it the New Apollo Energy Act because we think what Kennedy believed about America, which was that we were the greatest innovation country in the world, is something that we have got going for us. So we should use our technological genius just like we did when we went to the moon. 
   So before I yield to Mr. Cleaver, I want to talk about why I have optimism about our ability to skin this cat, why I believe we can dramatically reduce our carbon dioxide emissions and dramatically tell our grandchildren that we are going to use our know-how to solve this problem. And the reason I am confident about this is that in the last year I have been doing a rather intensive review of the technology that we hope to bring to bear on this subject and I have been getting to know the Americans really across the country who tonight are inventing new technological solutions so we can move forward on clean energy. I just want to mention a few of them. 
   First, there is a company in Massachusetts called the A123 Battery Company. I love the number. A123 Battery Company. And they have developed a lithium ion battery which is so powerful that basically in the size of about two or three shoe boxes you could put it in your car, which they are prepared to do this fall, and turn your hybrid car into a plug-in hybrid car. And I drove one actually, a converted plug-in hybrid that I drove around the capital a few weeks ago. This battery is so powerful that you will be able to plug in your car, drive it for 20 to 40 miles just on electricity, no gasoline. Then after 40 miles you use gasoline and you will get over 150 miles a gallon on either your ethanol, eventually, once it is a flex-fuel, plug-in hybrid, or your gasoline. Now, that is a heck of a deal for Americans for your first 40 miles to have zero carbon dioxide coming out your tailpipe. A123 Battery Company. 
   The second company called Nanosolar. Nanosolar is a new company in California that has developed a photovoltaic cell, a solar cell, which uses nanotechnology to dramatically decrease the manufacturing costs and the costs of solar energy. And they are going to make a solar cell that is 1/50 as thick as the current silicone-based solar cells. It is called thin cell technology. 
   A third company, Ausra Company, a former Australian company that has been moved to the United States that has breakthrough technology on solar thermal where you use parabolic mirrors to concentrate the sun's rays to heat gas to 1,100 degrees and turn a turbine, again, dramatically potentially reducing the cost of solar energy. 
   So I wanted to first start our discussion with the context of great Americans doing great things in energy, and here are three companies moving forward. And to continue this discussion, I want to yield to Mr. Cleaver, who has been a great leader on these energy issues fresh in Congress. I would like to yield to him for his perspective on our ability to move forward in global warming and clean energy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. We are hopeful. I actually gave a speech in response to Prime Minister Tony Blair last week in Berlin. I was asked to present sort of an American response to the Prime Minister's ideas about global warming. One of the things he talked about is what the Europeans have learned is that we need some action, some policies to drive investment into these clean energy technologies that can produce the clean energy to avoid the kind of problems you are describing in Greenland. And of course the President is right now in Germany today at the G8 Summit. 
   We are hopeful, although probably not that optimistic, that the President would propound some ideas where we will guarantee our grandchildren that we are going to reduce our CO  
   2 emissions. Now, one way or another, Congress needs to do that, because we've got an obligation to American grandkids to do it. 
   I want to just note a couple of things. It's not just Greenland that is experiencing it. It's the good ole U.S. of A. 
   I got to know some people in Alaska in a little town called Shishmaref that sits on the Arctic Ocean. That is the first city in America that is having to be relocated due to global warming because they live right on the coastline, and the tundra that supports their houses is melting, and the seas are encroaching, and it has actually eaten some of their houses already. They are actually going to have to move their entire city. They've already voted to do it. They are going to move it 13 miles inland to a little place called Fish Camp. 
   It will be the first American city to have to relocate its first victim of global warming. That's a sad day when you think Americans already have to relocate their cities. So this is not something that's 50 years in the future. It's here today. 
   Now, we have experienced off the coast of Washington and Oregon the same issues you've talked about, about new species of fish coming in. And our ranchers down in the western United States are having unprecedented drought they are having to deal with. This is something Americans are suffering today. And that is why, starting next Wednesday, we hope to have an aggressive congressional response to help these clean air technologies move forward. So I appreciate your observations of Greenland. 
   I wonder if I could maybe yield to Mr. Udall, who has joined us here this evening, who has been a leader and certainly has a long tradition in his particular family in leading environmental issues.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. I really appreciate Mr. Udall talking about efficiency, because I think we need to look at it as the first fuel. Before you start generating excess energy, if we could figure out how to use it more efficiently and not waste it, that's what I look at as like finding money in the street, it's the first fuel. And Europe has had tremendous success. England has increased their gross domestic product by 70 percent in the last 20 years, but their use of electricity has remained flat. That is a tremendous improvement of efficiency. You don't waste it. 
   But it is not just the English. We have something to brag about here, too. California has increased their gross economic activity by 50 percent in the last 10 years, and their per capita use of electricity has remained flat. They have done it through measures such decoupling utilities with the rate of growth of electricity so utilities now can make money by selling less energy by selling efficiency. And it has been effective. 
   In my city of Seattle, in my neck of the woods, the same thing has happened by doing some of the commonsense things we have talked about. 
   There are some amazing technologies coming in in efficiency. I went and talked to an organization called SIPs, Structural Integrated Panels, last week. They had their national convention. These are panels that are sort of a foam core with a wood fiber sandwich on both sides that are a structural panel you can build a house with so you don't need studs. You build these things, and you can get 20 to 30 percent less heating cost for your home. This is an invention of folks in America, and we can build part of the construction industry by doing that. So I really appreciate your focus on efficiency. 
   I want you to know, you mentioned wind. I remember talking to, in the course of writing this book Mr. Udall referred to, I fell across a story out of Missouri, Mr. Cleaver's State. And there was a quote by this farmer that said something to the effect like, Man, there is nothing better than sitting there watching that turbine go around, and I just count the money every time the blade goes around. Because they get paid by the utility to put the turbine in the field. That's a good way to do it. 
   So I would like to yield to Mr. Cleaver for his observations.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. That is an important point. I think the good news we can share with Americans is that there are a lot less people in this Congress than there used to be who believe it is a hoax, and that is, in part, because they have read the science. People are seeing it with their own eyes. Now they are hearing from their constituents, frankly, and they are hearing from their own scientists. 
   I just want to read this NASA report that just came out last week, and it talked about the urgency. Mr. Cleaver, you said, we don't have a lot of time to deal with this; we don't have 50 years to deal with this. 
   This report said that basically there are two ways we can go. We can go the business as usual approach, or we can have a second approach, an alternative approach to reduce our CO  
   2. Basically this report said that with another decade of business as usual, it becomes impractical to achieve the alternative scenario because of the energy infrastructure that would be in place. This was a quote from Mr. Hansen of NASA, basically meaning we have about 10 years to change course here a little bit to have more essential efficiencies, to have more clean energy, to put our minds together to figure out how to have a cleaner energy future. So we don't have the luxury of a lot of time. 
   But again I want to come back to this idea of optimism, why I am optimistic about it. Mr. Cleaver mentioned Mr. Carnahan started a wind  turbine farm that is doing great. They are earning farmers a lot of money. They are earning construction crews a lot of money to build these things. They are generating revenues in Missouri. This is happening all over the country, that tremendous growth, 15, 20 percent growth a year in this wind turbine wind energy. 
   I want to tell one little story that I think is typical of what we are going to see in America. A fellow in Seattle, Washington, named John Plaza who is an airline pilot. He was a good airline pilot, but he sort of got tired of reading books while he was flying back and forth. That is what they do in the cockpits, a dirty little secret we can share. 
   He decided he wanted to do something entrepreneurial. He started looking around for an idea that he could advance to create a new, value-added business, and he started to think about energy. He started thinking, is there a way that I could sort of develop a clean energy resource and make some money as well? He started to focus on biodiesel. 
   So this fellow, who was not an engineer, not a chemical engineer, not a mechanical engineer, didn't have an MBA, he literally went home and started to tinker in his home about how to make biodiesel out of various vegetable products. He hit on a way to make biodiesel that he thought was as good or better than anybody else. 
   He went out and raised a few dollars, rented a little tiny room in an old warehouse and bought the old beer vats from the Rainier brewery in Seattle, Washington. The Rainier brewery used to be the iconic beer in Seattle, Washington. He bought the old vats they used to brew beer in and he started to brew up biodiesel. 
   John Plaza is now CEO or CFO of a company in Grace Harbor, Washington, that is going to be the largest biodiesel plant probably in the world, or at least in the Western Hemisphere. They are under construction. They are going to be open for business some time next year, over a million gallons a year. 
   This is a product that reduces carbon dioxide, uses products we make, either canola seed or perhaps palm oilseed or perhaps soybean oilseed they are starting to bring in. 
   But the point is, here is an American success story of a fellow with an idea who wanted to find a way to maximize clean energy. We just need a way in Congress to help drive investment to those new clean energy sources. 
   I want to mention one thing about how Congress can help people like John Plaza to develop these new businesses. 
   One of the things we can do is next Wednesday we will be hopefully passing what is called a low carbon fuel standard. A low carbon fuel standard will basically say that the fuels we burn in America every 5 years will get 3 percent cleaner when it comes to carbon dioxide. And when we pass that low carbon fuel standard, it will create an incentive for investment to go to these businesses to develop these new higher, cleaner forms of biofuels. 
   You know we are using corn ethanol right now, but it is really just sort of the first generation. I liken it to the Wright brothers Flyer of aviation. It is just the first craft we can get in the air. But we need cellulosic ethanol and advanced forms of biodiesel that will produce a lot more product per acre and a lot more CO  
   2 savings, and we believe we can do this. 
   So here is one thing Congress can do, and I know there are many others. 
   I yield to the gentleman from New Mexico.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. The gentleman is entirely correct. Later this year the House will consider what is called a cap-and-trade system. Americans are probably going to hear that term a lot. A cap-and-trade system basically means that we will set a cap, a limit, a total ceiling on the amount of carbon dioxide that will be a pollutant going into the air a year in the United States of America. That is not too much to ask for our grandkids to say we are going to have a total amount of pollution that we put into the air. 
   Now we have done it for sulfur dioxide. We have done it for nitrogen oxide. We have done it for particulates. But there is this giant loophole you can drive a Sherman tank through for carbon dioxide. 
   So it is interesting. We have all these laws that set ceilings for the amount of pollutants that go into the air, but the granddaddy of all, the most dangerous pollutant there is in the world right now, carbon dioxide, there is no limit whatsoever. So Congress owes to ourselves and our grandkids to set some limit, a cap, on the total amount of CO  
   2 that is going into the air. 
   So then the question comes down, how do you allocate who is going to put the pollution in the air? Well, there are a couple of ways to do it. Congress can just hand permits out and we decide. But there is a better way, which is basically a trading system where these permits originally are allocated, but then businesses are allowed to trade them amongst themselves and establish a market for carbon. 
   Europe has done this. I have spent a week looking at how that system worked last week, and I can report that it has been successful to the extent that it has established a cap and a price on carbon. And once you establish a price on carbon, well, what do businesses do? They start figuring out  ways to not waste energy and how not to put more pollution into the air. 
   Importantly, this cap-and-trade system is the most economically efficient way to distribute this resource. I got brainwashed by economics when I went to school at the University of Washington. Basically what we learned is that having a trading system, you end up having the most efficient way to find out how to drive economies and efficiencies in your system. 
   So later this year we will be considering a cap-and-trade system. We will set a limit, and it will be the first step in this road to really a clean energy economy. 
   Now I want to note something about a cap-and-trade system, and this is one thing I learned in Europe last week, it is not enough. It is only one tool in the toolbox. This is really important, because next week we will have before us in the Energy Committee a host of issues of ways to drive this clean energy future forward not waiting for this cap-and-trade system, issues like this renewable portfolio standard, where we tell people 15 percent of our electricity comes from clean standards, a green building standard, so that we require new building codes to have energy efficient buildings, a low carbon fuel standard so we use low carbon fuels, a whole host of measures like that. Those are very important. A cap-and-trade system is not enough. 
   In fact, it is interesting, in England, we met with a minister who basically they told us they might have had 15 million tons of savings in carbon dioxide from their cap-and-trade system, but they had 100 million tons savings in carbon dioxide by this combination of measures to have more efficiency in their industries. 
   So next week we will be taking some first steps in the road to a clean energy future that are very, very important, that are going to help these businesses grow.

   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Cleaver, I appreciate your comments, especially sharing the idea that I think all faiths share about this idea of responsibility to the creation and to our grandkids. I appreciate you bringing us back to that fundamental truth. 
   I want to address the issue of Greenland. Greenland is changing dramatically. I have had some people ask me isn't it true that Greenland has changed in the past as far as their weather and why is this a problem now. It is true during Erik the Red's time, Greenland did have more green involved in it. They had some agriculture in Greenland when you had this little warm period during the time of Erik the Red. 
   But what the scientists tell us is there is a huge difference between that situation because now we are going to drive carbon dioxide levels by 2050 twice what they have ever been for tens and hundreds of thousands of years and that those carbon dioxide layers trap energy and heat. It is going to make the days of Erik the Red look like the Ice Age. 
   So even though there have been wide fluctuations in the Earth's climate before, what the scientists tell us is the rate of change is unprecedented ever in the historical record and that we will go into a period that really is unprecedented as far as we know pretty much in global history. So the things you are seeing in Greenland are very much of concern, and I hope we are going to start working to move that forward. 
   I yield to the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Udall).

   Mr. INSLEE. I think you have put your finger right on the nub of the issue. The President says he now, finally, and I suppose this is a small ray of happiness, he now finally recognizes there is a problem of global warming. But he expects volunteerism to solve this problem. 
   Well, I can tell you one thing we all know, you can run a bake sale on volunteerism, and maybe you can run a boy scout troop on volunteerism, but you cannot run a war on global warming on volunteerism. Think about this for a second. Here is what the President proposes. He thinks that he can just send a letter, nicely handwritten, to the CEOs of the oil and gas companies, would you kindly think about not polluting anymore. 
   Well, that would be just about as effective, if he simply tries to run that on a volunteer basis, to just rely on the good graces, and I have nothing against the executives of these companies, they  are fine people, but just relying on them to volunteer would be just as effective as relying on consumers to volunteer whether you are going to pay at the pump when you pump gas. 
   Now you can just see the executives with their tin cup and their tithing cup out there trying to collect money from the pump. It doesn't work that way. You have to have some requirement that we both pay for gasoline and you have some measure to require these companies to reduce their pollution. That is a fair statement. It is required. It is the only way we are going to solve this problem. 
   Most importantly, it is the only way we are going to drive investment to companies like A123 Battery and Finavera Renewables which is going to have the first wave-powered buoy off the coast of Oregon in this next year to produce electricity from waves bobbing up and down. 
   So, Mr. Udall, you are correct. We have a responsibility in Congress to create these limits on CO  
   2 pollution. We are going to do that; and, when we do that, we are going to unleash the innovative power that Americans have. The same genius that got us to the moon is going to get us to a clean energy future, and our grandkids will not have to deal with global warming. 
   I would like to yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Baca) on an unrelated subject.

   Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, I want to share a little note of optimism we heard yesterday in our Global Warming and Energy Independence Committee. We had a group of venture capitalists and investors come before us, and they told us that they were supremely confident that America can create a clean-energy economy that is based on new types of technology so we can solve our global warming problem and wean ourselves off our addiction of Middle Eastern oil. It was very heartening. But they told us they need one thing to really open up the floodgates of technology. They need a cap-and-trade system to cap carbon dioxide and really spur investment. 
   The President yesterday gave short shrift to that. He was disappointing. We've got to provide leadership here to get this job done. His message was sort of a ``can't-do'' message for a ``can-do'' people, we Americans. Let's get this job done. Pass a cap-and-trade system. We will have a burst of new economic growth in this country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an important amendment that will help continue our work in Congress to break the cycle of domestic violence from which we still suffer. We started that work in the Violence Against Women Act of 2005. We now need to extend it. 
   I want to recognize the chairman's strong showing of support for efforts against violence in this fashion by $60 million of funding. We appreciate that. But we do have several new programs that the Congress has authorized, has approved, has recognized as a valid effort that have not had an appropriation to date. We aim to fix that with an effort to provide that appropriation. 
   It would direct the Department of Justice to administer grants to fund four priority new programs for children and Native women in order to break this chain, this multigenerational chain of violence. 
   The amendment offered by myself and Mr. Burton would, for the first time, provide Federal funding to local domestic violence programs that provide direct intervention services to children who have witnessed domestic violence in their families. We know how witnessing violence ends up perpetuating violence down the chain of generations. We have to nip this in the bud. 
   We have to get kids treatment early. We know this amendment will do it. Men who have experienced violence in their families as children are twice as likely to become perpetrators themselves.     
   This amendment will also, for the first time, fund a competitive grant program for nonprofit organizations to provide community services to teens and young adult victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking. We know girls and young women between age 16 and 24 have the highest rate of intimate partner violence. Teens need to learn at an early age about healthy relationships. This amendment will help that. 
   My amendment also ensures that we can track crimes against American Indian and Alaska Native women through a national tribal sex offender registry. This is a place where we have been lacking resources in the tribes. One out of every three American Indian and Alaska Native women are victims of sexual assault on reservations. 
   Currently, every State has a sexual offender registry, but crimes against native women are rarely entered. We need to pass this to fix that problem. 
   So we know that this epidemic of domestic violence affects every State and community. We know that these VAWA programs can help break the cycle, and we know that we've authorized these programs, but we have not appropriated a dime for them. We have done this with some other new programs in this bill. 
   We have carefully selected four programs. This has the wide support of groups across the country who have selected these four programs as the highest priorities of those programs that have been authorized but not appropriated. 
   The Chair's done a good job with limited resources, but we hope that we can extend this effort and these authorized programs to nip and end this circle of violence.

   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, many of the 70 million Americans who enjoy music over the Internet woke up and their music was silent today, and the reason, because of an outrageous decision by a Federal agency that caused outrageous increases of 300 to 1200 percent of the copyright fees that Internet Web broadcasters have to pay. And in protest of that outrageous decision, Web broadcasters today have joined together in a day of silence to let Americans know what's going to happen if Congress refuses to act to right this wrong. 
   And I call today on my colleagues who will be hearing and have heard from many of their constituents on this day of silence. I hope they will cosponsor H.R. 2060, the Internet Radio Equality Act. 
   The simple fact is, if we do not pass this bill, Web broadcasters are going to go out of business. Many of the 70 million Americans who enjoy music over the Internet will not get to listen to it.

   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, today we really do begin America's clean revolution in this bill. Every revolution has a beginning. The American Revolution began at Concord; the aerospace revolution began at Kittyhawk; and America's clean energy revolution begins today with this bill. And years from now when we have licked global warming and we have achieved energy independence, we will look back to this day as the first step on the road to clean energy for America. 
   Today we are going to break the shackles of oil and gas. We are going to free Americans to invent, to innovate, to create the clean technologies we need in energy. This is only common sense. 
   We pay once at the pump for gasoline already. We shouldn't have to pay again on tax day on April 15 to line the pockets of the oil and gas industry. It is common sense. 
   Our national resources should be going to the innovators who will lead us in energy in the 21st century, rather than to those who have kept us in serfdom to the oil industry, an industry of the 19th century. Change is afoot starting today. 
   Now we are going to unleash the talents of the Nanosolar Company in California. It is perfecting thin cell solar cells. We are going to empower the Ocean Power Technology Company that is perfecting wave energy, enough wave energy off the California coast to light the entire State. We will get loan guarantees to the Iogen Corporation, which is going to build the first cellulosic ethanol plant in the Western World in Idaho starting today. 
   Today we recognize that the solution to our energy challenges is not below our feet in the ground. It is above our shoulders in our brains, and we are going to unleash the intellectual talents of America to see that that happens. 
   I will be introducing again the New Apollo Energy Project bill, which will marshal our Nation's talents, just as John Kennedy marshaled our national resources in the original Apollo Project. Today is the first step of the new Apollo Energy Project. Tomorrow I will introduce the Plug-In Hybrid Bill, a bill that will hasten the day when our cars are powered on clean energy, clean electricity, and clean biofuels so we can get our energy from Midwestern farmers rather than Middle Eastern sheiks. 
   These are just two of the many steps on this long road of the clean energy revolution; and there is no silver bullet to our energy challenges, but there is a silver lining, and that is the genius of the American people. Today we are freeing the genius of the American people. It is long overdue.

   Mr. INSLEE. Regarding clean coal, we believe clean coal could be part of our energy future, and we need to do research in it to find a way to sequester carbon dioxide so that resource can be used. But in doing so, we can only do it if we have some limitation on carbon dioxide. The FutureGen project will never be built unless we have a limit on carbon dioxide. That is the only way it is going to be built. Democrats stand for research on that. It is part of this bill, it is part of clean energy.

   Mr. INSLEE. I rise in support of Mr. Grijalva's bill. I really applaud his leadership on this. It is long overdue. 
   This bill really takes care of the landscape conservation treasures that  we have come to enjoy. It protects 26 million acres of BLM's most exceptional landscapes. And to put it in perspective, that is a lot of territory, but it is only 10 percent of the BLM-managed areas. It is a very reasonable thing for us to do. And the reason is that it protects the heritage, the ancient Native American sites, pioneer ranches and pioneer homesteads. I am a fellow of the West. I enjoy looking at them. It preserves historic trails, rugged and remote mountains, deserts, prairies and rivers. These are the jewels in the crown of the BLM-managed property, and all Americans have a stake in them. 
   When you think about how expansive this is, there is something for everybody in America in this bill, those who like to raft, to hunt, to sightsee, to fish, to hike, to study, to bird-watch or to just hang around with their kids. This is an all-purpose bill. And it is a lot of places: Colorado's Canyons of the Ancients National Monument the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail, Idaho's Craters of the Moon National Monument, California's Headwaters Forest Preserve, Nevada's Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area, Montana's Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument, Utah's Beaver Dam Mountain Wilderness Area, Oregon's Lower Deschutes Wild and Scenic River, and my kind of favorite, the Pacific Crest and Continental Divide National Trail System, a trail system that is in trouble and this bill can help preserve. 
   So this really is a universal bill. And I want to point out something that is kind of uniquely American. These systems really rely on volunteers to keep them healthy. And I want to commend the thousands of volunteers who spend their weekends working on these trails providing interpretive services. Thank you to all of you who are doing this. This bill will help them to have a more organized system, and I think it is a real economically sound thing to do. 
   The Bush administration has indicated its support for this bill. It's straightforward codifying legislation. As a member of the Resources Committee, I want to applaud Mr. Grijalva and all of those Americans who are going to take their kids out to these places and have a grand time. Congratulations on passing this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (A NEW VISION FOR OUR ENERGY FUTURE -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor this evening to talk about a great vision for America's clean energy future, and it's very timely that America adopts a new vision for our energy future because we know Americans have some challenges when it comes to energy right now. 
   We're going to, tonight, talk about a vision for a way to revolutionize how we use and how we generate our energy that will solve some of the problems that Americans are experiencing tonight, and I think there shouldn't be any debate about what those challenges are. 
   We are paying well over $3 a gallon for gasoline, with no relief in sight. We've seen it go from, I don't know, $30 or $40 a barrel during the start of the Bush administration to now approaching $100, $95, $100 a barrel. Again, fossil fuel costs continue to go up. 
   We're engaged in a security threat from the Middle East where we are sending about a half a million dollars a minute to the Middle East to the place, to the terrorists who come to attack us, and sending money to the Middle East and have them turn around and attack us as the 22 generals who testified in front of our global warming committee told us is not a very prudent security policy. 
   We're engaged in a war in the Middle East, the place that there is security concerns because that's where a significant part of the oil is in the world. 
   So we know we have economic challenges because of rising gas prices. It's hitting us right in the pocketbook every time we go to the pump. We know we have security concerns because of our addiction to the Middle East, and now we know that global warming is an additional threat that we simply have to respond to. 
   Now that Americans have seen 1 million square miles of the Arctic melt, the size of six Californias simply disappeared, melted in the Arctic this year, together with the melting of the tundra, the changing weather patterns. We've certainly seen it with our rainstorms we had in my State. I represent the State of Washington. We had 10 inches of rain in 24 hours, an unprecedented event. This type of heavy precipitation events are consistent with global warming. We know we have a global warming threat that we've got to deal with. 
   So we know that we have some challenges when it comes to energy, and we know none of those challenges are going to get better unless we do something about it. This energy problem is not going to get solved by the tooth fairy or simply sort of pleasant wishes for the market to solve the problem. We know we have to act. We know we have to have a plan. We know we have to have a vision. And we know it has to rely on something that we're rich in in America. 
   And there's one thing I've got some good news tonight we'll talk about at length. We are rich in intellectual talent in America. We are the best innovators, best tinkerers, the best inventors humans have ever seen. And there was a fellow back in May 25, 1961, who really understood that. He came to this Chamber on May 25, 1961, John F. Kennedy, and John F. Kennedy came and stood right behind me in here and said that America was going to accept the challenge of putting a man on the Moon in 10 years and bringing him back safely. Now, that was a President who understood the innate capability of the American people to invent their way to solve any challenge we set our mind to. 
   And President Kennedy really, that was a gutsy thing to say again. He was ahead of the curve. He was ahead of the technology. That technology to get to the Moon was hardly even on the back of an envelope at that time. You know, at that moment, our missiles were blowing up on the launch pad. The Russians were way ahead of us in the space race. We'd only put Spam in a can up for 15 minutes. We hadn't even invented Tang yet. 
   We didn't know how we were going to get to the Moon, but John F. Kennedy knew that we could invent our way to solve this technological challenge and we did it. And we're here tonight to say that Americans have the same level of can-do spirit, the same level of optimism, the same level of technological prowess that we had in the 1960s, and that we can do for clean energy what John F. Kennedy did for space, which is to create a whole new clean energy revolution for the economy of America and grow our economy at the same time. 
   So I've introduced with some of my colleagues a bill called the New Apollo Energy Act. The New Apollo Energy Act basically uses the word ``Apollo'' because it's the inspiration for what we know we can do, which is to invent our way to a new clean energy future just like Kennedy in the original Apollo project did for the Moon project.     
   Well, I have some really good news. The House of Representatives last Thursday, with 235 votes, with some bipartisan support, essentially committed ourselves and accomplished five steps towards this clean energy future, and we are shortly going to take a fifth large leap for mankind in clean energy. So stealing a little bit of the language from the original Apollo 11 project, we now have had five small steps for energy independence and clean energy, and we are now starting to work on one giant leap for America's clean energy revolution. 
   And I wanted to talk tonight about those five steps that we have taken in the House, and the bill is now over the Senate, and one of the reasons we are here tonight is to encourage the Senate to follow the House's lead to the extent we can and move forward on these clean energy steps. And before I yield to my friend, RON KLEIN, who has been a great leader in the freshmen class on these issues, I want to start with just the first step that we took last Thursday. 
   Last Thursday the House of Representatives, in a history-making step forward, passed the first improvement in our fuel economy standards in 30 years. For 30 years Americans' efficiency standards have been frozen, locked in stone and haven't made 1-mile-per-gallon improvement since 1983. In fact, and this blows my mind, the cars we drive get less mileage today than they did in 1983. We have mapped the human genome. We have invented the Internet. But the cars we drive get less mileage. 
   Well, we're doing something about that. After 30 years of Congress being  captured by forces against and in opposition of progress, we have increased by 40 percent the mileage standards by the year 2022 from 25 miles a gallon to 35 miles a gallon. That is a square deal for Americans. It is common sense, and we have done it in a way that protects our domestic manufacturers so that they are not exposed to a flood of new imports from across the seas, and we do that by having what is called the two-fleet rule that has been preserved. 
   Now, the reason this makes sense and the reason it's going to work is a combination of a couple of factors. First, it is a fact that we have got the best geniuses in the world right here in America when it comes to designing cars, and I know because they are designing some cars that are going to blow this record out of the way. By 2022 we are going to have cars that are way beyond 35 miles a gallon. I want to talk about one of those cars. 
   One of them is the General Motors Volt. And I have here today a picture of the General Motors Volt, a car that General Motors hopes to have in production 5 years from now. This car exists. I saw it at the Anaheim Electric Car Association Convention last weekend in Anaheim, California. And this car is a miracle because it is what's called a plug-in hybrid car. This car uses new lithium-ion batteries designed by A123 Battery Company in Massachusetts. And this car you plug in. You go home at night and plug it into your garage outlet. You unplug it in the morning. You drive 40 miles with no gasoline at all, free of gasoline from the Mid East or anywhere else, for that matter; 40 miles, zero pollution for 1 to 2 cents a mile. Gasoline costs 9 to 12 cents a mile to run your car for 40 miles. After 40 miles if you want to drive 40 miles, and 40 percent of Americans' average trips are over 40 miles a day, then you use hybrid technology to use a combination of gasoline and someday cellulosic ethanol and electricity like the hybrids now run to run your normal 250-, 300-mile range. 
   Now, that is a tremendous deal for Americans who get low-priced fuel for 40 miles, zero CO  
   2. Similar cars that are on the road today get 100 miles a gallon of gasoline today using this combination of electricity. And when we use cellulosic ethanol, we'll get 500 miles a gallon of gasoline using a combination of electricity, a hybrid. Now, this technology is going to blow that CAFE standard away. And after talking to the scientists at this electric car convention, I am very convinced that this is going to happen, and GM has certainly put big money behind this. So I'm very excited about the first step, which is to improve automobile efficiency, to talk about that tonight. 
   With that I would like to yield to my friend RON KLEIN from Florida, who has been a leader in the freshmen class. Thank goodness this freshmen class has shown up. That's one of the reasons we are making these strides tonight.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Yes. And I want to dovetail the second step. We've got five steps we're going to talk about tonight. The second step is on the taxes to really level the playing field for new technologies. 
   I don't think our constituents are very happy about paying $3-plus for gasoline. They are less happy on top of that to then throw in some serious change, about $21 billion, with a ``b,'' of the money they send to Uncle Sam on April 15 that is now shelled out to the largest oil companies that are making more profits than any corporation in the history of this solar system. And there is nothing wrong with profits, but there is something wrong with taxing Americans to add to those profits to, frankly, a very mature industry. This is not like this is a new industry that we are helping to get going. They've been around since 1880 or 1890 from the fields of Pennsylvania. This is a very mature, very profitable industry. 
   So what we have done in this bill is reel back in the misbegotten largesse that has been shelled out to the oil and gas industry to the tune of $21 billion. And what we are using that for is to help Americans adopt new clean energy technology. And it's going to be taken away from about five major oil companies, and it is going to be given to 300 million Americans that can use tax breaks when they buy a fuel-efficient car like this plug-in 
   hybrid car or when they weatherize their house and put in more insulation or when they want to buy energy-efficient heating or cooling. 
   This is like taking from the few, if you will, who never deserved it and giving to the many who need this help  now to adopt their old infrastructure, houses, cars, businesses, to the new clean energy. And it is going to do something for our business community too, and I want to talk about that. And this is Florida-specific. Mr. Klein represents Florida. I want to talk about a technology that is a kind of technology that we should be assisting. 
   This is a picture of technology called solar thermal technology. This is designed by the Ausra Company, A-u-s-r-a. The Ausra Company has developed a way to concentrate the Sun's radiant energy on a pipe. You can't see this very well, but this is a pipe of water that is essentially heated up by the reflected Sun rays. And they have discovered a way to make these mirrors very inexpensively and then heat this water and develop steam and drive a steam turbine and generate electricity. This company just signed a contract for 300 megawatts for a utility in Florida, enough for somewhere between 250,000 and 300,000 homes that they are going to produce electricity for with zero carbon dioxide, zero greenhouse gas emissions in Florida, 177 megawatts in California. And they believe that, within about a decade, once you make enough mirrors so you bring down the cost per unit of mirror, they will be able to compete with coal-based electricity. 
   Now, what makes sense, and what we have done, with a few Republicans' help, and it's not many but a few, we have reeled back in that $21 billion from the oil and gas companies and we have redirected some of that assistance to a company like the Ausra Company so they can develop this new technology. Now, that is a proactive action, and I am very happy to report that second small step. 
   Now, the gentleman wanted to talk about a specific technology. I would like to yield to him to talk about that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Well, I hope that that occurs. 
   And I'm really excited about power off our coastline as well. We have a little coastline off the Pacific coast which actually has the potential to generate power from waves. Mr. Klein talked about power from currents, where you can have turbines that turn, like a windmill or rotary moving mechanisms, but we also have huge power from waves that simply go up and down that are generated by the wind. And off our coast right now, we have some buoys going into the water, and as they bob up and down, they compress water, and that generates compression that turns the turbine that generates electricity. And this is a technology that is in its infancy, but there is enormous power in our wave power. In a 10x10 mile stretch off the Pacific coast, there is enough electricity for all the electrical needs of California, for instance. So, here's another technology. 
   I want to compare this technology to wind power. I've got a picture here of the largest wind farm in the western hemisphere, it's in southeastern Washington, in my State. These are, I think, almost three-quarters to one megawatt. That's enough for 1,000 homes, each one of these turbines. They are somewhere between 250 and 300 feet high. And what that power represents now is absolutely clean power, which today is the least expensive power that we can buy in the Pacific Northwest. If you want to get the cheapest power you can buy right now, this is the cheapest power essentially that you can buy, cheaper compared to even coal fire, or as cheap as a coal fire plant. That's why there is huge demand for these turbines. Actually, the pricing has gone up because there is so much demand for them, people want to buy them. 
   The reason I mention wind in conjunction with wave power and tidal power is a lot of people think that wave power and tidal power is sort of where the wind industry was about 20 to 25 years ago, in its infancy. When this started, people laughed at it. They thought it was like a big tinker toy with a bunch of folks living in a teepee that were dreaming up. And for a long time it was ahead of its time. Now it is commercially viable, it is supporting thousands of jobs. The Speaker's State of Pennsylvania has a company called Gamesa that is manufacturing these turbines. In Iowa, the Clipper Turbine Company is manufacturing. We want to make these and put them out to the world. 
   That's why the third step, we've talked about the first two, the auto efficiency standards, the tax fairness provisions, and now the third step we've taken is what we call the renewable electricity standard, which requires 15 percent of our electricity to come from a combination of renewable energy, clean energy sources, wind, solar, wave, enhanced geothermal, and efficiency. And we believe if we simply create those demands for these technologies, if you demand it, they will come. And these technologies will take off once we have these demands. 
   So, this is an important part of the package. Some of our colleagues across  the Chamber and in the Senate are balking at this. If we don't get this through now, we will next time. We will make some adjustments to it and get it through, because once people find out about these technologies, they're ready to rock and roll. 
   I yield to Mr. Klein.

   Mr. INSLEE. And what we have found, the genius of this, like you said, once the demand is created for these renewable energy prices, there is a very, very tried and tested rule that kicks in, which is, they become cheaper over time. And people say, well, gee, some of these things cost more than coal right now or oil and gas. Well, that's true right now, but look at what the experience has been over the last two decades. These are graphs from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory of the renewable energy cost trends over the last 25, 27 years, and there is remarkable consistency. 
   Wind energy started out in 1980 about 30 cents, 32 cents a kilowatt hour. It came down dramatically, until 
   now it's down to in the range of 6 to 8 cents in this graph, that actually might be a little optimistic, in the year 2000. Look at this enormous reduction over the last 20 years because of improvements in technology, and the fact that once you have scales of economy, you manufacture more of these, they cost less. 
   Same thing with solar thermal technology, that type of technology I showed earlier with the mirrors, heating up the water, started out at 60 cents a kilowatt hour in 1990, gone down to about 8 cents a kilowatt hour now in the year 2000. Again, these are, frankly, a little optimistic. These charts are a little less than the numbers I've heard quoted, but you get the general trend that it's incredibly down. 
   Photovoltaic solar energy, that's the kind most of us are familiar with, which you have a silicone panel, and it just takes the sun's energy and spins off an electron and creates an electrical current, started at 100 cents a kilowatt hour, now it's down to 22, 24 cents a kilowatt hour. 
   And what we find in these charts, in almost all these technologies there is almost this kind of law, I don't know if it's got a name yet, when you increase by a factor of 10 the number of units of these renewable sources, the price comes down 20 cents. Now, what does that tell us? We know two things for sure; the cost of fossil fuels is going up, and it isn't coming down. China is coming on like gang busters. They're demanding. They want to start buying the oil for their cars, too. And as their economy grows, that demand is going up. And we know we're not producing, we're not keeping up with the pace of demand for the increase in our oil production, so fossil fuel is going up over time. 
   We know these renewable sources are coming down over time, including geothermal, which is coming down dramatically again, from 1 dollar in 1980 down to about 26, 28 cents now. So, we know these are coming down. These lines are going to cross. And if we're going to hitch our economic star to some technology, let's hitch our star to the technologies that are getting cheaper, not the ones that are getting more expensive over time. And that's what this bill has done. 
   I yield to Mr. Klein.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (A NEW VISION FOR OUR ENERGY FUTURE -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. I would now like to turn to the fourth small step that we've taken, and the fourth step that we've taken is to embrace what we call the first fuel of clean energy. And the first fuel of clean energy is not wasting it. What we have found, and I've done a lot of research in this field, almost always the cheapest energy and the most effective energy you can get is the energy you don't waste. The efficient use of energy is the first place we've got to look. 
   Our bill in many ways demanded more efficiency for Americans. It demands that our lighting industry produce lighting that is 40 to 60 percent more energy efficient. It demands that our air conditioning units become much more efficient, that our buildings become much more efficient. There is a provision in there that we want to create model building codes, that when we build our buildings they won't waste as much energy as they do. 
   Many people believe that probably 30 to 40 percent of the road we have to travel we will get there simply by not wasting energy. And I want to go to exhibits A and B on that, show you a picture of a couple of folks in Redmond, Washington, Mike and Meg Town. They're standing in their doorway here. Mike is a science teacher at Redmond High School. It's a rainy environment out northeast of Seattle. And a few years ago when he was teaching his kids about clean energy, one of his kids said, Hey, Mr. Town, if you think this is so hot, why don't you build a house like this? And he said, I think I'll do just that. 
   So he basically set out to build a zero electrical net usage home by using efficiency, conservation, and a little bit of photovoltaic, and he did it. And here is a picture of his home. It didn't cost much of anything more than a normal home of this site. I think you'll agree it's a nice-looking place. It's in a rainy environment, but he managed to make it zero net electrical usage by doing some commonsense things. He used a little additional insulation. He used energy-efficient windows. He designed a home that uses a little bit of what's  called passive solar heating, so the solar rays, when we get them in Seattle, which is twice a year, I think, on August 12th and 13th, heats the inside of the home. And he did some photovoltaic array. He put on himself these darker panels up here on the roof that he actually put on. 
   And now Mike says one of the great joys is, first off, he uses about half as much energy as a normal home. And when he does use it, he's producing it largely with his PV system. And when he's generating more than he uses, his meter runs backwards. And he says there is nothing more fun than going out and watching your meter run backwards as you're feeding electricity back into the grid. 
   So, Meg and Mike Town are sort of walking examples of what our bill is going to do, which is to help Americans weatherize their homes, make sure their businesses are using energy-efficient appliances, and when we do that, we're going to use this first fuel. That's kind of a commonsense thing to do. 
   So, I want to move to the fifth step now. And the fifth step that we took is we adopted what's called a renewable fuel standard. In a renewable fuel standard, we guaranteed that we will have 32 billion gallons of biofuels that will be homegrown in the United States in the next 20 years. And the reason we said that is we think it makes more sense to get our energy from middle western farmers rather than Middle Eastern sheiks. And it doesn't make a lot of sense to take our subsidized agricultural products, export them, take the money from the international buyers, and then just ship it to Saudi Arabia. It's just kind of a shell game with money. Let's cut out the middle man and grow our own. 
   For those who doubt we can do that, I want to refer them to a little company in Grays Harbor, Washington, and I like to tell a little story about this company.     
   This is a picture of the Imperium Biofuels biodiesel plant in Grays Harbor, Washington. It is on the coast of Washington State. Imperium Biofuels is the largest biodiesel plant in the world, and it is in Washington State. It produces 100 million gallons of biodiesel, principally using canola oil, some additional oils that they are using, soybean and a couple of others. This company started from a guy in Seattle, Washington, who was a pilot, who got tired of flying airplanes, he got bored of flying airplanes and decided he would start an energy company. He started brewing up biodiesel in his garage. And the part of this story I like is he went to the Rainier Brewing Company and he got two old brewing vats from the Rainier Brewing Company, and he started brewing up biodiesel. What a great can-do story. He went out and raised some capital and now built the largest biodiesel plant in the world, and plans on building 10 or 20 more of these. 
   Now, with the capacity of biodiesel and with advanced forms of ethanol, and I am talking about advanced forms of ethanol, we have the capacity to provide 25 to 30 percent of all our transportation fuels from homegrown United States crops without jeopardizing our food chain, without jeopardizing the production of our domestic food supplies. And the reason for this is, and if you talk to John Plaza he will tell you about this, we have the capability of using whole new types of biofuels. We know we use corn ethanol now. But we only use the seed of the corn. We only use the kernel. We are now going to have cellulosic ethanol which uses the whole plant, all of the carbohydrates, from the stalk, the stem, what they call the corn stover, from wheat chaff that is now left on the ground. There is a company called Iogen in Idaho that is planning to bale it up and make that into cellulosic ethanol. When we do this, we will be able to produce a significant part of our transportation fuel. 
   So this is our fifth step. It is common sense. It is home grown. And for those who have heard a lot of controversy about corn ethanol, I have been talking to the scientists on this. You will be blown away by what is coming. There are crops now in development, one called miscanthus by a company called Mendel Biotechnology in Hayward, California. It is a crop they have developed that is four to five times more productive than corn per acre of ethanol. Now when farmers can start selling four to five times more ethanol per acre than they are today, we will decrease the pressure on our land. This crop uses less fertilizer and less water than corn today. So we look at corn ethanol as sort of the DC-3 of biofuels. It is a start. We are going to move forward to the Boeing 787, which is cellulosic ethanol.

   Mr. INSLEE. What is neat about this is a lot of these things are happening in areas that have previously been quite depressed. This is an area that has really been hurt when the timber industry has had some tough times. And now we have got this, and there are two other very green industries that have developed in Grays Harbor, Washington. 
   You look around the Midwest where the ethanol plants have gone up, these communities have really revitalized. A lot of them have been using co-ops. This is not all money from Wall Street. These are co-ops where people have banded together and built their own industry. It is a very unifying experience when these communities do this. 
   We see this happening in the inner city where we are developing green collar jobs, where we are improving the efficiency of older buildings. When you have a green collar job to rebuild a building to make it energy efficient, that job doesn't get shipped to China.  It is right here. It is a local green collar job. That is why we are excited about that. 
   We talked about the five steps we took last Thursday: number one, auto efficiency, which we are calling for; number two, commonsense tax fairness to move some of these things away from oil and gas to these new businesses and consumers to help them; number three, the renewable energy standards so we can have clean energy electricity; number four, the efficiency standards that Mike and Meg Town used to such effect to allow your home to be efficient; and, number five, the renewable fuels standard where we are calling for advanced fuels. 
   And by the way, our renewable fuels standard 
   requires these advanced biofuels. It requires about two-thirds of this to be from these advanced forms, not just corn ethanol, but advanced forms of ethanol in the future. So those are five significant steps. 
   Just to note how significant they are, there has been an independent group that evaluates energy policy that has evaluated a very similar plan to this and concluded that when this plan is implemented, it will save more carbon dioxide from going into the atmosphere, the principal global warming gas, than all of our cars and trucks are putting into the atmosphere today. This is a big, big deal. We know we have to reduce our carbon dioxide by probably 80 percent by the year 2050 to prevent carbon dioxide from going over twice preindustrial levels. This is about maybe 35 or more percent of the way we need to go. So it is a very significant first five steps on that path. 
   For those who are interested in this subject, I want to congratulate Vice President Al Gore for winning the Nobel Peace Prize. I read his acceptance speech, which anyone who is interested in the subject I would recommend it to them. It is available on some Web site somewhere. It is a brilliant statement of the planetary emergency we now have, and I would encourage people to take a look at it because it will give you a sense of urgency that we have.

   Mr. INSLEE. Well, this is why this is something that can unify us, because it is an economic growth plan, it is something that can unify us, red State, blue State, urban, rural, all of us can get behind economic development. And we have seen instances of that tonight when we have talked about that. I think the bill that we have promoted ought to be able to promote that economic development in rural and urban areas, red and blue States. I really think it is a unifying message. 
   We mentioned these five steps, but there is a giant leap for mankind that will be on our plate when we return in January, that is, we have to find a way to limit the amount of carbon dioxide that is going into the atmosphere. And the ultimate way to do that is what we call a cap-and-trade system, which we hope to embrace and pass in this House next year. 
   A cap-and-trade system does two things. First, it caps the amount of total carbon that goes into the atmosphere, the total amount of pollution, the total amounts of carbon dioxide and methane that contribute to global climate change. And we have done this in a variety of pollutants, particularly sulfur dioxide, which we have a cap on. Previous Congresses have put a cap on sulfur dioxide. But we have a giant loophole in that there is no cap today for carbon dioxide and some of these other global warming gases. 
   So next year, we will be working on a plan to cap the total amount of these global warming gases that go into the atmosphere and give the Americans the confidence and the security to know that their grandkids aren't going to be exposed to runaway climate change associated with global warming. And then we are going to insist that polluting industries that put that pollution in the air have to pay for that. They can't do it for free any more. 
   Essentially, they have been using the atmosphere like a private garbage dump, like they back their truck full of junk and dump it into your county park. We don't let them do that, dump their junk in our county park, and we are not going to let them dump their CO  
   2 in the atmosphere any more with zero cost. 
   So there will be a charge associated with that and that will be tradable amongst industries to make it efficient. So when we adopt this cap-and-trade system, we will truly have the ultimate incentive for the geniuses of America to create these technologies, and we will be looking for people's input on this. We hope to have a bipartisan bill to do this, because there is no Republican or Democrat, or shouldn't be in this debate. We want to have something that all our kids can have a future on and we hope to do that. So, Mr. Klein, I wonder if you have any final comments.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, we are starting a clean energy revolution today. It is not the end of that revolution, it is not perhaps even the beginning of the end of that clean energy revolution, but it is the end of the beginning for two important points. 
   First, we are starting a revolution in transportation today in the United States, and exhibit A in that regard is the GM Volt. The GM Volt, which GM hopes to have in mass production, is a plug-in hybrid car. You plug it in at night, you drive it for 40 miles just on electricity, zero gasoline, and after 40 miles you use a hybrid train with gasoline and someday cellulosic ethanol for the remaining part of your range. 
   Our corporate average fuel economy standards, which we make the first  strides in in three decades, will enhance the opportunity for Americans to have not just a few miles here or there per gallon, but a revolution in transportation. 
   This car will get over 100 miles per gallon of gasoline. This car will operate all on electricity for the first 40 miles. It is this revolutionary attitude that we need to have in America, and we make the first steps, and the first shots in that revolution are fired today. 
   But it is not the end of that revolution, because we have much more to do. We did not succeed this week in advancing renewable energy to have 15 percent of renewables. We did not succeed this week to advance tax relief for those emerging new businesses. 
   But exhibit A, on the renewable energy front, is a picture of the solar thermal array produced by the Austra Energy Company. This company this last month signed enough contracts for 500,000 homes to be heated by solar thermal energy which, within the decade, will be price competitive with coal-based energy if we succeed in our next steps in this clean energy revolution. That is why we will be back next year to have the true clean energy revolution America deserves.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (FEDERAL OCEAN ACIDIFICATION RESEARCH AND MONITORING ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, ocean acidification is both the most disturbing and potentially the most unifying issue involving carbon dioxide and climate change. It is the most disturbing because nothing that I have heard in the last couple of years about this phenomenon disproves the point of that old saying from the 1960s that was in an old commercial ``It's not nice to fool with Mother Nature.'' And we have found that when we put one-third of all the carbon dioxide coming out of our tailpipes and our coal plants, that that has made the oceans, just since the industrial revolution, 30 percent more acidic, and all the time the world has been around, it is 30 percent more acidic just during the time we've been burning coal and oil. 
   The results of that are not hypothetical. We had testimony in Seattle from biologists and oceanographers a couple months ago that said they actually put a shell into water that was as acidic as it could be in the next century and a half and you could see it literally melt. You are looking at literally melting of any living stuff in the oceans that form a calcium carbonate material, including the phytoplankton that is 40 percent of the bottom of the food chain, in the next century or two if we don't change course. That's why it's disturbing. 
   But here is why it's unifying: It's unifying because while we have had some debates about the climatic effects about global warming and CO  
   2, there is no debate about ocean acidification. We could spent the next century arguing about the precise climatic effects of CO 
   2, but there is no debate that we are making the oceans unfit for life that God himself or herself designed on the planet Earth. And that is what we are doing. And I am hopeful that that can be a unifying idea in this Congress so that we can start to develop a clean energy future for the country and the world that can preserve the oceans for living species that we depend on as well as the rest of the world. 
   So it is disturbing now. Hopefully, it will be unifying when we get together and really do an Apollo new energy project and save the oceans for what they were designed for, which is life on this planet.

They hope to bring out an all-electric car that will go 120 miles on one charge. You can charge your car for $3 and not use a drop of gasoline. 
   Now they could use a little assistance from Uncle Sam to bring these products to market as quickly as possible, and we on this side of the aisle proposed some bills to do that because we wanted to take the 21 billions of dollars that this side of the aisle wants to give to the oil and gas companies in tax breaks and give those tax breaks to consumers and companies so that we can get all-electric cars, so we can break our addiction to Middle Eastern oil. That is a solution. You want solutions? You can't handle solutions. We gave you a solution: Let's get electric cars on the road. We have a bill to do that. And if we can get some help there from the other side of the aisle, then the President will make this happen. 
   I will give you another company, the Astro Solar Energy Company. They can produce electricity just by solar thermal power. We wanted to give them some help to do that, this side of the aisle blocked it because they wanted to help some friends in the oil and gas industry. 
   So those are the long-term solutions. But I wanted to mention a short-term solution. Tell me why on this green earth we do not have the oil and gas industry futures market protected and governed by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission? We want them to put them under the regulation of that, have transparency. We regulate the orange, wheat, and soybean futures market; this market ought to be regulated as well. This side of the aisle stands to do that; 36 Democrats are on the bill to do that, Mr. Stupak's bill. We have only got two Republicans. We welcome Republicans to get in the solutions business.

   As the chairman well knows, U.S. wave and current energy resource potential that could be credibly harnessed is about 400 TerraWatt hours per year. That's about 10 percent of our total national energy demand. Just like the wind, coal, gas, oil, geothermal, conventional hydropower, and nuclear power industries have been nurtured through Federal research and development and other industry incentives, this new renewable energy source needs support from our government to get started.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. This is a misguided amendment. It is quite a surprise that of all of the decent efforts to help communities across the country, for some reason the gentleman picked this one. That is something beyond at least my understanding. The particular project involved here is a community center that is involved in a whole host of youth projects, including the Edmonds Boys and Girls Club, the Sno-King County Youth Club, the Triple Threat Basketball Club, the Brighton School, the Cascade Symphony Orchestra, the Edmonds High School Multi-Class Reunion, the Olympic Ballet Theater, the Sno-King Community Chorale, and Edmonds Community College. 
   I don't know why those seem like such un-American activities to the gentleman, but to our community and to the country at large, those are integral parts of our communities. I may note this is not a situation where somehow there has been some sort of Federal largesse, that is an intrusion into the community. 
   This is an effort where we have multiple parties that have been associated with funding this project. This is not just the Federal Government. In fact, it is less than 10 percent of the entire project. It is financed with Federal funds. It is largely a matter of local development, including a variety of local corporations. So where we have less than 10 percent in this final phase, why this has been selected doesn't make sense. 
   Now there is a difference, I suppose. I hold a press release from the author of the amendment dated February 28, 2007, announcing that the city of Winnsboro, Texas, had received $100,000 in Federal funds. The author of the amendment said: ``I am excited that some of the hard-earned tax dollars sent to Washington are flowing back into the county.'' There is a difference, I suppose, between that money flowing to Edmonds, Washington. In that case it was money going to the proponent of this amendment. In this case it goes to a different one. I am not sure I understand the difference. 
   I guess the difference is the money that went to Texas was chosen by the bureaucrats. The money that is selected here has been chosen by the United States House of Representatives. Now, I don't know why the proponent believes there is some intrinsic genius of the bureaucrats. Some believe all bureaucrats are smarter than all Congressmen, or the least wise bureaucrat is smarter than the most intelligent Congressman. Some may hold that view; I don't. 
   We have a valid community purpose here. We have a small Federal commitment, and we have a useful thing that is helping kids at risk as well as community development. I note that an economic evaluation of this particular project showed that it would have significant economic value as well as community value in helping the kids in these local communities. 
   So I would commend this small investment of Federal dollars in this community. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (THE ADMINISTRATION'S DECISION TO YANK A CONTRACT FROM AN AMERICAN COMPANY AND GIVE IT TO A CONSORTIUM DOMINATED BY EUROPE -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, Americans across the country are infuriated today that the administration yanked a contract away from Boeing, an American company, for our air tankers and gave it to a consortium dominated by Europe, and they're infuriated for several good reasons: 
   Number one, why are we giving a $40 billion stimulus plan to France? It is our economy that is in danger. 
   Second, why, when we are suing this consortium for violation of international trade laws because of illegal subsidies, do we turn around and award them with a $40 billion contract? One agency says they're illegal; the other agency's giving them $40 billion of our taxpayer money. 
   Number three, and this was an insulting thing when I heard this award, the person making the award says, well, this is an American airplane. It's got an American flag on the tail. Well, you can't just go out and buy a one nickel sticker, slap it on an Airbus airplane and call it ``America.'' 
   We have got to have a policy of procurement that's good for our economy and our security. We need to fix this disastrous administration decision.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT EXPANSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Chairman, I would like to express my support of this bill and congratulate the Chair for her great work. 
   Mr. Chairman, there's a lot of great news in this bill: updating the definition of small business for today's realities, taking care of small companies that are entering into high-technology capital-intensive industries. Many of these small companies are based in my home State of Washington. There's over 200 biotechnology and medical device companies. They are developing cures for debilitating diseases; they are improving the Nation's biodefense system. 
   Mr. Chairman, 44 percent of these companies have been formed just in the last 5 years, and they obviously rely heavily on venture capital. Unfortunately, there's some outdated SBA regulations that currently preclude small businesses, even though with a handful of employees, from receiving assistance simply because they rely on venture capital funds for their R&D. 
   I want to thank the chairwoman for including as a solution to this a provision that will correct this unwise discrimination that is now going on against small businesses that are so dependent on venture capital funding. Today, these companies will again be able to compete for grants and receive other small business assistance because of a provision in this bill. I have been working on a legislative solution for quite a while, so I am very happy to see this fixed today. 
   We are happy to see the American Dream is going to be helped by this bill. I want to thank the chairwoman again. I look forward to future success.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support the Inslee-Welch amendment to the Small Business Investment Act which will support the legislation's overall goal to modernize small business investment programs. Small businesses are the backbone of the growth in our economy and will be the brains behind the forthcoming clean-energy revolution. 
   Our amendment will ensure that the small business investment companies give consideration to innovators that create clean energy technologies and services. 
   There are 26.8 million small businesses in the United States. The vast majority of renewable fuels producers, such as biodiesel and ethanol, are small businesses. The chairwoman understands this, and I thank her for her support and commend her efforts to support small green businesses. 
   Under the chairwoman's leadership, the House passed a clean energy package that will help small businesses become more energy efficient and will establish a debenture financing program exclusively focused on investments in renewable fuels. 
   These efforts truly have been outstanding. However, I believe we must ensure that every piece of legislation that passes this Chamber that deals with taxpayer dollars and Federal investment include a provision to encourage investments in truly clean energy technologies. This amendment will help American innovators and entrepreneurs turn their ideas into products that will help prevent our worst-case climate change scenarios and will create green-collar jobs, and I urge its passage. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer a second Inslee-Welch amendment that will help small business achieve energy efficiency. We need all hands on deck in the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including our Nation's 26 million small businesses. 
   This amendment will help small businesses in low-income areas upgrade to energy-efficient buildings, technologies and practices. It will give them operational assistance in these areas through the New Market Venture Capital program. 
   The majority of small business owners say that they have been affected by rising energy prices and that reducing energy costs will serve to increase their profitability. At the same time, however, half of these entrepreneurs have not yet invested in energy-efficient programs for their businesses. 
   For instance, if a small business owner can replace 20 100-watt incandescent bulbs with 27-watt compact fluorescent bulbs, it does cost the owner $400 up front but saves them $980 a year in energy costs.  
   The owner of the Snoqualmie Gourmet Ice Cream factory in Maltby, WA retrofitted their small business lighting system and reduced their lighting costs by 50 percent. So we know that these simple, new, relatively inexpensive technologies pay for themselves in months, or at most in a couple of years. 
   We know small businesses benefit from energy efficiency and sustainable workplace practices. This amendment will help American innovators with the know-how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in America while increasing their profits. This is a green/green solution in both ways. I want to thank the chairwoman for her support, and urge passage of the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (THE ``RE-SADDAMIZATION'' OF IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - September 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, last week I talked to a father who lost his son in May in Iraq. He was, of course, devastated. He asked me a question: Why did my son die in Iraq? 
   That is a question that will be on all of our minds in the coming days when we receive the new report from Iraq. When we look at the report in a very calm, dispassionate manner, I hope we think about what is really going on in Iraq. What is really going on in Iraq, what the President has crowed about as a great success in these regions is what you might call the ``re-Saddamization'' of Iraq. 
   The President is going to brag about the sense that he is now giving more power to tribes and tribal sheikhs who at some point when we eventually leave Iraq will be better equipped and better armed to fight the central government that the President used to crow about. 
   I think we need to have a calm, dispassionate review of what we're doing. We are creating the conditions that could result in a worse civil war. We have to have a calm review and make the right choices.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, we have had the right to be disappointed in the President's abject refusal to do anything to give us auto efficiency and clean autos for years. And now we still have the right to be disappointed even though he has been ordered to do so by the United States Supreme Court. We sort of heard this sort of semi ``maybe I'll think about it'' approach the other day. 
   We need some bold action when it comes to new technology, including in our automobile sector; and we know we can get that. We know we can have efficient automobiles, and we know we can deal with global warming. 
   I've got to tell you, I just cannot understand why some folks here want to embrace ignorance on global warming. They point out that we didn't know about global warming in 1970. We didn't know about the Internet either, but I don't know why you shouldn't use it. 
   We've learned some things from 1970. We've learned that the planet is warming. We've learned that CO  
   2 is responsible. We've learned that it's coming from our industries. And we've learned that if we have the Federal law followed, we will have energy efficiency and a clean energy economy in the future of this country.

   Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, I was absent from the House floor during today's vote on H.R. 2831, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2007, which will protect women against pay discrimination and restore all employee's rights regarding nondiscriminatory pay. The legislation will reverse the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Ledbetter v. Goodyear by putting into statute widely accepted rules in employment discrimination law. I strongly support federal protections against pay discrimination; therefore, had I been present, I would have voted for H.R. 2831.  
   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Tierney) having assumed the chair, Mrs. Tauscher, Acting Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3161) making appropriations for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, this bill could not be more timely. As I was walking across the street in front of the Supreme Court, I saw the inscription chiseled in the marble of the Supreme Court. It says, ``Equal justice under law.'' But we have witnessed now in the last few weeks the unpeeling of a scandal where the executive branch fired eight well-performing U.S. Attorneys because they would not do the political dirty work of the White House. And it is apparent now, as much as it has ever been, that we have to have a check and balance on the executive branch with Senate confirmation. 
   I want to know why this is so viscerally important. In my district in western Washington, we had a gentleman named John McKay who was doing, by all rights, a good job as a U.S. Attorney for western Washington. But then there was this contentious election out there for Governor in 2004, and a bunch of Republicans were leaning on him to start a grand jury investigation alleging voter fraud because the vote came out in favor of the Democrat. He refused to do so because he said he didn't see any evidence of voter fraud. 
   A little later what happens is he goes to the White House for a meeting about a prospective judgeship, and what do they ask him about? They say: How come Republicans are mad at you, at the White House. And he knows what they are mad about, is because they wouldn't go after this case where there was no evidence of voter fraud. It was apparent they were leaning on him; and, when he did not collapse, he was fired. 
   Now, this is a situation where it is clear that we need Senate confirmation. And, by the way, I have written a letter to the President today saying the President should reinstate that U.S. Attorney while this matter is investigated. This thing smells like a mackerel in the moonlight, and it needs to be resolved. Until it is resolved, Congress is going to be investigating; and to prevent this from happening again, we need to be sure we have Senate confirmation.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (REVOLUTIONIZING AMERICA'S ENERGY POLICY -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor this evening to continue the effort to revolutionize American energy. We had the first breakthrough here just about a week and a half ago where the U.S. House of Representatives took the first step in the clean energy revolution. 
   I think it was long overdue, and I think it is going to be much enjoyed by Americans, because what we did about a week and a half ago was take the first step toward freeing ourselves from the shackles of oil and gas and in fact starting down the road toward clean energy with a high-tech clean energy future. 
   The way we did that, we reeled back in $14 billion of giveaways to the oil and gas industry, the most profitable industry in the history of the solar system, that had been given under the previous Congress; and we put that money for Americans to use to develop a clean energy future that can depend upon Midwestern farmers rather than Middle Eastern sheiks. 
   This really was a first step on a long road toward a clean energy future for America. It was a very, very important first step. 
   This evening I wanted to share with my colleagues some folks I have met whose lives are intertwined with that clean energy future. 
   We call the clean energy future the new Apollo Project because we believe we need a new high-tech energy future for this country every bit as bold and revolutionary and visionary as John Kennedy's original Apollo Project when he stood behind me in 1961 and said America was going to place a man on the Moon and bring him back safely in 10 years, and that happened. 
   We believe that we need that same spirit, that same idea that our genius, our innovation and inventiveness in America can create new technologies to provide us new energy. 
   The people I wanted to talk about tonight are all people I have met in the last month and are people who I believe exhibit why we need the new Apollo energy project and why it was a good idea for Congress to have created this clean energy fund, take money out of oil and gas and put it into clean energy. I would like to talk about some of those folks. 
   The first two people I want to talk about are exhibits A and B as to why we need a new clean energy future. 
   One is President Note of the Marshall Islands who is a gracious fellow. I met him on Bainbridge Island awhile back.     
   When I talked to him, he told me about the plight of his Nation, the Marshall Islands in the southern Pacific, very, very low atolls. They are essentially coral reefs, and they are just a few feet above sea level. What the President of the Marshall Islands told me is that his Nation is now threatened by sea level rises associated with global warming, together with the coral reefs that can be occasioned by acidification in the ocean and increasing water temperature, again because of global warming and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 
   What President Note told me is that, for the last year or so, they have had to take emergency provisions to keep the sea from encroaching where they live, essentially. They are now starting to have active consideration of where folks will have to go after they leave the Marshall Islands when the seas swallow the Marshall Islands or make them uninhabitable. 
   Another problem they are having is the storms are increasing in severity as well. 
   So here we have the President of a nation state who was in Seattle this weekend pleading for us to take measures to stop global warming to try to preserve his nation. I thought this  could be the first nation really destroyed by environmental catastrophe associated with an energy policy that is polluting the atmosphere with so much carbon dioxide. 
   President Note was pretty convincing that as an act of humanity we should not allow his nation to drown, and to me it was sort of a common-sense, human thing to do, to ask me to talk to my colleagues about what we could do about that, and so I am here tonight. 
   The second person I want to talk about is the director of relocation for a town called Shishmareff, which is a town on the northern coast of Alaska. This is a town that has been there for 4,000 years in some village system or otherwise. For 4,000 years, people have enjoyed living there, but now they are being swallowed by the sea. The Arctic Ocean is essentially intruding into the town. 
   If you go and google Shishmareff, Alaska, you will see pictures of the houses simply falling down into the ocean. For a combination of reasons, the tundra is melting underneath their houses, and the ocean is intruding because an ice barrier that formerly protected their village has melted. So they are both having the tundra melt underneath them and the storm waves coming in and washing away the town. 
   About 3 weeks ago, the town voted to move 13 miles, move the whole town, kit and caboodle, to the mainland. They are now on a coastal barrier island, and this will be the first town, Shishmareff, Alaska, the first town that falls victim to global warming in the United States, the first American town. 
   I cannot be thinking that that is something to be proud of, that we have an energy policy that allows the oil and gas industry and others to put untold amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It is actually destroying an American town. 
   I think we ought to rally to the idea that we do not allow American towns to be swallowed by a problem. We have got to solve the problem. 
   So there are two people, the President of the Marshall Islands and the leader of Shishmareff, Alaska, both of whom are having their communities literally being swallowed up and having to move at some point because we have an energy policy that is fit for the 19th century, not the 21st century. 
   That is the bad news, but now I want to shift to some people I have met who have given me a huge amount of confidence that we can deal with this problem. Because I think if you spend time talking to the scientists and the inventors and innovators, as I have during the last year, you would be convinced that Americans, the country that had people who invented the light bulb, the jet airplane, went to the moon, perfected the Internet and mapped the human genome, are capable of creating a new energy future that will not allow the destruction of other American towns. The reason I believe that is because I know these people. I just want to share some of the people I have met in the last month. 
   Last Friday, I met people from a company called General Compression, and these are scientists who have invented a way to make a compressor about 80 percent more efficient which does not sound too thrilling, I suppose, until you think what it can do. Because what they can do with this compressor is put it on the top of a wind turbine and use the wind turbine that blows in the wind to compress air and then take that air and can pump it down into subterranean caverns and keep stored air under high pressure that then can be vented and used like a big battery. When you vent this compressed air, it can drive a turbine and generate electricity. 
   Now, the upshot of all this technology is it means that we can take wind turbines and essentially connect them to a giant battery in the form of compressed air to store that energy. This is very, very important in the effort to have clean energy because now we can make wind turbines part of the grid. We can have energy that wind turbines create. We can have access to it even when the wind does not blow. Wind does not always blow, except here in the House of Representatives, of course. 
   So this, for the first time, when this technology is perfected, and it is not perfect yet, will be able to perhaps double the revenues that can be generated from wind turbines, a clean energy source that does not emit one pound of carbon dioxide when we generate that electricity. 
   So here is a tremendous breakthrough that could make radical changes in our energy policy by perhaps doubling the efficacy, at least the revenue generation of wind turbine farms. We have had a bunch of them go up in the State of Washington. We have the largest wind turbine farm in North America in the State of Washington, which is already as cheap as any other type of energy that we have. So there is one company. 
   The second company, the day before I had in my office a company called A123 Battery. It is a company in Massachusetts, scientists who have spun off of MIT, largely; and A123 Battery company is a company that has 
   developed a lithium ion battery which has tremendous capacity essentially for storing electricity. They have now signed an agreement with General Motors in an effort to provide the battery for the Volt, the first plug-in hybrid that GM has announced they would like to build in several years. 
   A123 Battery company, it is exciting because their technology, once it becomes commercialized, once it becomes packaged in a reliable source that we can make sure we can put in our car, will allow us to have plug-in hybrids, a car that we can take home at night, plug into a garage outlet, next day drive it up to 40 miles on electricity. And over 60 percent of our trips are under 40 miles a day, but if you want to go over 40 miles a day, then you have an auxiliary internal combustion engine that will burn either gasoline or ethanol that can take you the rest of the mileage as far as you want to drive. 
   So it is a plug-in, flex-fuel hybrid vehicle. Plug-in meaning you plug in at night, flex-fuel meaning runs on a gasoline or ethanol, and hybrid means it has electric and internal combustion engine. 
   So this company now has sort of answered the $64,000 question of how we are going to have enough battery capacity; and all they need to do, as they explained to me, is to mount some engineering. The science is there. Now they need the engineering. 
   This is very exciting to think that in 5, maybe 6, 7 years, we will be able to have an electrical driven car, by and large, that we can distribute energy over the electrical system. 
   Think about when you put those two companies I just talked about, put those two companies together. General Compression, which can perhaps double the efficacy of the wind turbine, that can generate electricity that goes out over the wires to your garage, that you plug in your car at night and drive off and get 40 miles on electricity and unlimited mileage on your gas or ethanol, a clean system, with zero carbon dioxide emissions. There is some pretty good news, and they are not the only one. 
   Now maybe we will not have wind turbine-driven electricity. Maybe we will have clean coal. You know, most of the energy is from coal, from electricity right now in the United States, and it is very dirty, huge gigatons of carbon dioxide which are responsible for global warming, but there may be a way we can burn it cleanly. 
   We can put it through a combined cycle process that can take the carbon dioxide out of the stream. We turn the coal into hydrogen. We burn the hydrogen in a gas turbine, and that generates electricity. But we have got to have some place to put the carbon dioxide so it does not get in the atmosphere. We basically sequester it, and we pump it under high pressure into the ground, and it stays there for hundreds of years, but it takes a lot of energy to compress that CO  
   2. For every two coal-fired plants, you have to have one just for the energy to suppress this CO 
   2. 
   But a company I talked to yesterday called RAMGEN in Tacoma, Washington, RAMGEN has a nascent technology using a very sophisticated technology to increase the efficiency of compressors by very significant amounts, which would allow us to compress this carbon dioxide and use much less electricity to do it. 
   So here we have a situation where we have these three companies I just talked about that may mean we would be able to have affordable, clean coal  electricity to go into our electrical grid to power our plug-ins; and, if not that, then we have wind turbine technology to power our plug-ins with a battery that works. 
   That is a beautifully elegant system that can keep the Shishmareff towns and the Marshall Islands that are being swallowed by the sea and keep us having cars that do not have to drive on oil from the Middle East. That is a pretty nice system. So there is a lot of great news out there, because there is a lot of great innovation out there. 
   But the question is, what can we here in Congress do to accelerate that rate and that pace of innovation, and this is the third thing I would like to address tonight. We have talked about the problem. We have talked about the people who are solving it, innovation, but we have a role here, too, to help accelerate that rate of innovation. 
   I would like tonight to talk about some of the things, not all of the things, but some of the things we can do here in Congress. 
   First, what we can do is try to accelerate the rate of the commercialization of this plug-in hybrid battery. It is still going to take some engineering to make sure the battery is put in sequence in a crash-worthy system. 
   We can pass a bill I introduced last week with some colleagues called the grid plug-in hybrid vehicle bill that will use some of this $14 billion that we have set aside for research that will help this industrial application get off the ground. It would also provide incentives for consumers to buy these products so we can help increase the demand for them; and, of course, we know once we increase demand, the cost of these goes down, the more we have on the road. 
   The bill would also create a Federal testing ground. We have several of these now that help prove the concept of these--that prove these concepts work, and we would build on that by providing another test facility to certify the safety and reliability of these systems. 
   So here is one bill that can help speed this transition to an electrical driven car, and we are very close to doing it. It may happen without Federal action, later rather than sooner, but we cannot wait. We cannot wait because of our dependence on foreign oil, and we cannot wait as the scientific panel will come out with its report this Friday again noting the danger we face as a country as a result of global warming. 
   So that is one thing we can do, pass this plug-in, flex-fuel hybrid vehicle bill. 
   Secondly, what we can do is make it easier for people to generate their own electricity. You know, photovoltaic energy where you put solar cells on your roof is becoming close to being market-driven. There are some very, very exciting things going on in photovoltaic energy right now. 
   A company in California called NanoSolar is producing 450 megawatts of thin cell solar cells which they hope will decrease the cost of photovoltaic cells dramatically, another company called MiaSole. But we want to make it easier for you. If you want to put it on your roof, when you generate more electricity, you are feeding it back into the grid, to basically--to sell electricity you grow at your home, home-grown electricity back to the utility company.     
   We want to make sure that you can get paid for that. So we have another bill called the net metering bill. Net metering basically means that you net on your meter what you used from the utility against what you produce and sell back to the utility. 
   This bill would create a right for you as a consumer, under certain rules that were set up, to sell your electricity back to your utility, make sure you can hook up, have a Federal standard to do that. That is the key to being able to get to what we call a distributed generation system, where we can have generators all around the country, including on our rooftops and our businesses and our homes, not just in large coal plants and large hydroelectric dams. 
   This is a pretty simple thing to do. It has been blocked now for 4 years in Congress. We are hoping that it can get through this year, a simple thing to do. 
   Third, we have got to increase our research and development in all of these high-tech energy fields. I just mentioned several of them. There are many others, wave power. We now have the first wave power plant that has been proposed off the coast of Oregon, 50 megawatts, with buoys that bob up and down underneath the surface that can generate very considerable electricity. There is enough electricity that could be generated off a 10-by-10 square mile area off the coast of California that, if the buoys can be shown to survive ocean conditions, can have all the electricity California could use. It is pretty amazing. 
   Now, there are hurdles to show that these buoys can survive in the wave power, but we need to do more in the wave conditions. We need to do more R&D on this. We need more R on the clean coal. We need more R&D on the solar thermal, which we are having great success with lately. 
   The reason we know this is because when we compare this to other major challenges, we are really pathetic. We are pathetic when it comes to doing R&D and energy right now. 
   You know, this challenge we have is at least as visionary as going to the Moon, but it affects our planet rather than the Moon. Yet we are spending one-seventh of what was spent and invested in the new Apollo Project, one-seventh per year what we spent on getting to the Moon. 
   That is a sad commentary on our failure to act with dispatch when it comes to energy. We would not have gotten to the Moon, probably ever, had we had such a skimpy, weak, pathetic amount of research into this basic science. We have all this explosion of information going on between nanotechnology and biofuels, which we haven't even yet talked about tonight. We have got to ramp up that Federal R&D. That is the third thing we need to do. 
   Fourth, we need to have major steps forward to advance our biofuels potential in this country. We have enormous potential in this country for biofuels. I have read the last few days some articles and newspapers by pundits who get to say anything they want. They don't ever have to run for election, so it doesn't matter what it is, really, I suppose. 
   But these pundits have suggested that biofuels could not play an important part of our role, and those people are not talking to the scientists who recognize the breakthrough technology that we are on the cusp of enjoying in this country to dramatically increase the productivity of biofuels. Now, we know we are already producing very significant sums of ethanol and some biodiesel in this country. We know that that can increase. 
   But what folks don't understand is that these biofuels, we are ready to take giant leaps forward to leapfrog the corn ethanol that we now use, and corn ethanol right now is what we might think of as the first-generation biofuel. It is kind of like the Wright brothers' flier. It works, you can fly, but it is just a start. We are going to enjoy succeeding generations of biofuels. 
   The first one that we will have will be cellulosic ethanol. Cellulosic ethanol is a fancy term that basically means instead of just using the seed of a plant to distill ethanol, you use the whole plant. You don't just use a kernel of the corn. You use everything, what they call the corn stover that grows above the ground. You mash it up, and you put an enzyme in it to break down the carbohydrates in the cell, then you distill the carbohydrates and you make ethanol. 
   When we do this, we will increase the productivity of the Midwestern farmer by a factor of two or three, not 5 or 10 percent, but by a factor of two or three. We will generate two or three times as much energy and money per acre as we are generating right now. This technology is ready for the first commercial plant, which should be in Idaho, a company called Iogen, that is ready as soon as they get a loan guarantee from Uncle Sam so they can build the first commercial plant to do this. 
   When we do this, we will be able to have a very significant amount of our transportation fueled by domestically produced biofuel. This is not me just saying this. This is the Department of Energy that has done extensive analyses of this, Department of Agriculture, a whole suite of agronomists  who have looked at it, who have basically concluded that in 25 years we can have 25 to 30 percent of our transportation fuels fueled by this, by this stream of domestically produced ethanol. 
   That is just a beginning. That is a second generation. A third generation could include algae. Algae has the capability of producing 50 times as much at least per acre as even the second generation of biofuels. 
   There is at least one company that has at least one commercial application of that technology now, basically to make diesel fuel out of algae. That is the kind of thing we need to invest in, and that is what we need to start doing. 
   Last, I want to mention something that is pivotal to driving these technologies, and that is the technologies that I have talked about tonight all operate under an enormous competitive disadvantage. They have to compete with other industries that have a huge subsidy that they don't get, and that's the subsidy that the fossil fuel industry has because they get to put their carbon dioxide, their pollution, in the atmosphere for free. 
   Now, you think about that. If a coal-fired utility right now can put its garbage, its pollution, its carbon dioxide, its pollutant that is damaging the Earth's atmosphere, that is damaging the atmosphere by the megaton and not pay a dime for it, in unlimited amounts, now, compared to what you do and what we do when we go to our county garbage dump with a pickup full of stuff out of our garden, goodness knows what we have got in the back of our basements, we have to pay money to dump our stuff in a limited space, because there is only a limited space in a garbage dump. 
   But utilities that put all this pollution in our atmosphere, which has limited carrying capacity for carbon dioxide, get to do it for free for as much as they want. That is a huge subsidy of those industries. 
   If you are a small company in California building solar cells or ocean-powered technology or wind turbines, or if you are a farmer in Ohio that is going to build cellulosic ethanol and sell it, you don't get that subsidy. It is an unfair subsidy, and it needs to stop.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, listening to the President last night, I had a very disturbing sense of d&#233;ja 2 vu, or actually, maybe, appropriately, d&#233;ja 2 voodoo. 
   I remember the situation where the President said we had this threat to the country, we had to respond in Iraq. He then went on to foist hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit spending in the Iraq war, without paying one single dime in a fiscally responsible way to do it. 
   Last night he did exactly the same thing. He attempted to foist somewhere between 200, 500, 700 billion dollars of deficit spending on the American people. When you do deficit spending, you ultimately put the cost on middle-income taxpayers in America. 
   This President, if he believes this crisis is so bad, needs to come to the American people and put the cost on the folks who got us into this predicament, the industry that created this crisis, not on middle-income taxpayers. 
   This is fiscal irresponsibility. It will not stand.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 7060, RENEWABLE ENERGY AND JOB CREATION TAX ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to address the importance of this bill, the American job creation bill, and how this bill relates to another bill we are working on. By doing that, I just want to share something I saw in Colorado about 3 weeks ago. 
   I was in Golden, Colorado, at the National Renewable Energy Lab. At that National Renewable Energy Lab I saw a functioning system of powering our cars with solar energy. 
   It was a photovoltaic cell about 400 square feet mounted on a little pod that basically would run two cars, two electric plug-in cars for a day, just by charging them for about 6 to 8 hours. So you plug them in, they run 40 miles on all electricity, and then they could go another 250 miles on gasoline. Basically what it showed was a vision for this country using home-grown solar power and home-grown electric cars. 
   This bill is absolutely imperative to make sure that we get that solar energy located in the United States. So these industries like Ausra Solar Thermal Power, like Nanosolar in Palo Alto with photovoltaic power, so we keep building those businesses right here in the United States. And the renewable tax credits are imperative in this bill. 
   But I want to point out how this dovetails with another bill that is under consideration today in the House, and that is a bill we will have to try to stimulate job creation. 
   It very important in those plug-in cars that we have that we manufacture in this country the batteries that are going to run our electric cars. When we have plug-in electric cars and fully electric cars, the batteries will represent 50 percent of the value of those cars, and we cannot allow those jobs to go to China and Korea. Unfortunately, right now the plans are to make the car bodies here, but make the batteries in China and Korea. That is a sure loss of tens of thousands of jobs. 
   So we are working on another bill here today parallel to this one that would create a loan guarantee program to ensure that those battery production jobs stay in America. I am hopeful that we get these renewable energy tax credits extended, and I think it is imperative that we move forward to save the battery industry in this country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, nothing is more apt for Americans than the clean energy revolution that we will start with today's bill. Nothing is more apt for Americans because this bill depends on two very intrinsic American qualities. Those are the qualities of optimism and innovation. And we believe that this bill sets us on a course for innovation that will achieve for clean energy what we achieved in the space race of the 1960s. 
   And I'd like to share why I'm optimistic about this. This is a picture I took a couple of weeks ago in Golden, Colorado, at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the center of our national effort on renewable energy. It's a picture of a photovoltaic cell. On the other side of this array is a 400-square-foot photovoltaic cell converting sunlight into electricity. That sunlight feeds down into these two cars that are plugged-in electric hybrid cars. This is a term Americans are going to get to know real well. They plug in. They use this solar-based power, and they will go 40 miles with zero gasoline. And then after you go more than 40 miles, they have a gasoline engine to go another 200 or 250 miles. 
   Here's the stunning fact which they told me at the renewable lab. This panel, which can go on your roof, powers two cars in 8 hours to get that all-electric drive for a full 40 miles. 
   We are in the midst of a transition. We are on the cusp of a great transition. It reminds me of another transition when we went from typewriters to software, and there were a bunch of optimists out in Redmond, Washington at Microsoft, in my district, that were optimistic about this new transition we were going to get into. 
   Now, I will tell you this: I've heard some of my Republican friends saying ``drill, baby, drill.'' I think during that transition from typewriters to software, what they would have been saying is ``type, baby, type.'' 
   We know that we have to break our addiction to oil, not to continue it, and this bill is a comprehensive measure.

   Mr. INSLEE. Let's be clear. The Republicans who will vote against this bill today are voting against solar energy for Americans. They are voting against plug-in hybrid technology for Americans. They are voting against enhanced geothermal for Americans. They are voting against more wind energy for Americans. And this idea of drilling as a bridge to these technologies, it's a bridge to nowhere. It won't show up for 15 years. 
   We need this technology starting today. That's a future America deserves.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. I have come this morning to take issue with a comment by one of the candidates for President about how our economy is doing fine, the fundamentals are strong. I want to say that we have to do some major work rebuilding our economy and rebuilding millions of jobs, and that we will have a bill on the floor this week that we will propose to restore economic growth by rebuilding a new, clean energy economy for America. 
   We believe that we need to have a new birth of whole new industries in America to start to replace the hemorrhaging of jobs that we have suffered,  and we believe that we can do this by building green collar jobs and a whole new clean economy for America. 
   In the next few days, we will be proposing to the House a comprehensive energy bill that will be focused on building new jobs in America. And we think Americans deserve this. We think Americans are ready for this. And we think it is an American destiny, as we were the arsenal of democracy in World War II, to now become the arsenal of clean energy for the world. 
   I want to talk about some of the things I've learned just in the last few months about our ability to grow a new clean energy economy in the world. 
   I'd like to refer to a photograph taken a few weeks ago in Golden, Colorado. This is a photograph taken at the National Renewable Energy Lab. This lab is vested with the charge to help build new technologies to grow new jobs in America. I want to report this picture, I think, encapsulates the potential future for the American transportation system and the American new energy system to drive jobs in that direction. 
   This is a photograph of a photovoltaic array, this panel here that is mounted on this pedestal. On the other side of this metal is a photovoltaic array that basically captures the sun's energy and transfers it to electric energy. This array itself is attached to these two cars here. These two cars are plug-in electric cars. These are two cars that essentially we will plug in at night, when these cars are on the road. And they are mass produced in America. 
   These cars plug in at night. We charge them for 8 hours. And then they will run about 40 miles on all electricity. So that these cars will emit no carbon dioxide. They'll run just on energy and electricity for 40 miles. If you want to go more than 40 miles a day, you'll run on gasoline or ethanol for the remaining 200, 250-mile range, plus. 
   Now the wonderful thing about this, and I've done a lot of research, but something I learned, and I was very impressed with the young man at the National Renewable Lab that told me that this array right here, which isn't a lot larger, you can see, than a rooftop, will charge in 8 hours, fully charge, two of these plug-in electric cars to run a full 40 miles on electricity, and they then can run on gasoline an additional 200, 250 miles. 
   This was a remarkable statement to me because this picture, I believe, is Exhibit A in our ability to totally revolutionize our transportation system and grow millions of new jobs in America to do that. Let me give you an example of that. 
   These photovoltaic arrays are now being manufactured in America, not just in the silicone-based systems that we're familiar with, but 2 months ago at the Nano Solar Company in California, Americans produced the first thin-cell photovoltaic to actually have a revolutionary system that is 30 to 40 percent less expensive for a lot of energy coming from these photovoltaic arrays. Those are manufacturing jobs in America. 
   General Motors is getting ready in 2010 or 2011 to mass produce the first plug-in electric car in America, where we are going to put Americans to work in this manufacturing process. 
   This is why I mention this. We will have a bill on the floor in the next few days that will truly advance these manufacturing millions of new green collar jobs in solar, in plug-in electric cars, by doing several things. It will create a tax code that will give benefits to companies to manufacture these products. It will give tax breaks to Americans to buy these products. It will create a 15 percent requirement that our utilities use these new, clean energy sources. It will create a research and development fund to help do the research to bring these to market. 
   And my Republican colleagues, I will call on them and we will call on them to join us in a comprehensive bill to truly help the development of these new technologies. We hope they will abandon their shortsighted view that these technologies aren't the future. This is the future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. You know, if we were having this debate in the 1800s, someone would be arguing about need to preserve whale oil, because that was the dominant source of energy in the 1800s and they couldn't see the emerging transition to different fuels. And now we have some people in this Chamber who don't understand the transition of fuels for Americans, the only transition that has a chance of breaking our addiction to oil and truly keeping down the price of energy. 
   I want to show you a transition fuel that is just on the cusp. I met a man named Tony Markel. He works at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado, two weeks ago, and he showed me this. 
   This is a photo-voltaic panel. It is about 400 square feet, and it is plugged into two plug-in electric hybrid cars. These are cars that run on electricity, only electricity, for about 40 miles, and if you want to go further than 40 miles, you use gasoline. This one system, a PV system, can power these two cars for essentially 40 miles, and then you use gasoline if you want to go more than 40 miles. 
   This bill that the Republicans hate is going to give Americans a step forward to this future, which is the only future, together with some biofuels and perhaps even some other technologies, that can break the stranglehold of the oil and gas industry over the American consumer. And it is clear to me from people at Boeing, who revolutionized commercial aircraft; from people at Microsoft, who revolutionized software, that now is a chance for Americans to revolutionize the world of new clean energy. 
   We know that we need innovation, not intransigence. We need invention, not insignificance. And we know we can't drill our way out of this problem. But we can, we must, and we will innovate our way to a clean energy future. This is a destiny of ours. It is a clean energy destiny.  
   In addition, I would like to add that Tony Markel is an employee of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. NREL is a national laboratory that provides great data and research on energy efficiency and renewable energy; however, NREL does not generally have a position on pending legislation, nor does it have a position on this bill, H.R. 6899.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support an economic stimulus package that will create American jobs in a growing clean energy economy. Thanks to the advocacy of Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Chairman John Dingell, Congress authorized an advanced battery loan guarantee program for advanced vehicle batteries and systems--key components to fuel efficient cars--in the United States. I also want to thank my good friends Representatives Steve Israel and Tim Ryan for engaging in the effort to push this program and others like Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Chairman Dave Obey and RAHM EMANUEL for their support in moving forward. Also integral in this achievement are hard-working staff. 
   As many Americans know, a healthy automobile industry is as American as apple pie. In the transition to a clean energy economy, batteries and advanced electric systems are the key to our future success in this area. Once cars are electrified, batteries will be equivalent to up to 50 percent the total cost of the car. At this time, all of the domestic auto manufacturers plan to purchase batteries that have been produced offshore for their new efficient electric vehicles. However, today, the House will provide funding for a $3.3 billion in loan guarantee program for the domestic construction of facilities that will manufacture advanced vehicle batteries and battery systems. This will enable an American industry to remain competitive in producing advanced lithium ion batteries, hybrid electrical systems, components and software designs. 
   Loan guarantees provided in this bill will enable several domestic advanced battery manufacturers and advanced vehicle systems companies to grow in a global marketplace. Such companies could include AFS Trinity, of Medina, WA, Enerdel of Indianapolis, IN, Altairnano Battery of Reno, NV, Firefly of Peoria, IL and International Battery of Allentown, PA. There are others that have also developed technology here and we hope that this provision will encourage those companies to open facilities in the United States. 
   Absent this program, we risk losing the advanced battery industry to Asia when there is no technological reason that America cannot compete in this technology. With this program, we will ensure that America retains green collar jobs in an important industry. We also ensure our companies grow in a global marketplace. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and fund this program.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (WILD SKY WILDERNESS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, this is wilderness the way wilderness is supposed to be done. I want to compliment Congressman Larsen and Senator Patty Murray for their efforts to shepherd and to fine-tune this bill. If anyone wants to see how to do a wilderness bill, come see how this one is done to take into consideration all of the local comments to pare this down to where we have the muscle and bone in this wilderness right now. 
   Boy, is it the right place to do it. I have a picture here of Gunn and Merchant peaks looking north from Baring Peak. I climbed Baring Peak, that is really just a little scramble, a couple of summers ago. What is so amazing about the Wild Sky Wilderness, it is both wild, and it is in the sky. It is only about 55 minutes from downtown Seattle.     
   About 2 million people can drive to this incredible Wild Sky Wilderness in about an hour, and it is a hidden gem. What you can say is that we have a new hidden gem that has been protected in the State of Washington to join the other jewels in the crown of our wilderness and our National Park System in the State of Washington, and we invite people to come out and see it. And if you come, what you will see is a very virgin country very close to an urban area. 
   Millions of people drive by these mountains on Highway 2 and don't even realize how wild this country is right to their left as they are going east towards eastern Washington. There are hardly even any marked trails in there. So if you want wild close to an urban area, come to the Wild Sky Wilderness. It is a very, very wonderful place to go. 
   But there is a second reason I want to point out why this wilderness is so important. The day I went up to the Baring Peak, I just happened to meet a father and two of his sons he was taking for a hike. He told me this is one of the earliest hikes going into Baring Lake. And if you could see the smile on this dad and the sort of interesting looks on these two kids, you know what wilderness is about, because today when we establish the Wild Sky Wilderness, we are giving a gift to these kids and their kids and their grandkids. So these kids could be in the same position as dad has been, sometime, to have a wilderness to take their kids and their grandkids to, and they will have the same smile on their faces 100 years from now as this family did that summer day up on Baring Peak. 
   I want to thank the people who have been involved in this, Mike Towns specifically, a fellow who has been working on this for over 10 years. He is a teacher in Redmond, Washington. I know he will have a big smile on his face today, too. This is a great day for the continuation of wilderness in the State of Washington. It is just south of the Jackson Wilderness Area. It is a tradition that Congressman Larsen has followed and Senator Jackson, and a proud tradition of wilderness in the State of Washington. Congratulations.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (WILD SKY WILDERNESS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, today I rise as a cosponsor of H.R. 886, the Wild Sky Wilderness Act of 2007 to commend the House for taking long overdue action on legislation to designate the Wild Sky Wilderness. Today's approval of this well-drawn, meritorious environmental legislation is long overdue. I want to thank Congressman Rick Larsen and Senator Patty Murray for their tireless persistence on behalf of their constituents as well as Chairman Rahall for his long standing support for the Wild Sky and for bringing this bill to the floor. 
   As a Member of the House Natural Resources Committee, I have been supportive of Congressman Larsen's attempts to designate this area as wilderness and was continually frustrated at the failure of the previous Chairmen of that Committee to move this legislation and disappointed at the reasons given for inaction. Those arguments were without merit. 
   One of the benefits of working on this legislation was learning of the steadfast support from my constituents, the new Wild Sky Wilderness will be a popular and well-loved addition to my state's heritage of protected wild landscapes. It is overwhelmingly supported by my constituents, who live nearby. Indeed, the new Wild Sky Wilderness is within easy access of the people in the entire Puget Sound region. 
   This wilderness area, which is located in Snohomish County, enjoys enthusiastic support from the county council as well as our elected county executive. It also has the support of an overwhelming number of local elected leaders throughout the county, Democrats and Republicans alike, as well as a long list of local Snohomish County business owners. Over the years that the Wild Sky Wilderness has been before Congress it has earned enthusiastic editorial support from the local newspaper, the Everett Herald, as well as the major newspapers in Seattle and across the state. 
   I want to emphasize to my colleagues that in my State this is as popular and non-controversial a proposal as it could possibly be. I am pleased to mention the support this legislation enjoys from the Administration, including  the Agriculture Under Secretary, who in response to my questioning said that the President will sign this bill into law. 
   On top of its stunning wild character, the 106,577-acre Wild Sky Wilderness is particularly noteworthy because it embraces lower elevation lands than most of the existing Federal wilderness areas in our State. As a result, the new wilderness will afford statutory protection to headwaters streams and watersheds vital to the survival and restoration of healthy runs of salmon and steelhead in the Skykomish River, for which the area is named. 
   Passage of this legislation contributes to the important goal of protecting a greater diversity of biological communities in our National Wilderness Preservation System--including deep, forested valleys as well as towering, ice-clad mountain peaks. This lower elevation wilderness land will provide greater opportunities for year-round recreational adventures for Washington State residents. 
   During the congressional consideration of this wilderness proposal, our committee has dealt with a question that all too easily can mislead those who are not familiar with the 1964 Wilderness Act and of the consistent approach Congress has followed over four decades now in applying the protection of that historic conservation law to additional portions of our Federal lands. 
   As Congress acts on wilderness proposals such as this Wild Sky Wilderness legislation, it is important that we take care to follow the legislative history of the Wilderness Act of 1964, which was a bipartisan product of our committee, and the precedents consistently laid down over the subsequent more than four decades as Congress has enacted more than 130 laws under both Democratic and Republican leadership that have designated new wilderness areas across our country. 
   It is clear that the Wilderness Act reserves to Congress alone the decision as to what Federal lands are ``suitable'' for designation as wilderness. Subsection 2(a) of the Wilderness Act specifies that ``..... no Federal lands shall be designated as `wilderness areas' except as provided for in this Act or by a subsequent Act.'' Subsection 3(c) further specifies that the President may make recommendations, but that ``A recommendation of the President for designation as wilderness shall become effective only if so provided by an Act of Congress.'' 
   Despite this full history of Congressional action, some tried to question the inclusion of certain lands in the Wild Sky Wilderness because these lands showed fading evidence of past logging, old roads, and similar evidence of human use and impact. This objection, sometimes referred to as the ``purity theory'' of wilderness, is not based on an accurate understanding of the Wilderness Act and the intent of those who enacted it. 
   The new Wild Sky Wilderness includes some evidence of past human uses and impacts, including evidence of logging, old logging roads and logging railroad grades, and some culverts installed along those roads and railroad grades. In this way, it is no different than many wilderness areas Congress has previously designated as wilderness. 
   During a debate here on the House floor in 1969, Representative Morris K. Udall, the former chairman of our committee and himself one of the architects of the Wilderness Act, explained this practical approach intended by the authors of the Wilderness Act to the House:  
   It would be nice to have our national wilderness system absolutely pure and completely free of any sign of the hand of man. But the fact is that we are getting a late start in this business of preserving America's wilderness. Logging has occurred; wood roads have been opened and later abandoned; cabins have been built which in time have decayed and fallen down; in the interest of public health and safety and to protect the natural resources there may sometimes be lookout towers and patrol cabins. All of these are imperfections within the wilderness. Yet how often is man able to create or to establish anything which is truly perfect? Very, very rarely--if ever. [Congressional Record, September 24, 1969]  
   Mr. Speaker, these remarks by Rep. Udall perfectly explicate the practical approach that Congress has always followed as we choose lands for protection in our National Wilderness Preservation System. He went on to further explain that:  
   Congress has declared it is our national policy to preserve America's wilderness resource. Whether some prior existing imperfection--something less than absolutely purity--is to be accepted into the national wilderness system should be determined by whether its inclusion will significantly contribute to the implementation of this national policy of wilderness preservation or whether its omission will significantly obstruct this policy. [Congressional Record, September 24, 1969]  
   In keeping with the practical approach he has so cogently summarized, I want to emphasize that some of the low elevation lands within the Wild Sky Wilderness show evidence of past human use and impacts. We have made a careful judgment that inclusion of these lands is important to serve the overall purpose of wilderness protection. As chairman Udall would have put it, every acre in the proposed Wild Sky Wilderness exhibits ``substantially all the value of wilderness.'' We should preserve it. 
   I would also like to take a moment to pay tribute to Ms. Karen Fant, who devoted her life to preserving wilderness and wildlife in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest. She spent four decades organizing for conservation, working for groups including the Alaska Coalition, Sierra Club, Olympic Park Associates, Wild Sky Working Group, Washington Wilderness Coalition, and Save Our Wild Salmon Coalition. Her activism spanned many years, crossed state lines, and extended as far as Chongqing, China, where she dedicated herself to developing a strategy to address environmental degradation in Asia as a board member of the Seattle-Chongqing Sister City Association. 
   Karen was instrumental in passing the 1984 Washington State Wilderness Act, which sets aside over one million acres of new wilderness. She also initiated the efforts to preserve Wild Sky. I cannot imagine a better way to honor Karen's conservation legacy than for my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 886, the Wild Sky Wilderness Act of 2007. Passage of this legislation is the perfect tribute to Karen's legacy.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (THE NATIONAL RAMIFICATIONS OF U.S. AIR FORCE'S DECISION TO AWARD TANKER CONTRACT TO EUROPEAN AEROSPACE CONSORTIUM -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, Mr. Tiahrt of Kansas and I, and others may join us later, have come tonight to talk about an important issue with large national ramifications, and that is the decision by the United States Air Force to decline a contract for our next extremely important tanker and to give it to a consortium, a very significant portion of which will be manufactured in Europe through a consortium in part with EADS and the Airbus company in Europe. 
   I represent an area north of Seattle with thousands of Boeing workers; so obviously this is an important issue in my district. Certainly the hometown team is Boeing. 
   But our discussion tonight will be about why all America ought to be very concerned about this decision for several reasons. And it is an obvious situation where there is very significant employment in my district that any Congress person would be concerned about that, but what we want to  talk about tonight are the national ramifications and why we believe this is a very, very injurious decision that needs to be reversed one way or another. 
   For background in this regard, the very able and really spectacularly performing aircraft, the KC-135, that for decades have provided the very backbone of our United States Air Force capability, will soon be at some point entering their obsolescence. Herculean efforts have been put forward to keep those great airplanes in the air, but at some point we've got to have a new airplane, and we know that that is the case. 
   So we have been engaged in an effort to provide another replacement. A good United States product, Boeing, competed with subcontractors across the United States for a 767 airframe that we believed was perfect for the task, and by all information provided, the Air Force would provide the capability that was needed by the Air Force. 
   Unfortunately, the Air Force has decided to reject an American contractor on this extremely important contract. And obviously it's important for dollars. It's a $40 billion contract, with a ``b.'' That is a significant contract. But of more importance to Americans are the job and employment prospects, and obviously that's important in the aircraft industry. If we see what has happened recently in the last decade, we know why it's important to think about this issue. 
   If I can refer to a chart showing the decline in teal or blue, this shows United States aerospace industry employment from 1979 to 2007. We have suffered a very, very significant decline, just about 50 percent of employment jobs in the United States compared to what we had in 1983, a peak year. Now, that has corresponded with the rise of the Airbus aircraft deliveries that have gone up, as indicated in these red bars, pretty much every year since about 1979. So we have had a significant loss of employment in the United States already in our aerospace industry. It has been in sync with the rise of Airbus sales. And we respect competition in America and should not decry or shrink from competition, and we would congratulate Airbus in a legitimate competition in any of these sales. But we point this out to show that we have already suffered a significant decline of thousands of jobs in the United States. So now we have a situation where that loss will be exacerbated by this decision should it stand. 
   Now, what is at stake here potentially could be 44,000 American jobs. Predictions are in that range of jobs that would have been involved in this contract. We know that we get different stories about where the Airbus employment will be. I want to point out one of the curious things, if I can. We get certain different viewpoints about where the jobs would be if, in fact, this contract is ultimately granted to Airbus. I note a newspaper article here in Les Echos, and I may mispronounce that, in Europe when Airbus talked about the employment on this contract. The article says that 76 percent of the employment associated with this tanker contract would be European and only 21 percent would be combined United States and Canadian content. That's in the article as publicized in France. In the United States, the rather large public relations effort that has gone on through Airbus, in fact, says it will be 50 percent in the United States. So it appears, at least in one instance, Airbus suggests that only 21 percent of the product in this tanker will be in the United States, and in America they suggest it will be about 50 percent. Some could chalk that up to hyperbole, salesmanship, but it means tens of thousands of jobs to Americans across this country, not just in the Seattle area where I reside but contracts across this country. We think that's significant and it's unfortunate. So this is a very significant thing that we are here to talk about tonight. It's not only employment but it's capability as well. 
   So we are going to talk tonight about the ramifications of this decision, why we think it was inappropriately made, and what we may consider to reverse this decision. 
   And with that I would like to yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Tiahrt), who been a stalwart and a champion on educating our colleagues about the importance of this, something we are going to talk about tonight at some length, which is the favorable treatment of Airbus by the European governments and why this has skewed this particular contract.

   Mr. INSLEE. I want to point out about this cost. Even under the Air Force's own accounting, even with these what you may consider rigged accounting standards that Mr. Tiahrt talked about, even under the Air Force's accounting standards, they concluded that the 767 is about 24 percent more fuel efficient than the Airbus product. You're going to save massive amounts on fuel over the lifetime. In fact, the Air Force estimated the Airbus product will burn $30 billion more fuel over the lifetime, even under the rigged accounting standards. 
   So the point is that we need the Air Force from a taxpayer standpoint to be looking at the operational cost. We just had the executives of the five biggest oil companies today. Those oil prices are not going down any time soon. If anywhere, they are going up. 
   So this is why we are saying that the country, not just the place these planes are made, but the whole country has a stake in this to really look at the operational costs on that. 
   Thanks for yielding, Mr. Tiahrt.

   Mr. INSLEE. That's most disturbing because of that experience and because of reading that in France, they tell the French they are going to have 76 percent of the jobs in Europe. Then they come over in America and tell us they will maybe have 50 percent. This is one reason, just one of the reasons this contract has to be reviewed. 
   I want to mention one now just before I yield to Mr. Loebsack for a moment. There is another aspect of this that is outraging Americans, and certainly is in my State, and that is that we are issuing this $40 billion contract to a company that essentially one of the partners that the American Government itself says is acting illegally. Because according to our U.S. Trade Representative, who has initiated a legal action against these companies for receiving illegal subsidies, illegal subsidies that violate international law, and by extension, violate United States law, at the same time we have taken this almost unprecedented action to bring a case in the world courts, the World Trade Organization, against their illegal subsidies. That is one agency of the United States Government. Sort of the ``cop on the beat''  blowing the whistle. And at the same time, another agency, the Air Force of the United States Federal Government is bailing them out of jail and giving them a $40 billion contract. 
   That is hard to explain to any American, particularly those in the 300 companies around this country in 40 States that are going to be losing jobs as a result of this. If this isn't a case of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing, one hand attempting to sanction these illegal subsidies, and I think anybody who reviews this would conclude there would have been billions of dollars of illegal subsidies to Airbus over the years, we will talk about those in detail, and then to turn around and reward them with $40 billion. They ought to be receiving a sanction from America, a punishment from America, some type of slap on the wrist, at least. Instead, they get $40 billion of taxpayer money. This is wrong by any sense, the code of the West, international trade treaties. This is something we all ought to be united about. 
   With this, I would like to yield to Mr. Loebsack from the great State of Iowa, who has a concern about this.

   Mr. INSLEE. We thank the voice of Iowa. This is important across the country. The jobs that Mr. Loebsack is talking about losing would not have been lost if the Air Force had considered the fact that these companies are receiving these illegal subsidies. And it's not just we three Congressmen talking about it, it is the executive branch of the United States, which has fully evaluated this and come to the conclusion these were illegal subsidies. 
   These were not just small. They received $1.7 billion in launch aid to develop the new A-350. They received $3.7 billion in launch aid for the A-380. That is why our U.S. Trade Representative has started this enforcement action, blown the whistle on these illegal subsidies. Frankly, it has been years later than it should have been. But we have finally done it. It's one of these great sort of black comedies to think in the year period when we finally blew the whistle after all of these years of abuse of these illegal subsidies that disadvantage American workers, that that same year the Air Force ends up giving a contract for $40 billion. 
   These subsidies are not just an issue of dollars, they are jobs in Iowa as well. I want to thank Mr. Loebsack. I would like to yield to Mr. Tiahrt.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. We should point out that this law, this international law against subsidization, has not been waived by Congress. This is sort of a backdoor way to waive an international agreement. 
   We have an agreement that now we are attempting to enforce that would prohibit this illegal launching. ``Launching'' basically is a situation where a European government assists the private manufacturer, in this case Airbus, by giving them essentially loan guarantees or essentially free money. You give them a loan that they don't have to pay back if the airplane doesn't do well. That is an enormous subsidy, to give free capital, in essence, or low cost capital, when you are manufacturing an airplane. Of course, when you develop an airplane, there are billions of dollars in development costs. Well, if a company like Airbus can go to their governments in Europe and say give us a loan we don't have to repay if the airplane doesn't perform as expected, we don't make money on it, that is an enormous subsidy. 
   Europeans with Airbus have been doing this for years. We have international laws against that, and those laws are in effect national laws in America. But somehow it is just like we ignored these. It is like they didn't exist. 
   Congress certainly never waived those laws, the courts have never waived those laws, the President has never waived those laws, the American people have never waived those laws. But somehow the Air Force did not take into consideration these enormous subsidies, and that is why this thing, this contract, has an odor about it, where we don't take into consideration that violation of international and American law. 
   But I want to talk, if I can, about the capability of these aircraft too, because obviously we want the best possible airplane for the job. There is possibly no more critical infrastructure, certainly to our Air Force, than the ability to refuel our planes. This is the absolute spine of the whole skeleton of the Air Force, to have this refueling capability. 
   There has been sort of a propaganda war that has been waged by the Airbus folks to sort of suggest that the Boeing airplane wasn't up to the job, and I just want to point out some of the facts about this aircraft that I think it is important to realize. 
   First off, if you want to look at the only company in this bidding that has essentially ever built an air tanker and has been building them for 50 years for America, it is Boeing. This is the hometown team that has been doing it for decades successfully, and I think we should maybe start the discussion from that point. 
   Second, the airplane that Boeing bid has some very distinct advantages that somehow were not considered, one of which is that the Boeing airplane can service about twice as many airfields as the competitor. The reason is it can land in shorter, not quite as equipped airfields. It can land fully loaded in 811 airfields around the world, compared to the competitor at 408. This is a distinct advantage, considering we don't know why where the next conflict is going to be. We don't know what sort of developing world airfield we are going to use. The airplane that Boeing proposes can be serviced and can essentially use twice the number of airfields. 
   Second, and this is critically important, the Boeing 767 is 24 percent more fuel efficient. In these days of a crunch with fuel and global warming we have to be concerned with and the enormous increase in costs that the Air Force is experiencing, this ought to be taken into consideration. That adds up to $30 billion, a distinct advantage. 
   Third, and this is one that I think is worth mentioning, this sort of propaganda effort that was started by the Airbus folks to suggest that the Boeing Company didn't score well just simply doesn't comport with the facts. 
   There were several factors, the first of which is called mission capability. When they compete these, there is a very sophisticated way of evaluating these. On mission capability, the Boeing airplane scored blue, which means exceptional, and low risk in the area of mission capability. That is the highest possible rating and I think can be considered the most critical factor in the whole competition. The Air Force concluded that the Boeing airplane met or exceeded all key performance parameters, which are also called thresholds and objectives. The Air Force concluded that the Boeing product actually had significantly more strengths, also called discriminators, than the competitor. 
   So you had Boeing receiving the highest rating possible for mission capability, it met or exceeded all of what is called KPP thresholds and objectives, and it was graded as having significantly more strengths than the competition, and somehow came up on the short end of the stick. 
   This deserves not only GAO review, but it deserves Congress reviewing this. As folks know, this is being evaluated now under the protest consideration, and we know it will be looked at carefully. But, frankly, if this does not get the thorough review we want, Congress is going to be looking at this, because these numbers just don't add up to say this was the right decision. 
   On factor two, proposal risk, just kind of from a commonsense standpoint perhaps we can look at the fact that we have one bidder, Boeing, that has been doing this for decades. They have an airplane, the 767, in the air, providing tanker services, ready to go, against a product that is going to be manufactured in this multi-nation system. To me, that would create significant confidence in the folks that have been doing it and have a plane that is in the air. In fact, the Air Force rated Boeing's risk as low, as it should be. 
   Surprisingly, the competitor was also rated as low, despite to me obvious risk where you have a multi-country, multi-facility, multi-build approach, contrasted with Boeing's integrated approach to design, build and certify with the existing facilities. So, at worst it seems to me that there is certainly no advantage of the competitors in that regard. 
   I would like to yield to Mr. Tiahrt. I have several more factors, but I want to yield to Mr. Tiahrt because I 
   know he has a great idea.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Coming back, it is not just cost, it is capability. Bigger is not always better, and I am very concerned here that the Air Force has been lulled into the sense that bigger is always going to be better. 
   Frankly, when I found out that the Boeing tanker can serve in twice as many airfields, it can refuel the V-22, which is our tilt rotor aircraft, this aircraft they have can't refuel one of our aircraft, we are going with a company that has no boom experience, they have never built an airplane commercially with a boom. 
   We have decided to reject a company, Boeing, that delivered a 767 to Japan, one February 19, 2008, a second one March 5, 2008, they are flying, they are in the air, they are a known quantity. And we are taking this risk, an uncertain risk, just for this apparent decision that all of a sudden bigger became better, which is very interesting, because Boeing could have competed a larger airplane, an airframe of the Boeing 777, and didn't, essentially because they understood that this was a satisfactory size component to deliver. 
   It made sense when Boeing made that decision and when Air Force led them to that decision, because when you look at the loading, the range of loading and what it has done historically, the Boeing 767 is a perfect fit. If you look at the offloading potential, the Boeing 767 is significantly greater than the average offloading in any of either the Vietnam, the Iraqi Freedom or the Southwest Asia conflicts. 
   So we are concerned that this decision of this deciding bigger was better was, A, not fair to a bidder, Boeing, which was not told that that apparently was now the Air Force's brand new criteria; B, exposes American taxpayers to greater risk with an uncertain contractor, with an uncertain plan in multiple locations; C, causes significant loss of jobs; and, D, violates international law, or at least awards folks who are receiving illegal subsidies violating international law. 
   This is not a good thing for the American warfighter, the American taxpayer or the American worker, and that is why we are here tonight suggesting that this contract has to be redone one way or another, and we are going to be talking about ways to do that.

   Mr. INSLEE. And I hope we don't have to vote. I hope this protest is successful. But we will be looking at the  right ways for Congress to exercise the will of the American people through the appropriation or authorization process. And the reason we intend to do that is that we think there were several mistakes made in this contract that essentially resulted in the Air Force selecting a larger, more expensive, and more operationally limited tanker, despite the fact that the domestic Boeing tanker met the requirements of the Air Force. 
   So, we intend to go forward. We hope that our colleagues will join us in this effort. It is the right thing to do. It may take some time to do, we regret that, but America deserves this and deserves better than what happened here.

   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, we come here to the well tonight to continue this discussion about energy. I have enjoyed listening to my colleagues Mr. Bartlett and Mr. Gilchrest, who have been talking about the need for changes in our energy policy to effectuate an energy efficiency policy for this country, to use our innovative talents to come up with new technologies to deal with our energy challenges, and to really bring our energy policy from the 19st century into the 21st century. And the good news is tomorrow, Thursday of this week, in just the third week of the 110th Congress, this new Congress is going to start with a big step out of the 19th century, which has been represented by the last Congress, and into the 21st century, which is represented by this Congress, and I am pleased to report to the House tonight and to the country, tomorrow the Democratic majority with some help from some of our friends across the aisle will pass a bill which will cause a major shift in the energy policy of this country. 
   In the last Congress there was a clear direction of the energy policy of this country, and under the last management of the U.S. Congress the basic operative rule was to give billions of dollars of taxpayer money to the oil and gas industry, the most profitable industry in the history of the solar system, over $10 billion in tax breaks to the oil and gas industry. Tomorrow, that money will be returned to the citizens of the United States for the use in developing a truly 21st century energy plan. 
   Tomorrow, the Democratic majority held Congress or House of Representatives will pass a bill which will reel back in $14 billion of taxpayer money that was sent to the silk-lined pockets of the oil and gas industry, and that is a good thing for Republicans and Democrats and Independents and for our grandchildren for reasons we will talk about tonight. It is a good reason because when we reel that $14 billion in giveaways to the oil and gas industry that happened in the last Congress, what we will do tomorrow is take that $14 billion and create a fund of money belonging to the American people that will be used for the development of new technologies, creative new sources of energy, energy efficiencies, more efficient vehicles, more efficient appliances, and a way to beat global warming. 
   So we are going to convert the giveaways from the oil and gas industry that happened in the last Congress to an investment in the future of our country to have a new energy technology, technologically based future for the energy source of this country. We are going to do it for three reasons. And perhaps those three reasons are obvious, but I want to state them. 
   Tomorrow when we pass this bill, we will create a fund called the Strategic Renewable Energy Reserve. Not really much of an acronym; I didn't get to name it. But the Strategic Renewable Energy Reserve will be a fund with $14 billion that will be taken back from the oil and gas industry and be used for our inventors, our businessmen, our academicians, our people who are doing great work to develop new sources of energy, and we will do this for three reasons. I will go through them quickly. 
   Number one, we will use this fund to develop a domestic source of energy for this country. We will use this money to develop the new advanced biofuels, the second generation ethanol, the cellulosic ethanol, the advanced biodiesel systems so that we can start buying our fuel from Midwestern farmers rather than Middle Eastern sheiks. We know the trouble we are in in the Middle East due to our dependence on Middle Eastern oil, and we are going to break that oil addiction, not rhetorically, but in reality. 
   Second, we are going to use these funds to develop new clean energy sources that can stop global warming. We are going to have energy efficiency which can have efficient appliances rather than dirty appliances that waste energy. We are going to have energy efficient cars, plug-in hybrids, flex fuel vehicles that can use biofuels developed in the Midwest; energy created by wind turbine, solar energy and perhaps clean coal, wave power. You name it.  We have a thousand flowers that are going to bloom in energy if we use this money in a smart way to stop global warming. 
   And, third, we will use this money to create a new energy source of jobs in this country. It is about time to start building fuel efficient cars in this country, new technologies here. It is time to reel those jobs back in. 
   So I am very excited what will happen tomorrow. It is the first step in a long road of what we will talk about tonight, the new Apollo Energy Project. And we have a new Member of the U.S. House who has brought a new vision of energy, Mr. John Hall of New York. And I will yield to Mr. Hall.

   Mr. INSLEE. If the gentleman will yield. Very much so, it is claiming what should be rightfully ours. We essentially gave away oil that belongs to the citizens of the United States, and gave it away with no royalties. It was a giant, giant giveaway program. And subsidies in certain circumstances are appropriate for nascent growing industries, but this is a mature industry. There was no reason to give a company that made $20 billion profit last year more of our taxpayers. You are paying twice when that happens. You are paying at the pump, and then you are paying on April 15 when you are paying taxes that are given to these oil and gas companies. 
   I want to just touch on your wind sample. Today I had the Director of the Bonneville Power Administration that runs the electrical grid in the Northwest today, and he was telling me that wind power today is cheaper, cheaper than essentially any other system that we have to generate electricity, at least in the Pacific Northwest, cheaper than coal even.     
   For those that say wind cannot be an integral part of the system, a study came down from a Minnesota group last week which evaluated how one can integrate wind because the wind does not always blow. It is not a totally reliable system, so you have to integrate it into your system. 
   They concluded it is so cheap you can integrate it by having backup gas turbines sometimes to kick in if the wind doesn't blow with minimal to no increases in prices. 
   This revolution that is happening in energy that we will start tomorrow, sort of the Concord Bridge moment for the energy revolution here, is all over the country. You mentioned in your neck of the woods, it is not just the Midwest, in Washington State we are going to have the biggest biodiesel plant in the Western hemisphere. It is going to be up and running next year. 
   Minnesota has huge growth in wind power. Wisconsin has a company that is building wind turbines so fast they cannot fulfill the orders. Missouri has just started three huge wind farms. This is something all over the country. 
   When I talk to businesses, what I find is there is not a State in the country that does not have some business that is going to benefit from what we will start tomorrow, which is new energy revolution. California in Silicon Valley is developing these new solar cells that could be 30-40 percent less expensive. A company called Fiber Forge in Colorado is starting to make composite bodies for cars that could be 40 percent stronger and half the weight. This is a national effort. All of us will get to brag about it some day. 
   I would like to yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Klein), a new Member of Congress. Thanks for joining us.

   You talked about the original Apollo project. We have named our bill, the first step we will talk about tomorrow, the New Apollo Energy Project because we believe, as John F. Kennedy did, that we have unlimited innovative capacity. But what we don't have at the moment are policies to put that innovative genius to work. 
   For instance, we are spending less than 16 percent on energy research in total in this country. We are only spending 16 percent of what we spent on the Apollo project. That is just abysmal. We had at least as much of a challenge as trying to get to the Moon. 
   I had a utility executive in my office today. He told me this factoid: We spend more on research about dog food than the utility industry does on new energy in this country. I don't want to belittle dog food, it is important, but we need to boost our research. Tomorrow we will put $14 billion back into the pockets of Americans to use in part for research, the tremendous things that are going on. Every time I pick up the phone, I learn about a new technology being developed.

   Mr. INSLEE. There is so much good work going in to stop those things that you are talking about. To mention two instances of success on energy efficiency, I was talking to the Vice President of Dow Chemical yesterday. Dow Chemical historically has not been looked at as a company on the forefront on environmental issues, but they got a star last year for their energy efficiency program. 
   They have saved 42 percent of their energy since 1990. They have reduced their energy since 2000 by 22 percent by just adopting commonsense measures, some of which you might have talked about, by having energy efficient appliances and lighting, by looking at how they monitor the energy in their building. So a 42 percent reduction of their energy usage, and they did that because it is good business, not because it is some granola-crunching idea. They did it because it is good business. And we will create a fund tomorrow to help businesses and individuals go down that road. 
   Second accomplishment, California. California has essentially, while the average American uses 50 percent more electricity than they did 10 years ago, 50 percent, California has been stable for the last 10 years. They have not gone up one kilowatt hour. And the way they did that was to help people invest in energy efficient light bulbs, energy efficient windows and appliances. As a result, they use 8,000 kilowatt hours per person per year, and the average person uses 14,000 kilowatts. 
   Does that mean people in California are living in the stone age? They are still taking hot tubs in Marin County and still putting out movies in Hollywood. They are living a good life there, and their economy is booming. But they are doing some commonsense things with energy. That is what we are going to start tomorrow.

   Mr. INSLEE. We had a meeting with Hank Paulson today, Secretary of the Treasury in the Bush administration, and he had made an interesting comment. I am very impressed with him, though I have been pretty critical of the Bush administration, because he has been a pretty outspoken advocate that we need to do something about global warning. 
   He said everything he has learned since taking the job as Secretary of the Treasury, he comes from a very successful Wall Street career, has been worse than he thought. The deficit, the situation in Iraq, everything he has learned has been worse than he thought, except energy, because he has learned about the new innovations going on around the country. 
   What we want to do is help businesses, like the Iogen Corporation, which is ready to build the first commercial cellulosic plant in America in Idaho. They are ready to go, as long as they can get their loan guaranty. They have 300 farmers that are going to give them their straw left over after wheat. They are going to chop it up, put an enzyme in it, and then free the carbohydrates and distill that into ethanol, and, boom, you have a product that is three to four times more productive per acre than the current type of ethanol we get from our farms. 
   Ocean Wave Technologies has the first permit for wave power in the United States off the coast of Oregon, a 50 megawatt plant. They are using a technology now that is in the water in Hawaii, generating technology with this buoy that is anchored below the water. It goes up and down and creates a force thoromatically that runs a generator. They are generating electricity today for the Navy. They are ready to make this a commercial operation. They need a little help to get started. 
   The Nanosolar Company, a company that was started, and the fellows who wrote the first two checks were the two guys who started Google. They have done pretty well for themselves, and they wrote a check to a couple of entrepreneurs in California, and now they are ready to do 450 megawatts of thin cell solar, where you use a solar panel that has one-fiftieth the width, using a selenium, iridium, gallium and caesium type of technology that they think can be 30 or 40 percent cheaper. 
   Another company trying something like this is called Miasole. 
   These are the companies that need help, not the big oil companies. And what we are doing tomorrow is shifting the subsidies that have been given away to the oil industry, an 18th century technology, and helping these new-generation technologies come on. 
   By the way, in this debate we are the optimists. We should identify who is on what side of this. We are the optimists who believe global warming can be dealt with. The pessimists say we can't. 
   Now, they are giving up. The debate about global warming is over. And I know it is over because yesterday the Exxon Corporation, which has fought tooth and nail the science on global warming, basically withdrew their support from the political organization that has tried to create doubt about global warming. 
   So when the Exxon Corporation agrees it is time to start getting serious about global warming, I think the debate is over. And now the question is, how can we join on a bipartisan basis to find solutions, and we are starting this tomorrow. I hope we draw some votes from some of our colleagues across the aisle. 
   I yield to Mr. Hall.

   Mr. INSLEE. I want to comment that some people have argued this is sort of peripheral or tangential sources of energy, niche types of energy. I think it is important to realize the scale of energy that we have available domestically. It is enormous. 
   When you talk to the scientists about this, the wave power in a 10-mile-by-10-mile stretch of the California coastline, that is 100 square miles, if you can imagine 10-by-10, there is enough wave power using this existing technology to generate all of the electricity used in the State of California. That is not hypothetical. That is actual wave power that is available. That is not a niche technology. 
   In Montana, if we can a find way to burn coal cleanly, and I say if because we are a long ways from being able to do that, to segregate and store the carbon dioxide below ground, but there is enough coal in Montana, just Montana, if we can find a way to do that, to power the electricity needs of the entire Nation for decades. 
   Just to give people a sense of the scale of this, with solar energy, in a few hundred square miles, there is enough to light the entire Nation, if we get solar power down to a market-based price. It is more expensive than electricity right now from a coal plant or a gas-powered plant. 
   But what we are learning is that for all the technologies we have talked about today, solar, wind, wave, efficiencies, where some day plug-in hybrids, plug our cars in and run on clean electricity, every single one of those technologies has come down in price dramatically as the technologies have improved and as we have scales of economy. 
   Wind power has come down in price 80 percent in the 
   last decade. Solar is coming down. There is a factor basically every time, if I get this right, every time it goes up, and I am going to have to check to make sure. In fact, I will not use it because I can't remember what it was, but there is a ratio that has been clear with solar power that has come down. Every time you ramp up production by a factor of X, you get a Y percentage decrease in price, and that has been a constant. 
   What we have learned is that we know there are two curves. Fossil fuels are going up because China is coming on gangbusters and demand is going to go up. We might reach peak oil. We don't know. But we know fossil fuels are going up long term, and these are coming down, and we want to be on the downward sloping path. 
   So one of the things we want to do eventually, in our new Apollo project, is to have a renewable portfolio standard to say that a percentage of our electricity will be generated by clean energy sources by the year 2020. We just did this in Washington by popular vote. 
   I yield to Mr. Kline.

   Mr. INSLEE. I want to comment on two really exciting transportation alternatives. One is public transportation. 
   The city of Portland, Oregon, has demonstrated the ability of America to reduce our CO  
   2 emissions to deal with global warming. They are the first city in the Nation to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels, which would be consistent with the Kyoto Treaty, which may be a treaty we do or do not eventually adopt, but they have been the first city in the Nation to reach these 1990 levels, to roll back their carbon dioxide emissions. 
   One of the principal ways they did it was they embraced an incredibly popular light rail system to move people. Rather than sitting on freeways for hours at a time, you go down to Portland on a convenient, much-loved system that has now been voted on five times successfully in Portland because people love this system. It is convenient, it is safe, it is cheap, and it saves us from global warming. 
   So if we have a transportation policy in this country that helps communities work in that regard, we will make some strides. 
   The second thing I want to bring up is a technology called plug-in hybrids, which I think could be maybe the ultimate vision for us in the next decade, and that is to develop our cars so we go home at night and we plug them in. You take power off the grid, electricity generated by clean wind, clean solar, clean wave, clean coal, or a variety of technologies. These are cars that today are running, that can run 20 or 30 miles just on electricity. And then when you run out of juice, you start running on your motor. 
   If we have a flex-fuel hybrid plug-in car, we are going to be in really great shape in this country, because we can plug it in and get clean electricity. We have the pipes to deliver it, which is the electricity grid. You plug it in at night, you run your first 20 or 30 miles, then you use ethanol that you bought from our local farmer in the Northeast, or in Iowa, or eastern Washington. And if you don't like that, you can burn gasoline as well. 
   General Motors just announced their first sort of proposed car, called the Volt. They ran it out at their show just 2 weeks ago in Detroit at the auto show. Now, we have to improve the batteries to really make them commercialized, but that is where our money should be going, to improving the batteries so we can have plug-in vehicles, rather than going to the oil and gas industry. 
   So tomorrow we are going to make a decision to take money we gave to the oil and gas industry and give it to these companies, to the extent we can, to help develop these new technologies for batteries and a whole host of other things. These are lithium iod batteries, and they are close to being commercialized. There are a few security issues they have to work with to make sure they are stable and workable, but that is a good shift for the country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Sure. And we can do things essentially at no cost to the Federal Government. For instance, loan guarantees. If we guarantee a company that wants to start a plant, like this Iogen cellulosic ethanol plant, if we do a loan guarantee for them, there is a high level of confidence it is going to work, and it never costs us a dime, assuming that it works. But it helps them get the capital to give security for the investors to do that. 
   That is a good investment for the country, if we choose wisely. But these companies will tell you they have to cross the valley of death, to get from development, where they have their prototype, until they can really commercialize it. And that is where Uncle Sam can happen. 
   And we will get a lot more bang for our buck helping a battery company that will help us drive plug-in hybrids a few years from now than we will just giving it to a company that made $22 billion last year in the oil and gas markets.     
   That is a better deal for America. Mr. Hall.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. And I think it is important to point out the tremendous payback to our economy of relatively small Federal investments. Look at the computer industry. It grew by leaps and bounds because of the Apollo project. There is more computing power now on a wrist watch than there was in the original Apollo space vehicle because we developed computer based software systems as part of the Apollo project. 
   Our medical device industry with these exotic materials largely came from the American space program, and these were relatively small investments. 
   By the way, we spend less today on research and energy than we do in a month in Iraq by a factor of about 10, just to put this in perspective. We are talking about for a family's budget a lot of money, but for the Federal budget fairly small amounts of money that can have absolutely tremendous payoffs. 
   I want to talk about one other thing that we think we need to help these companies too, though. If you want to start a company that will generate clean electricity with no carbon dioxide emissions today, you don't have a huge advantage because of a loophole in the law that a coal company has right now that is putting their carbon dioxide up the stack. That coal company that has what we call dirty coal, where you just burn it and you put your carbon dioxide, you dump it into the atmosphere, they have a huge loophole in the law because they can put as much CO  
   2 into the air as they want the tape. They can't put as much sulfur dioxide, they can't put as much nitrogen oxide, they can't put as much particulate matter, but they can put as much CO 
   2 into our atmosphere that you and I own jointly, with no charge. And the company that is going to make a clean industry, they don't get any benefit like that. We have to close that loophole. There has to be a way that there is some charge imposed on polluters who use our atmosphere to dump their carbon dioxide. And that is a loophole that needs to be closed to help these innovators as well to level the playing field. 
   Now it is really interesting. We are getting some support for this idea from some unusual sources. Duke Energy, I think, the third or fourth largest electrical utility in the United States, they burn massive amounts of coal, I think 40 or 50 percent or more of their electricity is produced by coal. But they recognize the need to have what they call a cap and trade system that caps the amount of carbon dioxide going into the atmosphere. And in part they realize that, I think, because when you impose some cost on this pollution it inspires these new companies to be able to create new technologies that are clean. So we hope ultimately the U.S. Congress will adopt a measure that will level the playing field and not allow these dirty plants to continue to pollute our atmosphere for nothing. You know, when you and I go to the dump it costs us 25 bucks to dump our pickup load of junk at the dump. But a company that burns coal can put their carbon dioxide and just dump it into our atmosphere, gigatons for nothing. That needs to change

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. And what we are finding is that more and more companies are actually accepting this idea, thinking it is a good idea because one, it will drive innovation. It will help us invent new technologies. But second, they realize this works. What we are talking about is a thing called a cap and trade  system. We cap the amount of carbon dioxide that can go into the air and we allow polluting companies to bid and trade for the right to put that pollution in. It is the most economically efficient way to do it. And what the companies have discovered is that when we do this, it works. When we did with sulfur dioxide in the 1980s it cleaned up the air and it actually ended up helping the economy.

   Mr. INSLEE. It created jobs in creating these scrubbers. It helped our health and it actually, if anything, increased the gross domestic product. So what we are seeing is that some of these visionary companies are embracing this idea and it makes sense. 
   Today when I was talking to the Treasury Secretary, Mr. Paulson, I said, you know if we don't do this we are 
   going to be wasting a lot of money. The Bush administration has supported a program, basically, it is a combined cycle way of using coal that you can make into hydrogen and sequester the carbon dioxide. It is called ``future gen.'' We are going to have a future way of generating coal based electricity. And I think it is a good idea to invest in that type of research to see if we can burn coal, take the carbon dioxide, stick it in the ground forever and we will have clean electricity. But the Bush administration is spending $750 million of taxpayer money to do that. But the plant will never, ever, ever be used or built if the Bush administration's policies succeed because they don't want to have any charge for carbon dioxide, any regulation on the amount of carbon dioxide going into the air. Well, if you are a coal company and you have got to invest money in this future gen program but you can put your carbon dioxide in the air for free, are you ever going to build this kind of machine that President Bush wants to build? It doesn't make any sense. So if we are going to do research in this new technology, it only makes sense also to have some regulation in the amount of carbon dioxide that goes into the atmosphere. Otherwise these technologies will be developed and never used. And that is not our goal, Mr. Hall.

   Mr. INSLEE. I really appreciate your comment. A couple of comments, first off, about the value of business, big, little, medium, small, all sizes. There are so many companies today that are leading this revolution that we want to assist them. DuPont has done tremendous work on energy efficiency. 3M has done tremendous work on energy efficiency. British Petroleum, an oil and gas company, internally, because of their great leadership, reduced their own carbon dioxide emissions down to 1990 levels. They thought it was going to take them 5 years. It took them 3 years. And they saved $300 million in energy because of doing just exactly what Mr. Hall is talking about of energy conservation. This is a green policy in two ways. Green environmentally and green for profit, and red, white and blue for America. So we have a lot of colors working for this policy. 
   I want to mention one other thing about our auto industry. We need our auto industry to give consumers cars that we can drive to use multiple fuels. Right now we are all kind of slaves to gasoline. We don't really have a choice. We need cars that will burn gasoline or ethanol, like they have in Brazil. The cars in Brazil drive, almost all of them burn either gasoline or ethanol. And because of that Brazil is energy independent today because they are growing their own ethanol, which we can do in this country. But we need the auto industry to give us this choice, to give us cars that can burn gasoline or ethanol. Now you can make a car for about $85 that does that. That is all it costs. Almost nothing. That is what is costs to put tint in your glass. But we need the industry to do that. And you know, Congress may need to act, and I think it does need to act to get the industry to agree to do that rapidly. The second thing we need is these oil and gas companies to agree to put pumps in that will be ethanol pumps or biodiesel pumps.     
   That is not happening, because, unfortunately, those companies kind of only are selling gas right now, not biofuels. So we need to act to give consumers that ability to have at least a small percentage in the number of service stations that are going to give us that choice.

   Mr. INSLEE. We know this can be done because in the 1970s and early 1980s we increased our gas mileage by 60 percent in 8 years. If we had simply continued on that path with the same rate of improvement, we would be free of Saudi Arabian oil today. We need to get back on that path of energy efficiency. We can do that. We can start tomorrow. It will be a good day for energy revolution tomorrow. I am looking forward to it.

   Mr. INSLEE. I want to thank Chairman Skelton for his help. A couple of amendments, one en bloc, will help advance the cause of efficiency and environmental responsibility. In this amendment we have an amendment that will encourage the DOD to look at systems to save energy in their computer networks. We have the ability to reduce our electric usage 20 to 30 percent. That helps us in our load growth. 
   It's a great amendment. I want to thank the Chair. Later today we will have an amendment that will assist the service to move forward to judge our global warming emissions as well, and our procurement policy. A great thing for the environment, great thing for the service as part of our universal effort to advance several causes.

   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor this evening on truly what is a historic day, the beginning of this Congress. Historic, I will mention two reasons: One, the first woman Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, something that certainly has caused a lot of joy here and across the country and it is something worthy of noting. But a second historic event arises from Speaker Pelosi's first address as Speaker of the House today that I think marks a pivotal moment in our future of the country when it comes to our energy policy. 
   Speaker Pelosi today, in some of her very first comments, made a commitment to the country that our Nation would start a titanic and historic shift from old technologies associated with fossil fuels that are now putting massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and towards the use of new technologies that can produce our mode of power for our cars and our planes and our buses and our homes and our computers, and even our hair dryers in a way that does not contribute to global warming. And this is her commitment and her very first comment, I think it was telling, that this House will pass a measure in very short order, in the next several weeks, that will shift a huge amount of our national resources away from work in these fossil fuels that are now contributing to global warming and put that money into a fund that will be dedicated to the use of new high-technological energy sources that can free us from Middle Eastern oil, create jobs in our country, and stop global warming. 
   This is certainly a three-fer. And the way that she has made a commitment that this House will do is that we basically will repeal some of the less prudent activities of the former Congress that gave $7 billion of taxpayer money to the oil and gas industry, a very imprudent move, an industry that is in tip-top form financially, making profits hand over fist, the most profitable corporation in American history, indeed, world history. And yet the last Congress saw fit to give billions of dollars of tax relief to these organizations. 
   And these organizations are good organizations. They have good people in them. But there was no reason to give that money away when it has higher purpose. And that higher purpose that Speaker Pelosi talked about today is  to take those billions of dollars, those tax goodies given away to these corporations, repeal those giveaways and shift that money, shift those public resources, into a pool of funds that will be used to develop new high-tech, clean energy sources that we can go forward to build energy independence and reduce our contributions of carbon dioxide and other gases that are contributing to global warming. And I think this is a fundamental shift in American history. 
   We have had a steam revolution starting with American ingenuity, with Fulton and others. We had an industrial revolution led by American inventors, Ford and others. We have had an IT revolution led by many people in the software business. Many of them in my district in North Seattle and Redmond, Washington. 
   And now we are heading into a fourth revolution in the industrial base of America, and that is an energy revolution, where we make a transition from dirty fuels to clean fuels, many of which we will talk about tonight, and we will do it in a smart, prudent, fiscally sound way of using funds that are being wasted essentially on these old dirty technologies and shift them over, starting today with Speaker Pelosi's wise comments, towards these new technologies. 
   And in doing so, we will use the most fundamental character of Americans, which is technological brilliance, innovation, creativity, tinkering. We are the greatest tinkerers and inventors, not speaking personally but our country, in human history. And now starting today, we are taking the first step what I call the road down to new Apollo. We had the first Apollo project with John F. Kennedy where we went to the moon. 
   Today, with Speaker Pelosi's comments, we took the first step on the road to a new Apollo clean energy future for this country to move these resources into a clean energy future. And I am very excited about it because it will build upon the scientific prowess of America. 
   I would like to yield now to one of the Members of Congress who is a leader in the scientific community, a physicist with a history at Princeton, who personifies what science can do for this country, who has been a leader on these clean energy issues, for some comments on this issue, Rush Holt of New Jersey.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. We want to turn to the things that can be done, because one of the messages of the new Apollo Project is that we have a clear path to use technology to solve this problem. But before we launch into a discussion now, I just wanted to note three conversations on this issue about global warming I have had in the last two weeks, that I want to note about why this is so compelling to have new energy. 
   The first conversation I had last week was with a woman who was a leader in the first city in the United States that is being relocated as a result of global warming. That is the village of Shishmaref in Alaska; it is on the Arctic coast of Alaska. This woman told me that last week the city voted to move their city, I think it is about 13 miles off of a coastal barrier island, that is disappearing because sea levels are rising, the tundra is melting, and the ice that serves as a barrier protecting their village is melting, and their island is disappearing, right literally underneath them. 
   They are having to move their whole city at a cost of $150 million, onto an inland area, that is Shishmaref, Alaska. When we have to start moving cities in this country to start dealing with global warming, it is time to have a new energy policy. 
   Second, I had a conversation with the president of the Marshall Islands. It is an independent nation in the South Pacific of 60,000 people. The president of the Marshall Islands told me that they are in an emergency situation because of the rising seas and the increasing frequency of big storms which are literally overtopping their islands, which are just a few feet. They are built on coral reefs. Their coral reefs are dying because the oceans are becoming warmer and more acidic due to global warming. We have a whole country that may go under water as a result of global warming. 
   The third conversation I had last week was with a woman who was a climatologist, I may have butchered that word, meteorologist. She is an expert on the Arctic, basically. The University of Washington just published a study that said with a fairly high degree of probability the Arctic ice pack will have disappeared in months of September, disappeared with just marginal little bits of it hanging on to the coastline by the year 2050, with all of the changes that portends, including the disappearance of the polar bear, that even the current administration under George Bush agrees should be listed as a threatened species because the Arctic ice is going to disappear. 
   I just note these because since Mr. Holt and I last discussed this in the last Congress 2 months ago, these three changes have taken place. This is a dramatically rapidly changing climate we have that demands an answer to energy policy. 
   So I just want to set the urgency for taking steps, the first step.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. That point of being able to sell American technology to the world, I want to mention two companies, their CEOs I have talked to in the last month. One I talked to this morning is called Greenpoint Energy. It is a company in Boston that has developed a way to take coal and to process it into natural gas, then burn the natural gas in a way that eliminates the mercury emissions that typically come out of a coal stack, eliminates the sulfur dioxide that comes out of a smokestack and most importantly reduces carbon dioxide, the global warming gas by 60 to 65 percent. 
   Now, when I asked this young entrepreneur, who formerly did very well in the software industry, and is now into energy, what he saw as the future of this, he said it is unlimited. The reason it is unlimited is that we can take this technology that we build here, we can build these plants and sell them to China. 
   China is building one dirty coal plant a week, a 500-megawatt coal plant a week in China, which is creating massive CO  
   2 contributing to global warming gas. Here is a company right now, they have got 25 employees right now, and 20 subcontractors, they can have thousands at some point when we start selling this technology to the Chinese. 
   Another company called Nanosolar in Silicon Valley, California, they developed a way to make a solar cell 
   using a thin cell material that can increase the efficiency, or at least decrease the cost at least by 40 to 50 percent of solar energy, using a thin cell that is about 5 percent of the current thickness of a silicone-based solar cell. They want to sell this technology when we develop it. We have the first 450-megawatt capacity plant they are building right now, as we speak tonight. They want to start selling these around the world. 
   So here is a tremendous opportunity for America to reverse our balance-of-payments problem and start selling things to the world rather than buying them.

   Mr. INSLEE. You mentioned transportation. I just want to note what I consider to be a very exciting development in the last 7 days in this country in transportation. I want to yield to a real leader in there, Mr. Blumenauer. 
   But when it comes to cars, we have not improved the efficiency of our cars in 25 years. We get less mileage today in our cars than we did 25 years ago. But in the last 30 days something very dramatic happened in the auto industry. 
   General Motors announced that they were going to start developing a plug-in vehicle in the next 5 years where you can go home at night, plug in your car, charge your batteries off your electrical grid from one to two cents, effectively, a mile, you are now spending ten to fifteen. For one to two cents a mile off the grid, you can run your car for, we hope, for the first 20 miles. Then after you run out of juice, if you drive more than 20 miles, and 60 percent of our trips a day are less than 20 miles, but if you go more than 20 miles then you start burning either the gas or the ethanol that you got from corn and soybeans and rye grass. You have a flex-fuel vehicle, you plug it in at night, you are off to the races. That is the first thing. 
   The second thing is the Department of Energy last week issued a study which concluded that there is enough energy-generating capacity in the United States, excuse me, it was a Pacific Northwest laboratory out in Washington State, actually, an arm of the Department of Energy. They concluded there was enough electrical generating capacity today to fuel 85 percent of our cars and trucks using a plug-in battery system and not build a single new generating plant. 
   In other words, we could fuel 85 percent of all of our cars once we get a plug-in battery system developed without building a single new dirty plant coal or even a clean coal, for that matter, because you have all of this excess capacity at night that is sitting there that we don't use. We have all these plants that just sit there unused at night. We can use them to charge our cars. These are two very exciting developments using home-grown technology if Congress acts to move these subsidies away from the oil and gas industry, as Speaker Pelosi pledged to do today, and move them into support for these new businesses and consumers to get the new end higher energy. 
   I want to yield to Mr. EARL BLUMENAUER, who has been a real leader in trying to bring transportation, particularly public transit which is a very, very effective way of reducing our pollution and making our transportation more efficient.

   Mr. INSLEE. I would like to point out a shining example of what Mr. Holt is talking about, and that is in Portland, Oregon, in part, because of the leadership of Mr. Blumenauer, Portland, Oregon achieved two very significant milestones in the last year. First, it was the first city ever to essentially meet the Kyoto targets for reduction of carbon dioxide. This proves it can be done. 
   A smart transportation policy and a smart energy policy can be both good for your economy and meet these targets to reduce carbon dioxide. Portland, Oregon has achieved that, and one of the reasons is because of their second accomplishment, the first city in the last 30 years in America, has had less miles driven per individual in the last several decades. It is the first city that has ever accomplished that by developing a very sophisticated public transportation system and developing a living system that can reduce the need for some of our long commutes. And I want to point out Portland's success on this has been an enormous benefit to its economy, because Portland, Oregon's economy has been booming. The value of property has been booming as a result of these smart energy choices it has made, and people want to live there. And it is because of some of the smart choices that have been made in order to use energy more efficiently.

   Mr. INSLEE. If I can allude to a choice, another sort of choice, I think that is a very fundamental principle that we want to give people choices in their uses of energy. But I want to allude to a choice, if you do decide to drive a car, what kind of fuel you use. And it is a Democratic Party principle now under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi that Americans are going to have more choices about what fuel you use because as part of our effort to move money away from this giveaway to the oil and gas industry that have enslaved Americans, you are a slave to the oil and gas industry if you have got a car right now, to move it over to give more fuel choices to Americans. We intend to develop a vision for this country that you have the same freedom that Brazilians have, because in Brazil today when you pull up to the pump you are not a slave to the oil and gas industry, you are the boss because when you pull up to a pump in Brazil you decide whether you want gasoline or whether you want domestically manufactured ethanol made from sugar cane in Brazil and soon to be made through cellulosic ethanol, through corn and wheat and corn stovers and switch grass and who knows what kind of products we are going to develop so that consumers can decide what product they are going to put into the tank. And when we do that, we are going to create thousands of jobs across the country, particularly in the agricultural belt. 
   I got an e-mail just as I was walking over here tonight about a little article about a company in Wisconsin that are building sort of the foundations for wind turbines. They can't hire people fast enough. Right down the road, at the Chippewa Valley co-op they are brewing ethanol in Minnesota to give people a choice to put ethanol in their tank rather than gasoline, and they have created source of jobs in this little town in Minnesota that was sort of a declining town at the time. We want to give choices to people. 
   And we have another leader here tonight on those issues, Representative Kaptur from the great State of Ohio, that has been a leader in an effort to make a transition from just an oil and gas economy to one based on biofuels. And I have to tell you that I am very excited about this because I have been talking to scientists who tell me that we now have the possibility of having two to four times more bio fuels per acre than we even have today, and with our corn usage today that is certainly being successful with a consequent reduction of carbon dioxide that Representative Kaptur can tell us about. I would like to yield to Representative Kaptur.

We know the State of Ohio is going to do some great work on energy under the leadership of the new governor, Ted Strickland, who is committed to this agenda. And he would have been here tonight, but he is serving as governor, or will be in about a week. 
   I want to make two comments on the transition to a biofuels economy in the United States. First off, some people have said, well, we should not use fiber or plants for fuel. We have to use it only for food. I want to point out the fallacy of that argument. Right now we  are exporting an enormous percentage of the foodstuffs we grow. We send it around the world and they send us the cash. What do we do? We take the cash and send it to Saudi Arabia. 
   Let us cut out the middleman. Let us grow our own. This is time to grow our own. We are sending it all over the world and then sending the cash to Ridya and Saudi Arabia. Let us keep it right here. Let us grow our own fuel. 
   By the way, this is no pie in the sky. The Department of Agriculture has concluded we could have 30 percent of our fuel easily in the next 20 years, easily, using very conservative efforts. This is a very achievable goal. 
   The second point I want to make is that this may happen eventually without Congress's help, but it will be too late. Brazil took 30 years to make this transition to an energy independent condition using their biofuels. They use sugar cane there. They took 30 years. We do not have 30 years to wait. We have a problem with al-Qaeda tonight, we have trouble with global climate change tonight, and we have trouble with a loss of a manufacturing base in America tonight. We do not have 30 years. So we need to act and we need to do some things that the past Congresses and the current administration have not done. 
   Let me just mention three of them. Number one, they have not given loan guarantee assistance to get some of these plants going. The first cellulosic plant in the world, commercial cellulosic plant in the world is a company called Iogen. They are ready to build a plant. They have contracts with 300 farmers to grow a plant using the leavings of wheat to use cellulosic ethanol in Idaho, but they can not get the loan guarantee to get the job done. 
   We want to get that job done and get that plant up and running in Idaho. And this is going to be three or four more times effective per acre with increasing profits to farmers as a consequence. 
   Second, to give Americans this freedom to choose what fuel to use, they have to have cars that burn both gasoline and ethanol and, frankly, the industry has not been willing to do that. So we need to have some requirement to make sure that they make cars that burn gasoline or ethanol. They make a car for less than $100 to burn either one, so it is basically nothing to the manufacturers. We need to require that to be done. Now, they say they are going to do more of them in years, but we do not have years. 
   Third, we need the pumps that pump either gasoline or ethanol made from midwestern corn or wheat or biodiesel. But the folks in Brazil will tell you that companies do not like putting those pumps in, because now you're competing with their gas and oil. They have a monopoly on gas and oil, and they are not crazy about putting in a pump that competes with them. 
   So we are going to need to require that Americans be given a choice in pumps. Maybe we start by saying 10 percent of the stations have to have an alternative pump of ethanol, if you have 25 stations. We do not want the moms and pops that have to do this, if they cannot afford it. But if you have a big chain, why not have 10 percent of your stations at least have one ethanol pump so Americans can have that choice. 
   We took the first step in this journey tonight when Speaker Pelosi said we are going to start making a shift from giveaways to oil and gas towards these new clean energy futures, and I am looking forward to making progress. 
   And I yield to Mr. Blumenauer.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. I would like to note that when Mr. Blumenauer talks about leveling the playing field, I think that is very, very important. Because when you look at these entrepreneurs, small businessmen and women that maybe have 10, 15, or 20 employees who are working out of their garage or a little warehouse they have rented somewhere and they are developing some new way. For instance, there is a company called Fiber Forge in Colorado, and they are developing a new way to use composites to build the body of an automobile that can be four times stronger than steel and weigh 30 to 40 percent as much. 
   Now, the challenge in doing this, we are building a composite airplane, the first one ever, the Boeing 787, but the challenge is how do you do that quickly in mass manufacturing, because it takes a lot of hand labor right now. Well, here is a little company called Fiber Forge and they are developing a way to manufacture this using mass production methods that will decrease the cost so you can build cars someday, the body of a car, out of composites that are stronger and weighs about half as much. Do not hold me to that exact number, but significantly less. But they are not getting subsidies, tax breaks, or help, whereas the giant oil companies of the world are getting those huge tax write-offs given to them by Congress. 
   I want to mention two other subsidies the oil and gas companies have that these new competitor businesses do not have. Subsidy number one. Probably a third of our defense budget is dedicated to the protection of our oil lanes to protect the oil these companies get and then sell to us at $3 or $2.50 a gallon. That is a multibillion dollar subsidy to the oil and gas industry that solar, wind, biofuels, clean coal that we can dig up and hopefully someday burn cleanly, they do not get that subsidy at all. That is number one. 
   Subsidy number two. The solar people, the wind people, the clean coal people, the wave power people, the transit people, people who do not put carbon dioxide in the air, they are competing with a company that is using the atmosphere as a free dump. The oil and gas companies today, and those using dirty coal today, are using the atmosphere as a free dumping ground to put their carbon dioxide in and they are not paying a penny for it. These other business people do not have that subsidy. 
   We have to do something about that so that there is some cost associated with using the air we breathe as a private dumping facility. When you go to the garbage dump now it costs us 25 bucks to dump a bunch of stuff out of your pickup into the dump, but these industries can put it into our air for free.  
   Now, we fixed that with sulfur dioxide and we fixed that with nitrous oxide, we have a cap and trade system, but there is a giant loophole, a giant loophole that these companies use for carbon dioxide. It is the most serious pollutant in the world today, but there is a loophole in our laws that does not impose any cost associated with putting that pollutant into our atmosphere. That needs to get fixed as well. 
   Now, we are going to have a long discussion about the best way to do that, but we have to do it. 
   I would yield to Ms. Kaptur.

   Mr. INSLEE. I just want to comment on that. I think basically a way to say this is that our current biofuels economy, which is very productive, and I believe is at least a small improvement on net CO 2, is really a first generation of biofuels. We have a second and third generation that are very close to coming.  
   One of them is this cellulosic ethanol that I have talked about. There is a company called Logen, there are several other companies doing this, to use a cellulosic method in an enhanced way of breaking open the cell to get at the carbohydrates. When we do this, this second generation of biofuels is really going to kick in and make this competitive. 
   I want to mention one thing before I yield to Mr. Holt, and that is we have just Democrats participating in this discussion. But our fellow Republicans are also involved in this discussion. I, myself, and others are talking to some of our Republican colleagues, developing a bill to try to enhance this second generation of ethanol. 
   We do want to make this, and believe we can make this, a bipartisan effort now that we have new leadership that will free us from the chains of the oil and gas companies that have shackled the Congress to date. We are going to have some colleagues on the other side of the aisle work with us, too. 
   I yield to Mr. Holt.

   Mr. INSLEE. I want to note too, as we do that, we want to do in a way that is fiscally responsible. One of the things we have done is to pay for these things by repealing some of these tax breaks that have gone to the oil and gas companies, and then shifting them over to these investments, to do this in a fiscally responsible way. 
   We also want to do it in a way that helps businesses rather than hurts them. Some of the incentive programs that have been done in the past have been done in a way to ensure their failure. 
   For instance, some previous Congresses have been in the terrible habit when they do tax incentives that are intended to help businesses grow, they have done it for one year at a time or two years at a time; and venture capitalists, and I have talked to many of them, say we are not going to make multibillion dollar investments, realizing the rug can be pulled out from under us. 
   That has been done because Congress has tried to hide the deficit, so they have tried to make these things seem like they are short term. 
   We only have about two more minutes. I would just like to yield to anyone who has a closing comment.

   Mr. INSLEE. We just have a few seconds. I would like to just make a closing comment. 
   First, I would thank my colleagues and say that I really do believe this is a historic moment for the industrial base and agricultural base of America, which is today's date, to start to move to a new base away from just a dirty fossil fuel-based system to a clean energy system. We are starting to do this starting today. We are going to join Republicans, hopefully, in finding a bipartisan way to do it. 
   We can tell people that the genius of Americans is in these new wind sources, wind turbines, solar cells, transit, flex-fuel vehicles, plug-in vehicles, cellulosic ethanol, wave power, geothermal, fuel efficient appliances, energy efficient homes; this job is going to get done by a new Congress and it is a bright day for the country.

   Mr. Speaker, we are here today to pass the Charlie W. Norwood Living Kidney Organ Donation Clarification Act.

The reason we had the benefit of Dr. Norwood's wisdom for years in the U.S. Congress was because of a lung transplant.

   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to make a point. I think this is a great bipartisan success, to try to improve organ donation prospects for these 70,000 Americans. But we have more work to do. This bill is not the end of our efforts. I worked for 2 years with Mike Bilirakis, a great Republican, to try to have people in hospitals work with families on transplant donation issues. We need to fund that bill, and I hope we can have a bipartisan effort to do that. 
   We have work to do to fund immunosuppressant drugs. Right now, we are not funding the drugs that donees need to suppress the immunological response to donation. 
   So I hope we can continue to work in a bipartisan fashion to help these 70,000 Americans. We will remember Charlie Norwood's efforts in this regard and on future successes

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment really is critical because we know one thing about America: when it sets grand goals, it is roused to great advance. When John F. Kennedy on May 9, 1961, stood right behind me and set a goal of America to go to the Moon in 10 years, the U.S. Congress did not complain that at that moment we did not have all the technologies we need to set that goal. But Kennedy knew that when America sets goals, it achieves them. 
   Today, we set a goal to have 15 percent of our energy from renewable sources. We know this is an achievable goal. We know that every State in the continental United States, including the Southeast, has more solar energy capacity than Germany, that today, cloudy Germany is getting massive amounts of solar energy. 
   The reason is that we understand that we are the people who invented the airplane, the Internet, software and mapped the human genome. And we are going to do this together. We are going to use clean coal for 80, perhaps 89, percent using our fossil fuel. Is it too much to say that we will use 11 percent for renewables, for wave, biofuels, solar, and 4 percent for efficiency? 
   This is a moment for America to have the same spirit of the original Apollo Project, and for the moment do not shirk and fear. Let's live our dreams. Let's live our aspirations. Let's pass this amendment.

The new Congress a couple months ago passed a bill, the first step, to reel back $14 billion of tax giveaways to the oil companies and create a fund for clean energy; but the second step starts next week. 
   When we take that step, we ought to be invested with the same ambition and innovative spirit of these companies that are doing great work around America, like A123 Battery Company that is making a battery so you get 150 miles a gallon in a plug-in hybrid; the Imperial Fuel Company, the biggest biodiesel supplier in the western hemisphere; the RAMGEN Company, making a compression technology to burn clean coal cleanly. 
   We ought to be invested with the same spirit of innovation that we had when John F. Kennedy stood behind me in 1961 and said we are going to do the Moon. So next week when we start, we should not hear the voices of timidity saying that we cannot improve our fuel mileage. We need a giant leap for mankind with innovation. Americans are a people with can-do spirit, and we will do it next week.

   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend this bill for two reasons. 
   First, the passage of the Bainbridge Island Japanese American Monument Act. It is long overdue. We will finally present a monument to a chapter in American history that should never be a occasioned again. On March 30, 1942, on Bainbridge Island, Washington, the island where I live, the United States Army rounded up 227 people living on Bainbridge Island, put them on a ferry boat, shipped them by trains to a camp in Manzanar for the duration of the war, totally without legality. And 62 of those people subsequently served in World War II. 
   Two years ago a 95-year-old woman, Fumiko Hayashida, came to Congress and testified about the pain that episode caused her and all of America. And this dedication of a monument on Bainbridge Island will serve as a monument to all Americans of all future generations that we should never ever allow the power of fear to overcome the promise of liberty. This monument will serve to do that. 
   I want to thank the great work of people on Bainbridge Island: Fumiko Hayashida, Frank Kitamoto, Clarence Moriwaki; Senator Cantwell and others who worked on this bill. And I invite all Americans to come see this monument when it's completed. 
   I would also like to congratulate my colleague Rick Larsen and Senator Murray for their incredible work, who really set the model of how to do wilderness legislation in finally today passing the Wild Sky Wilderness. I sat on top of Berry Mountain a couple years ago and looked down, and I want to thank them for their great leadership so that my grandchild will be able to look down from the top of Berry Mountain and see the same wilderness; and to their allies, Tom Uniack, Mike Towns, and Jon Owen, all of who really created a model of how to do future wildernesses. Thank you very much, Rick and others, and I congratulate all of us for final passage of these great pieces of work.

Mr. Speaker, one of the great falsehoods I have heard today, unfortunately, is this attempt by one side of the aisle who is against trying to get kids health insurance here keep saying somehow we are raising the eligibility to those folks who are hanging out at the country club. That is simply not true. That is bogus. We are maintaining the same levels of eligibility in America that exist today, yesterday and tomorrow in this bill. 
   What we are doing is simply allowing our State governments, our local governments, the ones that I know many of my Republican friends believe are effective and more efficient than the Federal Government, to fulfill their desire to reach these kids who are eligible today, but the Federal Government is not actually reaching to provide this insurance. 
   Now, where is the criminality in that in that? Where is the inefficiency in that? We have simply said federally that children of a certain income level should have health insurance, and we are simply saying those same children of the same exact economic considerations are now going to actually get it. That's all we are doing. 
   I want to mention another thing we are doing here. We have 11 States that have really been ahead of the Federal Government in providing health insurance for their kids. As a result, for a decade now, they have been punished in that they haven't been able to use the same resources to reach the kid they have already insured. 
   We fix that, 100 percent fix today. The States, if you are from the States of Washington, Wisconsin, New Mexico, Connecticut, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Minnesota, Maryland, New Hampshire, Vermont and Tennessee, do not vote against this bill, because it finally, finally restores this inequity that finally we will be able to get fair treatment for your States and your children.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (SUPPORTING THE GOAL AND MISSION OF AMERICA RECYCLES DAY -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support passage of H. Con. Res. 122, a resolution to support America Recycles Day, the only nationally recognized day dedicated to recycling. 
   And I want to thank the Chair, Chairman Al Wynn, for getting this to the floor; and my cosponsor, Republican Chris Shays, who has been a leader on so many environmental issues, for working on this issue. 
   You know, the economic ramifications of recycling are well known. It creates 1.1 million jobs. It has annual sales of $236 billion gross sales, and has $37 billion in annual payrolls. 
   But I want to focus my comments for the moment on why recycling is so much even more important than it was  originally. We know it has been the most successful environmental initiative in the country's history. It allows people to take individual action to preserve the environment. 
   But now that global warming is upon us, the wisdom, prudence, and genius of recycling is even more apparent. When 1 million square miles of the arctic melted, the size of six Californias this summer, the need for recycling has become even more apparent. 
   Because recycling substantially reduces carbon dioxide emissions when it's associated with raw material extraction, with product manufacture, with emissions from landfills or burning carbon based waste, when we conserve material, we don't waste energy, and we don't put global warming gases into the atmosphere. 
   In fact, the Environmental Protections Agency estimates that recycling a ton of mixed recyclables saves 2.8 tons of carbon dioxide from going into the atmosphere. If we simply increased our recycle efforts from the current 30 percent level to 35 percent, we would reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by an amount equal to the average emissions from 4.6 million households. There is real savings still available to us. 
   We also have a growing problem with electronic material waste. We only have 1 percent of the 130 million phones currently owned by consumers recycled. We're going to do something about that. I can report in Seattle, at America Recycles Day, Dell, Microsoft and InTechra will raise awareness for recycling of electronics at Safeco Field, home of the Seattle Mariners. 
   Here on Capitol Hill, the Office of Greening has helped promote the House America Recycling Day. So passage of this bill will certainly support these ongoing efforts. We need to build on them. 
   It's time for Congress to recognize this important day. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and find something to recycle, and recycle it.

It is time to turn course. 
   This side of the aisle believes the status quo in energy is acceptable. We don't think that's good enough. We believe that Americans are smart enough, creative enough, and innovative enough to launch a new Apollo Project in energy so that we can do for energy what Kennedy did for space, and this bill is step one in that regard. 
   All over this country Americans are inventing a new energy future for us: the OSPRA solar energy company in Florida with clean solar thermal power; the Nanosolar Company that made the first commercial sale of thin cell photovoltaics last month; the Imperium Company in my State of Washington with biodiesel that powered the first jet airliner flight with biodiesel with Virgin Air last weekend; the Altarock Company, the first enhanced geothermal company now growing in the State of Washington; the Janicki Company, which is opening up a new wind turbine blade construction project.

But this side of the aisle and my friends, unfortunately, have put a hold on the countdown, and we're about 2 seconds away to really having a burst of economic growth in this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, America will hear 435 separate ideas about Iraq, but I want to note one great shining light about our country. The American people are absolutely unified, no matter what they think about the policy in Iraq, of holding American warriors and our sons and daughters close to our hearts. This is a unified position across this country, and it is a bright light for America. 
   Now, I have heard some people have suggested that soldiers who fall in Iraq will have fallen in vain. That is wrong. Any American who falls in the course of the conduct of American wars, they do not fall in vain. They fall into our arms, and they fall into our hearts, and there they will always remain. And we are unified on this principle. And when I go to a memorial service for a young man from Redmond, Washington next Monday, I will carry the unified American prayers and hearts of the 650,000 people I represent. 
   Now we are in a difficult situation in Iraq and none of us have a silver bullet, and none of us have a magic wand. And it seems to me that when we are in dark times, we should go back to fundamental American character to find a way forward. 
   There are three parts of the American character we should think about here: first, the character of the American mission in Iraq; second, the character of American common sense; and, third, the character of American democracy. 
   What is the character of our mission in Iraq? President Bush, when he started this war, said we have three missions: 
   Eliminate WMD. Mission accomplished. They were never there. 
   Second, eliminate any terrorist that attacked us on 9/11. Mission accomplished. They were never there. 
   Third, eliminate Saddam Hussein as a threat. Mission accomplished. He is no longer a threat to anyone who walks the face of the Earth. 
   Our proud men and women have fulfilled the three mandates of missions set forth by George Bush. And now we have one moral mission to complete, and that is the moral responsibility to give the Iraqis a reasonable chance to form a government. We have done that after 4 years; and our investment of 3,000-plus lives and hundreds of billions of dollars of American money has fulfilled that moral obligation in spades. 
   Second, what is the American character of common sense? Why did General Abizaid, when he asked all the divisional commanders whether this escalation would help and every single one of them say no, why is that? It is because they have common sense. 
   I was on a walk a couple of months ago, and I met an old high school friend. His son was serving in Baghdad, and I asked him what he thought about Iraq. And he said, We have no common sense in our policy. He said, the fundamental problem in Iraq was that the Shiites were not agreeing with the Sunnis principally over oil revenues. And my son is serving in Baghdad today as a security blanket because the Iraqi politicians will not make the compromises necessary to form a government. 
   That has to end. It is American common sense to understand the real enemy in Baghdad is sectarian intransigence. The real enemy in Baghdad is their failure to compromise. And the best weapon we have is a dose of reality to the Iraqi people of all sectarian faiths. You have to get a grip on your country because you will very shortly have your own fate in your own hands. The best weapon we have in Iraq is to tell the rest of the immediate region that they must become responsible for their own neighborhoods. That is the weapon of reality we should use. 
   And, third, what is the character of American democracy? George Bush said that he was the decider. That is wrong. The decider is the American people. And the American people had a message to George Bush that there has to be a change in Iraq policy. And he is not listening to the generals, he is not listening to the bipartisan commission, and he is not listening to the American people. 
   Congress has a responsibility coequal with the President under Article I of the Constitution to declare war, to raise and support armies, to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces. It is time for Congress to stand up on our hind legs and take away the keys from the man who has driven our foreign policy into a ditch. It is time to restore the American mission to where it belongs, to American common sense where it belongs, and to American democracy where it belongs. 
   Support this resolution. Prevent this escalation in Iraq.

   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, since the President's escalation of the war in Iraq began, every month we have had more and more proud, dedicated people from Fort Lewis, Washington, and their families learn they were never coming home. Those men and women have been fed into Iraq by a President whose policies in Iraq were wrong at the beginning, were wrong in the middle, and will be wrong at the end. 
   The fact is very clear from all of the reports that we have been reading in the last week: whether we stay 6 days or 6 weeks or 6 months or 60 years, the destiny of Iraq will be determined by the Iraqi people. 
   And what we have learned in this escalation is that it failed; it has failed to accomplish its design of political reconciliation in Iraq. And until the Sunnis and Shiites reconcile their interests, all of the king's horses and all the king's men are not going to put Iraq together again. It is time for an orderly exit from Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the Chairwoman and Ranking Member for their this issue. I rise today to support my amendment to the Small Business Lending Improvements Act (H.R. 1332) which would add an eligibility area to Section 504 loans. My amendment will ensure that American entrepreneurs  have the opportunity to start, build and, grow green small businesses by adding a sustainable design or low-impact design to the public policy goals of this lending program. 
   This common-sense amendment would decrease long-term operating costs for small business owners, stimulate green building technologies, create a better work environment for employees and reduce carbon emissions in the United States. 
   Buildings account for one-third of carbon emissions per year. It is important that we help small business owners make sustainable choices that they might not otherwise make due to cost, or simply due to the fact that some of these technologies are new. My amendment will help SBA expand their financing structure to help businesses use sustainable building standards, such as LEED certified, which have a minimal impact on our environment. Currently, SBA loans can help a company upgrade to required standards, but very few Small Business Loans have helped owners choose green building standards. 
   Furthermore, green buildings benefit workers. Case studies show examples of 2 to 16 percent increase in productivity in among employees who work in buildings that incorporate sustainable building design. 
   Sustainable design and green building practices are easy and available. An excellent example of how this can be done, and why green technologies help small businesses and the community, is the Snoqualmie Gourmet Ice Cream factory in Maltby, Wash. I recently toured this factory, which is Snohomish County's first sustainable commercial project, owned by Barry Bettinger. Barry used Small Business Administration (SBA) loans for low impact development strategies. With assistance from the Sustainable Development Task Force, he used technologies to cut his lighting costs by 50 percent, reduce his water usage by 40 percent and reduce energy for cooling fans by 75 percent. 
   I hope that the SBA and experts in sustainable design such as the National Institute of Building Sciences will work together to develop meaningful standards in this eligibility area of sustainable design. 
   Congress has a huge opportunity here to further improve the small business lending program to meet goals of reducing energy consumption in this country. Thank you for supporting this amendment.  
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. INSLEE. My fellow Members, we know that small businesses have been leaders in job creation and are the dynamic growth center for the American economy, and now they are poised to become the leaders in our green building revolution. We know that we have challenges on energy security, we know we have challenges to deal with on global warming, and we know that small businesses have challenges to receive capital to help in their programs to make their businesses more efficient, less costly for energy consumption, and less emitting of greenhouse gases. 
   Our amendment would create the ability of the SBA to provide capital to our small businesses across the country to do thousands of things that they want to start doing, items like putting additional energy-efficient equipment into their businesses, building green roofs that can prevent energy loss, installation of renewable energy sources like photovoltaic cells and energy equipment heating and cooling systems. The list is endless. 
   I would like to think of a little small business called the Snoqualmie Ice Cream Company, which is some of the best ice cream in the world, but they used an SBA loan essentially to put impervious concrete and build a green roof, which helped their business operations and helped the environment to boot. 
   So we would propose that we expand the SBA purposes to allow our small businessmen and women to be on the cutting edge of green building and green businesses across the country. This will help them move a step forward to use their dynamic leadership. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield to Ms. Vel&#225;zquez.

   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, we here highly resolve that starting today we will no longer allow President Bush to make an infinite number of mistakes with an infinite number of our sons and daughters. 
   We know one thing, the President believes he has done a heck of a job in Iraq; the American people disagree. The people who are now doing our bidding in Iraq proudly are standing up for democracy, and we want some democracy here. We know that there is a difficult road to hoe in Iraq, but we know there should be an infinite wisdom in one source in America, and that is the American people. 
   There is no sovereignty, there is no king, there is no person who always does a heck of a job. When push comes to shove, we have got to listen to the American people, and the American people have spoken to us loudly. They have said it is time for the Iraqi leadership to quit fiddling around and form a government. And they know, as we do, as the retired generals who have come out full force and said that the American people are right, we cannot expect our service personnel to solve the political problem in Iraq. And now, 13 months have gone by since supposedly they formed this constitution and they were going to solve this problem of what to do with their oil, and they still haven't got an agreement. They are still fiddling around while our sons and daughters die. 
   Now, the troops and the generals understand that there is a message being sent by this resolution, and the message is to Maliki and the rest of the Iraqi leadership: You have got to stop fiddling around and form a government, and you have got to reach an agreement about oil. And until you do, there is going to be civil strife, civil war and Americans driving in the middle of that. This is a message to them: Solve this problem.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (GAO'S GOOD DECISION FOR WARFIGHTERS -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, we come to the floor this evening to discuss this good news that we read yesterday for our warfighters doing great jobs for the U.S. Air Force and for the taxpayers who are providing the equipment for the Air Force and for a lot of working families in the United States. And that was the decision by the General Accountability Office to essentially allow the protests against the previous proposed decision by the United States Air Force to send a contract for the construction of 80 tankers which refuel our Air Force planes essentially overseas to a combination that is largely European by the Airbus Company. 
   And we are extremely gratified and vindicated that the General Accountability Office has found that in seven very fundamental ways, the decision by the Air Force to send this American tanker using American taxpayer dollars for American warriors essentially overseas, and they have found that this was a decision that violated some general principles of procurement in issuing contracts using taxpayer dollars. In a very forceful and powerful and unambiguous decision, the General Accountability Office, we call it the GAO up here, concluded that this purported decision to send this contract away was a bad decision, bottom line. And this decision must be reviewed and we hope ultimately reversed. 
   So we've come to the floor tonight to talk about why that decision was appropriate, why it is welcome, and why we hope the Air Force will move forward working with the bidders on this contract to really reach a decision that's going to be in the best interest of the country as a whole, including our warfighters and our taxpayers and our working families. 
   And just if I can by way just as a matter of background, this is a contract for eventually 179 what are called KC-X aircraft. The first tranche would be 80 aircraft. These are the tankers that refuel our airplanes, and they are obviously the backbone of our Air Force. Without tankers, we don't have an Air Force. This is perhaps the most critical of the one type of airplane we have because this type of airplane has to be right for the job, competent, survivable, cost-effective, or we don't have an Air Force that requires this refueling capacity. 
   Now, the contractor that we'll talk about tonight, the Boeing Company, has been essentially the exclusive suppliers of these tankers for the United States Air Force for five decades and with incredible success. The KC-135 has been an enormously successful airplane, and the Boeing family of workers that have provided it have been proud to provide that background. And they were, of course, a bidder to provide the Boeing 767 as the platform, a very well-respected workhorse airplane that is converted for tanker purposes.  
   And this bid was originally rejected by the Air Force and given to a consortium involving Airbus, and it is that decision that the GAO has found was illegal essentially and violated procurement policies. 
   Now, the GAO, they're sort of a neutral referee, if you will. They don't have any dog in this fight. They reviewed this decision with intimate care and concluded in seven ways, which we will talk about tonight, this decision was grievously flawed and has to be revisited. So we felt vindicated by that decision because we had been arguing on this floor for a couple months now that that decision was grievously wrong. 
   I'm joined tonight by at least two Members, Phil Hare of Illinois and Nancy Boyda of Kansas. And I would like to start by yielding to Phil Hare of Illinois about his observations about how we need to restore this American plane to an American manufacturer to take care of American warfighters.

   Mr. INSLEE. I think you seized on a very important point. This was not a decision by the GAO that they're just going to change this decision because they decided 
   to favor American jobs. Now, we think that's a really important point, but the really fundamental aspects of GAO is they concluded the rules were violated in making the decision of what the best airplane for the money was. They did not take into consideration American jobs. We essentially--the Boeing family sort of won this on the merits of the airplane without any sort of special consideration that we were the hometown team, and I think that's a really important point, and I appreciate you making that.

   Mr. INSLEE. I appreciate the comments. Again, the GAO decision was not based on job creation or job loss, but we, of course, think that's an important value. And this isn't just those of us who are from the Boeing kind of country who feel this. A study by the Economic Policy Institute studied the proposals of Boeing in the competing European Airbus and concluded that the Boeing project would create twice as many jobs, 14,000 more jobs in this country than the other. 
   Now, we've seen a lot of these fancy ads by the Airbus contractors suggesting that it's an American airplane. But you can't have an airplane take off to Luce, France, as wonderful as that  country is, land it here and slap an American decal on it and make it an American airplane. And the EPI study, I think, is the most dispositive in showing that 14,000 additional jobs were at stake in this decision. 
   But again, Boeing wanted to win this on the merits on what's the best airplane. And that's what's so impressive about the GAO study that for seven, not just one sort of technical violation, not two technical violations, they concluded that this decision violated this sort of seven deadly sins of procurement policy. And every single one of them went against Boeing contrary to the law. 
   So this was a very powerful decision. I was going to use the word ``slam dunk,'' but I'm not sure that's a legal term of art. But that's what it was. This was not some sort of just minor technical decision. 
   I would like to now yield to NANCY BOYDA of Kansas who I appreciate joining us this evening.

   Mr. INSLEE. You used the word ``strong,'' and I think that's very important here, because the Boeing airplane, the Boeing 767 was found by the Air Force's own evaluation to have five times as many survivability discriminators as the Airbus plane. Now, that's a fancy term to mean it had five times as many characteristics that would allow the plane and its pilots and its crew to survive and complete its mission. 
   It is a stronger airplane from the sense of survivability. You used that term, and I just want to use a quote by former United States Air Force Chief of Staff and Retired General Ronald Fogelman who stressed survivability as an asset of the Boeing plane. He said, ``When I saw the Air Force's assessment of both candidate aircraft in the survivability area, I was struck by the fact that they clearly saw the KC-767 as a more survivable tanker.'' This was a statement to the ARSAG in his role that he was serving in as a consultant of Boeing. He said, ``To be survivable, tanker aircraft must contain systems to identify and defeat threats, provide improved situational awareness to the aircrew to avoid threat areas, and protect the crew in event of attack. The KC-767 has a superior survivability rating and will have greater operational utility to the joint commander and provide better protection to aircrews that must face real-world threats.'' 
   Now, this just isn't Boeing talk. This is the Air Force's own conclusions that the ``discriminators''--it's a fancy word used in this business--that Boeing included more robust surface-to-air missile defense systems, cockpit displays that improve situational awareness, better electromagnetic pulse hardening, automatic route planning and rerouting, better armor protection features for the flight crew and critical aircraft systems, and better fuel tank explosion protection features. 
   The Boeing 767, according to the Air Force's own evaluation, concluded that Mrs. Boyda's comment that this is a stronger airplane is correct.

   Mr. INSLEE. I really appreciate again reiterating that we want this decision to be made on the merits, and one of those merits I want to point out just that I find incredible about this decision--and that's why I'm so happy about the GAO decision--is the recognition that the Air Force totally failed to consider accurately the lifecycle costs of these two proposals. 
   Now, obviously there's the up-front costs, but to the taxpayer, it's the lifecycle cost or the whole cost of maintaining and operating and parking the airplane that you really have to look at. And according to the GAO and the United States Air Force, they made a mistake in evaluating what the lifecycle costs were. 
   Just reading from a Reuters article June 12--it was a few days later confirmed by GAO--the U.S. Air Force has conceded that Boeing Company's proposed KC-767 refueling tanker would cost less over time than what was then the winning plane by Airbus. 
   And this is what the taxpayer has at stake in this thing, and this comes--we need to get down in the weeds a little bit--by the failure to take into consideration several things accurately. Number one, the Boeing airplane uses 24 percent less fuel. It's 24 percent more efficient. So you save, it's about somewhere between--I'm looking for my number here--according to a pretty good study, over the 40-year operational life, the Boeing plane would save $30 billion in projected fuel costs, $30 billion. 
   I'd like to yield to Mr. Blumenauer for a comment.

   Mr. INSLEE. And by the way, there seems to be no doubt, these statistics we're giving are essentially inarguable. Airbus is not contesting the fact that the Boeing airplane is 24 percent more fuel. This is just fact. The GAO find that this is, I believe, one of the reasons of life cycle cost. 
   And by the way, it's just not fuel. Because the Airbus plane is so gargantuan, it's going to cost taxpayers an additional $2 billion in military construction to rebuild the hangers to hang them in and places to park the things. It will also cost $13 billion in additional manpower over the life cycle. So there are numerous reasons why the Boeing plane is a better deal for the taxpayers.

   Mr. INSLEE. Well, I appreciate that. And just so people know who may be  listening to this--and maybe even a couple of our colleagues, you never know, it's a slow night--I'll just read finding number six by the GAO. And they said, ``The Air Force's evaluation of military construction costs in calculating the offerer's most probable life cycle cost for their proposed aircraft was unreasonable. When the agency, during the protest, conceded that it made a number of errors in evaluation that, when corrected, resulted in Boeing displacing Northrop Grumman as the offerer with the lowest, most probable life cycle cost, the GAO concluded, and ultimately after they fixed their mistakes, concluded that the Boeing airplane is a better deal for the American taxpayer.'' Now, to me, if you've got a stronger airplane and a better deal for the American taxpayer, and peripherally, but not unimportantly, 14,000, at least, more jobs in America, this ought to be a slam-dunk decision. We hope that it will be, ultimately. 
   I will yield to Mrs. Boyda.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. And just to back up what Mrs. Boyda said, she's not just whistling Dixie--or Kansas in this case--she has backed up what the GAO said. They said specifically, in finding number four of seven deadly sins, they said, ``The Air Force conducted misleading and unequal discussions with Boeing by informing Boeing that it had fully satisfied a key performance parameter objective relating to operational utility, but later determined that Boeing had only partially met this objective. And then there's a bunch of other language that's pretty technical. 
   But what happened here is, for some reason that I don't know for sure--I have some suspicions of what happened here, and that doesn't really matter--but for some reason the Air Force decided bigger was better. And they went and in their original decision opted for a bigger airplane and violated, in several different ways, the procurement rules in order to reach that conclusion. 
   Now, we've said that the Air Force has already recognized that their life cycle cost decisions were in error. But we really hope in this rebidding that they will not be persuaded that bigger is always better. And what we have found, and some of the things we've talked about tonight, why bigger is not better, it's actually worse in this particular case because when you build a plane that's that much bigger, that exceeds your real requirements, you end up spending a quarter more fuel and you end up spending $2 billion on construction costs. 
   And here's something that I think is important. The Airbus airplane can only use half as many airfields around the world as the Boeing 767. Now, you think of all the places we can end up in a military conflict around the world and all the relatively little airports that we may want to get involved in, I mean, who knew we were going to be flying from airports in Iraq 20 years ago when we made some procurement decisions? We have to be ready to fly these airplanes anywhere in the world. Yet the Airbus decision, if you buy this larger airplane, it can only use--I think it's either 200 or 400 airports that the Boeing plane can use that the Airbus plane cannot. I think that's really important, and one of the disadvantages of size. Plus, if you look at the requirements, the Boeing airplane fulfills the requirements that they asked for on how much capacity they had to have for refueling, Boeing met it. 
   So that's one of the things that Mrs. Boyda was alluding to that GAO said, just because you do more than the requirement, it doesn't do you any good. Why give extra bonus points to something that just costs more money and eliminates half the airports in the world where you can land? That doesn't make sense. And I think that was one of the reasons that GAO decided. 
   And I yield to Mrs. Boyda.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (GAO'S GOOD DECISION FOR WARFIGHTERS -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. And as a result of this decision that has now been reversed, thankfully--at least by the GAO, they're calling for a reversal--what really happened is that the original decision, the Air Force decided to buy excess capacity that was not needed and gave up a capacity that was needed, which was refueling all our types of aircraft. And the GAO concluded--this isn't just Boeing talking, it's the GAO concluded--that the Airbus cannot refuel some of the airplanes we have in stock right now. 
   So you sort of paid more money for more life cycle cost for the Airbus airplane, you bought capacity you did not need, and you gave up the one thing you do need, which is to be able to refuel every kind of airplane. What are we supposed to tell the pilots of the Tilt-Rotor aircraft; sorry, you don't get to fuel? We've made a procurement decision that, you know, you'll just have to take the long way around? It was a serious, serious misjudgment because they concluded, for reasons that  escape me, frankly, why bigger is better. And I think that's really the fundamental decision that was made in that regard. 
   I would like to, if I can, talk about something else that is important that was not in the GAO decision that I do think bears on this, and I think we, as Members of Congress, have a responsibility to look at, and that is this issue of whether or not it should be Federal policy to reward countries and companies that are violating international law on our trade agreements. 
   Right now, the United States Government has concluded that the Airbus company has been the recipient of billions of dollars of illegal subsidies, illegal subsidies from the governments in Europe, and has concluded with such force that the United States Government, the U.S. Trade Representative, has filed a claim, a lawsuit of sorts, against Airbus because of these illegal subsidies. So the United States Government has determined that this contractor has received illegal subsidies violative of international and consequentially United States law. But then what did the other agency of the U.S. government turn around and do--or tried to do before the GAO blew the whistle? They turned around and tried to give a $40 billion contract to the very company that's violating the trade laws. Now, how does that make us look in international law if we're suing them, saying there's illegal subsidies, and we turn around and give them a $40 billion contract while taking away 14,000 jobs here away from a very well known and successful contractor, the Boeing company? It's ludicrous. Talk about the right hand not knowing what the left hand was doing here. 
   This is an issue that the GAO did not review and the Air Force did not review because some people in the Senate did not allow them to do that--that's a whole other story how that happened--but it seems to me that we, as Members of Congress, should stand for the enforcement of these trade laws and not reward companies and contractors who we ourselves have concluded violated the law. And I think that's an obligation on us. It's beyond the obligation of the GAO. That wasn't their job, but I think it is our job.

My uncles and cousins, I remember my best friend growing up in south Seattle, his dad had the job of breaking Boeing airplanes. And his job was to try to figure out what you had to do to break a Boeing airplane. And when you were a kid growing up, to think that your job was to get to blow up things was pretty fun.

   Mr. INSLEE. One of his coolest jobs was they would take a Boeing 727 and put a jack underneath it, and jack that wing up and see how far they could jack that wing up before it failed. And when they failed, they would literally explode because of the tension. And those things get up almost 35, 45 degrees. They have incredible flexibility as well as strength. So I grew up with Boeing as part of my blood and family, in the interest of full disclosure. But I think the arguments we're making here tonight go well beyond our sort of familial and constituent interests and duties because I think what we're portraying is a decision that it was so far out of kilter that you had the GAO now blowing the whistle on it, and the GAO is like the referee. They had an instant replay. They had it right on videotape. And they concluded this was a decision that was way, way out of bounds. And we are now hopeful that the Air Force will fully and fairly re-evaluate this. And I think that they will conclude in something that all of us Members conclude, I think tonight. 
   And I was counting on what Mr. Hare said, five inarguable truths about this contract. I just want to list them, that nobody can argue, everybody would agree, even our Air Force colleagues would have to admit this. Number one, the Air Force's own conclusions showed that there were more survivable discriminators to show the survivability to the Boeing airplane helping the warfighter survive and do their jobs; Number two, the life cycle costs, when you include all the costs for maintenance and reconstruction of the hangars and everything, are less expensive in the Boeing airplane than the Airbus airplane; third, that the fuel life cycle costs are going to be less for the Boeing airplane than the Airbus airplane, in the billions of dollars; and fourth, and this wasn't in the GAO report but we know it to be true, if we go with the Airbus product here, we're going to be spending $40 plus billion of  American taxpayer dollars rewarding a company that our own Federal Government has concluded is guilty of very serious violations of Federal trade rules in the billions of dollars; and fifth, and one that is maybe closest to our hearts at the moment, the Boeing airplane will have at least, and probably more than this, 14,000 families more employed doing high quality work than the competitor. 
   So the GAO said there were seven major errors, which is extraordinary by the way, not just one, seven major fundamental errors. We will say tonight that there were five strikes and you're out, those are the five strikes that all of us can agree on I think. So we're hopeful that the GAO is heeded, if it is not by the Air Force, we will be doing our job here in Congress, and we will be finding the right avenue in the appropriations process to not allow this decision to stand to make sure that the right decision is made.

   Mr. INSLEE. And thank you Mr. Hare. Our thoughts are with your flooded constituents in Illinois. We are thinking about them tonight. 
   Just a closing comment, where this goes from now, the Air Force is required within 60 days to respond to this protest. They will have 60 days within which to plan their next action in this regard. We know what we would like them to do. Following that, if decisions are not made as they should be, Congress can act in a variety of ways to make sure that this decision is right. And we stand ready, willing and able to do so. 
   And the longer this goes on, the more our colleagues frankly understand that something was not right in this decision and needs to be reversed. So as time goes on I think we will get closer. 
   Let me also say in criticizing the decision by the U.S. Air Force, I hope it goes without saying, we have undying respect for the people who serve in the United States Air Force. These are decisions that are hard fought, a lot of technical issues. A decision was not made here according to Hoyle. But do you know what? We have a process of fixing these things. And at the end of the day, the U.S. Air Force is going to be something we always admire. And we are going to get them the right airplane for the job. We know what that is, and we are going to get that job done for them.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (REPUBLICANS' ENERGY ``SOLUTIONS'' WON'T SOLVE OUR ENERGY CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. You bet. And any time an optimist is talking at 11 o'clock at night about America's great energy future--and I think we do have a very great energy future before us, and I appreciate you sharing that sense of optimism. 
   And I'm optimistic because it is my belief that America has the same right stuff we had in the 1960s when Kennedy sent us to the moon and that same right stuff, that same intellectual fever, that same sense of a can-do spirit, that same innovative spirit is really available to us if we, in this building, will simply unshackle that creative power of America to solve our energy woes. 
   And the reason I came over here tonight is that I am very concerned that some folks are promoting an alleged plan that won't solve our problems but will short-sell the Americans' spirit of being really able to solve this problem through technological gains. 
   I heard some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle today proposing what they call an energy plan which is to simply drill more holes in the ground. And I would suggest very strongly that that is a plan doomed for total and abject failure, which is something at $4 a gallon of gas and a war in the Middle East and global warming nipping on our heels we can't run the risk of failure. 
   And I'm just going to suggest what has been proposed is too little, too late, and too timid. 
   And the first two are obvious why they're too little and too late. We know that it's too little simply to drill a few more holes in the ground in the United States because we don't have the oil. Even if we drill in Mount Rushmore, Yellowstone National Park, and the Capitol Mall, we could drill in the south lawn of the White House, but we don't have the oil that can make any significant difference in the price of oil. 
   Oil is a fungible product that is sold on a worldwide market, and every single expert that has testified--and we're not talking Democrats or Republicans; we're talking to people who know the oil industry--and every single expert that we have talked to has told us even in the long term, because our dinosaurs somehow died under the Saudi Arabia soil, we don't have the oil to make a difference in the price. Simple economic fact.     
   The simple fact is we use 25 percent of the world's oil. The experts have told us, even if you drill in the south lawn of the White House, we've only got 3 to 3.2 percent of the world's oil supply. Because oil trades on a worldwide market, we can maximize and we won't be able to change the worldwide price of oil more than a couple of cents. 
   And I want to make sure people understand this. There's a bunch of hooey coming from across the other side of the aisle that you're going to get $2 a gallon of gasoline if we drill on the south lawn of the White House. It's a bunch of hooey. 
   Every single expert who has testified in the United States Congress for the last 2 years has told us that if you maximize drilling, if you ignore all of any environmental concerns we have, you will not change the price of oil more than a couple of pennies because it simply isn't enough to make a difference. The oil under Saudi Arabia is many, many, many fold the oil that we have no matter where we drill. 
   So telling Americans that we are going to be able to affect the price of oil by expanding drilling in the United States is simple flimflam, and it reminds me of that great movie with George W. Scott called ``The Flim-Flam Man.'' He said he identified himself as a master of back stabbing, cork screwing and dirty dealing. And I think, frankly, it is a flimflam to tell people that it's going to solve it. It's too little. 
   But it's too late because we shouldn't wait till 2030. The first oil that would flow from these new holes in the ground wouldn't flow until 2030. It is too late. It is too late for the Americans. 
   And it's too timid. Now, I believe Mr. Blumenauer talked about this a little bit, but we have really one significant thing we can do in the short-term, and that is to end this rampant speculation that the experts are telling us is driving up the price that is not a function of supply and demand. It's hard to explain these increases any other way but rampant speculation. 
   And tomorrow, I'll be joining Representative Bart Stupak, who's doing great work leading the House to a bill that will finally close the loopholes that have allowed these speculators to act in a nontransparent, sort of dark hole, of energy--of oil trading. And you know, they operate--and the one thing that was entirely appropriately named--It's called the Enron loophole. Man, that was the right name for that loophole, where these traders can do swaps, and we don't know about it. 
   So we need to close these loopholes. That can have a short-term impact this year where we don't have to wait 20 years for a resolution. So it's too little, too late. 
   But I just want to really focus on the part about being too timid. We need a bold, courageous, over-the-horizon, visionary energy plan that's fitting of the talents of the American people. Drilling holes in the ground is 140-year technology. It is old, mature technology. We do it quite well, and we've done it for a long time. 
   Now is the time to turn the page and add to our portfolio of energy sources a whole new suite of technological sources that can power our cars and our homes, and I want to mention two of them. Okay? 
   In the last 2 weeks, I've met with two people. One is a guy named Felix Cramer, who's a guy who essentially helped invent the plug-in hybrid car. You plug it in, you run it for 40-plus miles on electricity, and if you want to  drive more, you use gasoline or ethanol. These are technologies that we need to strive on. 
   And next week, I meet some folks at the A123 battery company in Boston. These are the folks who are making the lithium ion batteries that will be able to drive your car ultimately 100 miles and 40 miles now without a charge. 
   We don't have to shackle ourselves to oil for the next 100 years. We've got to break our addiction to oil. We have the capacity to do this, but if we're timid, if we're pessimistic, if we're shortsighted, we will simply do what we've done for 140 years, which is drill holes in the ground. 
   And we have a policy, and I've introduced a bill called the New Apollo Energy Act which basically says that this country's going to go on a course of technological innovation, and this truly has the capability of breaking the chains of oil, and I know we're capable of doing that. 
   So I appreciate Mr. Blumenauer starting this discussion.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (REPUBLICANS' ENERGY ``SOLUTIONS'' WON'T SOLVE OUR ENERGY CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. I always appreciate Mr. Blumenauer's question of isn't it kind of funny to watch people stuck in traffic, driving to the gym to ride the stationary bicycle, and I always kind of appreciate that irony. 
   I want to point out in talking about this theme of why we need a bold energy plan rather than a timid one, I want to point out three e-mails I've got in the last 24 hours that I think depict the future that we optimists see rather than pessimists who just want to remain addicted to oil. 
   One was an e-mail I got about 4 hours ago from the United States Climate Change Science Program. This is a program in the George Bush administration. They just released their report about what the United States is going to face due to global warming. We're not talking about Kenya or India. We're talking about the United States. 
   And today at 1:30, they released their report. This is the official scientific assessment of the administration of George Bush. And they concluded, Among the major findings reported in this assessment are that droughts, heavy downpours, excessive heat, and intense hurricanes are likely to be become more commonplace as humans continue to increase the atmospheric concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. The report is based on scientific evidence that a warming world will be accompanied by changes in the intensity, duration, frequency, and geographic extent of weather and climate extremes. 
   That is the Bush administration's own people recognizing that the science says that we are in some dire consequences. 
   In talking to my friends here tonight, who have been stacking sandbags in Iowa, in the second 500-year flood in about 14 years, I think we can see something's happening. I'm not saying this flood is specifically caused  by global warming, but what we do know is these kind of incidents are going to become more frequent over time. 
   Now, what is the response from this side of the aisle from that scientific information?     
   You know, this side of the aisle, they trust science. They believe in science because they use cell phones, which are based on quantum mechanics. And they fly on Boeing airplanes, which are based on advanced physics. But when it comes to the science of global warming, what is their response? Their response is, let's just drill more oil and use more oil and pollute more global warming gases. That is a nonstarter of a strategy that can save the planet from the problems that the George Bush administration scientific assessment this afternoon says we're in for. That is too timid. 
   Now, the second e-mail I got, I got it about 35 minutes ago, it was from the Nano Solar Company in Palo Alto, California. The Nano Solar Company is a thin cell photovoltaic company. And thin cells are a new type of photovoltaic. It's a solar cell that creates electricity just from sunlight. And it's thin cell, where you just spray this material on a plastic coating and boom, you've got yourself a solar cell. It's much cheaper to make than a silicon-based photovoltaic cell. Today they announced that they were the first company in the world to have one gigawatt of manufacturing capacity for photovoltaics, which can dramatically decrease the cost of production of photovoltaics. 
   Now, we have a vision on this side of the aisle to help those companies expand. And if they do, we're going to eventually be able to break this addiction to oil. And that company is part of a vision where we use solar power, wind power, enhanced geothermal power, potentially clean coal, potentially some other sources to produce electricity and run cars on electricity. That's a vision that's up to the innovative capability. But the answer from this side of the aisle is, no, no, don't help these new companies that are advancing these new technologies, just help the old companies that learned how to drill for oil 140 years ago in Pennsylvania. That is an old technology. It's a horse-and-buggy technology. It's worked really well. Gasoline is a great fuel, except for its global warming capacity. 
   The third e-mail I want to mention; yesterday afternoon I received an e-mail from the Ausra Energy Company that announced that they are opening their first solar thermal plant--in California, I believe--in about 2 or 3 weeks. Now, solar thermal energy is where you use mirrors to concentrate the sun's light; you generate heat; you heat water or oil; and you generate steam power based electricity. It has a potential to be energy just as cheap as coal-fired electricity in the next decade. 
   These people are for real. They have multiple million dollars of capital funding; they have now signed contracts in Florida and California to provide electricity for almost 400,000 homes. These are the breakthrough projects that we need to foster rather than going back to just the old technology. 
   And my concern about what my friends across the aisle are proposing is that we are proposing to really chain ourselves to the past here while the rest of the world is moving ahead. You know, we're in a race right now. We were in a space race in the sixties, and we won because we had leadership from John F. Kennedy who said, let's beat the Russians, let's go to the moon in 10 years. Now we need some leadership from this building to say, let's beat the Germans in solar cell technology, let's beat the Danes in wind turbine technology. Let's be the company that gets the Nano Solars and the Ausras of the world to start selling products to China. 
   And I'll tell you another place we can get gasoline from, from the Sapphire Energy Company. It's a company in Washington and California that just raised about $50 million. And they have an algae-based material that can make, not ethanol, not biodiesel, but gasoline, gasoline just like you put in your tank today. Now, there's a company that could use a step forward so that, instead of having to drill in these environmentally sensitive areas, we can produce our own fuel without competing with food crops. And that product can be mass produced probably sooner than we can get major league drilling going in offshore areas. 
   Now, that is not a guarantee, it is not a guarantee. None of these new technologies are lead pipe cinches. But they have very good prospects of success, they have attracted very significant private capital, and we know that they have a chance to do what we need, domestically produce clean energy that doesn't destroy the planet through climate change. 
   And so we have adopted a position of assisting these breakthrough technologies, allowing drilling to continue in the United States where it has been leased. And there are 68 million acres today of public land owned by the United States Federal Government that has been leased to the oil and gas companies where they are fully capable of drilling wells, and they have not done so. In fact, there has been a lot of talk about the Arctic. Five out of the six oil companies that are drilling oil in any major league way internationally have no interest in the Arctic because it's too expensive to get to. We haven't even talked about cost associated with these things. 
   So we believe this country is ready for a bold new vision, and we're ready to tackle that. And that's why my new Apollo energy project, the Bart Stupak bill, that will bring these speculators into the bright light of regulation so they don't do to us what Enron did to Washington and Oregon and California, that's a vision for this country, and we're ready to rock and roll on it. We're looking forward to a new President so we can get on with that job. 
   I yield to Mr. Blumenauer.

   Mr. INSLEE. My only point is that I think it was May 25, 1961, John F. Kennedy stood right there and said we're going to go to the moon. And what we heard today from some of my colleagues across the aisle is, let's just go to Cleveland, that will be enough. 
   Just being addicted to oil is beneath the bold vision that Americans are asking for right now. And we really have only one hope of significantly reducing gas prices over the long term, and that is to develop sources that are an alternative to oil and gas. We need to no longer be slaves to the oil companies and addicted to the needle of the gas pump. We need to be the masters, where we decide whether we're going to use electricity in our cars or algae-based biofuels that a little algae particle produced, or a combination or those things, or public transportation, as you so radically suggested, or a bicycle, and maybe even walk on occasion, if our minds were into that. 
   When we have these choices, Americans will be freed from this oil addiction. And until we have those choices, we will not. We stand for giving America those choices. The other side stands for continued addiction for the next several centuries. We'll let the people decide. 
   Thanks for having this discussion.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA TO END ITS CRACKDOWN IN TIBET -- (House of Representatives - April 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Madam Speaker, due to the leadership of Nancy Pelosi, we were able to experience a profound and moving time in Dharamsala, India, 2 weeks ago, and it was profound for two reasons. One, when you talk to a Buddhist monk who has walked for 5 days through the Himalayan mountains to escape suppression and obtain some modicum of religious liberty, it would move the hardest of hearts. And we talked to monks who had that experience, monks who couldn't even show a little medallion with a picture of the Dalai Lama on their chest without having to go to jail in Tibet under the control of the Chinese Government. It was profound in that sense, but it was profound in meeting the Dalai Lama, as well, a person of great humor, great grace, great courage and great nonviolence. And he has asked for an investigation of what has gone on in Tibet, to quash what the Chinese Government has been saying about him, saying that he has instigated this violence. Anyone who makes that claim couldn't distinguish between Mahatma Gandhi and Che Guevara. 
   And I take great umbrage at this assertion that somehow he has been the reason for violence. His position has been reasonable. He has asked for a dialogue with the Chinese Government. He has asked for an investigation to what happened in Tibet. He has not called for a boycott of the Olympics, an extremely reasonable position given what his people have undergone. 
   His aspirations for China I think should be the world's, that as China grows into a great economic power, let it seek to be a great power in the sense of morality and humanity. My district has a growing relationship with China selling jets, software and agricultural products. And we like to see the economic potential of China. But that has to be married, to become a great nation, with a commitment to humanity, morality and religious freedom. This is consistent not only with America's core values, but international values in the Olympic spirit. We hope we move in that direction.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (BAINBRIDGE ISLAND JAPANESE AMERICAN MONUMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, today, when we pass the Bainbridge Island Japanese American Monument Act of 2007, we will be making a strong American statement. That statement will be that the power of fear will never again be allowed to overcome the promise of liberty. These are images we should never see again in America; and today, with the passage of this bill, we will make a strong American statement that they will not. 
   On March 30, 1942, the American Army, pursuant to an executive order by an American President, rounded up 227 Americans living on Bainbridge Island and marched them down the Eagledale Dock in Eagle Harbor of Bainbridge Island, Washington, surrounded by American soldiers, some having bayonets deployed. They were taken away to internment against their will, without trial and without recognition of their rights as citizens and their honor to serve America. 
   And now, today, when we are making the memorial on Bainbridge Island at the site of this dock, which is now being prepared and is under construction, we will be making an American statement that this cannot happen again. 
   The saying is ``Nidoto Nai Yoni, never let it happen again,'' and by making this part of our National Parks System, we will be making a statement that these images will never happen to any generation of any creed in America. 
   I want to note some of the people. This is a picture of a young fellow at that time named Frank Kinamoto. In this picture, Frank had his little tag. Everyone was given a little tag they had to wear with a number on it. Frank grew up to be a respected dentist on Bainbridge Island, and Frank has done personally what this legislation will do nationally. He has spent many years going around showing a collection of photographs telling young students why the protection of our civil liberties is critical and why we should never be overcome by fear again, and I pay respects to Frank and his efforts. 
   Another young woman at the time, who testified several months ago, who has been pivotal in this effort, Fumiko Hayashida, shown with her daughter here just before she was marched down that pier. Fumiko came to town, who is 95 years young, who is the oldest internee that we are aware of, to send Congress a message to make a national statement to memorialize this. 
   Now, there are three reasons I think it is important that we pass this bill. 
   First, although this was a tragic episode in American history, it was an episode involving patriotism because, and this is incredible to me, of the 227 people marched down that pier, 62 of them turned around and volunteered to serve their nation in World War II, and 62 of these people served with distinction. These people were the ultimate patriots. Having been sent to camps by Uncle Sam, to turn around and fight for the freedoms to which they were not entitled was the ultimate act of patriotism, and we honor them as an act of patriotism in this memorial. 
   Second, it is a memorialization of their neighbors. Many of their neighbors rallied around them. Many of their neighbors guarded some of their equipment to wait for them to come home. And Walt Widward, the publisher of the Bainbridge Island Review, was the only publisher on the western coast of the United States to editorialize against this violation of American values. That is something to memorialize. 
   But, most importantly, Nidoto Nai Yoni, never let it happen again. And this will be a statement to ourselves,  to our children, to our grandchildren, that, when we are in fear in this country, we should never lose that anchor of American civil rights and civil liberties in respect to what we are as Americans. 
   We have gone through these days in the last several years. We have experienced fear that sometimes has infected the discussion here in the Chamber; and when we go through and deal with our fears today, I think it is well that we take a lesson from history of 1942 to hew to the power of liberty, rather than the power of fear. 
   So I am happy today that we will pass this bill that will make this part of our National Parks System. I will invite all Americans to come visit us in Bainbridge Island. We will invite the world to come see that America is a country that makes mistakes but learns and improves. And this is a continuation of that American tradition of improving the American value system. So I am happy today this House will take this step. 
   I want to thank the Bainbridge Island community and all of those who worked on this project. Clarence Moriwaki, who has led the effort on Bainbridge Island, congratulations. And congratulations to America for always being an improving country.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (PROPOSED CHANGES TO MEDIA OWNERSHIP RULES IN SEATTLE, WASHINGTON -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, last Friday, the FCC held the last of six public hearings about proposed changes to media ownership rules. They did so in Seattle after I called for that meeting so that people in the State of Washington could let their government know what they thought. It was really an unbelievable showing at this hearing. The FCC callously only gave them 5 days' notice. But still it is estimated that 1,000 people showed up on a Friday night for a 9-hour hearing that ended up at 1 a.m. on Saturday morning. 
   Most Friday nights Americans won't be going out to hearings. But in Puget Sound country, and indeed across the country, people understand how important a media consolidation could be as a threat to our diversity and our democracy, and 1,000 people showed up to testify. I encouraged my constituents to attend. I want to credit Reclaim the Media, the Free Press and the Seattle Times who also got the word out about this important hearing. 
   At the hearing, FCC Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein prophetically stated that if the FCC quickly proposed a new rule, ``you know your input was dismissed.'' He was right, unfortunately. Despite the protestations of almost every single witness in Seattle on Friday displaying the overwhelming sentiment against this consolidation, on Tuesday, one business day later, Chairman Martin announced his plans to end a 32-year-old ban on radio and television broadcasters owning newspapers in the Nation's largest media markets, including right in Seattle where 1,000 people asked him not to do so. 
   The fact that Mr. Martin had an op-ed piece published in Tuesday's New York Times just a couple days later shows this was clearly a preordained decision and that appearance in Seattle was just a stunt, and, frankly, an insulting one to the citizens who attended. He went through the motions, but Seattle people did not. 
   Now, those people knew that weakening the ownership rules would allow the media landscape to be dominated by a few massive corporations, putting too much control in a few hands and producing a system where only the powerful can be heard in our democracy. It would lead to a lack of diversity of voices, programming that is out of touch with local concerns, as well as a continuation of the homogenization of our news and our entertainment. 
   Already, consolidation has brought us to the point where in the average radio market, two companies control 70 percent of market revenue. That is why the Senate voted to overturn the first try, the first run that Mr. Martin and then-Chairman Powell took in 2003 to loosen these rules. It is why a Federal court tossed out the ill-advised rules in the Prometheus decision, and it is why we need to stop a second attempt to do the same thing that 1,000 people in Seattle asked to be stopped. 
   Therefore, I am working with my colleague, Congressman MAURICE HINCHEY, to reintroduce our legislation that would derail Commissioner Martin's cross-ownership scheme that is so contrary to the wishes of the public. Mr. Martin claims that his proposal is a modest one. In fact, it would impact half of Americans who live in the top 20 media markets and could impact even more with possible waivers and exemptions. I wish 1,000 voices in Seattle and thousands more in hearings across the Nation would have knocked some sense into a particular commissioner, maybe three of them on the FCC who are heck-bent, or perhaps hell-bent, on loosening media consolidation rules. 
   Now that this Federal agency has disclosed its real plan to move ahead with a plan that runs so counter to public sentiment and the public interest, the time has come for Congress to weigh in. We are one voice that the  FCC can't tune out. It is time for Congress to act. Let's make sure the will of the American people is heard, not just this preordained stunt by an FCC commissioner.

   Mr. INSLEE. Thanks, Mr. Blumenauer, for leading this discussion. You know, when people come through the Capitol here, you can see them beaming with pride of the Capitol, and it's because we lead the world in democracy and people feel good about this building. Now, they're going to have another reason to feel good about the U.S. Capitol and the House of Representatives, because we intend to be the greenest parliamentary Chamber in the world. And, in fact, we probably will become the first zero carbon, become a carbon-neutral legislative body, the first in the world. And that's something that America can take pride in. And we're accomplishing that because we want to, on a bipartisan basis, do these commonsense things to try to reduce our CO  
   2 emissions. 
   And we're doing that. Switching from coal, first, to natural gas in our power plant, which reduces carbon dioxide something like 20 to 30 percent. We're then taking a look at the possibility of going to a totally renewable fuel of wood pellets grown in New Hampshire and some other places which would go to essentially zero CO  
   2 on a net basis.
   Under the leadership of Nancy Pelosi and Dan Beard, we're having a green cafeteria. A new contract's been let so our cafeteria reduces by 50 percent the matter of waste. And when you reduce waste, you quit using energy.

And the importance of this waste disposal from a global warming position is that every time you reduce the amount of waste you throw away by a ton, you reduce the amount of carbon dioxide going into the atmosphere by two tons by not wasting all that production and energy associated with it. 
   So what we're doing in this House is doing what a picture I have here of Mike and Meg Town of their home in Redmond, Washington, one the rainiest places in the United States, who built a home that's essentially carbon neutral. By doing the same kinds of things they're doing in their house, we're now going to do in the people's House, which is to use some commonsense waste disposal systems, decent insulation, energy-efficient lighting, energy-efficient heating and cooling system. They use solar photovoltaics to get to a carbon neutral house. 
   People are doing this across the country. I'm proud to say we're starting to do it in this House. And I know I'd like to yield to Mr. Farr who can help us on that.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (GREEN THE CAPITOL INITIATIVE -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Well, the point I would like to make is to point out why these things are happening. They're happening because of leadership. We have leadership from the top with Speaker  Nancy Pelosi who, when she assumed office I think in the first week or two, said we're going to have a green House of Representatives, and we're going to save money in the process. And she had a good leader, Dan Beard, take charge of this. 
   And the reason I point this out is that you look at, in corporate America we see similar leadership. The President of Dow Chemical, who 10 years ago basically said we're going to save money, they have now reduced their energy usage by at least 30 percent, and they intend to reduce it another 20 percent. And when I asked him, Why did you do this? He said, Really simple, it saves money. 
   British Petroleum, a petroleum and oil company under the leadership of former Chairman Sir Henry Brown, had reduced their usage of energy and saved $300 million and actually met what would have been their CO  
   2 emissions target. It happens because of leadership. 
   And I want to comment on one thing the House is doing as well. We are committing to buying green electricity. That means electricity that is generated by non-CO  
   2-emitting sources. And I just want to make a point. This is not something that is just a pipe dream; it is really happening. 
   I want to show two types of technology that are working today. One, I want to show a solar thermal technology. This is a solar thermal technology manufactured by the Ausra Energy Company. The Ausra Energy Company just signed contracts with the Florida Public Power and Light Company and the California Public Utility for over 400 megawatts. That's enough to do over 400,000 homes of pure CO  
   2 solar energy. And the way this works is, they've discovered a way to manufacture mirrors that are flat, that are very inexpensive, that focus the radian energy of the sun on a pipe that has water or a liquid metal in it, very long sheaths here. This is several acres of mirrors. This hot water then makes steam, the steam makes CO 
   2-emitting energy. And they intend to make this for prices competitive with coal within the decade. 
   Now, I point this out for our Members in the Chamber who think we can't do solar power in Florida. It's happening in Florida now, and in California. And if people think that this is some type of thing that just the hemp-wearing folks of America believe in, people are going to make money on this, because for every two acres of these mirrors, you can power 1,000 homes. This is not just to run your little fan, it's to run all of your electricity in your house. And that's what we intend to do in this House, because this House, under the leadership of Nancy Pelosi, understands the future of technology to allow this. 
   I want to point out just one other technology that has the capability of helping in this regard, and I will show just a quick story. 
   This is a picture of the Imperium biodiesel company. 
   It's called Imperium Energy. It's in Grays Harbor, WA. You see these tanks here; this is where biodiesel, which is essentially a zero CO  
   2-emitting biodiesel plant, that's in a former failing lumber town that has now reinvigorated the economy of Grays Harbor, WA. It happened because a guy named John Plaza had the guts and the vision to go out and buy some old vats from the Rainier Brewery in Seattle, WA, I used to be a fan of Rainier Brewery, for various reasons, and built himself, in his garage, in a little warehouse, a biodiesel plant, then went out and raised some venture capital and has now built the largest biodiesel plant in the world in Grays Harbor, Washington. And he is now going to be providing biodiesel, going to probably have 10 to 30 plants like this around the country. 
   Now, our proposal in the House to go to a green economy is based on the genius of guys like John Plaza, who know how to blend technology with venture capital and go out and make a buck and help us provide green technology. And this is what we're doing in the House, and I'm excited about it. And I think there is a reason to be proud of it. 
   I wonder if I could yield to Mr. George Miller, who has been instrumental in this program.

   Mr. INSLEE. I want to just express an experience that we have had and these companies that have gone down this route have had. Two things they've learned: Number one, hardly anybody gripes about it. I mean it's amazing. We have done all these things we have been talking about here tonight, changing the coal plant, changing the cafeteria, changing paper usage, changing lighting usage, changing some of our transportation usage, and, frankly, nobody is griping about it. We have got 435 people here griping about everything from the weather to the price of bananas, but none of our Members are griping about this because we are finding out that we can accommodate our businesses and our lifestyles just fine if we do this. And businesses have learned this as well. That's the first rule of greening an organization. 
   The second rule is that people find out that virtue is cumulative. When people take one little step forward, they get into it, and then they take another step, and then they take another step. And companies continue. That's why Dow Chemical, even though they have been spectacularly successful in reducing their energy use by 20, 30 percent, they are going to get another 20, 30 percent because people get excited about it, and we're seeing that. 
   I wanted to just touch on transportation that Mr. Blumenauer was talking about. Mr. Boehner was criticizing this effort to give our employees flexibility to use cars. I want to mention two technologies that I think can help reinvent our transportation system in America. 
   One is we are now testing a software system in Seattle which will give you instantaneous ride-sharing so that on your text message or your BlackBerry, you can say I want to go to this theater, get my ride, and this software system will patch you through to whoever is going in that direction. In 5 minutes, boom, you've got a ride. And that system has incredible promise to reduce congestion and reduce your cost of transportation if we can all start sharing rides in that regard. And I'm very excited about this. It has just gone in the first stage of trials. 
   The second technology I want to mention, this is well beyond the House, but I want Members to know about this. We are having this discussion about improving average fuel economy standards. In the next 2 weeks, hopefully, we will have it on this floor for debating on. But I think the capability exists to blow way beyond anything that we have even thought about in fuel mileage. We're arguing about whether we can get 35 miles a gallon. I drive a car today that gets 45 miles a gallon. I'm six-two, 200 pounds. It's a five-passenger car. It's very convenient and it's safe.     
   We have a technology coming on in 5 or 6 years in cars that are on the road today called plug-in hybrid cars, and I learned about them when I was writing this book that Mr. Blumenauer talked about. It is plug-in hybrid technology. And here is a car that General Motors has. It is in reality. Here is a picture of it. It is the GM Volt. They want to have it on the road, mass production in  5 or 6 years. And the way it works is using an incredible battery technology. You plug it in at night; it has a little port. You plug it in, charge it for 6 to 8 hours. You unplug it in the morning, go about your driving. You can drive 40 miles with just electricity, no gasoline, no ethanol, just pure juice out of your plug. And it costs two-thirds less per mile than gasoline. 
   Now, if you want to drive more than 40 miles, then you have a hybrid engine like the one in the car I am driving, in the Ford Escape or Toyota Prius. It will take you wherever you want to go for 200, 300 miles. Someday it will burn cellulosic ethanol as well as gasoline. Right now these cars are on the road today. I've driven one on the Capitol grounds. They get 100 miles per gallon of gasoline today. When you drive it with ethanol, you will get 500 miles of gasoline. And the electricity you use will get cleaner over time. This car will get better over time as the electric grid becomes cleaner. You start using more solar power, more wind power, you actually put out less carbon. Nothing gets better in life as it gets older except wine and a plug-in electric car. 
   I point this out because when we have this debate on the House floor in a few weeks, some people are going to say, Gee, I don't know if we can get to 35. Baloney. Hogwash. We have scads of cars that get 10 or 15 over that today, and you have a car that is going to get 100 miles per gallon in 5 or 6 years. This is something we can do in this new spirit in the House led by Nancy Pelosi, to head down this route to the future, is one people are going to be happy with, and they have.

   Mr. INSLEE. I want to note as far as cycling, as a biker myself, the things we are talking about in a lot of communities that are improving their bike options, we are just giving people options. This is not the storm troopers coming down making everybody ride a bike. We are talking about giving Americans more options in how to get to work and back. This is one that in my town of Seattle, every year there are scads more people riding bikes.

   Mr. INSLEE. Almost, to compliment Mr. Blumenauer's hometown, Portland, Oregon, is the first city in the United States to reduce the number of miles that people drive per capita. And that is a fundamental achievement, and I know how they have done it because they have visionary leadership, Mr. Blumenauer included; they have more public transportation options with light rail and buses, more bike options, better land use, planning that allows people to live close to public transportation options, and they are well on their way to meeting the CO  
   2 targets that they have set. And it has happened because they have simply given people options. They haven't told people what to do. They just gave people a smorgasbord, and people did what was comfortable for them. A lot of it is bicycling, if they can catch Mr. Blumenauer.

   Mr. INSLEE. Just one general one, and that is that the reason our approach to greening the Capitol works is that we are the optimists in this debate. We are the people who believe that options exist, that technologies will continue to grow, and as a result of that, Americans will have more choices of how they use energy and how they produce energy. 
   We have mentioned some of those new technologies tonight. I will just give you an example of a couple I've learned about in the last year about how to produce green electricity. We have made a commitment to buy green electricity for the U.S. House of Representatives. I just want to mention a couple of new ways to produce it. 
   One is wave power. If you have ever watched a big ship bob up and down on the waves, you understand how much power there is on the ocean. We have people capturing that energy and able to create electricity. This is a picture of a buoy. A similar one is going off the coast of Oregon this fall. The first wave power buoys in the world to be deployed were in Hawaii and are now powering some naval stations. 
   These are designed to essentially capture energy. As these buoys bob up and down, they compress water or air, creating pressure, which drives a generator, creates electricity, goes to the shore on a wire. Each have the capability to power close to 1,000 homes. There is enough energy in the waves in a 10-by-10-mile stretch off the Pacific Coast to produce all of the electricity for the State of California. 
   We are not guaranteed these are going to work because we have to make sure they can survive the terrible stresses at sea. But according to the Department of Energy, they have the capacity to produce 10 percent of all the electrical usage in the United States. I point this out because this technology wasn't even dreamed of 10 years ago. 
   Now, we have another option that could be available to Americans that right now, big investment, there's a lot of private investment in these companies. A company Finavera in Washington, a company called Ocean Power Technologies, there is a company associated with Oregon State University in Mr. Blumenauer's State. All work different approaches to this. 
   A second one that is intended to capture the power of the oceans are tidal-powered turbines that work sort of like a wind turbine, but they work on the currents that are driven by the tides. This is a picture of one. This is one by Verdant Power that works just like a wind turbine, but uses water through the blades instead of wind. Verdant actually has these in the East River in New York City. They are actually powering a grocery store right now with electricity. 
   We found out when the first six went in the water, there's actually more power than they knew, which actually disabled some of these so they have got to rebuild them to make them stronger, which is good news because there is more power than they thought. 
   We have someone in the State of Washington looking at potentially powering 50,000 homes with these tidal turbines now in the estuaries of Puget Sound. 
   I just point this out that we believe there are numerous options; we believe there are technologies that are going to free us from the constraints of the past. We are proving it in the U.S. Capitol. You can look at the dome and see the citadel of democracy and the citadel of new ways to save energy and produce it. I think Americans can be proud of that. I think we have a right to be a little bit, too. 
   Mr. Blumenauer, I thank you for your leadership on this and in leading in discussion.

   Mr. INSLEE. We know we can do this. We know, because we have had success. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, we improved our mileage of our cars by 60 percent. Then in 1994 those efforts stopped and we stopped making any progress. Our cars are getting actually less mileage than they did in 1984. If we had simply continued on that rate of improvement, we would be free of Saudi Arabian oil today. Now we have got to get back on this bandwagon of using our brains to get better mileage. We know we can do this.  
   Just as a closing comment, I want to express my appreciation to the Americans doing this. We are not the only ones doing this in the Capitol. I know a woman on Bainbridge Island that greened up her home. I would like to say we're meeting that bar here in the House. 
   Again, thank you, Mr. Blumenauer.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - November 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I come to the House this evening to discuss our great irony about our position in the world right now, economically and environmentally. 
   The irony is that we face some real challenges that touch on our energy-based economy, and I think those challenges are obvious to us tonight, a challenge as oil approaches $100 a barrel, $3 a gallon, and there's no relief in sight. 
   Americans right now are feeling the pinch associated with fossil fuel costs going up. We have a challenge in that we still are addicted to Middle Eastern oil as a principal source of oil, and as long as we are addicted to oil we will have a problem being wrapped around the axle of the Middle East. 
   And we have the problem of global warming, which is something that is becoming increasingly clear to us, not with scientific research but with our own eyes. In fact, I was pretty stunned to see the photographs of the arctic this summer where 1 million square miles of the arctic disappeared this summer, totally shocking the scientific community. An area the size of six Californias disappeared, melted unexpectedly in the arctic this summer. 
   And, of course, that's a big concern because the arctic ice cap is sort of like a big sunshade. It reflects energy back into space. Now that it's gone in the summer, or substantial portions of it, the oceans are absorbing six to ten times more energy, having a pernicious feedback loop, making the problem even worse. 
   In fact, if you look at the projections prepared by the scientific community showing the arctic ice cap in the year 2000, if you project up to the year 2040, the scientific community basically has found the arctic ice cap will be gone in the late summer months, essentially in my children's lifetime certainly. 
   And the results of these three challenges that we have, increasing fossil fuel prices, our addiction to Middle Eastern oil and global warming, are certainly great challenges and ought to give us pause. 
   But I'm here to talk about optimism rather than fear because the great  irony is that these three challenges have the capacity to ignite one of the most positive developments in the U.S. economy ever, and that is sparking the potential clean energy revolution that we're not accustomed to enjoying in the United States.     
   Our situation is a little bit like it was in the 1960s. If you recall, in the early 1960s, when John F. Kennedy came and stood right behind me here on May 25, 1961, and said that we would put a man on the Moon in 10 years and bring him back safely, that was a very bold and audacious thing to say. At the time, rockets were blowing up on the launch pad, and our computers were in rudimentary stages. We were way behind the Russians. We just put Spam in a can up. We hadn't even invented Tang yet. 
   But we were driven to going to the Moon by a challenge, the challenge with the Russians, and the need for technological imminence that the Americans felt we deserved and had a destiny to fulfill. Indeed, we did fulfill that destiny when we went to the Moon in the original Apollo project. 
   Now we have these challenges involving oil and global warming that we can use to the same effect as Kennedy used the challenge in the space race, and that effect is to rally the United States of America to a brighter future and a higher destiny to use our technological genius to develop a clean energy future for the United States of America. 
   I am here tonight to share some of the good news that is extant across the United States in all 50 States where tonight there are men and women of genius and entrepreneurial perseverance and business acumen that are building the technology that allows us to beat global warming, break our addiction to Middle Eastern oil and, third, grow millions of new jobs in the clean energy economy that we intend to build. 
   I will here tonight, when we conclude, finish by saying we will be able to achieve the same level of technological leap forward as Kennedy achieved in space. We will do for energy what Kennedy did for space. 
   If I can, let me talk about some of the things I have learned in the last year. I have been proposing a bill called the New Apollo Energy Act for some time and, of course, writing a book called ``Apollo's Fire,'' I met a lot of people around the country who are now engaged in this great challenge. I would like to share with my colleagues and the public tonight what I found. 
   First I want to address the issue of our cars. We got great cars. My favorite is a 1956 Chevy, always was, always will be, but we know that we have a great problem that 40 percent of the carbon dioxide emitted as global warming gases come from our cars and trucks. We know that we are paying $3 a gallon and it's going to go up. We know that we are taking our money and putting it in the pump machine, and it's going right to the Middle East to finance people who are attacking us. 
   We need to reinvent the car. We need to take a bold leap forward in technology to find a new way to propel the car in a more efficient way. I am here tonight to say that we have the ability to do that in the immediate future. 
   I want to share with you a picture of a car called the General Motors Volt. This is a prototype of a car that General Motors hopes to have in mass production 5 or 6 years from now. It is a plug-in hybrid vehicle. A plug-in hybrid vehicle, this car is quite stylish, and this physically exists. I actually brought this car to show to my colleagues several months ago. Thanks to General Motors, it exists physically. 
   The way this car works is that it has a tremendous combination of advance battery technology and hybrid drive train technology that allows it to be plugged in at night. When you have this car, you will be able to take it home, put it in the garage, plug it in. The next morning you unplug it. You can drive it for up to 40 miles on total electrical propulsion, no CO  
   2, no gasoline for the first 40 miles. 
   The beauty of that, and the importance of that, is that when you operate on electricity from the electrical grid, it may cost as little as 1 to 3 cents a mile for fuel. It costs 9 cents-plus a mile or more for gasoline now, and it's absolutely clean while you are driving the car. Now, obviously there is some CO  
   2 involved in the production of the electricity, but I will get to that in a moment, so it's basically very inexpensive. 
   Because over 60 percent of all the daily driving is under 40 miles, over half of the daily trips that Americans take will be pure electrical propulsion. Then if you want to drive more than 40 miles before you get home to recharge, you have a hybrid engine similar to the hybrid engines now used in both domestic and foreign manufacturers, to basically use a combination of fuel, and right now it's gasoline, someday it will be cellulosic ethanol, and electricity residual in the batteries to drive until you fill up your tank again or you get back to get recharged. 
   When these cars are produced, we will get over 100 miles a gallon of gasoline. This won't be some small marginal increments, and you know right now we are debating whether to improve our corporate average fuel efficiency standards up to 35 miles a gallon in 10 or 15 years. These are going to blow right by that. It's going to blow right through the things we are debating right now and leapfrog that technology that is actually available today. 
   Cars like this are on the road today being driven. I have driven one. They use a lithium ion battery manufactured by the A123 Systems in Massachusetts. People have taken the Toyota Prius. I drive a Toyota Prius. It is a great car. I am 62", 200 pounds; comfortable, safe, quiet, works like a dream for us. Folks have taken these Priuses and converted them into a plug-in hybrid car today. They are driving around the streets of America. 
   I drove the first one that was commercially sold. We are going to have them in mass production in several years, and that's why it's important for this Chamber to send a signal to the auto industry that we are going to have a legal requirement that will improve the economy, and it will be simple to do and economical as well. Economical, because when these are in mass production, they may cost a couple of thousand dollars more than if you didn't have this technology, but you are going to save three or four times that amount in fuel costs later on. 
   A double bonus of these cars is that as you drive them, as the grid electricity gets cleaner, because as we move to solar thermal energy and wind power energy and other sources, perhaps clean coal energy, we will have less CO  
   2 emissions so the car will actually get cleaner. I mean, except wine, this will be the only thing that gets better with age and put out less CO 
   2 over time. 
   A triple bonus, according to people who have studied this, these cars have the potential to help the electrical grid where utilities can essentially use the batteries in the car in the garage at night to store energy. Your utility can be generating wind power at night or wave power at night or any kind of power at night, feed that energy into your battery and rent your battery in your garage. 
   Economists who studied this think the day may come when you are paid $2,000 or $3,000 a year essentially for the temporary rental of your battery once your battery becomes part of the electrical grid. There are companies today in my town of Seattle, Washington, who are developing the software to do that. 
   The point I think is important to make is that as we talk about setting caps on carbon dioxide, as we talk 
   about increasing mileage requirements for our cars, we ought to have optimism and we ought to have confidence and we ought to recognize what Kennedy did about the can-do spirit of America, that that spirit is going to build us cars that can radically improve our mileage and radically reduce CO  
   2 and then become a source of exports so we can start exporting these cars around the world. 
   Why can't we sell these cars to China? We can, if, in fact, we will start sending the signals from this Chamber to the industry that this is going to be very achievable. It makes sense once we limit carbon dioxide. 
   Now, this isn't the only solution to our car woes. General Motors, Ford, Honda, various other companies are also looking at electrifying the car and using a fuel cell hydrogen source to essentially generate the electricity to run electrical motors. That may be as good or better as lithium ion batteries.  It is probably a little further away from commercialization due to the storage issues of hydrogen and the distribution needs for the distribution system of hydrogen, but it is another alternative that at least one company intends to have commercially available in the next several years. 
   So we now are ready to have leapfrog technology. It's because of the genius of Americans, and it's getting ready to go, and we should not be fearful in this Chamber. We should be confident of our ability to reinvent the car, thanks in part to guys like Felix Kramer, who essentially built one of these in his garage in California and dared Detroit and the rest of the auto industry internationally to build one, and that's going to happen now. 
   So we know we can reinvent the car. But where do we get the energy for the electrical grid to energize these electrical cars? Well, the good news is that the genius of people building cars is matched by the genius of people figuring out how to generate electricity. I have been stunned in the last year, as I have studied this, and as I have gone around talking to people across America, I have been stunned with the rapidity of the developments that are taking place in the clean electricity field. You literally cannot turn over a rock in this country and not find someone developing a technology that is helping to find a way to generate electricity cleanly. 
   I want to relate a little story of a company I heard about months ago. It's a company called Ausra Energy, Ausra. Ausra is owned largely by a fellow named Vinod Khosla, who is a fellow who was very instrumental in the development of software, founded Sun Microsystems, was very successful, and now has taken his talents to the field of clean energy. 
   Mr. Khosla has now looked at all of the potential places where we can develop clean energy, recognizing that the world is going to demand these new technologies. He is a person, as many of the other people will talk about tonight, who did very well in software and Internet, and now see the same potential in the clean energy world as existed in software and Internet. They recognized a market opportunity, and they recognized that there are technological solutions that can fulfill these market opportunities. 
   A fellow named John O'Donnell sent me an e-mail, who is one of the leaders of the Ausra Company, and it was a really happy e-mail to get. I will tell you why. I was on this floor the first week in August when we were debating what's called a renewable portfolio standard, and in the energy bill that we eventually passed in the House in August, which is a great bill by the way, a good start on this proposal, we were working to get a provision that would call for 15 percent of our electricity to be generated by clean renewable sources by the year 2020. 
   Of course, we talked to each other on the floor, and I was talking to some of my colleagues from the State of Florida. They were explaining to me, and I was saying, well, you know, there are a lot of different sources of clean energy, biofuels, wave power, clean coal technology. Efficiency in conservation is a form of what we call the first fuel and solar power. When I said that, one of my colleagues from Florida said we can't do solar power in Florida. 
   I thought that was a little curious because I thought the license plate said Florida, the Sunshine State, but he explained that because they have some clouds in Florida, it's not as productive a solar field as perhaps the deserts of Arizona. In fact, that is true. Arizona might be 10 or 15 percent better than Florida. 
   But, a few weeks later, I was talking to Mr. Khosla, who told me that his technology has a perfect fit for Florida, it's called Ausra. This is a picture of the Ausra thermal solar generator. The way the Ausra system works is that it is an array of mirrors. These blue long lines are essentially flat-panel mirrors, long arrays. They are quite long. As you can see these mirrors concentrate the sun's energy on a little pipe. You can see this pipe running about here above the long mirrors, and these are all focusing the reflected rays of the sun on that pipe. It heats water and eventually creates steam, and the steam turns a turbine, just like a coal-fired plant would, and generates electricity. 
   Now, this Ausra technology could be and is, as far as we can tell right now, probably the least expensive of the solar thermal technologies that are being considered. The reason Mr. Khosla explained it to me is because they discovered a way to make these mirrors flat rather than concave, and they can make them a lot cheaper. The other provisions have a concave surface to them. They are much more expensive to manufacture.     
   Well, as a result of these and other improvements they made, Mr. Khosla's company just signed for ten, I believe, hundreds of megawatts with the Florida public, with a Florida public power utility for the production of zero CO  
   2 emitting solar thermal energy. So here we have a situation in a State that at least some folks didn't think we could produce solar energy, and within weeks we have a contract with a major league, a Florida utility to produce electricity for thousands of people in Florida. And this stuff's powerful. In every 2 acres of these mirrors, you can do somewhere between, you can provide enough electricity for somewhere between 750 and 1,000 homes. This is not just, you know, powering just your fan. It's real electricity. 
   And now I got an e-mail from Mr. O'Donnell 3 days ago that, in fact, a contract has also been signed, a major public utility in California. And the sky's the limit. Now, this power's a little more expensive than coal-based power now, but the folks who run this company believe that can be competitive in just a matter of a few years once the cost of investment capital comes down and their scales of economy, and the fact that the prices of fossil fuels have not exactly been coming down, witness the price of gasoline. 
   So in a very few years, this technology has the capability to be as inexpensive or less expensive than traditional fossil fuel-based systems with zero CO  
   2 emissions without sending our money to Saudi Arabia and without digging up anything in the ground. That's a pretty good deal. 
   Now, there are other companies besides OSRA that have similar technology, and there are contracts being let around the country for them as well. So we have the potential, not the potential, but the existence of real energy. This is not a pipe dream. This exists in reality. And we have the right to be excited about it. 
   Now, there are many other ways to produce potentially clean energy. One of those potentially is clean coal technology, and research is going on, as we speak, in the potential of being able to take coal, gasify it, draw off the carbon dioxide, take the carbon dioxide and inject it underground into permanent geological sequestration, and then burn coal without any CO  
   2 emissions of any significant amount. And that research is expensive, and it is not a guarantee that this tip of technology will be commercially viable. But it is a distinct possibility. 
   In fact, an MIT researcher that reviewed this believed it was probable that this type of sequestration technology, putting CO  
   2 underground in either large saline aquifers underground or in two or three other types of geological formations, that we would be able to do this in many, many places in the United States in commercially viable costs. 
   Now, that technology's being developed too. There's a company called Ramgen Corporation in Seattle, Washington, that has developed a compression technology that costs 30 percent less money that could make this commercially viable to allow true clean coal to occur. And it strikes me that research to make that determination whether this can be done is appropriate investment. 
   Now, this is to be distinguished from something you might hear called coal-to-liquid, which is a very different thing. Coal-to-liquid is turning the coal into a liquid and then burning the liquid. When you just burn the liquid, for instance, in an airplane motor or a car motor, you end up putting CO  
   2 right back into the air. So coal-to-liquid is not an improvement from a global warming perspective. 
   What we call clean coal, where the CO  
   2, from its production is actually sequestered underground, is a marked improvement in global warming, and that's another technology that we are  looking at. But there are a host of others, and some of them are off our coastline. And I learned about these technologies in the last year in the course of my research and in the preparation of the new Apollo Energy Act that I've cosponsored. 
   Off of our coastline in our estuaries, we have enormous amounts of energy in the waves and in the tides. And I have a picture here of some of the technologies that are now under development to harness that energy. And to have a, just to get a sense of the energy that is in our waves, if you've ever been thrashed in the surf like I have, you get some sense of how much energy is in a wave. But it's truly awesome. 
   In a 10-by-10-mile stretch of the coast of the Pacific, just in a 10-by-10-mile square, there is enough energy in the waves that could power all the electrical needs for the State of California. That's big-time energy. And the Department of Energy has concluded that if we can commercialize wave power technology, it could produce even in excess of 10 percent of all the electrical needs of the United States. So there's an awesome amount of energy off the waves. 
   In fact, the Pacific Coast of the United States happens to be the, happily, the single most beneficial prospective place for wave power in the world. This has actually been mapped. There are maps of the wave power all around the world, and the best in place in the world is off the Pacific Coast. 
   So now we have brilliant Americans developing technology to harness that. We have a picture of some of them here. A buoy developed by Ocean Power Technology. As this buoy bobs up and down, it compresses air that then compresses, essentially, hydraulic fluid and drives an electrical generator. 
   There are others from a company called Finavera that uses a system as the buoy bobs up and down, it pressurizes a column of water that then turns a generator. There are others that look like these large snakes. As they undulate and move up and down, they, through mechanical transference of energy, basically run a generator that then through a wire sends the electricity back to the coast. 
   Now, the first of these in the Continental United States has now gone in the water off the coast of Oregon. We have them off the, actually powering Navy bases in Hawaii right now that have been in the water now for over a year. We're learning a lot from them. We're learning that there's a lot of energy there. And, in fact, as you might imagine, we've learned that you've got to make them incredibly strong to withstand the forces of the sea. 
   Now, people, we cannot guarantee that this technology is going to be commercially viable. It is an infant industry. But we know, with the energy available in the waves, and we know the advances we can make, I think it is a reasonable opportunity that justifies investment in this technology, and, in fact, the private sector is making a very large investment in this technology. 
   Now, there's another type of power called tidal power which involves currents, harnessing the currents that are driven by the tides, by the Moon, of course. You know, this is kind of lunar energy. The Moons run the tides. And we now have technology using turbines that look like underwater wind turbines. There's a picture of one here manufactured by a company called Verdant that is now in the East River in New York. 
   These essentially work like wind turbines that you've seen. As the tide moves in and out, and of course it's very predictable and happens every day, it spins this turbine very slowly, so it has a minimal impact on marine life and generates the electricity. And these are actually in the water. 
   Now it's interesting, we found out there's so much energy in these currents these have had to be rebuilt, which is a good sign, essentially, because we found out there's more energy than we knew. So we have substantial energy off of our coastlines that we have potential for capturing. 
   Now, a lot of people thought ocean energy is where wind energy was about 20 years ago. About 20 years ago, people started to put up these wind mills and generate electricity from them. And when they started, a lot of people thought they were kind of wacky. It was very expensive at the time. It was a new idea and the oil and gas folks kind of laughed at them. That was 20 years ago. 
   During this succeeding 20 years, we've had continuing improvements of the technology, and now we have wind turbines over 300-foot in height powering over 1,000 homes apiece, producing electricity that is as cheap as any electricity in the Nation. 
   Today, in the State of Washington, where I hail from, in southeast Washington, we have the largest wind farm in the Western Hemisphere producing electricity as cheap as coal-fired electricity. And now it is the largest most rapidly growing form of energy in the United States, and it has still huge potential to grow because we have enormous resources of wind. In fact, it's growing so fast that the wind turbine manufacturers cannot keep up. 
   And I'd like to tell the story of an American company called Clipper Wind. Clipper Wind tonight has several hundred Iowans working in Cedar Rapids building clipper wind turbines; good, well-paid American jobs now spinning, and these are also being exported around the world, producing exactly zero CO  
   2 emitting wind energy. And these are American jobs. 
   And that's what this is about. Whether it's plug-in hybrid cars or solar thermal technology, or wind turbine technology, these are American jobs that we're building. But we're only going to build them if Congress starts to adopt the policies that drive investment into these technologies, rather than just the fossil fuel industry. And that's why we need to take some of these subsidies we've given to the oil and gas industry and we did it in the House bill we passed some time ago, $16 billion, reel it back in and put it into a fund to help some of these nascent industries grow. 
   And we need a renewable portfolio standard to send a message to the investment community that they can invest in these technologies, because we know there's going to be a demand for them. And we need a cap and trade system so that we don't allow polluting industries to put their carbon dioxide and their pollution in unlimited amounts into the atmosphere. And when those things happen, there will be a gold rush, a flood tide of investment capital into the companies that are developing these technologies. That's what they need. They've got the brilliance. As soon as they have the investment capital, they're going to take off. And as soon as the demand is obvious, investment capital will flow. 
   I talked to a fellow named John Plaza. He was here three days. John has a really interesting story. He was an airline pilot, and he said he sort of got bored going back and forth. I know what it feels like because I fly back and forth every Monday and Friday. And he decided he wanted to try something new. So he went out and decided he was going to start brewing up biodiesel fuel, literally in his garage, and started to figure out a way to make biodiesel. And he actually came to believe it was commercially viable. So he went and found an investor, a fellow named Martin Tobias, who was successful at Microsoft; raised some capital, built a little plant on the shores of the Duwamish River in Washington. Really wasn't much to look at. Just your typical little tilt-up warehouse. 
   John was pretty creative. He went to the Rainier Brewing Company, the iconic Big R in Seattle, and he bought two big huge brewing vats from the Rainier Brewing Company, and he moved them down to this little warehouse and he designed a way himself on how to filter some of the material out of biodiesel when you refine it. And he started refining biodiesel, and he started selling it. 
   Well, that was last year. This year he is leading and has constructed the largest biodiesel plant in the world that puts out 100 million gallons of biodiesel at Grays Harbor, Washington, a town that's experienced some economic hardship because of the decline of the timber industry. And John, in his genius and his business acumen, has built a business hiring people in Washington State, now going to be shipping biodiesel all around. They just signed a deal with a distributor to start distributing it. And the very first committed biodiesel pump from this group called Propel was installed in Ballard, Washington, just a couple of weeks ago. 
   So here's good old American know-how, can-do spirit, developing a whole  new industry. And the biofuel industry has a very bright future.     
   I would like to talk just for a moment about biofuels. We know we have corn ethanol today in abundance, and 23 percent of all the corn grown in the United States now goes to ethanol. And it's been productive. The price of gasoline actually would have been worse if we hadn't had that ethanol available. It's bad enough as it is. 
   But the good news I want to share with you is that we have tremendous cause for optimism that we are going to grow second, third, and fourth generations of ethanol. They're going to be much more productive than corn ethanol that we are using now because the corn ethanol we use now only uses the kernel, a very small part of the total plant. Scientists have now developed ways to use the entire plant, all of the carbohydrates in the plant, what they call the corn stover, switchgrass, and some advanced feedstocks that have the capability to be four or five times as productive per acre as corn. 
   And I was at a company called Mendel Biotechnology in Hayward, California, a few weeks ago that have developed a grass called Miscanthus. Miscanthus grows about 10 or 12 feet high, a real thick-looking plant. When you harvest it, you take the whole plant. They take it, they chop it up, they expose it to heat and enzymes that breaks down the cell wall and freezes the carbohydrates that then could be distilled into an alcohol. Ethanol is an alcohol. And that feedstock has the potential to produce four or five times as much per acre as existing corn ethanol with less fertilizer and less water needed. 
   We're also making tremendous strides in enzymes. And there are ways to do this even without enzymes. The very first cellulosic ethanol plant in America had the ground broken 2 days ago, I believe, the Ramgen Company, another company owned by Vinod Khosla that I talked about, and we have five others that are going to begin construction shortly. So conservative estimates are that within the next 20 years, we will be able to have 25 to 30 percent of all of our transportation fuels fueled by biofuels. And the best is yet to come. 
   Last night I learned about a company called Solazyme. Solazyme is developing a way to make biodiesel from algae that is 50 times as productive as corn per square meter or acre in its productive capability. Now, it's not commercialized yet. It's quite aways from commercialization. A lot of work has to be done. But when that is done, Katie, bar the door when it comes to biofuels. And when we do that, we are going to have plug-in hybrid cars that we can plug in, run for 40 miles, then burn cellulosic ethanol or potentially biodiesel, and have an infinite number of miles per gallon of gasoline because we won't be using it. We will have a decarbonized car. The car may become total electric, but even if it doesn't become total electric, it can become decarbonized by a combination of plug-in hybrid technology and biofuels. And of course biofuels are zero CO  
   2 emitting net because you don't put any more carbon into the atmosphere than the plant takes out of the atmosphere. It's just a little circle. The plant sucks the CO 
   2 out of the atmosphere, photosynthesis kicks in. You make carbohydrates, build the plant, chop the plant up. You make it into biodiesel or cellulosic ethanol. You burn it, and then CO 
   2 goes back up and the cycle is repeated. There is no net CO 
   2, unlike coal and oil. We are taking stuff out of the ground that has been there for a million years, and that has enormous net increases to the atmosphere. 
   So here we have existing technology that is on the cusp of commercialization and American know-how is going to do it. And that is why we in this Chamber and my colleagues who might be listening tonight, should that be the case anywhere in this fair country, we ought to have confidence that we can move forward with the host of these clean energy policies that we are now considering and realize that the American economy is going to grow as a result of these policies, not shrink, because the world is going to need this clean energy. And it ought to be America that is selling it to China and the rest of the world, and we have every possibility of doing that. 
   Now, there is another place where the clean energy revolution is going to be really important, and that is in our homes, in a lot of different ways. And some people think that to make our homes electrical-generating units or to make them zero CO  
   2 emitters is sort of a Buck Rogers fantasy, and I have learned that that is anything but true. In fact, on the mall 2 weeks ago, we had a solar decathlon where 13 colleges sent kids, and anybody under 40 is a kid to me now, but these college students that came in and built these zero CO 
   2 emitting solar-powered homes. And they were just delightful to look at and fascinating to behold what these young students had created. 
   Now, they did look a little different than my home and maybe yours look like because they had the absolute avant guard technology in them. 
   But I want to show you another home in one of the rainiest parts of Washington, up north in Redmond, Washington. This is the home of Mike and Meg Towne. Mike is a teacher at Redmond High School. And several years ago Mike was talking to his students about the importance of dealing with global warming and all the whiz-bang technologies that he thought was going to come on to help solve this problem. And one of his students said, Mr. Towne, if this is so cool, why aren't you using it? And he said to himself, well, maybe I will. So he and his wife, Meg, decided to go out and build essentially a zero net CO  
   2 home that's solar powered, and they did it. And they did it for very little more than it costs to build a typical home. And here's their home in Redmond, Washington. 
   I want to note this is a very unusual day because it was not raining when this picture was taken, and it tends to rain a little bit where I live, and it rains even more where Mike lives. This is up towards the foothills of the Cascade Mountains, and it's just a very damp, gray environment. But even in that environment, they put up these solar cells, and you will see that they are incorporated into the roofing material. You can just put them on. Mike put them on himself. They used a little extra insulation, decent windows, designed it in a way to minimize heat loss. And right now they have zero electrical net usage because they feed back into the grid frequently of electricity they are not using, and they netted out to zero. And Americans are going to have that right if a bill that I have been working on for 4 years called the Net Metering bill passes, so that when you generate electricity and you feed it back into the grid, you get paid for it. 
   The point of this is that this exists today in rainy climates. It's possible almost anywhere in the country. And we are going to do it. And we have a bill in the House that we have now passed this August that will establish building codes that will decrease energy use by 50 percent in our homes and our businesses in the next 10 years of new construction. That is possible to do. We are doing it. Mike and Meg Towne did it. And we are well on our way as part of an important part of the clean energy revolution. 
   And, by the way, this is going to create jobs, because when we retrofit our homes, when we put in new insulation, when we put in weather stripping, when we put in more efficient heating systems, all of those things generate jobs. And a conservative estimate of the new Apollo Energy Act that I have sponsored is that it will create 3 million new jobs in the next several years. 
   So what we have seen tonight is a host of new economic opportunities for America. And what I started out with, I was talking about that this is an irony. The irony is that these great challenges of global warming and addiction to Middle Eastern oil and the huge increase in the cost of oil and gas are actually disguised opportunities. And if this Chamber will act, and we would like to do it in a bipartisan basis, to adopt this signal to the market, these technologies are going to blossom. 
   And I would like to talk about one policy that is of overriding interest, and that is the cap-and-trade system that we need in this country to drive investment in these technologies. Right now we have a broken market. We have a great market failure. And that market failure is that we are allowing polluting industries to use our atmosphere, a scarce resource, and put  unlimited amounts of their pollutants into the air for no cost whatsoever. And that is not only morally wrong; it's economically wrong, because when you have an asset, if somebody uses it up, they ought to pay for that; right? And there ought to be some limit on it. But right now when a utility burns coal and they dump the CO  
   2 in our atmosphere, an atmosphere we have in common, it's like a city park. And we would not allow a utility to back their dump truck into the city park and dump their trash in the city park. We would not allow some refinery putting CO 
   2 into the atmosphere to drive up to the city park and dump their sludge in the city park. But that's what we are doing right now by allowing unlimited amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. And that has to stop. We have to develop a limit on the amount of carbon dioxide that goes into the atmosphere. And a cap-and-trade system does that. When we develop a cap, we will put and guarantee Americans that only a certain amount of carbon dioxide can go into the atmosphere every year. It's common sense. We can't continue to put this into the atmosphere without very devastating ramifications. And we need to charge for that as well. 
   Europe made a big mistake. When they did this, they just handed these permits out, and the utilities took them and then took a huge windfall profit by charging rate payers for an asset that was just given to them. We can't do that. We need to have an auction of those permits to create a price for carbon and to use the market to determine who really needs them and what they will pay for that scarce resource. 
   And this is a resource owned by the taxpayers. The taxpayers own the atmosphere, not the corporations. The citizens of America own the air we breathe, not the utilities. The Congress has a responsibility to our citizens to take care of that asset, and we are not doing it yet. And when somebody uses that asset, they need to pay for using that asset. 
   So what we would propose to do is have an auction and let the market determine what the cost of those permits are for polluting industries. And the sooner we do that, the better; the more powerful impact we will have in driving investment to these new technologies, and the sooner that taxpayers will get a break getting paid by something that they own mutually. And that money can then be used for further research and development into these technologies. It can be used to help lower-income folks with their heating and cooling expenses. And it can be used as part of the clean energy revolution. And we need to increase that R and D. We are spending 25 times more in Iraq today than we are spending on trying to solve this energy problem. We spent seven times more on the original Apollo Project than we are spending today on this energy problem. We have got to ramp up our Federal R and D as the private sector does as well. 
   So in closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like to say that if people come to know the people I have known during the last year; the folks who are developing solar thermal; the folks who are developing clean coal; the folks who are developing advanced forms of cellulosic ethanol and advanced forms of biodiesel; the folks who are developing wind and tidal power; the people who are developing what's called the SIPs industry, the structural integrated panels, where they have built these panels now that you can build a house with them and you can reduce your usage by 40 percent at no additional cost; the people who are developing the plug-in hybrid car, these are the Americans that we need to listen to and have confidence in that they are going to solve this problem. And that is why in the next few weeks in this Chamber I hope we will pass an energy bill that is as bold and as visionary and as optimistic as Kennedy's original Apollo Project. And America deserves nothing less than that because we are just as capable, we are just as smart, and we are just as technologically ambitious as we were in the 1960s. And if we do that, America will produce. It is our destiny. The New Apollo Energy Act will solve these problems and grow our economy at the same time.

   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Chairman, before I comment on this bill, I want to comment on two leaders who helped to get it here, Mr. Klein and Mr. Mahoney. Usually, when freshmen Congressmen have bills in the House, it is something like naming a post office or something. These two fellows have worked a very well-crafted bill that I hope has broad consensus, and they have my admiration for their great work. 
   I think it is a very important bill for all of us because it responds to the need for a stable insurance market in these areas. Some have suggested somehow this displaces the private insurance industry. In fact, it just allows that market to work. It is preferable to have catastrophe bonds and some reinsurance contracts in advance, rather than trying to deal with catastrophe afterwards through Federal Government bailouts. This is a market-driven way to do it. It makes the market stronger. It spreads the risk in a way that is consistent with our economic system, and we need to pass this bill.

   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Chairman, behold the polar bear Ursus maritimus, one of the most magnificent creatures on earth, legendary in its strength and to date its survival. 
   But today its survival is at great risk. It deserves the protection of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and it does not have it. 
   Today we seek to close the loophole that alone amongst marine mammals allows the importation of bear heads, bearskins, bear claws in opposition to the basic concept of the Marine Mammal Protection Act. And we do so because this animal certainly is at risk. It is at risk because where there is no ice, there are no polar bears. This creature is dependent on the ice, and the ice is disappearing. That is what has led the Bush administration's Secretary of Interior to propose to list it as a threatened species. 
   But it gets worse. If you look at what the future is going to bring this bear, by 2040 the recent studies indicate that there will be no meaningful sea ice in the Arctic ocean by 2040 upon which these bears depend for their survival. 
   Now, we have folks who do enjoy trophy hunting in the United States, and there is nothing wrong with hunting or any suggestion of that in this amendment. But the truth is this: At this moment of risk to these bears, polar bear cubs need their parents in their dens more than we need polar bearskins in our dens. And this will simply close that loophole to remove that lack of protection from these animals. 
   Now, these animals are not threatened just in the United States. The ongoing trophy hunt is going on in Canada, where the International Polar Bear Community has found that at least half of the specific populations of polar bears are at great risk for extinction. And we know that hunters can be a force for conservation. We know they help provide habitat for ducks with Ducks Unlimited. 
   But the fact of the matter is, is that with a bullet to a bear, you cannot conserve it. And the fact of the matter is that the $750 permits that go to this bear hunt cannot solve the problem of global warming. And we stand here today to say that we ought to have the same level of American national commitment to the polar bears' continued survival as we have had for the bald eagle. And if we demonstrate that commitment, our grandchildren will enjoy these polar bears. And if we do not, they will not. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo).

   Mr. INSLEE. I would like to address this canard that this is an anti-hunting amendment. 
   In fact, Americans enjoy passing down the tradition of hunting to their kids, their sons and daughters; and that tradition should be able to continue. But if the prey is gone, there is no hunting. And if we don't get serious about recovering polar bears, we will not be able to hunt anything because they will not exist. And if we don't stop this loophole which allows importing polar bear heads, contrary to the Marine Mammal Protection Act, we cannot tell our children we are serious about recovering this species. 
   Listen to the science. In 40 years will there will be no polar ice cap. And shooting polar bears and putting them in our dens in Texas or any other great State in this country is not consistent with what we did for the American bald eagle. And if we work together, hunters, nonhunters, left and right, east and west, we can accomplish this goal. But I'm suggesting this is a commonsense measure to close this loophole and listen to the science. 
   These species are going to have a 30 percent decline in the next 30 years. Three of the six Canadian groups that are already hunted are deemed at risk by the international scientific community. 
   I don't know what the Canadians are thinking. It's a great country; they're the greatest ice hockey teams in the world. But maybe they haven't got the best polar bear policy like we do in the good old USA. 
   Enforce the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Bring some common sense. Tell our kids we're going to keep these species available to them and pass this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be here tonight to help pass the Webcaster Settlement Act of 2008. The reason is I really do believe the upshot of this legislation will be the survival of webcasting as we know it in the United States, to really allow our consumers and our constituents to continue to enjoy tremendous opportunities to listen to great music and great news over the Internet, and allow the continued development of businesses around the business model of webcasting. 
   I am very appreciative of Chairman Berman and his efforts to facilitate discussions to help resolve this difficult issue and to the ranking member, Mr. Smith, who is a cosponsor of this legislation. This really is a bipartisan effort to find a resolution to a difficult issue. 
   As Mr. Berman indicated, there is a wide divergence on what the right royalty to pay is. Certainly a lot of businesses were jeopardized by this decision. I just note one that led to this relief. Big R Radio, it is actually in the State of Washington where I hail from, under the CRB decision that gave rise to this issue, it would have caused Big R Radio to exceed by 150 percent of their revenues what they would have to pay in royalties.     
   We have heard many businesses would be in that situation. 
   We have been engaged now for some period of time, discussions to try to find a resolution and agreement between those who are webcasters, who have big dreams, and providing tremendous music to allow them to continue. 
   We hope that those will succeed. We think that we are close to a successful resolution of those discussions. Mr. Berman has been very helpful in that regard. 
   But to get there, we need to have this bill to make sure that when an agreement is reached, that it has, in fact, the sanction of the United States. This bill is really kind of simple. It just basically says that the parties, if they can reach an agreement, Uncle Sam will not get in the way. Certainly that makes sense from all standpoints on both sides of the aisle. 
   I just want to note how important it is. I know many people have been interested in this in the last few days to encourage Congress to pass this legislation. Webcasting really has become a fabric of people's daily lives. 
   I want to read one quote from Luis Jimenez, who is involved in Live365 network. He is from Frederick, Maryland. This is a quote: 
   ``Internet radio gave me the freedom to put together my own format station without having to be a cookie-cutter station. Listeners and musicians love it because of the variety of music and the fact local and independent artists are played.'' That's a quote from the Frederick News Post. 
   This is really why our constituents love this service. We want to find a business model where webcasting can thrive, where consumers can listen, and, at some point, terrestrial broadcasters who will be able to simulcast under this the legislation, they will be able to access the benefit of this legislation, and they will be involved in negotiations to find a right, appropriate level. 
   I am delighted by the passage of this, and I thank all involved in this effort.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. I've come to the floor this morning to talk about a great opportunity we have in the next 2 or 3 weeks here in Congress to really adopt a comprehensive energy bill that will move forward with the bold strokes that America needs, but I mention bold strokes rather than tiny, little baby steps, and we will not have accomplished our goal this fall if we just take tiny, little baby steps, and unfortunately, that still remains a possibility. 
   Now, the tiny, little baby steps that I refer to are the efforts to go for a little thimble full of fuel off of our coastline, and this has really gotten the majority of the debate, but unfortunately, it's not where the tankers full of energy are. We know that if we drill off our coastlines it simply won't answer the problem that we have because there is just not enough oil there. We consume 25 percent of the world's oil, but we only have 3 percent of the world's oil supply even if we drill off our coastline or in Yellowstone National Park or on the south lawn of the White House. So, while we're having an honest debate about where to drill, there is one thing we know for sure: drilling is not enough. Even if we do expand the places where we drill--and my side of the aisle is supporting using the 68 million acres that are already leased, in fact, starting drilling on those areas that are already leased--we know we have to do so much more than just drill. 
   The good news is that we will have on the floor in the next couple of weeks a proposal that will move forward broadly with the new technologies that really provide the vast, huge tankers full of energy that we need to replace our fossil fuel-based economy, but I learned this August at some companies that I visited and at some research labs that we are just on the cusp of a clean energy revolution that is now ready, if we can ask some of my fellows across the aisle to join us, for truly having a comprehensive plan. 
   I want to just run through some of the companies I visited this August. I went to the National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, Colorado, and I saw an incredible place where they had two plug-in electric cars. Right above them was a photovoltaic cell of about, maybe, 10 by 20 on a pedestal right above them. With that one solar photovoltaic panel, they were charging two plug-in electric cars that would go 30 to 40 miles, all electric. Then if you wanted to go more than 40 miles, you could run it on gasoline or potentially on ethanol, a plug-in electric car. You could see a vision where we have PV cells in our homes or at our businesses, powering our cars with plug-in electric technology, and it was right there in Golden, Colorado. It is not a pipe dream. It is on the roads today. The first commercially available plug-in electric car today was written about in the Seattle Post Intelligence in my hometown in Seattle. This is ready to go. Our bill will support that technology. 
   I met a guy named Bob Nelson on Bainbridge Island in Washington who has a company called Sapphire Energy. Sapphire Energy has figured out a way to use algae and to convert algae to gasoline, pure American-bred gasoline from algae. Our technology will support the commercialization of that technology. 
   I met a woman named Susan Petty, also in Seattle. She has a company called AltaRock. AltaRock is a company that drills down 3 to 5 kilometers. It pumps down cold water. It fractures rock. It then pumps down water and brings it back up at 300 degrees temperature. It uses that hot water to create steam, and it generates electricity with zero CO  
   2 emissions and with zero global warming gases. AltaRock Energy is going to be ready to commercialize this technology, we hope, in the next several years that could produce potentially half of our electrical needs in the United States if we can surmount a couple of technological challenges involving pumps. Here is a company that could be a total game changer, and it needs policies from Congress to move forward. Our proposal, the Democratic leadership will propose, will support that technology.
   Next, I go down the drive to Bellevue, Washington, and I visit a company called MagnaDrive that is producing an electrical system that can reduce the electrical needs of electrical motors by 60 to 70 percent. They are manufacturing that product today and are shipping it to China. They're hiring people in Bellevue, Washington to produce these things to go to China, to start exporting products to China. This is the future of this country to build these clean energy technologies and to ship them to China. Our bill that we will propose will support that technology. 
   Now what we need are for some of my Republican colleagues to drop this proposal of ``none of the above'' and to start joining us with a comprehensive approach. What America needs is a clean energy revolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (BEACH PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of an amendment I'm offering with Mr. Van Hollen. The amendment is quite simple. It will simply direct the EPA to report to Congress on how to mitigate the effects of climate change on recreation at our Nation's beaches. 
   I'm particularly partial to islands and beaches. I live in one, Bainbridge Island, Washington. It's a great place. 
   And like others, I'm concerned about the impact of global climate change on rising sea levels that can impact the quality of our beaches. And we need to get to the bottom of what those impacts will be so that we can help local communities respond to rising beaches. 
   Scientists have agreed that sea level is already rising across our coast. In my neck of the woods, the University of Washington Climate Impacts Group has predicted that sea levels in Puget Sound could rise by as much as 50 inches by 2100. This could have a $1 billion impact on waterfront investment. 
   Rising sea levels intensify flooding, we know. They intensify storms and the erosion associated with them. And they can impact the water quality of our Nation's beaches as they impact sewage disposal systems. 
   Already, under BEACH Act programs, the EPA does collaborate with government agencies to predict where and when this pollution can occur. My amendment simply directs the EPA to report to Congress on how climate change may exacerbate those problems. 
   We know how important recreation is on our beaches. In fact, beaches are the leading tourist destination. I was surprised to learn 85 percent of all U.S. tourism is associated with beaches.  They contribute over $700 billion each year to the GDP, and that's not just the Beach Boys. 
   In 2006, recreation brought in $948 million, just the Olympic and Kitsap Peninsulas where I live. So knowing about the problems we're going to have with climate change locally is a boost. You don't have to live on an island or near a beach to recognize that. 
   I want to thank the Chair, Mr. Pallone, and the Chair for their help in drafting and accepting this amendment. And I hope you'll join me in supporting a very commonsense measure to help respond to these problems we know we're going to have. And I hope we can prevent them. But we're going to have some of them no matter what we do. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, we cannot, we should not, and we must not give President George Bush a blank check to squander the lives of our children and the dollars of our constituents in Iraq. We should not give him a blank check today, we should not give him a blank check next week, and we should not give him a blank check ever. The days of giving him a blank check to make repeated incompetent decisions in Iraq must be stopped and they should be stopped today by voting ``no'' on this supplemental. 
   And the inspiration for doing that should come from our proud men who are serving in Iraq. I heard a story a few weeks ago about a fellow who had his buddy shot by a sniper, he was being shot up by automatic weapons fire, and his buddy ran out into the field of fire to rescue his friend. We should look at our duty today as rescuing our children, brothers, sisters, husbands and wives in Iraq. And if we take hostile political fire in doing so, so be it. That tiny act of standing up to George Bush does not end up in the same league of courage of those who are serving in Iraq who take real hostile fire, that need to be rescued from the incompetence of the executive branch of the United States Government. And it is solely the power of the U.S. Congress to do that. 
   The people who established this institution had a very wise knowledge. They knew someday there could be a President who might make bad decisions on occasion, who might make bad decisions in the course of a war, and that is why in article I, section 8, they vested in the U.S. Congress the power of the purse to be used in exactly these circumstances, to rein in a rogue President who cannot seem to understand the reality on the ground in Iraq and has a hallucinatory policy that is exposing our children to harm. This power in section 8, the power of the purse, is one that is designed by the framers of democracy for exactly these circumstances. And the reason the framers put the power of the purse to rein in a rogue President is because they understood that this is the institution closer to the American people. This is the People's House. 
   And I know there's a lot of problems that none of us are geniuses on in Iraq, but there is one thing we know: In difficult times in America, there is one will, one sense of absolute genius that all of us should follow, and that is the will of the American people, the joint, commonsense consensus. From the cornfields of the Midwest to the coastlines, there is a common consensus that we need a change in policy in Iraq, and the only way we will get it, the only way that common sense of the American people will be followed is to vote ``no'' on this today. We can be united in understanding that. And when we do so, we will follow the Congresses of the past who on at least five occasions have used the constitutional power of the purse to insist on a change. 
   And I will say this. In the Constitution, this organization here is given the power to declare war. And we also have the power to end a war. Presidents do not have the authority to fight wars in perpetuity. There is no way that Congress would ever give that authority. And today using the power of the purse, a constitutional tool, we should stand up for the will of the American people and fulfill our rescue mission for our sons and daughters in Iraq and vote ``no'' on this supplemental bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment to ensure that the U.S. Attorney General appoints attorneys to assist in enforcing Federal law when it comes to public interest as outlined in 28 U.S.C. 542 and 28 U.S.C. 543. It is in the public's interest to prosecute crimes committed against Native women, including domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking and dating violence. As they take on this task, I also urge them to consult with tribes as practiced and required under Executive Order 13175. 
   As we know, there are 4 million American Indian and Alaska Native people throughout the United States, and jurisdictional questions today are preventing the enforcement of Federal laws. Indian women suffer 2 1/2 times more domestic violence and 3 1/2 times more sexual assaults than the rest of the American population. An Amnesty International report showed that 86 percent of these crimes are committed by non-Indian men, and the law prevents Tribal courts from prosecuting them. 
   As a former prosecutor, I was shocked that the majority of criminals go unpunished. Justice Department data compiled by Syracuse University showed that in two decades, only 30 percent of tribal land crimes referred to U.S. Attorneys were ever prosecuted. I would like to see U.S. Attorneys consult with the tribes and work to enforce Federal law, especially when it comes to crimes of domestic violence, stalking and sexual assault. And ensuring that U.S. Attorneys appoint special attorneys to assist in prosecuting these Federal laws is imperative. 
   I will include for the Record information from a Wall Street Journal article entitled, ``Tattered Justice on U.S. Indian Reservations, Criminals Slip Through Gaps.'' It is time we close those gaps, and I urge U.S. Attorneys to act with dispatch in this regard.   
   On U.S. Indian Reservations, Criminals Slip Through Gaps  
   Cherokee, N.C.--Jon Nathaniel Crowe, an American Indian, had a long-documented history of fighting with police officers and assaulting women. But the tribal court for the Eastern Band of the Cherokee, under whose jurisdiction he lives, couldn't sentence him to more than one year for any charge. Not when he left telephone messages threatening to kill an ex-girlfriend, not when he poured kerosene into his wife's mouth, not when he hit her with an ax handle. 
   ``We put him away twice for a year, that's all we could do,'' says James Kilbourne, prosecutor for the tribe. ``Then he got out and committed the same crime again.'' 
   Indian tribes are officially sovereign nations within the U.S., responsible for running services such as schools and courts. But a tangle of federal laws and judicial precedents has undermined much of their legal authority. As a result, seeking justice on Indian reservations is an uneven affair. 
   Tribes operate their own court systems, with their own judges and prosecutors. Sharply limited in their sentencing powers, they are permitted to mete out maximum jail time of only 12 months for any crime, no matter how severe. The law also forbids tribal courts to prosecute non-Indians, even those living on tribal land. 
   Federal prosecutors can intervene in serious cases, but often don't, citing the long distances involved, lack of resources and the cost of hauling witnesses and defendants to federal court. In the past two decades, only 30% of tribal-land crimes referred to U.S. attorneys were prosecuted, according to Justice Department data compiled by Syracuse University. That compares with 56% for all other cases. The result: Many criminals go unpunished, or minimally so. And their victims remain largely invisible to the court system. 
   The justice gap is particularly acute in domestic-violence cases. American Indians annually experience seven sexual assaults per 1,000 residents, compared with three per 1,000 among African-Americans and two per 1,000 among whites, says the Justice Department. The acts are often committed by non-Indians living on tribal land whom tribal officials cannot touch. Local prosecutors say members of Indian communities have such low expectations about securing a prosecution that they often don't bother filing a report. 
   ``Where else do you ask: How bad is the crime, what color are the victims and what color are the defendants?'' asks Mr. Kilbourne, who has prosecuted cases on Cherokee lands since 2001. ``We would not allow this anywhere else except Indian country.'' 
   The lack of prosecutorial discretion is one of many ways in which Indian justice has been split off from mainstream American due process. For example, some defendants appearing before Indian courts lack legal counsel, because federal law doesn't require tribes to provide them with a public defender. Although some tribes have them, others can't afford to offer their members legal assistance. It's not unusual for defendants to represent themselves. 
   The Indian Civil Rights Act, passed by Congress in 1968, limited to six months the sentences tribes could hand down on any charge. At the time, tribal courts were seeing only minor infractions. Congress increased the maximum prison sentence to one-year in 1986, wrongly assuming that the Indian courts would continue to handle only misdemeanor-level crimes. Tribal offenses, meanwhile, escalated in both number and severity, with rape, murder and kidnapping among the cases. 
   The Supreme Court weighed in on another level, with its 1978 Oliphant decision ruling that tribes couldn't try non-Indian defendants in tribal courts--even if they had committed a crime against a tribe member on the tribe's land. In its ruling, the court held that it was assumed from the earliest treaties that the tribes did not have jurisdiction over non-Indians. 
   ``If you go to Canada and rob someone, you will be tried by Canadian authorities. That's sovereignty,'' says University of Michigan law professor and tribal criminal-justice expert Gavin Clarkson. ``My position is that tribes should have criminal jurisdiction over anybody who commits a crime in their territory. The Supreme Court screwed it all up and Congress has never fixed it.'' 
   Jeff Davis, an assistant U.S. Attorney in Michigan who handles tribal-land cases, acknowledges that his hands are often tied. Mr. Davis is also a member of North Dakota's Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa. ``I've been in the U.S. Attorney's office for 12 years, and both presidents I have served under have made violent crime in Indian country a priority. But because of the jurisdictional issue and questions over who has authority and who gets to prosecute, it is a difficult situation.'' 
   Often cases don't rise to the level of felony federal crimes unless the victim has suffered a severe injury. Federal prosecutors have limited resources and focus almost exclusively on the most serious cases.  Compounding that is the fact that domestic-abuse cases are difficult to prove, especially if the lone witness recants. 
   ``It requires stitches, almost a dead body,'' says Mr. Davis. ``It is a high standard to meet.'' 
   For some non-Indians, tribal lands are virtual havens. Chane Coomes, a 43-year-old white man, grew up on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota--home to the Oglala Lakota, near the site of the infamous 1890 massacre at Wounded Knee. Marked by a small obelisk, the mass grave is a symbol of unpunished violence, literally buried in the soil of the tribe. The 2000 census documented Shannon County, which encompasses the remote and desolate reservation, as the second-poorest county in the U.S., with an annual per-capita income of $6,286 at the time. Only Buffalo County, S.D., was poorer. 
   According to local authorities, Mr. Coomes used his home on the reservation as a sanctuary, knowing he would be free from the attentions of tribal prosecutors. 
   Tribal Police Chief James Twiss says Mr. Coomes was suspected of dealing in small amounts of methamphetamine for years. Tribal police also thought he might be trafficking in stolen goods. 
   In 1998, Mr. Coomes assaulted a tribal elder, Woodrow Respects Nothing, a 74-year-old decorated World War II and Korean War veteran. Because it couldn't prosecute, the tribe ordered Mr. Coomes off its land. But attempts to remove him were unenforceable. 
   ``All I could do was to escort him off the reservation,'' says tribal police officer Eugenio White Hawk, who did that several times, the last when he spotted the banned man hauling horses in a trailer. ``He kept coming back. After a while I just left him alone and let it go. It was just a waste of time.'' 
   Mr. Coomes remained in his Shannon County home until 2006 when he was accused of beating his estranged wife in nearby Nebraska and threatening to kill her, according to Dawes County District Attorney Vance Haug. The crime was committed off the reservation, and the subsequent investigation gave state authorities official jurisdiction. 
   After raiding his home, they found stolen equipment as well as 30 grams of methamphetamine and $13,000 hidden in the bathroom, along with syringes. 
   Mr. Coomes is now in the Fall River County Jail charged with possession of stolen property, grand theft and unauthorized possession of a controlled substance. He also faces separate charges, of assault and ``terroristic threats'' related to his wife, in Dawes County, Neb. If convicted on the latter charges, he faces up to six years in prison, Mr. Haug said. Mr. Coomes's attorney declined to comment. 
   The jurisdictional quagmire also has implications for Indian members on the other side of the tribal border. Gene New Holy, an ambulance driver on Pine Ridge, had been arrested by the tribe more than a dozen times for various drunk-driving offenses, for which he received only two convictions totaling about a month in a tribal jail. In state court, four convictions would have led to a maximum sentence of five years. 
   Lance Russell, the state prosecutor for Shannon County and neighboring Fall River County, had never heard of Mr. New Holy until Feb. 11, 2001, when Mr. New Holy got drunk at a Fall River County bar. According to court documents, he nearly hit one car on a main highway, forced two others into a ditch and sideswiped a third that had pulled off the road as Mr. New Holy approached it in the wrong lane. 
   The last car he hit contained three tribe members--cousins Bart Mardinian, Anthony Mousseau and Russell Merrival-- all of whom died. The accident was less than a mile off the reservation, enough to give Mr. Russell and the state jurisdiction in the case. Mr. New Holy is serving 45 years in state prison for three counts of vehicular homicide--much longer than the 12 months per count he would have served under tribal law. His attorney didn't return a call seeking comment. 
   ``The holes in the system are more practical than legal, and the victims of crime pay the price,'' says Larry Long III, the South Dakota attorney general. ``The crooks and the knotheads win.'' 
   The Eastern Band of Cherokee, located in the Smoky Mountains of North Carolina, is one of the most efficiently run tribes in the country. Its ancestors hid in these mountains while Cherokee east of the Mississippi River were forcibly moved to present-day Oklahoma, a migration known as the ``Trail of Tears.'' Today the tribe is spread across five counties and is economically well off: It takes in more than $200 million annually from the Harrah's Cherokee Casino & Hotel, which it owns, and has a robust tourist industry. About half of the tribe's gambling spoils go to pay for infrastructure and government services. 
   Its court, which is housed in a prefabricated building, looks like any other in the U.S., except the judges wear bright, red robes. The offices, while cramped, are modern and computerized, and are a little over one hour's drive from the federal prosecutor's office in Asheville. Tribal authorities meet regularly with federal prosecutors for training. The tribe's top jurist is a former federal prosecutor who has regular contact with his successors. 
   Yet even here, the justice system works erratically. In 2005, tribal police received a tip that James Hornbuckle, 46, an Oklahoma Cherokee who had moved to the reservation, was dealing marijuana. Officers built a case for weeks. They raided the business and then Mr. Hornbuckle's home, where they found 10 kilograms of marijuana, packaged in small bricks. By tribe standards, it was a big haul, and authorities approached the U.S. Attorney's office. 
   Gretchen Shappert, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina, says federal sentencing guidelines for marijuana are so lenient, that ``we'd need 50 kilograms in a typical federal case'' to pursue it. The feds rejected the case. 
   If the state court had jurisdiction to prosecute the crime, Mr. Hornbuckle might have received a three-year term. Instead, he pleaded guilty to the marijuana charge and was sentenced to one year in tribal court. Recently the tribal council voted to permanently ban him from the reservation, with backing from the feds. Messages left for Mr. Hornbuckle's attorney weren't returned. 
   Mr. Crowe's name is all too familiar on the reservation. Tribal Police Chief Benjamin Reed has known him since he was a juvenile. ``What I remember is his domestic-violence incidents. He just wouldn't stop,'' Mr. Reed says. 
   Crystal Hicks, who dated Mr. Crowe before his marriage, says the tribal member was verbally abusive. She says she left him after she had a miscarriage, when he berated her for not giving him a ride to a motorcycle gathering. ``He said I was using the miscarriage as an excuse,'' says Ms. Hicks, 27 years old. 
   After that, in several telephone messages saved by Ms. Hicks and her family, Mr. Crowe threatened to kill them and bury Ms. Hicks in her backyard. He was jailed by the tribe and ordered to stay away from the Hicks family. 
   ``One year,'' says Ms. Hicks. ``He even told me he was fine in jail. He got fed three times a day, had a place to sleep and he wasn't going to be there long.'' 
   After he married, the violence escalated, says Police Chief Reed. During one incident he drove to the home Mr. Crowe shared with his wife, Vicki. ``He had threatened her, and dug a grave, and said no one would ever find her. We believed him,'' Mr. Reed said. ``Just look at some of the stuff he'd done. That girl was constantly coming down here, her face swollen up.'' At one point, he choked his wife, poured kerosene into her mouth and threatened to light it, police reports say. Mr. Crowe's attorney didn't return calls seeking comment. 
   None of these acts led to more than one year in jail, a sentence he has been given twice since 2001. His criminal file at the tribal court building fills a dozen manila folders. There are reports of trespassing and assault convictions, telephone harassment, threats and weapons assaults--one for an incident when he hit his wife with an ax handle, breaking her wrist. His latest arrest, in September, came about a week after he finished his most recent sentence, when he came home and beat his now-estranged wife--again. 
   After seven years, his crimes finally triggered federal involvement, although almost by accident. Federal prosecutors from around the country met at Cherokee earlier this year to discuss crime on tribal land. One federal official mentioned to Mr. Kilbourne, the tribal prosecutor, a new statute that allows federal intervention where defendants have at least two domestic-violence convictions, regardless of the crime's seriousness. 
   Mr. Kilbourne, who was preparing for a new trial against Mr. Crowe the following week, quickly turned the case over. Mr. Crowe pleaded guilty to assault last Friday and is awaiting sentencing.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (OPTIONS FOR STIMULATING THE U.S. ECONOMY THROUGH EFFICIENCY AND CLEAN ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I come to the House floor today to address the two issues that we have a chance to really move forward on, and that is the difficulties in our economy and the difficulties in our energy policy; and we think we have an opportunity, and I met this afternoon with a good number of my colleagues about how to do something about both, the slow-down in our economy and our need to rejuvenate our economy by adopting some new clean energy strategies for the country. We think this is an ideal opportunity for the House of Representatives to lead a short-term plan economically to help stimulate our economy, while at the same time directing our economy towards a clean energy future which can really grow jobs, millions of jobs in our country. 
   What the group of my colleagues and I discussed is the hope that in our upcoming stimulus package, which is now under development, that our stimulus package can hew to the values set forth by Speaker Pelosi of being timely, targeted, and temporary. We think if we follow those three guidelines, we can do things to help our short-term clean energy revolution really take off in the United States. 
   I have come to the floor to talk about that night, about some options that are available to us. We know that we want to make sure that our stimulus package is timely, that it in fact gets into the economy very quickly, because that is what we need. This is not something that can wait 5 years. We need to have a stimulus now. But we also need that stimulus to be targeted. This is not a moment where it would be wise for us to simply sort of spread butter across America very thinly in the hopes that somehow it will help the economy blossom. 
   We need to target our strategies so that it will be really driving economic growth in the United States and, importantly, make sure that that economic growth takes place in the United States. It won't do us much good to just short of spread a thin layer of relief, because a lot of that would end up buying products from China, frankly. 
   We want to look for targeted stimulus that will really help the growth in the American economy and create jobs in America. If we have a choice between two activities, one of which would be simply to allow buying retail products from China, and one which would really grow jobs in America, we should pick the latter. 
   A group of my colleagues and myself want to make a proposal that will ensure that we target some of the stimulus into a clean energy future for America that really grows jobs in this country and doesn't simply buy retail products from China. So we are going to make a proposal that will suggest that we adopt some measures that in a very timely fashion can inject growth into the American economy this year and will ensure that we target that strategy to the development of clean energy jobs, and I want to talk about some of the things that can accomplish that in our stimulus package. 
   The first thing that we will propose is a very down-to-Earth, extremely commonsense expansion of an existing program that helps low-income Americans weatherize their homes. We currently have a program that is working very well, very efficient, and extremely popular to help Americans put in insulation, fill in cracks, get energy-efficient windows, essentially just quit wasting heat that filters out through the cracks of our homes. That right now is a $250 million program to help Americans do that. 
   We suggest we boost that by $100 million this year in a program that can immediately put people to work. We know we have people that are losing their jobs today because the home construction industry is slowing down,  something I am familiar with. My oldest son is in the home construction industry, and he is doing okay in Washington State, but we know in other areas, particularly, they have had a real slow-down in the home construction industry. 
   We can put those people that are being laid off back to work in the home weatherization industry, and we can do that today if we boost the funding in the home weatherization industry. If we do that, and we have checked with the Department and it can easily accommodate another $100 million right away so that we can get that work being done in the next several months. 
   So we are proposing that we add $100 million. It sounds like a lot of money, but in the course of a 50 or $100 billion stimulus package, it is actually a very small amount of money. It can make a big difference for people to make their homes more weather efficient. They reduce their energy costs. At the same time, we are putting people back to work who are being laid of in the construction industry. This is really a golden opportunity for us. It's the first thing we'd propose. 
   The second thing we'd like to propose is that we stop the hemorrhaging that is going on right now in the renewable energy industry. Now, we allowed, in a huge failure by our Congress, frankly, the lapse of some tax incentives which have created thousands of jobs in this country in the renewable energy industry. Those lapsed this past December, essentially. Any project that is not done this year would not be able to take advantage of them. We have projects right now that are just crying out for this tax relief as an incentive in the wind industry, in the solar energy industry, and several of the other renewable energy industries. 
   Because those tax credits lapsed, and I just got off the phone this afternoon with a leader in the solar energy industry who told us we are already seeing a decline already in the number of orders for some of these renewable energy industry projects, and that is a terrible mistake at the very moment where we need to stimulate growth, and we know we need to do it in these advanced energy growth segments of our economy. 
   So we would propose that we have a short-term, a 1-year extension of the production tax credit and the investment tax credit, which would allow these industries to again get on the growth track that they have been on with such great success. These industries are tremendously beneficial in creating jobs. They actually create twice as many jobs. For every $1 of economic growth, they create twice as many jobs. They are very, very labor intensive in growing these technologies. 
   Now, it would be a terrible moment to allow us to go backwards in solar and wind and other associated technologies. The reason is we are just starting to lead the world in these technologies. 
   Last Friday was the first commercial shipment of what we call thin cell photovoltaics by the Nano Solar Company in Palo Alto, California. Thin cell photovoltaics are extremely cost effective. It's a new type of photovoltaic cells. People are now familiar with the silicone-based cell. The thin cell photovoltaic cells, as its name suggests, it's thin, and it can be made with great cost advantages. The very first commercial sale in world history took place a week ago last Friday. 
   So we hate to see these breakthroughs taking place and not see the possible expansion of their application. The very first permit for a wave power buoy, and we have buoys now that can generate electricity as they bob up and down in the waves, the very first permit off the Washington State coast was issued in the last two weeks to the Finavera Company, a company with offices in the Northwest. 
   So at the moment we see these technologies, we'd hate to see a decline in the orders for these technologies taking place, which is now taking place because we allowed these production and investment tax credits to lapse. We should simply restore them and renew them for at least another year, short-term relief, and this is very timely if we do this, because if we do this, there's an immediate, an immediate demand by people when we know these tax credits will be available to go out and order these projects that get these jobs going, putting the pedal to the metal. You don't have to wait. 
   The third thing we would propose is a renewal and partial extension of the solar tax credit for residential homes. That also expired, and it has been historically limited to $2,000. Frankly, it hasn't cut the mustard. It simply hasn't been enough to really get residential customers engaged to get going on ordering these products. If we simply renew that for 1 year, we recommend expanding it to $4,000 per consumer. If we do that, we are going to have an immediate burst of orders and at least continuation of the growth in orders in solar, as we have had historically. 
   Fourth, we propose to essentially extend the otherwise lapsed consumer credit for solar for the same reasons that we just talked about. It just makes a lot of sense. Fifth, we'd suggest extending the expired energy efficient credit both for homes and commercial buildings. It makes no sense to have allowed these tax credits to expire. When they exist, they create this demand for the type of work we talked about in the weatherization program, only it's larger in its application, because this is not just low-income people. It's now the entire United States, folks who can take advantage of it. It creates a demand. It happens immediately, because once people know they are going to be able to have access to these tax credits, they can go out and make the orders right away to get this done. 
   We also hope to propose a Green Fund proposal. Frankly, we are working on this right now to discuss how we can create ``green collar jobs'' in this country, and a ``green collar job'' proposal is something we think we ought to pursue.     
   We want to find a way to do that to make it timely. 
   But as a package, these proposals as a package have the capacity to make sure that our stimulus package is targeted to something that is really going to get spent in America. Frankly, a lot of the other proposals out there are going to get spent buying retail products from China. You know, that is fair and Americans do that. But if we want to stimulate the economy, these proposals we have now proposed have the added advantage of spending money right here. 
   This will happen immediately, and we know it works, because all of the things we have proposed have been tested. These are not avant-garde proposals. These are things we know that work because they have been in the field, we know the economic growth they have produced, we know they create jobs. The weatherization program is doing it today. The production investment tax credits for several years we know created great growth. The most rapidly growing part of the economy right now has been the wind turbine industry, and we hate to see that slow down, and the same can be said about the solar industry. 
   So we simply want to continue apace the success we have had, and we are going to urge our colleagues to include at least a portion of our proposal in this package. 
   We also want to note that we don't want to bust the bank on this. The proposals we have talked about, cumulatively, if this is a $100 billion stimulus package, this would be about 1 percent. We are proposing just maybe 1 percent of the package would include the provisions we have included. If it is $50 billion, it would be 2 percent. So the items we have suggested today are relatively modest portions of this package, but they are very important, because we are going to lose the momentum the United States is starting to develop as a world leader in clean technology. 
   We have just started to gain that momentum. We don't want to give it up. It would be a shame to see these industries start to plateau just when they are on the growth curve of new technological development. That is not the American way. The American way is to innovate, to grow and have a confidence in our economy and our inventive talents. This is part and parcel of that, and in the spirit of the New Apollo Project, something I have been advocating for a long time, that we should have the same confidence that Kennedy had in the original Apollo project that took us to the moon, we ought to have  the same confidence in a clean energy economy. 
   I am not the only one talking about this. I was listening to Senator Clinton talk about this the other day in the Senate, about the need for an Apollo project. She has made some proposals about a stimulus package that are very similar to some of the ones we are proposing in the House. I think that is the right attitude we should have, because it is based on confidence. 
   Her larger program for clean energy also tracks the New Apollo Project that I have proposed in the House that would really on a major league basis propose major investments in clean technology. She has proposed a major league weatherization program to weatherize 20 million homes, and that is the scale that we ought to be thinking about. She has proposed 55 mile per gallon standards for our cars, and a $50 billion pool of funds to be financed by transferring some of the tax benefits that have been given to the oil and gas industry and put it back into the clean energy industry and create a multi-billion dollar fund for the research to expand this technology. That is the type of thing we need. We appreciate that going on in the Senate, and we are going to continue to push these ideas in the House. 
   But let's start on the stimulus package. It is one small step for man, maybe not quite a giant leap for mankind, but it is commonsense for Americans that we do this. I appreciate my colleagues working with me, Lloyd Doggett, who has been a long time leader on this, Tom Udall and others. We are going to push this ball. We hope we are successful.

   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, this is a great bill and cellulosic ethanol is great from a global warming perspective because it simply recirculates carbon through the atmosphere. It doesn't add any additional carbon. It is simply that the plant takes it out of the atmosphere. They crush the plant, burn the fuel. It is a cycle. It doesn't add any net increase. 
   But I want to make sure Members understand this bill is just a beginning of what we need to do. Brazil is totally energy independent today because they have gone to an E-85 system. They burn fuel that is 85 percent ethanol. But I talked to the person in Brazil that made this happen, and he told me one clear lesson. If you don't do something to compel the oil and gas distribution system to put in E-85 pumps, they don't do it. Now, they in Brazil had to adopt some policies to compel the installation of these E-85 pumps because there is a competitive reason. The oil and gas industry doesn't want to put in these pumps to compete with their oil and gas. So this is a start to demonstrate why the use of cellulosic ethanol is very allowable in Brazil. They pump this stuff all over the country all the time. But we are going to need to take another step to get those E-85 pumps built to fuel our flex-fuel cars. This is a first step. There is more to come.

   Mr. INSLEE. Who are the real experts on the question of whether the lack of a timeline actually fuels the insurgency, the lack of a timeline actually making the violence worse? 
   One of them is named Muhammad al-Dini. He is an elected member of the Iraqi parliament. He was here yesterday, and I met with him. He told me that a majority, 144 members, of the elected Iraqi parliament 2 days ago signed a petition that basically said that the lack of a timeline is fueling attacks against our troops. The lack of a timeline is fueling this insurgency. The lack of a timeline is playing into the hands of al Qaeda. And the reason he told us this is that it allows them to go out and recruit and say, Look, America is going to be here forever. And they recruit people that go out and attack us. 
   The other thing he told us is that the Maliki government is using our taxpayer dollars to run sectarian militias that go out and attack Americans. He urged us to adopt a timeline. An elected official in the parliament of the state of Iraq; now there is an expert. 
   It amazes me that people who have been wrong on Iraq for 4 years come down and lecture us, lecture us about whether a timeline is going to work or not. I think it might be handy in Congress to have a penalty box. If you have been wrong for 4 years on the right strategy in Iraq, maybe you should to go into the penalty box for a while and allow the people who were against this war from the beginning to have a say on what we do in Iraq. 
   What we are saying is, a lack of a timeline hurts. We need to bleed the insurgency of the fuel they use, and the fuel they use is the lack of a timeline. 
   One more thing, I read this headline: ``Bush Told War is Harming the GOP.'' I don't care about the GOP or the parties. The GOP members went and told the President this is hurting the GOP. It doesn't matter who is getting hurt politically here. I will tell you what matters: Our sons and daughters are being killed in Iraq. 
   I hope some of my GOP colleagues, the next time they go to the White House, I hope they say, we don't care about the GOP or the DEM; we care about the Army and the Navy and the soldiers who are being killed in Iraq, and let's get a timetable and get us out of there.

<DOCNO>Mr. INSLEE. (POTENTIAL LOSS OF INTERNET RADIO -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor of the House this evening to discuss the potential loss of Internet radio by Americans, a tremendous service that, because of Internet software and musical geniuses, 70 million Americans now enjoy the ability to listen to music by Web broadcasters over the Internet. 
   It is a tremendous service. It is as ingrained in a lot of Americans' daily lives as a cup of coffee and the morning newspaper. 
   Unfortunately, I have to inform the House that that service may be gone in a matter of a few weeks if we don't reach a resolution of a, frankly, wrong decision decided by the Copyright Royalty Board. What I am disturbed to report to my colleagues is that some time ago, March 2, 2007, we had a decision by a Federal agency, the ramifications of which would be to shut down the ability of Americans, on a realistic basis, to continue to enjoy Internet-based radio. 
   The reason this happened is that this board was given the authority to set the royalty that should be paid by Webcasters who stream out this great music, by the way, tremendously diverse music. One of the great things Americans love about Internet radio is you have such eclectic, different types of music, not just top 40. You know, I haven't progressed past the Beach Boys in the 1960s, but there are a lot of kinds of other music. Internet radio has been tremendous by allowing people to enjoy thousands of different genres and types of music. 
   But now this Copyright Royalty Board has issued a decision which will explode the royalty that these Webcasters are forced to pay to those who generated the music, to the extent that it will make it totally economically impossible for these businesses and these Webcasters to continue to stream music to the 70 million Americans who now enjoy it. 
   We need to fix this problem. We need to fix it urgently, because the decision will, this guillotine will come down on July 15 if either Congress doesn't act or an agreement is not reached between the parties to adjust this copyright fee that will have to be paid by the Webcasters. 
   So we need to fix this problem, and, in doing so, we need to do it in a way that is fair to the musicians and artists who create the music that 70 million Americans enjoy over the Internet. These artists work hard in producing this music. They share their genius. It's an artistic gift they have, and they share it with Americans. They need to be compensated fairly to allow them to maintain their business model as well. 
   Unfortunately, this was a wildly disproportionate decision by this board that is grossly unfair to the distributors of music and simply will allow them not to continue in business. And to give folks a feeling of how distorted this decision will be, I would like to refer to this graph which shows Internet radio per-song royalty rates under preexisting law starting in 2005, that started at $.00008 dollars in 2005, and by 2010, we will have foisted on us 149 percent increase in these royalty rates. 
   I am not sure any business model can tolerate a three-fold increase just in the per-song royalty rates that these folks are having to undergo. Unfortunately, this royalty rate means about a 300 percent increase for big Webcasters. But because of the particular rules here, it's a 1,200 percent increase for small Webcasters, so the small Webcasters, which are the vast majority of Webcasters will be hit potentially by 1,200 percent increases. 
   Now, this board, this Copyright Royalty Board has refused to reconsider their decision. What it means in the real world is the Internet going silent. Many of the stations a few days ago went silent to demonstrate and to protest its decision. I know Americans are disturbed by this, and they are now talking to my colleagues. I know thousands of them have communicated with my colleagues as a result of this, so we need to fix this problem. 
   I know in my district, I am from an area just north of Seattle, First District in the State of Washington, we have a Webcaster called Big R Radio. They stream to over 15,000 listeners who enjoy their product. But because of this decision, their rates are going to go up to a level, and you have got to understand how bad this is, the rates they would have to pay just for their royalties, not for their overhead, their rent, their salaries, the royalties they would have to pay for this exceed by 150 percent the revenues that this business is getting in. 
   Well, obviously, that's untenable, and this company will have to either go offshore or simply shut down if some change is not made. That is bad for Big R Radio, the company, and it's bad for the 15,000 people that enjoy their music right now. We need to fix this problem. 
   So the first damage that was done is this per-song radio royalty, but there was another, perhaps even more odious thing that this board did, the preexisting rule required a $500 charge, or, excuse me, a per-station minimum fee. This new ruling required a $500 charge for each streaming station that they offered. Webcasters, of course, stream under certain channels. But under this decision, there was no limit on the amount total in this per streaming channel that would be placed. Many, if not most Webcasters, have multiple channels. 
   So, if you look at what it will cost, just three of these Webcasters, Pandora, RealNetworks and Yahoo, because they are getting socked with this $500 per channel, and they broadcast literally thousands of channels with no limit, just those three Webcasters would have to pay $1.15 billion, with a B. These rates will dwarf the radio-related revenues by substantially more than $1 billion. 
   In other words, it will charge these businesses more than $1 billion more than the revenues they generate from this business. That's absurd. It's ridiculous. It has no relationship to economic reality, and it is a government glitch, a foul-up of the highest order that needs to get repaired. 
   This would result in 64 times more the total royalties collected by the group called SoundExchange that collects these royalties in 2006, an increase of more than, this is a pretty amazing number to me, 10 million percent over the minimum fee of $2,500 per licensee. Clearly, this is beyond the realm of economic reality. 
   Finally, this royalty board, the third thing that they did, they eliminated the percentage of revenue fees that many small Webcasters use to determine their performance royalty, which would be severely damaging to small Webcasters. So, to put this in perspective, in a global sense, I want to refer to what this will mean in total royalties. 
   If you look at this chart, you show total royalties in 2004 of $10 million. The estimated fee under the old royalty rule in 2006 would be $18 million. But under this decision, this flawed decision, it will actually be $1.150 million. So if you want to see the difference graphically of what the old royalty would be in 2006, this bubble would go to this supernova, I would call it, in 2006. This is untenable. It needs to be fixed.  
   Now, in order to fix this, Representative Manzullo and myself have introduced the Internet Radio Equality Act, it's H.R. 2060, and this bill would fix this problem by doing something that appears eminently fair to me, which would simply have the same rate to be paid by Internet-based Webcasters as broadcasters now pay over satellite radio, over cable radio and over juke boxes.     
   What we are simply saying is that we ought to have equality, fairness, that is why we named it the Radio Equality Act, by having parity, the same level, which is 7.5 percent of revenue, a transition rate, in 2010. This is something that is fair, equal, and economically realistic to allow 70 million Americans to continue to enjoy their radio over the Internet. And now, 128 Members of the U.S. House of Representatives have cosponsored this bill just in a matter of a month or two; and the reason they have done so is I think they have heard from their constituents who want to keep their service going and realize how ridiculously out of whack this particular decision was. 
   Now, I know it may surprise some Americans to know that government agencies can make mistakes, but certainly one was made here and we need to fix it, and we need to fix it quickly. On July 15, this decision will go into effect. I encourage my colleagues to look at this bill, H.R. 2060, the Internet Radio Internet Equality Act, and cosponsor it to add their voices to the choir to demand action by the legislature to fix this bureaucratic foul-up. 
   Obviously, this is supported by a large number of people, not just broadcasters. National Public Radio certainly has an interest in this. I know that many of my constituents enjoy it, and it is in great jeopardy tonight if we don't act. I know one station has already gone off the air because of this bureaucratic snafu. The NPR affiliate Rock Island Illinois-based WVIK served hundreds of thousands of citizens. They have switched off their Web stream because this is an economically untenable situation for them if it is not fixed. So what their constituents and their customers are now hearing over the Internet is silence. Silence may be better than some of the music my kids have listened to over the years, but it is not better than the thousands of stations and access that people have over the Internet. We want to keep that available for Americans. 
   I also want to say that why I think this is so important is diversity. One of the best things about the Internet is it gives you what you want, not what the broadcaster wants you to listen to. And, frankly, because of the consolidation of the industry and the radio over-the-air industry, we are hearing a lot more of the same thing over and over and over again. And some of it is great music. We are still stuck in the 1960s, many of us, and we enjoy it, but diversity and having access to Appalachian bluegrass or music from the subcontinent of India; I heard of a genre, it was basically heavy metal, hip-hop, country at the same time, and that is quite a genre. But this provides diversity for people, and they ought to have their multiple tastes enjoyed and that is really in jeopardy tonight. 
   Now, the other thing I want to say is that this decision will go into effect July 15, and these stations will be in great economic jeopardy beginning just in a week or so; and, unfortunately, some of them as of July 15 might shut off their streaming. Others are going to start to consider what to do. Some may consider going offshore, which is not a healthy situation for us for a variety of reasons. 
   But I want to assure the parties who might be involved in discussions in this that after July 15 it will not be the end of this discussion. If Congress is unable to act before July 15 and if the parties don't reach some resolution of this, July 15 will not be the end of this effort. It will not be the beginning of the end of this effort; it might be the end of the beginning of this effort, because as these stations start to shut down, Congress will be deluged more than they have already been deluged with voices of protestation exercising their right to petition their government for redress of grievances, and one of the biggest grievances people are going to have is they can't hear their radios over the Internet anymore. The 128 cosponsors we have today even before the sword of Damocles has fallen on the music is going to grow, and we are going to be back here to continue to grow this until we get relief. 
   So I am hopeful that the parties are talking to one another to try to reach an economically viable and fair resolution of this so that artists, performers, songwriters can continue to have a meaningful economic model, so they can continue to do their work and they will be compensated for it; that Web casters can have an economic model to allow them to stream it over the Web, and 70 million Americans can continue to enjoy the pursuit of happiness over the Internet listening to this great music. If that does not happen by July 15, we are going to be back here until it gets resolved and this chorus, this drumbeat will continue. We do not intend to let, in the words of Don McLean's song, not allow the music to die. It is, too, a part of the American culture, and I will encourage my colleagues to help out by cosponsoring this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for H.R. 4, the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act. 
   I strongly believe Medicare should ensure seniors have access to the drugs and biologics they need. In the past, my reluctance to support this kind of legislation has stemmed from the hope that we might find an alternative solution to the fact that our citizens, including our seniors, are subsidizing the research and development for drugs and biologics for the rest of the developed world, which has traditionally not paid its fair share of these costs. It is with the recognition that such a remedy is not forthcoming that I cast my vote today in favor of H.R. 4. 
   I applaud the Democratic Leadership's desire to ensure that this legislation continues to prohibit the HHS Secretary from requiring a particular formulary or list of covered drugs to be used by Medicare prescription drug plans or limiting access to any prescription medication. As a Member that represents a district with a strong biotechnology sector, I believe that America's continuing leadership and innovation in developing new treatments would make this particularly inappropriate. 
   Small, emerging biotech companies are researching and developing cures for cancer, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis and other devastating diseases. The overwhelming majority of biotech companies are small companies without approved products, highly reliant on the public and private capital markets. It is important that as we seek to ensure that our seniors are receiving the best care possible under Medicare, we must not take action that hinders this important research, which is estimated to cost $1.2 billion and can take over 10 years. Research and development that is the lifeblood of the biotechnology industry, and we must guard against taking action that would result in fewer breakthrough therapies.

   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Chairman, due to unexpected circumstances, I missed the vote on the College Opportunity and Affordability Act, H.R. 4137, important legislation to reauthorize and strengthen key Higher Education Act programs aimed at making college education more affordable and accessible for American students. Had I been present, I would have voted in favor of the legislation that will keep America's economy competitive. 
   Overall, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act will address major issues facing our Nation's students from simplifying student aid forms to addressing rising textbook and tuition costs. The bill will increase assistance for Veterans and military families and bolster students' interest in science and technology by partnering with businesses and other stakeholders. 
   I commend Chairman MILLER and HINOJOSA for their diligent work on the underlying legislation and for their support for my amendment that was passed to improve key education grants by setting higher environmental standards for recipients. The amendment ensures that Sustainability Planning Grants are awarded to projects aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, guaranteeing that Federal funds make a meaningful impact on global warming and requires that certain Federal grantees demonstrate that they meet or exceed American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, ASHRAE, energy-efficiency standards when designing new facilities. Finally, the amendment would add a Sense of Congress to reject the President's FY2009 budget proposal to eliminate the important Perkins Loan Program, a critical educational program for high-need students who will become a modern green workforce. 
   Additionally, I applaud Representatives BLUMENAUER and EHLERS for their work to include provisions to support green higher education efforts. Many of our Nation's 4,000 colleges and universities are taking action to reduce greenhouse-gas pollution, which currently accounts for 7 percent of U.S. carbon emissions. Federal grants should be available to give a boost to such projects, like the state-of-the-art, carbon-neutral science laboratory being planned at Cascadia Community College in my district.

It's a beautiful dorm, and they are saving enormous amounts of energy because they built it green with good insulation, co-generation, triple-pane windows. It's a great idea. 
   We have an amendment that has been incorporated that is going to help colleges move forward in three ways. First, it will call for those who use these Federal funds for the colleges to meet or exceed minimum energy efficiency standards for their new renovations or construction as developed by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, two other ways we are going to do it.

   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Chairman, I rise with Mr. Sarbanes to offer an amendment today that will establish an energy conservation corps program. This will provide green collar training and educational service grants to nonprofit organizations, universities, and State and local governments. This is really an exciting opportunity for us to create opportunities for young folks to be engaged in this new revolution of clean energy in this country. 
   The energy conservation corps we envisioned will help revitalize communities and preserve and restore the environment, while also preparing young people for the responsible and productive lives we know they are going to have. 
   The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 will create hundreds of thousands of new opportunities for Americans. It will give low-income young people training to fill these green collar jobs that we are now excited about and hope for a prosperous and successful future. 
   The conservation corps will fund energy conservation installations in public spaces, energy efficient green housing for elderly and low-income people, and restoration of historic structures on public lands. It would also provide funding for and repair, renovation, and rehabbing of existing infrastructure facilities, and transportation enhancements and recreational trail improvements. It is going to help a lot of places that we need energy conservation. It also establishes a competitive grant program to fund National Senior Service Corps programs that will involve seniors in providing meaningful volunteer opportunities. 
   Now, there are multiple organizations that can participate in this, one of which just as an example is the Student Conservation Association. Under this grant program, they will be able to deploy sustainable community projects which engage disadvantaged and other youth to help communities learn energy saving and water conservation techniques and strategies to prevent pollution. 
   In this program, SCA corps members will be able to provide a variety of energy-related services to homeowners, schools, and businesses, and communities. These services include outreach and education, facility audits, development of energy reduction strategies, and implementation in support of these programs. As part of this program, corps members will receive training, career development, and life skills while helping communities benefit from these sustainable programs. 
   I am familiar with this organization, the SCA. My parents led Student Conservation Association efforts with young people in Mt. Rainier National Park back in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and I saw how important these programs were both to help these communities, and to help the young folks themselves. Because what we have learned is, and what I saw firsthand when my folks worked with the SCA kids, once kids get involved in volunteer programs, once they get involved in their communities, once they get involved in clean energy, they are never going to turn back. This is going to be a lifetime pursuit, and there is nothing better we can do to help both kids' lives but this clean energy revolution we are going to launch in this country. 
   So, by establishing the energy conservation corps, we will help make our  Nation's volunteer programs into a true 21st century program, and we will also help solve one of the most pressing challenges of this century, global warming, while helping our kids as well. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to Chairwoman McCarthy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, the previous speaker alluded to a financial crisis we are now in that has occurred in part because of greed and avarice and incompetence and perhaps fraud, but it's also arisen because of the lack of an honest, tough regulatory system to rein in those abuses that has been most unfortunate during the last several years. It's happened sort of in the dead of the night, and it points out the need for Uncle Sam to provide a regulatory system that really stands up for hardworking Americans. 
   And I come to talk about one of those things that we need, which is a regulatory system to make sure that Americans have access to multiple sources of information so that we can make studied, reasoned decisions about public policy. And unfortunately, under the Bush administration, which I must say has not done a heck of a job in regulating the financial services industry the last few years, has also not done a heck of a job recently in providing a regulatory structure that would give Americans access to multiple sources of information in our news outlets. 
   Specifically, what I'm concerned about, I'd like to talk about tonight, is the Federal Communications Commission, under this administration, has attempted to allow greater consolidation in our media outlets which basically reduces the sources and multiple diverse sources of information that Americans receive, and this has happened in the dark of the night. I'd like to address this problem tonight. 
   Many of my colleagues have advocated against the consolidation of our news outlets because we know having multiple sources of information is healthy for public debate. It's absolutely intrinsic to a functioning democracy, and that's why we were outraged when the FCC voted last December to lift a ban on one company owning a daily newspaper and a broadcast station in the same market, too much consolidation.
