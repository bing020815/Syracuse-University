<DOCNO>Mr. NADLER. (PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   I rise in support of this bill to reauthorize Amtrak, create a State grant program for intercity passenger rail, and invest in high-speed rail corridors. I want to thank the chairman, Jim Oberstar, and Corrine Brown and Ranking Members Mica and Shuster for moving this bill, which is long overdue. 
   For years, Amtrak has been underfunded and threatened with bankruptcy. For the last several years, Amtrak has received just enough money to maintain its system while many critical capital improvements have had to be postponed. As of 2005, Amtrak had a backlog of $4.2 billion in capital investments, which rises to $6 billion if you include the necessary bridge and tunnel improvements. Even with adequate funding, it will probably take 10 years to complete the work to bring the system into a state of good repair. 
   We cannot afford to play catchup with our rail transportation system, certainly not as gas prices continue to skyrocket. We have to look for ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat global warming. We should be shifting people from cars and airplanes onto rail. 
   This bill is also of particular benefit to the Northeast and to New York. In addition to the investments in the Northeast Corridor, the bill authorizes $2.5 billion for a new State capital grant program for intercity passenger rail projects. I am particularly thankful to the committee for structuring this program so that projects such as the Moynihan Station project in New York City are eligible to apply for these grants. Penn Station in my district is the largest station in the passenger rail network and is the hub of the Northeast Corridor. It is basically at capacity. If we are to increase rail traffic, we have to look beyond just the track space between cities to improving the stations at the end of the line. I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar for working with us to ensure that the language was written in such a way that projects like Moynihan Station are eligible. 
   Investing in high-speed rail is an urgent issue. We must accelerate investment in our rail infrastructure. This bill finally starts to authorize rail investments at an adequate level. It makes eminent sense as part of a rational energy and transportation policy. I urge all of my colleagues to support it. 
   I thank again the chairman and the ranking member.

   Mr. NADLER. I appreciate the gentleman yielding to me. And I wasn't planning to debate this; I just happened to be walking through the Chamber and I heard what you were saying. People are entitled to their opinions, but they're not entitled to misquote what the bill does, which is what I've been hearing. 
   First of all, it is quite correct, as the gentlelady from New Mexico said, that the FISA law needed to be updated.

   Mr. NADLER. I will say two things. Number one, the RESTORE Act, the bill that was pulled from the floor, number one takes care of that technological problem, just as the bill that was passed in August does, by updating and making clear that foreign-to-foreign communications that come through a server in the United States do not need a warrant. So that's not an issue because this bill does it. 
   Second of all, let me just make the two points. And second of all, I think I heard you say, both of you, somebody here, that if you were tapping some terrorist abroad and he called into the United States and you heard him talk about terrorism with somebody in the United States, that you could not tap that, you could not use that information. That's simply not true.

   Mr. NADLER. Thank you. Two points. One, what was just said about that motion to recommit, the contents of the motion to recommit, that nothing shall be construed as barring, tapping or wiretapping, whatever the language was, bin Laden, Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda, et cetera, was completely unobjectionable. Indeed, it was totally superfluous. Had that motion said the motion is to recommit the bill to committee to amend it to include these words, and to report the bill back forthwith so we 
   could have continued the debate, we would have accepted that amendment. We would have said fine. It doesn't change anything. Fine. 
   But, as you know, the amendment said report back promptly, which would have entailed at least a 2-week delay. That's why the bill was pulled, not because of the subject matter, but because of the word ``promptly.''

   Mr. NADLER. Yes, it was going to pass a different bill. We wanted to pass a bill before they did, so that's why we were in a hurry. 
   But getting back to the point we said a few minutes ago, I don't have the benefit of the language. I know you have it there from the manager's amendment which I haven't seen, or the context. But I do know the following: The whole point, Admiral McConnell is quite correct when he says, obviously, if you're tapping whoever in a foreign country, you don't know who he's going to call. You're tapping that one point. You're tapping Mohammed in Karachi because you know that he, you suspect he's a terrorist that's involved. If he calls someone else abroad no one thinks you need a warrant or anything else. Under the bill, if he calls someone in the United States, either you hear it, you can't help hearing it. Either that conversation is innocent or it's involved with something that makes you suspicious of terrorism. If it's innocent, you have to engage in minimization procedures so you don't unduly and inadvertently violate the privacy of some American for an innocent conversation. If it's not innocent, then you, with that information, you can continue listening and if necessary you can get a warrant. And that's the general design of the amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. NADLER. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support this resolution and to call upon my colleagues to make a commitment to protect our troops and to bring them home as quickly and safely as possible. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people and Members of Congress were deceived. Every reason we were given for invading Iraq was false. Weapons of mass destruction, not there. Saddam Hussein working hand in glove with al Qaeda, not true. 
   I ask you, if the President had gone to the American people and said, we must invade a country that poses no imminent threat to us and sacrifice thousands of lives in order to create a  democratic government in Iraq, would we have assented? I think not. 
   As the President now says to us that we should continue indefinitely to expend American blood and treasure to support one side in a sectarian civil war, should Congress continue to consent? I think not. We need to say enough already. Enough with the lies and the deceit and the evasions, enough with the useless bloodshed. 
   We must protect our troops and ensure their safety while they are in Iraq. But we must not send more troops there to intervene in a civil war whose outcome they cannot determine. 
   And we should set a swift timetable to withdraw our troops from Iraq and let the contending Iraqi factions know that we will not continue to expend American blood and treasure to referee their civil war. 
   Only if faced with the reality of imminent withdrawal of American troops might the Iraqis strike a deal with each other and end the civil war. We know, Mr. Speaker, that the administration has botched the handling of this war. They stood by as Baghdad was looted, they failed to guard ammunition depots, they disbanded the Iraqi Army, they crippled the government by firing all of the competent civil servants in the name of debaathification, and they wasted countless billions of dollars on private contractors and on God only knows what with no accounting. 
   And all this while they continued to deny resources to the real war on the real terrorists. They let Osama bin Laden escape.     
   They allowed the Taliban to recover and to reconquer. They allow our ports to remain unprotected from uninspected shipping containers, and they let loose nuclear materials remain unaccounted for, waiting to be smuggled to al Qaeda to be made into nuclear weapons. 
   And why does the President want more troops in Iraq? To expand our role from fighting Sunni insurgents to fighting the Shiite militias also. Of course, when we attack the Shiite militias, they will respond by shifting their targets from Sunnis to American troops. American casualties will skyrocket, and we will be fighting two insurgencies instead of one. 
   I believe the President has no real plan other than not to ``lose Iraq'' on his watch, and to hand over the whole mess to a successor in 2 years. He will ignore anything we do that doesn't have the force of law. That is why this resolution must be only the first step. 
   In the supplemental budget we will consider next month, we should exercise the only real power we have, the Congressional power of the purse. We will not cut off the funds and leave our troops defenseless before the enemy, as the demagogues would imply. But we should limit the use of the funds we provide to protecting the troops while they are in Iraq and to withdrawing them on a timetable mandated in the law. We should provide funds to rebuild the Army and to raise our readiness levels. We should provide funds for diplomatic conferences in case there is any possibility of negotiating an end to the Iraqi civil war. And we should provide funds for economic reconstruction assistance. But above all, we must use the power of the purse to mandate a timetable to withdraw the troops from Iraq. 
   We must use the power the people have entrusted to us. The best way to protect our troops is to withdraw them from the middle of a civil war they cannot win and that is not our fight. 
   I know that if we withdraw the troops, the civil war may continue and could get worse. But this is probably inevitable no matter how long our troops remain. And if the Iraqis must fight a civil war, I would rather they fight it without 20,000 more Americans dying. 
   Yes, the blindness of the administration is largely to blame for starting a civil war in Iraq, but we cannot end it. Only the Iraqis can settle their civil war. We can only make it worse and waste our blood and treasure pointlessly. 
   So let us pass this resolution, and then let us lead this country out of the morass in Iraq so that we can devote our resources to protecting ourselves from the terrorists and to improving the lives of our people.

<DOCNO>Mr. NADLER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3685, EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am committed to the passage of an ENDA that protects lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees. I have been a lead sponsor for proposals like ENDA every year since I became a member of the New York State Assembly 30 years ago. I am a proud original cosponsor of the original ENDA bill that would protect the entire LGBT community. 
   I believe that civil rights are best advanced by bringing forward a bill that adequately protects all members of the LGBT community. While this may be risky, it is not reason to accept defeat before the fact and to leave behind members of the community who desperately need protection against employment discrimination. 
   As we have seen in many States, the failure to include transgender people in civil rights legislation from the beginning makes it more difficult to extend protections later. My own State of New York, which enacted employment protections for lesbians and gays, has yet to extend these protections to the transgender community. 
   The Senate has yet even to introduce its version of ENDA. Indeed, even if Congress were to adopt a noninclusive ENDA, the President has already pledged to veto this legislation. So it is not a question, as the gentleman from Massachusetts said, of now choosing to protect a great number of people and leaving behind a smaller number of people as the price of so doing because we cannot pass this legislation into law and protect anyone this year, unfortunately. We must look to the future when we have a President who will support equality. I believe it is important we take a principled stand now and speak with a strong and united voice for equal rights for all Americans, whether they are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender in order to maximize the chance that when we can enact an ENDA bill into law, it will be an inclusive bill that protects everyone's rights. And we must better educate lawmakers and the public about the issues of gender identity and expression. 
   While I may disagree with some of my colleagues on strategy, I assure you that we are united in support of the ultimate goal, protection from employment discrimination for the entire LGBT community. No one should underestimate the strength of that common commitment or our dedication to seeing it realized. Transgender Americans, because of a lack of familiarity and understanding, are more likely to face employment discrimination and, therefore, more in need of protection from irrational discrimination that an inclusive ENDA would afford. 
   And removing gender identity from ENDA may also leave lesbian and gay employees vulnerable to discrimination for failing to conform to gender stereotypes. In other words, some employers and courts may take an overly restrictive view that an exclusive ENDA fails to protect lesbians who appear ``too masculine'' or gay men who appear ``too effeminate.'' That is not our intent, nor do we believe it is an accurate reading of the bill, but congressional intent does not always carry the day. Splitting sexual orientation and gender identity disserves the entire LGBT community and invites the kind of legal mischief that has undermined other civil rights laws.  
   The fundamental issue is this: There are still too many places where it is entirely legal to discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender employees. We must bring an end to this unfair, unacceptable and un-American situation. 
   When the House considers ENDA today, I will support the amendment introduced by Congresswoman Baldwin to restore the protections from discrimination based on gender identity. Should that amendment fail, I will not be able to vote for the underlying bill because it fails to uphold adequately the American values of fairness, equality and inclusion, but I will continue to fight for a proper ENDA bill that includes all the people who need its help.

<DOCNO>Mr. NADLER. (TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the bill and, in particular, its provisions to help families obtain affordable housing with Section 8 vouchers and to help people with HIV/AIDS to secure housing with the assistance of the HOPWA program. 
   I want to thank the chairman for including $300 million in this bill for Housing Opportunities for People With AIDS, the highest funding level ever for this program; and for providing $403 million more than current funding for the Section 8 Tenant-Based Rental Assistance program. For years, we have had to fight for every nickel of funding and offer amendments for modest increases. It is a true pleasure to be working with a Chairman who better understands the needs of the American people and who is able to dedicate resources to areas of great need. 
   Rising housing costs and stagnating incomes have created serious housing affordability problems for growing numbers of low-income families. Years of Republican budget cuts have seriously damaged our public housing stock and forced thousands of people onto waiting lists for assistance. The list in NY grew so long that they stopped accepting applications. They have only recently announced their intention to reopen it, and they have been inundated by qualified people seeking help. To reduce the number of low-income families with severe housing affordability problems, it is critical that Congress increase Section 8 funding and resume funding for incremental vouchers, which I am pleased this bill does. The section 8 housing voucher program provides safe affordable housing to approximately 2 million American families in urban and rural communities in every State across our country. These vouchers are often the only resource for low-income families confronted by our Nation's affordable housing crisis. 
   In the past, my colleague Representative Vel&#225;zquez and I, often with the support of Chairman Frank, have offered amendments that have passed with bipartisan support to increase the Section 8 program. We were successful in passing amendments in 2003, 2005, and 2006 to increase funding so that more families would be able to obtain affordable housing. While we can always do more and clearly there are still many unmet needs, I am pleased by the increases in today's bill. 
   [See Roll Call 267, 109th Congress 2nd Session (243-178), Roll Call 339, 109th Congress 1st Session (225-194), Roll Call 453, 108th Congress 1st Session (217-208)]. 
   HOPWA is the only Federal housing program that specifically provides cities and states with the resources to address the housing crisis facing people living with HIV/AIDS. Americans living with HIV/AIDS are often forced to choose between expensive drug treatments and necessities such as housing. According to the National AIDS Housing Network, rates of new HIV diagnoses among the homeless are 16 times the rate in the general population, and HIV/AIDS death rates are five to seven times higher. People with AIDS who are homeless are more likely to be uninsured, use an emergency room, and be admitted to a hospital. 
   Inadequate housing is not only a barrier to treatment, but also puts people with HIV/AIDS at risk of premature death from exposure to other diseases, poor nutrition, stress and lack of medical care. Tragically, at any given time, one-third to one-half of all Americans with HIV/AIDS are either homeless or in imminent danger of becoming homeless.  
   There is a desperate need for HIV/AIDS housing, and HOPWA answers this need. By providing suitable, reasonably-priced housing, HOPWA enables cities and states to design and provide community-based, cost-effective housing for thousands of people living with HIV/AIDS and their families. It provides maximum flexibility so that states and communities can implement strategies that respond to local housing needs and shortfalls. In addition, the administrative costs of the program are capped, ensuring the money goes directly to serving people with HIV/AIDS. 
   Providing supportive housing is crucial to the well-being of thousands of people living with HIV/AIDS, and is a cost-effective approach to the AIDS housing crisis. Again, I thank the chairman for supporting HOPWA and Section 8.

<DOCNO>Mr. NADLER. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I voted against the Iraq war resolution, the PATRIOT Act, the FISA Act amendments; and I led the opposition to the bankruptcy bill just a few years ago, in each case because I thought we were being railroaded into unwise actions through the use of fear tactics. But I do not believe that to be the case now. Now we face a very real crisis. 
   The credit markets are shutting down. People will not be able to get car loans, loans for store inventories. There will be thousands of bank failures, millions of job losses. I believe we stand now literally on the brink of the abyss, and that we haven't seen such a situation since 1931. 
   This is in many ways a weak bill. There should have been far more help for people facing foreclosures. There should have been bankruptcy reforms. There should have been real revenues to pay for it. There should have been a real stimulus to the economy. But this is the only bill that could be agreed upon now. 
   We are not sure this bill will solve the crisis, but it might. It will buy us time for a better solution. As between a certainty of catastrophe and a possibility of averting that catastrophe, I will vote for the possibility of averting the catastrophe. I urge everyone else to do so.

<DOCNO>Mr. NADLER. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise reluctantly in support of this rescue package. I have great reservations about this legislation, but after looking at the situation carefully, reviewing the facts, and speaking with economists whose views and expertise I value, I believe that the threat to our credit markets is both real and urgent. 
   Is the danger severe enough to warrant supporting a bill about which I have strenuous reservations? I believe so. 
   In the past, I have been very skeptical of proposals brought to us by this administration with the warning that the situation was dire, that we could not afford to be more deliberate, and that we must give the administration broad new powers. I opposed the USA PATRIOT Act, the recent FISA legislation, and the vote to authorize the war in Iraq. In each instance, we were told that the danger was great and imminent. The administration went so far as to warn of a smoking gun in the form of a mushroom cloud. 
   Unfortunately, these tactics worked, and Congress was stampeded into doing the wrong thing. In each case, it was not easy to stand in the way of the stampede, but, in my judgment, after examining all the known facts, it was the right and necessary thing to do. 
   In this case, the administration should have seen this crisis coming years ago. Many of us warned that the administration's deregulation policies were leading us toward disaster, but so long as unprecedented profits were rolling in, the voices of caution were ignored. 
   The near-religious belief that unrestrained markets would bring nothing but good times, that real estate prices would spiral upward forever, that financial instruments that even the directors of the firms selling them did not understand, would always bring prosperity, permeated thinking in government and out. 
   History should have taught us otherwise. Our current situation proves otherwise. 
   When the final accounting came, the boom was revealed for what it was: history's largest and most costly ponzi scheme. 
   Finally, the administration acted--belatedly and arrogantly. Only a week ago, they told us that the situation was dire, that they needed $700 billion--more even than the President's Iraq adventure has cost so far--and presented us with a three page proposal that said essentially, ``Give the Treasury Secretary a free hand with nearly a trillion dollars, make sure no one can go to court to stop him if he gets out of hand, forget any oversight or transparency, don't worry about paying for it, don't do anything to help the middle class, then buzz off.'' 
   In defense of that request, they said we should just trust them--the same people who got us into this crisis--with power even the Vice President only dreams of. 
   As the old joke goes: how do you say ``drop dead'' in Washington? ``Trust me.'' Only this time, it's not funny. 
   The legislation before us today is not very attractive, but it is greatly improved from the President's proposal. The bill has increased transparency. It leaves available court remedies, although not as many as I would want. It partially repays the taxpayers by providing for acquiring an equity stake in participating firms. It does have real oversight. 
   I am deeply disappointed that some very important provisions for which I fought were not included. 
   The package should have been paid for with a repeal of tax breaks on the wealthy, and of giveaway tax benefits for oil companies and other big corporations and for the industry that caused this mess. The shareholders should have borne more of the cost of this package. They are the ones who profited, and they are the ones who should pay. I do not believe in privatizing profits while socializing risk. That's not capitalism, that's lemon socialism--the people get only the lemons. 
   It is clear that the taxpayers will not be on the hook for the full $700 billion authorized, because the securities that will be acquired are not as worthless as the market now assumes, although we do not know how much they are really worth. 
   I believe that the Bankruptcy Code should have been fixed so that families with predatory  or subprime mortgages could restructure their mortgages. Mortgages are the only secured debts in bankruptcy that cannot be restructured. Investors can do it with their properties; The Senator from Arizona [Senator MCCAIN] can do it with six of his seven houses; you can do it with airplanes, yachts, steel plants, or anything else. The only exception is the family home. That's wrong, and we should have fixed it in this bill. 
   We need comprehensive regulatory reform in order to stave off the next financial catastrophe, and we need a President and regulators willing to enforce the laws we have on the books. The bill does not do that, but the next Congress must enact comprehensive regulatory reform. We need to take away from this experience the lesson I had thought the nation learned in 1929. Sound regulation in markets is necessary to maintain stability. 
   So, as I said, I am angry that we are in a situation we could and should have avoided, and I am disappointed with the bill we are voting on today. I am especially angry that we are now at a point where, as unpopular as this is--and my constituents have told me that they do not like this any more than I do--we must act. 
   The crisis is real and immediate. If the credit markets freeze, as they started to do last week, and as we are warned by almost all credible economists they will if we do not act, we will face a calamity. All economic activity dependent on credit will cease. Businesses will not get loans to expand or to meet their payrolls. Thousands of banks will fail, ATM machines will dispense no funds, credit cards will be worthless, millions will be thrown out of work, and we could face a repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s. We cannot be certain this bill will stave off this calamity, but it might. When faced with a choice between a certainty of catastrophe and a possibility of averting a catastrophe, the choice is clear. 
   Madam Speaker, I reluctantly support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. NADLER. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5349, a 21-day extension of the existing FISA Act to provide Congress the time to work out the differences between the two Houses on this very important matter. It is a question of our Nation's security and it is a question of our Nation's values. We should not be stampeded into action when there is no need. This administration has the ability to monitor terrorists, and extending current law for 21 days will not remove that ability. 
   What this debate is really about is whether national security wiretapping should be subject to judicial and congressional oversight, as the bill that we passed last November, the RESTORE Act, provides and as traditional American values insist on, or whether the administration, any administration, can be trusted to police itself, whether American citizens' liberty should be subject to the unreviewable discretion of the Executive as the Protect America Act and the Senate-passed bill provide.           
   Also at stake is the question of so-called telecom immunity. We know what they are asking. They are asking that the lawsuits against the telecommunications companies for participating in the warrantless surveillance program, allegedly in violation of the FISA law, be foreclosed. 
   Now there are only two possibilities. There are two narratives: Either the telecom companies nobly and patriotically assisted the administration against terrorism. That is one narrative. Or the telecom companies knowingly and criminally participated in a criminal conspiracy in violation of the law, aiding and abetting a lawless administration to violate Americans' liberties and privacy rights against the Constitution and against the FISA Act. I believe it is the second. But it's not up to me or up to anybody else here to  decide that. That's why we have courts. Courts determine questions of law and fact. People are out there who believe their rights were violated. They've brought a lawsuit. Let the lawsuits continue. Let the courts decide whether the telecom companies acted properly or acted in violation of the law. It is not the job of Congress to foreclose that judgment. 
   We have been told: If we pass telecom immunity and if we fail to control abuse of the state secrets privilege that has been abused by the administration to prevent the courts or the Congress from reviewing what they have done, there will be no mechanism in the courts or in the Congress to know, let alone to control, what the Executive is doing. The separation of powers established by the Constitution to protect our liberties will have been destroyed. That way lies the slow death of liberty. It must not be permitted. 
   We have been told by this administration, Trust us. I'm not in a very trusting mood these days, nor should we ever trust any administration without judicial and congressional oversight. 
   I remind everyone here that there is a bill that passed this House, the RESTORE Act, last November. The Senate finally got around to passing a bill yesterday. Now we are being told we should have no time to work out the differences as we normally try to do, we must take the Senate bill sight unseen. Frankly, that's an insult to every Member of this House and to the prerogatives of this House. We passed a bill. They passed a bill. We should have 21 days to work out the differences. American liberty is depending on this, and the integrity of this House depends on this. I urge passage of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, 1 week ago today, we marked the sixth anniversary of the tragic events of September 11, 2001. I appreciate the opportunity to speak today about an issue that faces not just my district, where the attack on the United States occurred, where the World Trade Center once stood, but our entire Nation. 
   I am honored to be here today to support legislation sponsored by CAROLYN MALONEY and myself and others. CAROLYN has been such a strong advocate for the living victims of 9/11. 
   I also want to thank Chairmen GEORGE MILLER and FRANK PALLONE for the recent hearings they have held on this issue, one last week and one earlier today. 
   I am pleased to announce that yesterday, along with Congresswoman Maloney and others, I introduced essential new legislation that would ensure that everyone exposed to World Trade Center toxins, no matter where they live now or in the future, would have a right to high-quality medical monitoring and treatment and access to a reopened victim compensation fund for their losses. 
   Whether you are a first responder who toiled without proper protection, who came to help in the rescue and recovery from New York, from elsewhere in New York or from elsewhere in the country, or whether you're an area resident worker or student who was caught in the plume, or subject to ongoing indoor contamination, if you were harmed by the environmental effects of 9/11, you would be eligible. 
   This bill builds on the best ideas brought to Congress thus far, and on the infrastructure already in place providing critical treatment and monitoring. 
   Mr. Speaker, when the World Trade Center collapsed on September 11, 2001, the towers sent up a plume of poisonous dust that blanketed Lower Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn, Queens, and New Jersey. A toxic cloud of lead, dioxin, asbestos, mercury, Benzene, PCBs, PAHs and other hazardous contaminants swirled around the site and around Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn and Jersey City as rescue workers labored furiously in the wreckage, many without adequate protective gear. Thousands of first responders inhaled this poisonous dust before it settled onto and into countless homes, shops and office buildings where it remains to this day. 
   Mr. Speaker, I've always said that there were two coverups conducted here, two coverups conducted by the administration. The first coverup was that the air was okay, that no one would get sick from the exposure to World Trade Center dust at or near Ground Zero. The administration denied the air was toxic and insisted that no one would get sick. They lied. They lied deliberately to the American people, to the people of New York, to the first responders. They said the air was safe, when they had test results saying it was toxic. As a result, tests at Mt. Sinai Hospital published in a peer reviewed medical study just about a year ago revealed that of the 10,000 first responders tested, over 70 percent suffer  from lung disease at this point, or at least as of last year. We have seen this in test after test and study after study. All the literature goes in the same direction. Thousands of people are sick who need not have been sick. Thousands of people are sick because the administration lied, and because OSHA failed to do its job. 
   Mr. Speaker, there was air pollution at the site of the Pentagon attack on this country also. But OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, enforced the law. Nobody was permitted to work on the site without wearing proper respiratory protective gear, as the law demands. 
   Mr. Speaker, nobody is suffering lung damage or respiratory disease today as a result of participating in the rescue and recovery efforts at the Pentagon. But in Lower Manhattan, somebody made a deliberate decision not to enforce the occupational safety and health laws. OSHA did not enforce the laws. People were permitted on the site without respirators. Indeed, public officials went to the site and wore only masks, paper masks, which were worse than useless, we are told by the scientists. Many workers worked without respirators. Many workers had no access to respirators. Police officers have testified they had no access to respirators. 
   Many workers who did have access to respirators believed the assurances they got that the air was safe and didn't use the respirators because they got in the way of the work. The result is, thousands of people are sick and some are dead, unnecessarily, as a result of the malfeasance, the deliberate malfeasance of the Federal Government. 
   Mr. Speaker, two things establish a moral obligation 
   on the Federal Government. One, the people who were hurt, the people who are sick as a result of participating in the clean up, the people who are sick as a result of living in Lower Manhattan or working in Lower Manhattan, the government workers who returned to government offices in the Securities and Exchange Commission or other government agencies and worked there before the buildings had been cleaned and are now sick as a result, are sick for two reasons. They are sick because of the terrorist attack on this country, and they are sick because their government lied to them and urged people to go back into unsafe environments and told people things were safe when they weren't. 
   We owe, the Federal Government owes a moral debt to all these victims. Because they are victims of a terrorist attack on this country, the words of Abraham Lincoln apply. Abraham Lincoln said that it is the duty of all of us to care for him who shall have borne the battle. The people who are sick today with deadly illnesses, with long-term illnesses, are just as much victims of the terrorists as those 3,000 people who were killed on 9/11, and the United States Government owes them long-term health care, monitoring and treatment because they are victims of the attack on the United States. Al Qaeda didn't attack them individually. They attacked United States. They happen to be the individual victims. 
   Secondly, they are victimized because, many of them, perhaps most of them would not have gotten sick if the Federal Government had not lied to them and if the Federal Government had not decided not to enforce the occupational safety and health laws. That too establishes a moral obligation to care for the victims of the Federal malfeasance. 
   Now, that is all the first coverup. But as a result of the Mt. Sinai study, as a result of other studies that have come out all within the last year as a result of some newspaper reports, that coverup has unraveled. Almost nobody today still maintains that these people aren't sick as a result of 9/11. The only question is how best to deal with that sickness. 
   And the answer, we believe, is that the Federal Government should adopt the bill, Congress should adopt the bill that Congresswoman Maloney and I and others introduced that provides two things: one, reopen the victims compensation fund for people whose health was damaged, who weren't immediately killed, but whose lives were perhaps shortened, whose health was damaged as a result of 9/11 of the attack on our country. 
   And, secondly, provide for long-term medical monitoring and treatment through the centers of excellence, through the institutions that have treated people and through a network of institutions that would be, not formed, but would be brought into a network around the country that would be fed the latest data on diagnosis and treatment. So this legislation ought to be adopted. 
   Secondly, Senator Clinton and I have introduced legislation of a more immediate nature to appropriate $1.9 billion for the next 5 years to provide for this medical monitoring and treatment in case we cannot immediately adopt the long-term legislation that Congresswoman Maloney and I have introduced. The mayor of New York estimates that the annual cost of treatment for the first responders is now about $198 million and will increase to $413 million in the next few years as more and more people need more and more treatment. 
   But I said there were two coverups. The second coverup is the failure of EPA to clean up indoor contamination. When the World Trade Center collapsed, it released, as I said, thousands of tons of toxic dust and debris. Much of it settled on the ground and in the air outdoors; much of it blew in through windows and into heating vents and air conditioning vents, into buildings, all throughout Manhattan and Queens and Brooklyn and perhaps New Jersey. 
   Now, nature cleans up the outdoor air. The rain washes the toxins away. The wind blows them away.     
   Nature does not clean up the indoor air. Only people can clean up the indoor air. Only people can clean up the residue of those toxins that are still there. And if they are not properly cleaned up, they will stay there, and they will stay there forever, poisoning people on a daily basis. And that is exactly what we have reason to believe is going on. 
   Now, the EPA said people should clean up on their own. Under the Giuliani administration, the City of New York said landlords should clean up the exterior surfaces of buildings and the public spaces in the buildings but let the tenants, individual tenants, individual residents, individual small business owners and large business owners, to clean up their space, without providing any help or expertise to do so. And, of course, most of these spaces were not properly cleaned. 
   The EPA and New York City Department of Health put on its Web site very early on that if you came home and you saw World Trade Center dust in your apartment, clean it up with a wet mop and a wet rag. And if there is a lot of dust, if it's really thick, consider using a HEPA filter. 
   Now, this advice is illegal because the law says you may not remove or move asbestos-containing material unless you are trained and certified and licensed to do so and unless you are wearing a moon suit, proper protective equipment. OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, ruled that all World Trade Center dust had to be presumed to be asbestos-containing material because there were thousands of tons of asbestos in the World Trade Center. We know that. So this advice said illegally move this material. 
   Now, when we had a hearing in our subcommittee, the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties, back in June, I inquired of Christie Todd Whitman, the former head of EPA at the time, I said, Governor Whitman, when you were administrator of EPA, if you were told that some company or some individuals who were not trained to do so were removing asbestos-containing material, what would you do? 
   She said, We would certainly have arrested them. 
   I said, If you were told they were disposing of that material in the garage, in the regular garage, what would you have done? 
   We would certainly have arrested them, she said. 
   But EPA and the City Department of Health put on their Web site the advice to do exactly that to every individual who saw the World Trade Center dust in their own apartment. 
   So this was illegal advice, but it was also unsafe advice. It was also unsafe  advice because if you remove asbestos-containing material without wearing proper respiratory protection, you are guaranteed to inhale some of that, and that's poison. That's toxic. Not to mention all the other toxins that we know were in that dust. And, also, if you are not trained properly how to do this, you are not going to do a thorough job. You may think you have cleaned your apartment or your office, but the material is still going to be in the drapes. It's still going to be in the carpets. It's still going to be in the porous wood surfaces. It's still going to be in the HVAC system. It's still going to be behind the refrigerator or the stove. And every time the baby crawls on that carpet for the next however many years, the baby is going to release some into the atmosphere and is going to inhale it. So these indoor spaces are unsafe to work or live in. And we are daily poisoning people. 
   How many such spaces? Tens of apartments, hundreds of apartments, thousands of apartments, tens of thousands of apartments? We don't know. Over what geographic area does this spread? We don't know because EPA, the Federal Government, never did any proper testing. 
   Now, they say they did testing, but the EPA's own Inspector General says it was nonsense. The EPA says it did a cleanup in 2002, an indoor cleanup, on a voluntary basis of several thousand apartments. But the EPA's own Inspector General said it was a phony cleanup for any number of reasons I won't go into now. And every time that anyone qualified has looked at this, they have labeled what has been done hazardous and phony. 
   At my request, back in February and March of 2002, the EPA's ombudsman held public hearings in lower Manhattan to talk about the indoor contamination to examine this. What did the EPA do? They dismantled the ombudsman's office after telling people not to attend the hearing. The EPA Inspector General released a report in August of 2003 labeling the EPA's actions atrocious and its cleanup phony. What did the EPA do? It ignored the recommendations. 
   Under pressure from Senator Clinton and myself and others, the EPA in 2004 formed a scientific advisory panel to look into this and to advise us what ought to be done. But when the scientific advisory panel of people hand picked by the EPA started coming to the conclusions similar to what I have been stating here, what did the EPA do? Did they listen? No. They dismantled the panel and they didn't permit them to issue a report. The administration has promised us reports; we haven't seen them. 
   What has to be done? What has to be done is what the Inspector General recommended 4 years ago. What the Inspector General said was that there has to be active testing of indoor spaces, several hundred indoor spaces, in concentric circles from the World Trade Center. Why concentric circles? To see how far the contamination expanded and still exists. 
   Now, the EPA, when they talked about their cleanup, they established an arbitrary line. They said, We consider that the problem is limited to lower Manhattan below Canal Street, as if there were a 30,000-foot-high wall at Canal Street blocking the plume from going north of Canal Street, as if there were a 30,000-foot wall across the East River and the Hudson River protecting New Jersey and Queens and Brooklyn. Well, I've never seen any evidence of that 30,000-foot wall. We have to assume that the toxins went in these places too. We have to find out where they went. That's why the Inspector General instructed us that we should properly inspect several hundred indoor spaces, randomly selected indoor 
   spaces, in concentric circles from the World Trade Center to see where the contamination extended to. And it may be that in one direction it extends three blocks and in another direction three miles. It may be, as I said, that we are talking about a few hundred apartments or tens of thousands. We don't know. But wherever that extended, wherever the tests in the concentric circles show that those toxins are present indoors, we must draw lines on the map, and then we must go into every single building in those geographic areas, however small or large the areas may be, and professionally clean them up. This may take several hundred million dollars; it may take several billion dollars. We won't know the extent of it until we do the testing. But as long as we don't do that testing, we have to assume, from everything we know, that hundreds, maybe thousands, maybe tens of thousands of people are being poisoned daily and will come down 10 years from now with mesothelioma, with lung cancer, asbestosis, and other dreaded diseases because they are living or working in contaminated environments. 
   And we know something else about these kinds of contaminated environments. We know the effects of the toxins are cumulative. That is to say, if you waved a magic wand tomorrow and cleaned up all the contaminated indoor spaces, a certain number of people, we don't know how many, we don't know whom, but a certain number of people, because of the failure over the last 6 years to clean up these indoor spaces, because they worked there for 6 years, are unavoidably destined to come down with these dreaded diseases because we didn't clean it up 6 years ago. But if we don't wave that magic wand, if we don't conduct a proper cleanup, then a much larger number of people will come down with lung cancer, mesothelioma, asbestosis, and so forth 10 and 15 years from now. And the liability, the tort liability, of billions, tens of billions, maybe hundreds of billions of dollars, will mount up and mount up. 
   Now, this second coverup is still covered up in the sense that the government doesn't admit the problem. On the first coverup that thousands of people are sick, almost nobody denies it anymore. We know that. The only question is what we do about it, and I spoke about that a few minutes ago. We should make sure that people are plugged into centers of excellence and networks and we should pass legislation affording them long-term health care, monitoring and services. But this problem that we still have, people who will come down with these dread diseases unnecessarily because they are being exposed on a daily basis to World Trade Center toxins that were never cleaned up, this is still unadmitted by the EPA or by the Federal Government. 
   Mr. Speaker, if we are going to be true to what we have said about the heroes of 9/11, if we are going to be true to what Abraham Lincoln said when he said that it is our duty to care for him who shall have borne the battle, we must do two things: We must provide for the long-term monitoring and health care by passing the bill that CAROLYN and others and I introduced yesterday. We must also demand that EPA implement a proper indoor testing and cleaning program. Not a cleanup that the EPA's own scientific advisory panel says is a joke and a fraud, not a cleanup that the EPA's Inspector General says is woefully inadequate, but a proper cleanup to test buildings thoroughly, to test for all pollutants, not just for one or two, and that is not limited by arbitrary geographic boundaries in a way that allows the EPA to minimize its responsibility. 
   Mr. Speaker, for the past 6 years, we have demanded that the EPA, that this administration, fulfill its legal mandate to protect the public health by telling the truth about post-9/11 air quality and by implementing a scientifically sound testing and cleanup program to address indoor contamination. They have absolutely failed on both fronts. The Federal Government has incurred a heavy moral liability because the blood of many of the people who will die early because of these diseases lies on the hands not only of the terrorists but of the administration officials who lied to the people about the conditions and therefore caused people to work in unsafe environments and who are continuing to allow people to work today in unsafe environments. If we are to be true to the survivors and the heroes of 9/11, we must learn something of this nightmare so that, God forbid, if there is a disaster, natural or manmade, we will protect the innocent rather than allowing our malfeasance and carelessness to shorten the lives of thousands of people. 
   Now, when we have talked about this in the past, some people have said, and Christie Todd Whitman, the former administrator of EPA has said, the fault for all the people who are suffering and dying is the fault of the terrorists. Of course that is partially true. If the terrorists hadn't attacked us, none of these people would be sick.  
   But it is the job of government and of government officials to minimize damages, to mitigate damages, to make sure that the number of people who get sick and die because of a terrorist attack is the fewest possible. Not to act in such a way that thousands of people who would have been fine had it not been for the malfeasance of government are not going to be fine. So for that it is the terrorists' fault but it is also the fault of these government officials. And that is another reason why the government has a heavy moral responsibility to clean up the indoor environment so that people stop being further exposed to the toxins so that we put a halt to further numbers of people getting sick from this. And, secondly, the government has a heavy moral responsibility to help those who have lost their jobs because they can no longer breathe, who are getting sick, who are sick, to minimize their damages by making sure that their health care is not a problem, by enacting legislation to provide for long-term health care and monitoring. 
   So I thank you for yielding to me. I hope that these rather harsh words but realistic words and absolutely truthful words will get some response from an administration that has been completely callous toward the survivors and has paid only lip service toward the survivors, and I hope that we can redeem the moral values that we all share on behalf of the Federal Government by doing the right thing in the future on this if we have not done so in the past, which we have not.

<DOCNO>Mr. NADLER. (DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I first want to thank Chairman Obey for including $50 million for treating the health needs of 9/11 first responders from all over the country in this bill. Without his leadership, the heroes of 9/11 would still be waiting for the Federal funding they so desperately need for medical treatment following their work at Ground Zero. Although this funding is an important step, we need so much more. 
   Just this morning the New York Times revealed a new study by the Department of Health and Human Services that says that the cost of treating 9/11 illnesses will reach $20 million a month, $20 million a month by the end of this year. 
   The Federal Government must drastically increase its funding commitment if it is to fulfill its obligation to those suffering the health effects of 9/11. But today's bill is at least a first step. 
   We have all heard the harrowing stories of those first responders, firefighters, police officers, emergency medical technicians and countless others from all around the country who responded and put their own lives in danger to save others. But they are not the only victims of the environmental disaster that resulted from the attacks on the World Trade Center. 
   The toxic mixture of asbestos, mercury, benzene, dioxins, jet fuel and other harmful substances landed inside apartments and schools and office buildings. The dust settled onto furniture and carpets and onto curtains and air ducts. 
   Before buildings in Lower Manhattan had ever been tested to insure that they were safe to reoccupy, residents were urged by the EPA to return to their homes near Ground Zero, and students were sent back to school, where they breathed poisonous dust for months. 
   Residents and students followed EPA instructions to clean up the dust in their apartments with a ``wet mop or a wet rag,'' a completely inadequate, not to say illegal, method for cleaning up asbestos and other toxic materials. 
   Students at Stuyvesant High School returned to a building that sat next to enormous piles of toxic debris being carted off to landfills. To this day, there has been no comprehensive testing or cleanup of World Trade Center dust in buildings in Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn and Jersey City. More than 5 years later, an increasing number of residents and students are now becoming ill from 9/11 toxins.     
   Residents and students, in addition to first responders, should be eligible for 9/11 health funding as our colleagues in the Senate seek to do but this bill does not do. 
   I had planned to offer an amendment that would have made residents and students eligible for 9/11 health funding, too. I will not offer that amendment tonight, but I will express the hope that the chairman will support, as we go forward, the work to provide treatment to the tens and thousands of residents and students who are now suffering and will suffer the health effects of 9/11. And I hope we will accede to the Senate version of the bill. 
   On a separate matter, I would also like to say that I am extremely pleased to see that $39 million has been included in this bill for arts and education. In past years I have had to offer amendments to add funds in this area, but for the first time we have a bill before us that does a very good job in arts and education. The funds provided in this bill are vital as they bring the arts to schoolchildren across the country, many of whom would otherwise have no other opportunity to experience the arts. 
   I again thank the chairman for his initiative in this respect.

<DOCNO>Mr. NADLER. (ARTS REQUIRE TIMELY SERVICE (ARTS) ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1312, the Arts Require Timely  Service Act, or the ARTS Act, and I thank Congressman BERMAN and Chairman Conyers for their leadership on this important issue. 
   Under immigration law, foreign artists or groups must obtain a visa in order to perform in America. However, over the last few years, this process has been severely delayed, leading some nonprofits to stop planning events that include foreign artists altogether. These delays not only impact the immediate availability of foreign artists to perform alongside American artists, but also threaten to impede the ability of U.S. artists to perform abroad. 
   The ARTS Act would address these delays by requiring the Government to expedite--without any additional fees--visas for foreign artists that are not processed within 30 days of filing, if the visa petition is filed on behalf of a qualified nonprofit organization. 
   The ARTS Act will help end the delays and uncertainties in the processing of visa petitions for foreign guest artists coming to the United States. 
   America is a great land of opportunity for artists, and in my district, this is particularly true. New York City prides itself as being an international center for the arts, yet the current system is failing it. It is becoming increasingly difficult for too many foreign artists to come to America to perform. Foreign artists bring to America their own unique artistic abilities, and every time they are essentially prevented from performing in America, we do a disservice to the arts and to ourselves.

<DOCNO>Mr. NADLER. (EXPRESSING SENSE OF HOUSE REGARDING CREATION OF REFUGEE POPULATIONS -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution which I introduced, along with Representatives ROS-LEHTINEN, CROWLEY and FERGUSON. I am proud to stand alongside of them, as well as Chairman Berman and Representative Ackerman, who have been strong leaders on the issue of Jewish refugees from Arab lands, in this historic moment of recognition of these refugees. 
   I would also like to take a moment to commend the leadership of our late chairman, Tom Lantos, whose leadership on this issue and on all human rights issues has been critical to opening this debate and to recognizing the rights of refugees throughout the world. 
   This resolution is not just about a forgotten chapter of history. For centuries, long before the advent of Islam and long after it, Jewish communities lived peacefully and often prosperously and productively in Arab lands among Arab people. Their forced relocation and the material value they lost when they were compelled to abandon their homes and other properties in Arab countries has never been redressed. For example, in Iraq, a community of 150,000 in 1948 dwindles to around 10 today. In Egypt, a community of 75,000 in 1945 became between 50 and 100 today. In Yemen and Aden, 63,000 in 1948 became 200 in 2003. 140,000 Jews lived in Tunisia in 1948, less than 100 remained in 2004. 
   In Morocco, which is hailed today as a bastion of Jewish-Arab coexistence in the Arab world, a thriving community of more than a quarter million Jews lived their lives in peace by 1948; by 2003, only 5,500 remained. Some left willingly, most did not. 
   While the plight of Palestinian refugees is well known throughout the world and has been a major element in every Arab-Israeli peace plan and negotiation, the plight of these Jewish refugees is rarely mentioned these days. Nevertheless, numerous international agreements pertaining to the Arab-Israeli conflict have been codified with the rights of the Jewish refugees in mind. U.N. Security Council resolution 242, passed on November 22, 1967, after the Six Day War, calls for a just settlement to the refugee problem without limiting that problem to Palestinians. In fact, the Soviet Union tried to limit that resolution to Palestinians and it was rejected. 
   Presidents Carter and Clinton stated explicitly that the issue of Jewish refugees must be a part of any comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace agreement. And lest there be any doubt about this status, the U.N. High Commission on Refugees in 1957 ruled that Jewish people that fled Arab countries were, indeed, ``refugees.'' 
   This principle is reaffirmed in the Camp David Accords and in the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty. The treaty states, ``The parties agree to establish a Claims Committee for the mutual settlement of all financial claims.'' And it also states, ``Jewish refugees have the same rights as others do.'' 
   These Jewish refugees, Madam Speaker, were expelled systematically under official regime policies, which included state-fostered anti-Jewish decrees, pogroms, murders and hangings, anti-Semitic incitement and ethnic cleansing. They were done in accordance with an Arab League 1947 decree that provided a formula to promote state-sanctioned discriminatory measures that were replicated in many Arab countries in a deliberate campaign to expel the entire Jewish population from their home countries. And unlike the Palestinians, the Jewish refugees, having been expelled from the Arab countries, were absorbed into their host countries, mostly by Israel. About 600,000 refugees went to Israel, and the remaining 300,000 fled to other countries, such as France, Canada, Italy and the United States. In Israel today, the majority of the population consists of Jews from Arab countries and their children and grandchildren. 
   The right of Jewish refugees from Middle Eastern lands to seek redress does not in any way conflict with the rights of Palestinian refugees to seek redress, and resolution states this explicitly. This resolution merely expresses the sense of Congress that Jewish refugees, many of whom were so effectively absorbed by the State of Israel, should not be denied their legitimate rights and compensation for the property of which they were deprived. 
   The resolution further states that a comprehensive Middle East peace agreement can be credible and enduring only if it achieves legitimate rights of all refugees, ``including Jews, Christians and other populations'' displaced from Middle East countries. Importantly, it also resolves that the President should instruct the U.S. Representative at the U.N. and all U.S. representatives in bilateral and multilateral fora to use their voice, their vote and the influence of the United States to ensure that any resolutions relating to the issue of Middle East refugees which include a reference to the required resolution of the Palestinian refugee issue must also include a similarly explicit reference to the resolution of the issue of Jewish refugees from Arab countries, and to make clear that the United States Government supports the position that as an integral part of any comprehensive and much to be desired Arab-Israeli peace, the issue of refugees from the Middle East, north Africa and the Persian Gulf must be resolved in a manner that includes recognition of the legitimate rights of and losses incurred by all refugees displaced from Arab countries, including Jews, Christians and other groups. 
   There is broad bipartisan support for this resolution, which was passed with unanimous consent from the Foreign Affairs Committee. Many Jewish groups have endorsed the resolution, including the American Jewish Committee, Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, Hadassah, the Union for Reform Judaism, the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, the Anti-Defamation League, and the Orthodox Union, among others. I must particularly acknowledge the work of B'nai B'rith International and the strong leadership of Justice for Jews from Arab Countries, which has led the International Rights and Redress Campaign. As of September 2007, this coalition to secure the rights of Jewish refugees from Arab lands includes 72 organizations and 20 countries. 
   It is important to deal with this issue now while some of the original refugees are still alive. Justice for Jews from Arab Countries has organized a campaign to conduct public education programs on the heritage and rights of former Jewish refugees from Arab countries, to register family history narratives, and to catalogue communal and individual losses suffered by Jews who fled from Arab countries. 
   By adopting this resolution and urging that the rights of Jewish refugees be recognized in any future comprehensive Middle East settlement, we are simply seeking to ensure that any such agreement is just, fully just to all parties. As a member of the Quartet, and in light of the United States' central and indispensable role in promoting a just Middle East peace, the U.S. must reaffirm that it embraces a just and comprehensive approach to the issue of Middle East refugees. I urge strong report for this resolution.

   Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, what a deaf President we have. The American people told him loud and clear on November 7 that we want to change course in Iraq. He doesn't hear them. 
   The Iraq Study Group told him loud and clear we must change course in Iraq and certainly not escalate; he doesn't hear them. 
   His generals tell him that more troops won't do any good, will simply increase American casualties; he hears them, but he fires them and gets generals that will tell him what he wants to hear. 
   There is nothing more clear today than that the civil war in Iraq is a civil war, that there is no function for the United States to try to help one side against the other in that civil war. Indeed, one could make the case we picked the wrong side, and that we must withdraw our troops. We must tell the Iraqis that we are withdrawing, and we are withdrawing on a timetable. You make a deal with each other, you live together or fight your own civil war, we are not going to do it for you. 
   Mr. Speaker, for that we should not escalate. We should pass legislation in this Congress saying funds that are appropriated can be used only to protect the troops and to withdraw them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and the bill because I believe it does two critical and important things. 
   First, it provides $50 billion to finance military withdrawal from Iraq, to be completed by the end of next year. I voted against the beginning of the war, and I have consistently tried to end America's involvement in the war. Saddam Hussein is gone, there were no weapons of mass destruction, and there was no Iraqi involvement with al Qaeda or with 9/11. Al Qaeda in Iraq is now in shatters and subject to attack by both Shiites and Sunnis and poses no ongoing threat to the United States. We have no stake in the Iraqi civil war, and it is time to end our occupation. 
   I signed a letter to the President back in July with over 60 of my colleagues vowing not to support any more money for the war in Iraq unless it was for the protection and redeployment of our troops. I believe this bill is consistent with that commitment. The time has come to end the war, and the money we provide should be used only for that purpose. 
   The second critical thing this bill does is to end torture by the United States Government. By including in this bill the American Anti-Torture Act, which was introduced by Representative Delahunt and myself, we are saying, once and for all, no more torture. The law now requires the Department of Defense to follow the Army Field Manual, which bars torture or cruel and inhuman procedures such as waterboarding. This bill extends these limits to every U.S. government agency, including the CIA, and ensures a single, uniform, baseline standard for all interrogations of people under U.S. control. In short, that means no more waterboarding, no more clever wordplay, no more evasive answers, and no more uncertainty with regard to what is allowed and what is not allowed. It is time to restore the honor of the United States and to force the administration to act in a manner consistent with the Constitution. 
   When this bill is passed, the President could have two options: He could sign this bill and help bring the war in Iraq to a speedy end. Or he could veto the bill, in which case he will have to explain why he is denying funds for the troops. But we will not vote for further funding without a requirement to withdraw the troops as in this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, let's end this war and let's end torture. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, it is a disgrace, a blot on our Nation that the citizens of our Capital do not have a voice in Congress. 
   Whatever technical issues there may be with respect to rectifying this problem, we must never lose sight of the fact that our democracy is permanently stained by the disenfranchisement of a large group of our citizens who pay taxes, serve in our wars, work in our government, and bear all the responsibilities, but do not have all the rights of citizenship. 
   Whether you took a cab to work today or rode the Metro or bought a cup of coffee or walked down the sidewalk or were protected by a police officer, your safety, your livelihood, every aspect of your life was made possible by people who have no vote in our democratic society. There is no excuse for that. 
   Now, we have heard from people who say, well, we should change this, but let's amend the Constitution. We have tried that. Very difficult. 
   We have heard from people who say, well, we should change this, but let's do it another way that will take forever and that haven't worked. This way we are told, doing it by statute, giving the District of Columbia a vote in the House by statute, is unconstitutional. 
   Well, it is not unconstitutional. The fact is the Constitution says that the Congress shall have power to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over such District, as may, by cession of particular States, become the seat of the Government of the United States. Exclusive jurisdiction. Very plenary power. 
   The Constitution also says in Article III, discussing the powers of Federal courts: The judicial power shall extend to controversies between citizens of different States, so-called diversity jurisdiction. 
   One of the earlier cases cited by the Supreme Court was that citizens of the District of Columbia have standing to go into Federal court and sue citizens of a different State, of any State under diversity jurisdiction, because the District of Columbia, for that purpose at least, is considered a State, and the Supreme Court was very clear on this. And if the District of Columbia is a State for purposes of diversity jurisdiction under Article III of the Constitution, there is no reason why Congress cannot take advantage of that fact and legislate under its exclusive jurisdiction clause that the District of Columbia is a State for purposes of representation in the House of Representatives. 
   The judicial cases are fairly clear. We have ample constitutional authority to do this, and we should take that up. Let those who are opposed to American citizens having taxation without representation, let those who are supportive of American citizens be subjected to taxation without representation, let those who are opposed to American citizens having the full rights of citizens, let them go to court and argue that it is unconstitutional. Let us assert our authority, because we believe it is constitutional. The courts will ultimately decide if the Bush administration continues to oppose this bill and has threatened to veto. 
   What I don't hear from the administration is any concern about the injustice of depriving D.C. citizens of the right to vote, which speaks volumes about the administration's hostility to voting rights. 
   If we are to have the audacity to hold ourselves out to the world as a beacon of freedom and democracy, if we want to lecture other countries about the importance of freedom and democracy, as this Congress and the President regularly seek to do, we need to clean up our own House. I urge passage of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the contempt resolutions. Unfortunately, these resolutions are necessary for Congress to meet its Constitutional obligations and conduct oversight and investigations. We provided many opportunities for the administration to avoid this situation. But here we are. 
   We are here today to consider issuing contempt citations for former White House Counsel Harriet Miers and White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten for their failure even to appear in response to valid subpoenas issued in our investigation of the firings of a number of United States Attorneys and related matters concerning the politicization of the Justice Department. We issued these subpoenas only after repeated unsuccessful attempts to secure their cooperation voluntarily. 
   It is one thing to assert a legal privilege; but no one has a legal right simply to refuse to appear at all. 
   This investigation seeks answers to ensure that the American people can trust the Justice Department to be guided by the law and not by political obligations or pressures. 
   This resolution is about the rule of law. We are taught about a system of checks and balances to prevent abuses, but this Executive has shown that it thinks the rules do not apply to it. This sets a dangerous precedent for our democracy. Our system of government works only when each branch respects the authority and role of the others, and follows the rule of law. 
   For the sake of our democracy, for the sake of the rule of law, and for the sake of our Constitution, I urge my colleagues to support the resolutions.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this dangerous and ill-considered legislation. 
   Once again, this House is being stampeded by fear-mongering and deception into signing away our rights. If you trust this President and if you trust this dishonest Attorney General to exercise unfettered power to spy on Americans without any court supervision, then you should support this bill. 
   If you still believe in the America our Founders, the Framers and every succeeding generation has fought and died for, then you must oppose this legislation. 
   This bill is not what the Director of National Intelligence told us he needed. That was embodied in the bill that we considered last night and that we should be considering tonight, the House bill. We were told that we needed to fix the foreign-to-foreign intelligence. That bill fixed it. 
   We were told we had to compel electronics companies to do what the government needs to do on properly authorized surveillance. That bill did it. The Director of National Intelligence told us we had to deal with all foreign intelligence, we had to deal with recurring communications into the United States from foreign targets. That bill did it. That bill dealt with everything we were told was necessary for national security. 
   This bill is what Karl Rove and his political operatives in the White House decided they need to win elections. That is not national security, that is political warfare. 
   I do not believe we will soon be able to undo this damage. Rights given away are not easily regained. This bill is not needed to protect America from terrorists. *.*.* 
   We should stand up for America. We should stand up for our freedoms. We should stand up for our security. We should reject this bill so we can go and do the right thing and pass the bill that we had on the floor last night that did everything necessary for our national security. It gave us all the right to do the wiretapping and the surveillance we need. We should all be willing to stay here as long as it takes. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

<DOCNO>Mr. NADLER. (INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - March 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago, I joined my colleagues in writing to the President urging him to sign this conference report. This conference report contains a provision that mirrors legislation which I authored with Congressman Delahunt, the American Anti-Torture Act, that would ensure a single, uniform baseline standard for all interrogations conducted by the U.S. intelligence community. I applaud the leadership of Senator Feinstein and the other conferees for including this measure in the report. 
   Since news of the mistreatment, and possible torture, of detainees in U.S. custody first surfaced, Congress has debated, and legislated, on the subject of the legal, and moral, limits on interrogation. Torture is unworthy of the United States and its people. It places every American, especially every American in uniform around the world, at grave risk. 
   The United States has historically been a leader in the effort to establish and enforce the laws of war and the conventions against torture. The Army Field Manual is an outstanding example of how our modern military effectively gathers intelligence and observes international norms of conduct. 
   We all understand the critical role that intelligence plays in helping us achieve these goals. But torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, besides being contrary to our values, have proven not to be effective in obtaining actionable intelligence. Current and former members of the military have made it clear that torture doesn't work. 
   That includes General Petraeus, who wrote an open letter that the standards in the Army Field Manual ``work effectively and humanely in eliciting information from detainees.'' Lieutenant General Kimmons, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence, similarly stated that ``No good intelligence is going to come from abusive practices. Any piece of intelligence which is obtained under duress, under, through the use of abusive techniques would be of questionable credibility.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, the President and this administration have repeatedly said that America does not torture. But most intelligent people know the word of this administration cannot be trusted. And to prove the point, when asked to place those assurances into law, the  President refuses. Now Congress must act to override the President's veto and hold him to his word. 
   And later this week, we will deal with FISA. And all the nonsense spewed by the other side will be dealt with because we will again, as we did last November, pass a bill which will give every tool the administration says they need to them but will place it under judicial and congressional supervision to protect our liberties as well as our safety. 
   I urge support of this veto override to outlaw torture once and for all.

   Mr. NADLER. I thank the gentleman. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to commend the distinguished majority leader and the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner) as well as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the chairman of the Education and Labor Committee for their leadership on this important legislation. 
   This bill would help to restore the Americans with Disabilities Act to its rightful place among this Nation's great civil rights laws. 
   This legislation is long overdue. Countless Americans with disabilities have already been deprived of the opportunity to prove that they have been victims of discrimination, that they are qualified for a job, or that a reasonable accommodation would afford them an opportunity to participate fully at work and in community life. 
   This bill fixes the absurd Catch-22 created by the Supreme Court in which an individual can face discrimination on the basis of an actual past or perceived disability and yet not be considered sufficiently disabled to be protected against that discrimination by the ADA. That was never Congress' intent, and this bill cures this problem. 
   Some of my colleagues from across the aisle have raised concerns that this bill might cover minor or trivial conditions. They worry about covering stomachaches, the common cold, mild seasonal allergies, or even a hangnail. I have yet to see a case where the ADA covered an individual with a hangnail. But I have seen scores of cases where the ADA was construed not to cover individuals with cancer, epilepsy, diabetes, severe intellectual impairment, HIV, muscular dystrophy, and multiple sclerosis. 
   These people have too often been excluded because their impairment, however serious or debilitating, was mischaracterized by the courts as temporary or its impact considered too short-lived and not permanent enough. 
   That's what happened to Mary Ann Pimental, a nurse with breast cancer who challenged her employer's failure to rehire her into her position when she returned from treatment. Ms. Pimental was told by the court that her cancer was not a disability and that she was not covered by the ADA. The court recognized that ``there is no question that her cancer has dramatically affected her life, and that the associated impairment has been real and extraordinarily difficult for her and her family.'' Yet the court still denied her coverage because it characterized the impact of her cancer ``short-lived''--meaning that it ``did not have a substantial lasting effect'' on her. 
   Mary Ann Pimental died as a result of her breast cancer 4 months after the court issued its decision. I am sure that her husband and two children disagreed with the court that her cancer was short-lived and not sufficiently permanent. 
   This bill ensures that individuals like Mary Ann Pimental are covered by the law when they need it. The bill requires the courts--and the Federal agencies providing expert guidance--to lower the burden for obtaining coverage under this landmark civil rights law. This new standard is not onerous and is meant to reduce needless litigation over the threshold question of coverage. 
   It is our sincere hope that, with the passage of this bill, we will finally be able to focus on the important questions: Is an individual qualified? Might a reasonable accommodation afford that person the same opportunities that his or her neighbors enjoy? 
   I therefore urge my colleagues to join me in voting for passage of H.R. 3195 as reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee. I thank everyone associated with its passage.  
   Madam Speaker, I want to commend the distinguished majority leader and gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr. Sensenbrenner, for their leadership on this important legislation. 
   H.R. 3195 would help to restore the Americans with Disabilities Act to its rightful place among this Nation's great civil rights laws. 
   This legislation is necessary to correct Supreme Court decisions that have created an absurd Catch-22 in which an individual can face discrimination on the basis of an actual, past, or perceived disability and yet not be considered sufficiently disabled to be protected against that discrimination by the ADA. That was never Congress's intent, and H.R. 3195 cures this problem. 
   H.R. 3195 lowers the burden of proving that one is disabled enough to qualify for coverage. It does this by directing courts to read the definition broadly, as is appropriate for remedial civil rights legislation. It also redefines the term ``substantially limits,'' which was restrictively interpreted by the courts to set a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled. An individual now must show that his or her impairment ``materially restricts'' performance of major life activities. While the impact of the impairment must still be important, it need not severely or significantly restrict one's ability to engage in those activities central to most people's daily lives, including working.  
   Under this new standard, for example, it should be considered a material restriction if an individual is disqualified from his or her job of choice because of an impairment. An individual should not need to prove that he or she is unable to perform a broad class or range of jobs. We fully expect that the courts, and the Federal agencies providing expert guidance, will revisit prior rulings and guidance and adjust the burden of proving the requisite ``material'' limitation to qualify for coverage. 
   This legislation is long overdue. Countless Americans with disabilities have already been deprived of the opportunity to prove that they have been victims of discrimination, that they are qualified for a job, or that a reasonable accommodation would afford them an opportunity to participate fully at work and in community life.

   These people have too often been excluded because their impairment, however serious or debilitating, was mis-characterized by the courts as temporary, or its impact considered too short-lived and not permanent enough--although it was serious enough to cost them the job. 
   That's what happened to Mary Ann Pimental, a nurse who was diagnosed with breast cancer after being promoted at her job. Mrs. Pimental had a mastectomy and underwent chemotherapy and radiation therapy. She suffered radiation burns and premature menopause. She had difficulty concentrating, and experienced extreme fatigue and shortness of breath. And when she felt well enough to return to work, she discovered that her job was gone and the only position available for her was part-time, with reduced benefits. 
   When Ms. Pimental challenged her employer's failure to rehire her into a better position, the court told her that her breast cancer was not a disability and that she was not covered by the ADA. The court recognized the ``terrible effect the cancer had upon'' her and even said that ``there is no question that her cancer has dramatically affected her life, and that the associated impairment has been real and extraordinarily difficult for her and her family.'' 
   Yet the court still denied her coverage under the ADA because it characterized the impact of her cancer as ``short-lived''--meaning that it ``did not have a substantial and lasting effect'' on her. 
   Mary Ann Pimental died as a result of her breast cancer 4 months after the court issued its decision. I am sure that her husband and two children disagree with the court's characterization of her cancer as ``short-lived,'' and not sufficiently permanent. 
   This House should also disagree--and does--as is shown by the broad bipartisan support for H.R. 3195. 
   H.R. 3195 ensures that individuals like Mary Ann Pimental are covered by the law when they need it. It directs the courts to interpret the definition of disability broadly, as is appropriate for remedial civil rights legislation.

   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for passage of H.R. 3195, as reported unanimously by the House Judiciary Committee.

<DOCNO>Mr. NADLER. (THE IRAQ WAR -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, 4 years ago, the United States invaded Iraq, ostensibly to eliminate weapons of mass destruction. When no such weapons were found, instead of declaring victory and bringing the troops home, the administration in its arrogance decided to dismantle the major institutions of Iraqi society and settle into a long-term occupation in order to remake Iraq in our own image. 
   The dismantling of Iraqi institutions, the army, the Baath party, et cetera, led to the breakdown of the delicate balances in Iraqi society and the emergence of civil war between Sunnis and Shiites. The continuing occupation led, as occupations do, to the development of a nationalist insurgency. 
   Now we have Sunni, Shiites and the insurgents shooting at each other and all shooting at American troops. This will go on as long as the occupation continues. The only way out is for Congress to mandate a timetable for a phased withdrawal of our troops. 
   Only such a mandate can get the Iraqi Government to step up to the plate. As Defense Secretary Gates said yesterday, the strong feelings expressed in the Congress about the timetable probably has had a positive impact in terms of communicating to the Iraqis that this is not an open-ended commitment. Only a mandated timetable for withdrawal will end the endless occupation and end the endless bloodshed of young Americans.

<DOCNO>Mr. NADLER. (FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, the last few weeks, the last few minutes we have heard assertions from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle that are false and designed to mislead and frighten the American people. They claim that we allowed the Protect America Act to expire, that we are dark for 27 days. 
   Ken Wainstein, the Assistant Attorney General of the United States, and the Bush administration admitted that because of the provisions of the group warrants in the Protect America Act that had gone on for a year, didn't change anything. It is still in effect, number one. 
   Number two, we forget, this House passed a FISA updating modernization bill in November, on November 14. We called it the RESTORE Act. We waited for the Senate to pass a bill so we could go to conference and compromise on it. When did they pass a bill? Not in November, not in December, not in January. Because of Republican foot-dragging, they didn't pass the bill until February, mid-February, three months after we passed the bill here, and two days before we went home for a week for the Presidents Day recess. 
   The President came out and said it's up to the House to pass the Senate bill, no questions asked. But there are a lot of questions about the Senate bill. Maybe our bill isn't perfect, but their bill is far from perfect, and our bill is closer to perfect than theirs.     
   So then we said, well, if you don't want, because catastrophe will happen, according to the President and the Republicans if we go home without passing the Senate bill, we will extend the Protect America Act for 3 weeks until we can come back and deal with this. Who voted it down? The Republicans. They said, no, don't extend it. The President said he would veto an extension. 
   So let's not hear any remarks on this floor from that side about how we are dark because the act expired. It expired because they made it expire. They voted against a 21-day extension that we could have renewed if necessary until we got this all figured out. So let's not hear any less-than-honest assertions about we are dark and we are unprotected and it is the Democrats' fault. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have a very good bill here. It gives the intelligence community every single tool they need and  every tool they say they need. How does it differ from the Senate bill? In two ways. One, it provides for some closer judicial supervision, because while we are giving the intelligence community the tools they need to wiretap on American citizens, on people who are not American citizens, we have to make sure that our constitutional rights and liberties are protected so that this country, which we have all defended, and we all want to defend, remains worthy of being defended by defending our own liberties. 
   Remember why we enacted protections in the first place, because the administration at the time wiretapped Martin Luther King. We don't want that to happen again by a future administration. And so we must protect our civil liberties. 
   We are told that telecom companies, if we don't provide retroactive immunity, they won't cooperate in the future, we won't get their help. Number one, that is an aspersion on their patriotism. Number two, they can be compelled to do so under court order. And number three, they have always had immunity. They have it now. All they have to do to have immunity is to have a request from the administration that says: A, we need your help; B, you are not violating the law if you do what we ask; and C, you don't need a court order. If they get that request, whether those assertions are true or not, as long as the administration says we need your help, what we are asking you to do won't violate the law, and you don't need a court order, they are absolutely immune. And they have always had this immunity. 
   So why do they need retroactive immunity, they say because the administration won't permit them to go to court and say we were asked for help, we gave that help. We have this request and we got the legal assurances because the administration won't let that go to court because it says it will violate State secrets. 
   So what does our bill do? It says you can go to court under secret procedures to protect the security of the State secrets, but you can assert your defense in court and get the case thrown out if you at least got the assurance by the administration in advance, which is all the law required. If you didn't get that, then you have no respect for the privacy rights of Americans and you don't deserve immunity. Even if we gave retroactive immunity for the future to the telecom company that helped us next week, they still have the same requirements for immunity. And if they wanted to go to court to assert them if someone sued them, they would still have to go to court and say the same thing. So you are dealing with a one-time fix. 
   Retroactive immunity takes it out of the courts and says Congress shall say to American citizens you're wrong, you can't protect your constitutional rights in court, you're right. That is a duty for the courts, not for Congress. That is the basis of the protections of all of our rights. The Senate bill goes the wrong way. We protect the telecom companies and protect our liberties. It is the right way to go. I urge adoption of this rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this carefully crafted legislation which gives our intelligence agencies all the tools they say they need to protect our country while protecting our fundamental civil liberties. 
   In the last few weeks, we have heard countless assertions from our colleagues on the other side that are false and misleading. They claim that we allowed the Protect America Act to expire, when it was the Republicans who blocked attempts to extend that bill temporarily, and they continue to claim that retroactive immunity for the telecom companies is necessary for the security of the country. 
   The telecom companies aided the administration's surveillance program. Some people, American citizens, believe their constitutional rights were violated and brought a lawsuit against the government and telecom companies. 
   There are two narratives here. One is that these companies patriotically aided the administration to protect Americans from terrorists. The other is that they conspired with a lawless administration to violate the constitutional rights of Americans. Which of these narratives is right is for a court to decide. It is not the role of Congress to decide legal cases between private parties. That is why we have courts. 
   We had told the telecom companies they would not be subject to lawsuits for doing their duty. But whether they were doing their duty or abusing the rights of Americans is precisely the issue. 
   In any event, the existing law already provides absolute immunity if their help was requested and if they were given a statement by the Attorney General or various other government officials stating that the requested help did not require a warrant or court order and would not break the law. They have immunity. Whether those statements are true or not, they can rely absolutely on the government's assertions. 
   So why do they think they need retroactive immunity? Because of the administration's sweeping assertion of the State secrets doctrine, will has prevented the companies from claiming their immunity. 
   This bill allows the telecom companies in secret in court to present the evidence for their immunity and to get their immunity, if they obeyed the law. And I remind that obeying the law means simply obtaining a statement from the government that the company's help is needed and that the requested help does not require a court order or violated the law. A company that assisted in spying on its customers without getting that simple assurance from the government does not deserve immunity. And even if we voted retroactive immunity, they would still have to prove that immunity for what they do next week in the same way, and they would have the same problem. 
   So, by solving the State secrets problem, we give the companies the immunity they need, if they need it, and if they obeyed the law. This still gives our intelligence agencies what they need. I urge its adoption.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3733, the FISA Amendments Act. This carefully crafted legislation gives our intelligence agencies all the tools they say they need to protect our country, while protecting our fundamental civil liberties. 
   Mr. Speaker, let us be clear about what this legislation does not do. It does not require individual warrants for the targeting of foreign terrorists located outside the United States. For three decades, that has been the law, and it will still be the law under this bill. There is no dispute about this. 
   The bill starts with the recognition that the intelligence community needs to surveil all members of a terrorist group--once that group is identified. Any suggestion that it requires individualized warrants to intercept communications of terrorists overseas is wrong. 
   The bill maintains the traditional requirement of a warrant when our intelligence agencies seek to conduct surveillance on Americans. And because some foreign surveillance may record conversations with Americans, the bill requires that, when the Government proposes to undertake surveillance of a foreign group or entity, it must first apply to the FISA court, except that, in an emergency, the surveillance can begin immediately, and the court can consider the surveillance procedures later. 
   In both this bill and the Senate bill, the government must inform the court of the procedures it will use to ensure that it is targeting only foreigners overseas and how it will ``minimize'' domestic information it might inadvertently pick up. The only real difference is that the Senate bill lets them listen first, then go to the court within 5 days. This bill requires that they go to the FISA Court first. But in an emergency, we give them 7 days to listen before they go to the court. So will someone please tell me how this minor difference between the bills somehow gives rights to terrorist? 
   There is one thing that this bill does not do, and this great body must not do--provide blanket, retroactive immunity to the telecommunication companies that assisted in the President's warrantless wiretapping program. Such a move would fly in the face of our notions of justice. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the last few weeks, we have heard countless assertions from our colleagues on the other side that are false and  misleading. They claim that we allowed the Protect America Act to expire--when it was the Republicans who blocked attempts to 
   extend that legislation temporarily. And they continue to claim that retroactive immunity for the telecom companies is necessary for the security of the country. But they have failed to provide any evidence for that claim. 
   The telecom companies aided the Administration's surveillance program. Some people--American citizens--believe their constitutional rights were violated, and brought suit against the government and the telecom companies. There are two narratives here. One is that the telecom companies patriotically aided the Administration in protecting Americans from terrorists. The other is that the telecom companies conspired with a lawless Administration to violate the Constitutional rights of Americans. Which of these narratives is correct is for a court to decide. 
   It is not the role of Congress to decide legal cases between private parties. That is why we have courts. If the claims are not meritorious, the courts will throw them out. But if the claims do have merit, we have no right to dismiss them without even reviewing the evidence. 
   We are told that the telecom companies should not be subject to lawsuits for doing their duty. But whether they were doing their duty, or abusing the rights of Americans, is precisely the issue. And that is a legal issue for the courts to decide. 
   In any event, the existing law, in a wise balance of national security and constitutional rights that this bill does not change, already provides absolute immunity to the telecom companies if their help was requested, and if they were given a statement by the Attorney General, or by various other government officials, stating that the requested help did not require a warrant or court order and would not break the law. They have immunity whether those statements were true or not. They can rely absolutely on the government's assertions. 
   So why do they think they need retroactive immunity? Because of the Administration's sweeping assertion of the ``state secrets'' doctrine, which has prevented the companies from claiming their immunity. 
   Title II of this bill will allow the telecoms to show the courts, in a secure setting, if they were obeying the law or if they weren't. It will allow the telecom companies to assert their immunity in court, and to present the relevant documents and evidence to the court in a secret session that protects any ``state secrets.'' The courts can then judge whether the telecom company obeyed the law--in which case it has complete immunity--or whether it did not. And, I remind you, that ``obeying the law'' means simply obtaining a statement from the government that the company's help is needed, and that the requested help does not require a court order or violate the law. A company that assisted in spying on its customers without getting that simple assurance does not deserve immunity. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill gives our intelligence agencies what they say they need. But it also demands that their extraordinary powers be used properly, and that they follow our laws and our Constitution. This bill will help limit this Administration's disregard for the rule of law. It is a carefully crafted measure, and deserves the support of every member in this body.

<DOCNO>Mr. NADLER. (LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill deals with violent crimes committed against victims who are singled out solely because someone doesn't like who they are. 
   Violent attacks because of actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or disability often cause serious injury or death. They are more serious than a normal assault because they target not just an individual, but an entire group. They spread terror to all members of the group and often deter them from exercising their constitutional rights, sometimes for simply walking down the wrong street. 
   The only question for Members is whether they believe that singling out a person for a crime of violence because of his or her race or religion or because any other trait is sufficiently heinous to merit strong punishment. 
   For many years, Mr. Speaker, Congress debated what were known as the Federal lynching laws. They were designed to deal with the widespread practice of lynching primarily African Americans. There was staunch resistance to those laws here in Congress. For three decades, they did not pass while thousands were lynched. We heard many of the same arguments then that we are hearing today. That was not a proud period in our Nation's history. Today, we can do the right thing. I hope we can agree to do so.  
   Under current law, the attackers of someone like Michael Sandy of Brooklyn, who was attacked simply because he was walking down a street and he was gay, could not be prosecuted for a hate crime because, under existing law, only victims targeted because they are engaged in a federally protected activity, such as voting, are protected. This bill expands the definition to cover all violent crimes motivated by race, color, creed, national origin, et cetera. 
   This is not an issue of free speech. This bill deals only with crimes of violence in which the victim is selected with his or her status. 
   The law routinely looks to the motivation of a crime and treats the more heinous of them differently. Manslaughter is different from premeditated murder, which is different from a contract killing. We all know how to make these distinctions. The law does it all the time. We ought to do it here; we ought to say that crimes of violence motivated by one's status are particularly heinous and ought to be treated as such.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. I thank the gentleman. 
   I thank the distinguished majority leader and the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner). Under their leadership, the House passed the ADA Amendments Act in June by an overwhelming vote of 402-17.  
   The Senate, under the leadership of Senators HARKIN and HATCH, has taken up our bipartisan call to restore the promise of the ADA and has passed a nearly identical bill, S. 3406. 
   Like the House bill, S. 3406 overturns Supreme Court decisions that have narrowed the scope of protection under the ADA. These decisions have created a catch-22, in which an individual who is able to lessen the adverse impact of an impairment by use of a mitigating measure like medicine or a hearing aid can be fired from a job or otherwise face discrimination on the basis of that impairment and yet not be considered sufficiently disabled to be protected by the ADA. Congress never intended such an absurd result. 
   Like the House bill, S. 3406 cures this problem by prohibiting courts from considering ``mitigating measures''--things like medicine, prosthetic devices, hearing aids, or the body's own compensation and ability to adapt--when determining whether an individual is disabled. On this important point, S. 3406 retains the exact same language as H.R. 3195.

<DOCNO>Mr. NADLER. (THE TIME IS NOW TO SUPPORT HEROES OF 9/11 -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I do thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I want to thank her for her leadership on this issue. I am pleased that we will soon be introducing legislation together to provide long-term health care to all the first responders, residents, area workers and students who have become sick as a result of the collapse of the World Trade Center. Our legislation will build on the efforts of the Centers of Excellence of New York City and will extend to people who came from all over the country to aid in the massive rescue and recovery effort after 9/11. 
   When the World Trade Center collapsed on that sunny morning 6 years ago, a plume of poisonous dust blanketed lower Manhattan, and not just Lower Manhattan, but parts of Brooklyn and possibly Jersey City, too. The cloud was a toxic mixture of lead, dioxin, asbestos, mercury, benzene, PCBs and other hazardous contaminants that swirled around the site where the World Trade Center once stood. The cloud blanketed the area as rescue and recovery workers worked around the clock. Many did so without adequate or without any protective gear. Thousands of first responders inhaled this poisonous dust before it settled onto and into countless homes, shops and office buildings in the area. 
   For the past 6 years, we have demanded that the EPA fulfill its legal mandate to protect the public health by telling the truth about post-9/11 air quality and by implementing a scientifically sound testing and cleanup program to address indoor contamination. They have absolutely failed on both fronts. 
   While America watched these brave men and women working fearlessly at the World Trade Center site, their government failed them and continues to fail them. As the Nation and the world united in solidarity, our government, this administration, put politics over science and safety. 
   Federal law mandates that when there is a terrorist attack in which toxins are released into the air, both the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration have specific responsibilities. EPA is charged with the cleanup and is the lead agency to deal with the pollution. The American public deserves to know why and how that did not happen. We are getting some answers though, painstakingly. 
   As Chair of the Subcommittee on Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, I chaired a hearing in June on the failures of the Federal Government in responding to the environmental crisis that resulted from the World Trade Center attacks. Senator Clinton held a companion hearing in the Senate. At the hearing we heard for the first time from Christine Todd Whitman, the former administrator of the EPA, who said her agency did nothing wrong, that they were honest with the public and that they listened to their scientists. But we know that EPA lied and to this day continues lying. We know that early tests revealed high levels of asbestos and other toxins and that EPA in statements vetted through the White House misled the public with their assurances that the air was safe to breathe. Independent scientists who testified in the hearing said that no amount of asbestos should be considered safe and that everyone knew that those buildings contained asbestos, hundreds of thousands of pounds of it before the buildings collapsed and released it into the air. 
   Indeed, there is no doubt that thousands of people are sick as a result of the contamination at the World Trade Center. Thousands of people are sick who would not be sick today if they had not been lied to by their own government and worked without protection on the pile for 13 and 14 and 15 weeks. 
   A study by Mount Sinai Hospital found that 70 percent of the more than 9,000 first responders who were studied suffered health problems related to their work at Ground Zero. These health problems include things like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung diseases and reactive airway disease. 
   A recent New York Times article highlighted the clear link between the World Trade Center dust and life-threatening diseases. The article cited the report from doctors from the Fire Department of New York and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, which again confirms what we have known for years, that we are facing a major health crisis as a result of September 11. 
   These studies do not even address the students at Stuyvesant High School and the Borough of Manhattan Community Colleges, schools that sat near piles of debris from the Towers, the nearby residents' apartments still contain poisonous dust or the thousands of people that work in offices that were never properly cleaned. These factors combined present an unprecedented challenge to public health not just to New York City but across the country. 
   In the days and weeks after 9/11, workers and volunteers came from across the country to help. The great citizens of this country came together, but the Federal Government has failed in its obligations. To this day there has been no comprehensive testing and cleanup of the affected areas, and to this day, there is no adequate provision for long-term monitoring of health care of the people who suffered in the aftermath of the World Trade Center disaster. 
   Now we are making, finally, small strides in providing health care to those who became ill. The emergency supplemental appropriations bill passed earlier this year because of the efforts of Mrs. Maloney and myself and other members of the New York delegation included $50 million for 9/11 health needs. The 2008 House Labor-HHS appropriations bill includes $50 million for the World Trade Center monitoring and treatment program. 
   I was also extremely pleased to learn from Senator Clinton that the Senate appropriations subcommittee has included $55 million in their version of the labor appropriations bill. The Senate version of the bill includes funding for residents, offices of commercial workers, volunteers and students. I hope the House will follow suit in making Federal funding available for residents too. 
   But much more remains to be done. The estimates of the costs are not $50 million a year but starting at $198 million and expanding to $400 million a year as more people become sick in the next few years. And we need to develop a comprehensive approach to 9/11 health that includes residents, nonfirst responder workers and school children. We need to secure funding that is not subject to the yearly appropriations battle. We must commit ourselves to act and to help all of those who are still waiting. That is why we are going to introduce the bill that Mrs. Maloney referred to a few minutes ago to provide a long-term comprehensive  funding source, a bill that I hope this House will consider. 
   But in addition, there's a second cover-up. I have always said there are two cover-ups conducted here. One about the health care disaster that followed 9/11; that cover-up has unraveled. In the last year with the 
   revelations of the Mount Sinai study, the New York Daily News reports and other reports that have come out, now everybody recognizes that first responders and residents are suffering, thousands and thousands of them, because of the air pollution after 9/11, because of the government lying to them and saying that the air was safe to breathe and therefore they didn't use respiratory equipment or they were there in the first place when they shouldn't have been, not the first responders, but residents who could have gone elsewhere. But that was one cover-up that has now unraveled, and we have been talking about what to do about it and how to provide long-term medical monitoring and long-term care for it, and that is the legislation we are talking about. 
   But there was and is a second cover-up, and that cover-up is the fact that the indoor spaces that were polluted were never properly cleaned up. A GAO report, which Senator Clinton and Mrs. Maloney and I unveiled yesterday, pointed out that the EPA to this day cannot guarantee that any single building, except for its own building which it cleaned up properly at 290 Broadway, other than that, they cannot guarantee that any single building in Lower Manhattan is clean today and does not contain toxins that are slowly poisoning people on and on. 
   The EPA never properly cleaned up, nor did the City of New York, indoor spaces. Nature cleans up the outdoor spaces. The rain washes the stuff away. The wind blows the toxins away. Nothing cleans up indoor spaces. The EPA Inspector General reported in 2003, it is 4 years ago already, that the so-called cleanup the EPA conducted in 2002 was a phony, that it didn't clean up anything adequately. And they said that what had to be done, the EPA Inspector General, was that the EPA should inspect several hundred indoor spaces, apartments, residences in concentric circles going out from the World Trade Center to find out where the contamination is, maybe 3 blocks in one direction, maybe 3 miles in another. And wherever they found the contamination, they had to go in and clean up every single building in those areas. That may cost money, but until that happens, the babies crawling on the rug 10 years from now or today will be poisoned. The people living in those apartments, working in those spaces, will be poisoned, and we will reap the bitter harvest 10 and 15 and 20 years from now with thousands of unnecessary and preventable cases of mesothelioma and lung cancer and asbestosis. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is our job to do two things. If we are going to be true to what we have said to the heroes and about the heroes of 9/11, we must do two things. We must provide legislation and funding for long-term monitoring and health care such as that that Mrs. Maloney and I and others have been talking about in the legislation that we are introducing. We must also prevail upon the administration, by legislation if necessary, to do the proper indoor testing the way the EPA Inspector General said, and then to do proper cleanup. Not a cleanup that the EPA's own scientific advisory panel says is a joke and a fraud, not the cleanup that the EPA's Inspector General says is a joke and a fraud, a proper cleanup that does the entire building, that looks at all pollutants, not just asbestos, that is not limited geographically to below Canal Street, but wherever the contamination went as scientifically determined. 
   These are what we must do. If we do these things, we are true to the survivors and the heroes, and we will learn so that, God forbid, when there is another disaster, natural or manmade, we will do it properly and we will not have thousands of people with preventable illnesses and shortened lives as a result of our malfeasance or carelessness. 
   So I thank Mrs. Maloney for arranging this special order. I thank her for her leadership and in bringing to all our attention the struggle and the continuing health problems caused by 9/11 and in helping to craft legislation to deal with it.

<DOCNO>Mr. NADLER. (LILLY LEDBETTER FAIR PAY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, this bill would restore to employment discrimination victims the realistic chance at justice that the Supreme Court recently took away from them. What is important to understand about the Court's decision is that everyone agreed that Lilly Ledbetter was the victim of intentional discrimination for 19 years. The Court said something truly astonishing, that the only discriminatory act was the initial decision to pay Lilly Ledbetter less than her male coworkers. Once the employer had successfully concealed that fact from her for 180 days, she was out of luck and Goodyear could openly go on paying her less just because she was a woman forever. The initial decision to discriminate was illegal, but the continuing decision to continue paying her less was perfectly okay. This upset 40 years of settled law, 40 years in which the companies of this country went under the rule that this bill would restore. 
   The Court's decision is an open invitation to employers to violate the law with virtual impunity. Once again, Congress must correct the Supreme Court and instruct it that when we said discrimination in employment was illegal, we meant it, and we meant for the courts to enforce it. And anyone who says that discrimination in employment should be illegal but should not be enforceable if the employer can hide the discrimination for 6 months is really saying let the discrimination go on forever. Let the women and the racial minorities and other people who are discriminated against be discriminated against forever. 
   Shame on the Supreme Court, and shame on those who would make employment discrimination victims helpless by opposing this bill. I urge adoption of this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. NADLER. (FAA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bill which contains many excellent provisions. But I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar and Subcommittee Chairman Costello, in particular, for including in the manager's amendment two provisions that are particularly important to me. 
   The first requires the FAA to conduct a study to determine if temperature standards are necessary to protect crew members and passengers from excessive heat on board aircraft. We've all heard the news reports about passengers on planes grounded for hours sometimes in the heat without fresh air and necessary supplies. 
   The Association of Flight Attendants reports that many crew members have had to work in dangerously high temperatures during ground operations for long periods of time with no ability to obtain relief. 
   Now, this is not just a matter of discomfort. Heat-related illness can be severe, can even lead to death, particularly for sensitive populations. 
   My first inclination was to require that the temperature in the aircraft must not exceed 80 degrees during ground operations, but various operational issues make it clear that such a requirement would be premature. I hope that this study will inform Congress of what options are available to us and that it will force the FAA to take seriously this serious problem. 
   The second provision would mandate the FAA to complete a study of the cabin air quality that we required in the last FAA reauthorization bill passed in 2003. Aircraft in the current commercial fleet are equipped with air circulation systems that bleed air off the engines and are subject to contamination of the air by engine oil and hydraulic fluids. We continue to hear reports from crew members and passengers who have developed long-term neurological problems after documented exposure to oil smoke in the cabin or on the flight deck. In the last reauthorization bill, we included a study to sample and analyze the air on board the cabin aircraft. Unfortunately, the FAA never completed the study. 
   My preference, again, would be to set standards for cabin air quality now or to require that aircraft use certain filters that can clean the outside air more efficiently. But every time we raise this issue, we hear that the problem has not been properly documented. It is time, and this bill requires that the FAA complete this research. 
   I would like to thank Mr. Oberstar and Mr. Costello for their support of these provisions and for including them in the manager's amendment. I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance these critical workplace and consumer protections, so that people can breathe the air and not faint from the heat. And I urge support for this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. NADLER. (RECOGNIZING ANNIVERSARIES OF MASS MOVEMENT FOR SOVIET JEWISH FREEDOM AND FREEDOM SUNDAY RALLY FOR SOVIET JEWRY -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 759, introduced by the gentleman from California (Mr. Waxman), marking the 40th anniversary of the Mass Movement for Soviet Jewish Freedom and the 20th anniversary of the Freedom Sunday Rally for Soviet Jewry on the National Mall in Washington, DC. 
   Mr. Speaker, in 1967 the plight of Soviet Jews was severe and largely unknown to the outside world. State-sponsored anti-Zionism and a widespread culture of anti-Semitism made daily life difficult for the millions of Jews living in the Soviet Union. Worst of all, these Jews had no right to leave the country for more welcoming parts of the world, namely, Israel and the United States. 
   Mr. Speaker, in answer to this reality, 1967 saw the rise of an organized movement to rescue the Soviet Jews, the Mass Movement for Soviet Jewish Freedom. Looking back 40 years later, we can all chart the profound success of that movement which lifted hundreds of thousands of people out of persecution and poverty and into freedom. Beginning in 1971, this movement made possible the mass exodus of Soviet Jews from the Soviet Union to the shores of Israel, the United States and elsewhere. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am gratified to represent the largest community of former Soviet emigres in the United States, and I have the great fortune of knowing many of those leaders and entrepreneurs who owe their livelihoods and freedom to the success of that movement organized in 1967. 
   The former Soviet Jewish community of Brooklyn, New York, from Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, Uzbekistan and elsewhere has returned the humanity and kindness shown to them years before in their new capacity as industrious, law-abiding, and dynamic members of American society. In neighborhoods like Brighton Beach, Coney Island and Bensonhurst, you can witness every day how hard they have worked in order to secure happiness for their families and how they strive to give back to the Nation that rescued them from persecution. 
   Mr. Speaker, no discussion of this movement of Soviet Jews would be complete without mention of Jacob Birnbaum, an exceptional leader and human being who worked night and day to bring this issue to the forefront of our minds so many years ago. Earlier this year, I was very proud to introduce a resolution honoring Mr. Birnbaum, and I am pleased that Congress passed it, thereby bringing official recognition to a leader who made an incalculable difference for the lives of many thousands of Soviet Jews and others throughout the world. 
   In addition to the courageous work of Mr. Birnbaum, tribute ought to be paid to the other pioneers and national organizations who fought so strenuously for the liberation of Soviet Jews, people like Malcolm Hoenlein who is now executive vice president of the Conference of Presidents of American Jewish Organizations but who pioneered much of the work in the Soviet Jewish movement. 
   I am pleased today to join with my colleagues to mark the accomplishments of the Soviet Jewry movement and to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Freedom Sunday Rally for Soviet Jews and the 40th anniversary of the founding of the movement to free Soviet Jews. I am proud to have been part of this movement beginning in the late 1960s in many marches and demonstrations and picketings of the Soviet embassy. I was here on the Mall 20 years ago. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.

   Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2106, the Procedural Fairness for September 11 Victims Act of 2007. This bill is substantially identical to H.R. 3921, a bill that the House Judiciary Committee reported by voice vote without amendment on October 24. 
   This legislation would provide immediate procedural relief to the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, by implementing a technical fix to a bill that this Congress passed in the wake of those horrible events. 
   Eleven days after the September 11 attacks, we passed comprehensive legislation, the Transportation and Systems Stabilization Act. That Act, among other things, created a Victims Compensation Fund to provide relief for victims without the need for litigation. It also allowed victims to opt-out of the fund and seek relief in court. 
   The bill limited jurisdiction over any civil litigation to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. 
   An unintended consequence of our actions, under operation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, was that subpoena power to secure testimony or documents from nonparty witnesses to any litigation has generally been limited to persons and documents located within 100 miles of the Southern District of New York. 
   The law we passed in 2001 did not take this 100-mile rule into account. Unfortunately, many of the events relevant to the September 11 tragedy occurred in Boston, where American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 originated, and in the Washington, DC, area where the Pentagon is  located and where American Airlines Flight 77 originated. Both of these locations are far outside the 100-mile limit from the Southern District of New York. 
   The bill before the House today would remedy this problem by providing for nationwide subpoena service for all parties in the litigation, victims, victims' families and defendants, to ensure that all parties involved have an opportunity to obtain the witnesses and evidence they need to obtain a fair hearing. That was Congress' intent, and we should not allow the unintended interplay between the 9/11 legislation and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to undermine that legislative purpose. 
   The bill also makes clear that the existing power of the Federal court under rule 45(c) to quash or modify a subpoena in order to protect a subpoenaed person from undue hardship or expense is maintained. That is the current rule, and the bill makes it clear that this important protection for witnesses will remain. 
   Congress has previously approved nationwide subpoena power in other contexts. For example, nationwide subpoena power is available under the False Claims Act, the Veterans Benefit Act and the Civil RICO statute. 
   This bill has bipartisan support. It passed the Senate by unanimous consent in committee and on the Senate floor. The House version, which is substantively identical to the Senate version, was reported by the House Judiciary Committee by voice vote. 
   Six years ago, Mr. Speaker, Congress and the Nation came together to provide prompt and equitable assistance for September 11 victims. I urge my colleagues to ensure that the laudable goals of that effort are not frustrated by the unintended effect of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in this particular case. 
   I urge the adoption of this measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. NADLER. (RECOGNIZING AND COMMENDING THE ALVIN AILEY AMERICAN DANCE THEATER -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution honoring the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary. I would like to thank  Chairman Miller, Ranking Member McKeon, and the rest of my colleagues on the Education and Labor Committee for bringing this resolution to the floor. 
   Founded in 1958, Ailey has become widely recognized as one of the world's premier modern dance companies. In its 50-year history, Ailey has performed for an estimated 21 million people in 71 countries on six continents. The troupe's signature work, ``Revelations,'' has been seen by more people across the globe than any other work of dance. 
   Alvin Ailey was born into an impoverished childhood in the small, segregated town of Rogers, Texas. Dedicated to promoting the uniqueness of the African-American cultural experience, Ailey began offering opportunities to black dancers when there were few. ``Revelations,'' which draws upon the influences of black spirituals, gospel music, and blues, epitomizes the universality of art that Ailey sought to explore. Of this groundbreaking work, he said: ``Its roots are in American Negro culture, which is part of the whole country's heritage. The dance speaks to everyone.'' 
   By 1963, the troupe had begun welcoming dancers of diverse ethnicities and backgrounds, and translating their experiences into some of the most riveting works of dance of the 20th century. The company now performs works by a wide range of choreographers, both emerging and established, from across the globe, totaling more than 200 works by over 70 choreographers. 
   In 1982, Alvin Ailey received the United Nations Peace Medal, and in 2001, President George W. Bush recognized the Ailey and Artistic Director Judith Jamison with the National Medal of Arts, making the Ailey the first dance company to be honored with this award. 
   Ailey continues to make a lasting impact in the dance world through its arts in education and community programs, which provide more than 100,000 young people from diverse cultural, social, and economic backgrounds the opportunity to explore their creative potential, not only in New York, but in cities throughout the United States. Ailey II, the junior company, reaches more than 69,000 people each year, and brings its inspiring performances to smaller communities across North America. 
   I am proud that Ailey calls my congressional district in New York City home, and has made the Joan Weill Center for Dance the largest facility dedicated exclusively to dance in the United States. 
   I wish to thank Ailey for all it has done to break cultural barriers through the arts. I especially want to thank Judith Jamison, Artistic Director, and Sharon Gersten Luckman, Executive Director, who keep Alvin Ailey's artistic and social vision alive today. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution congratulating the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater for its 50 years as a cultural ambassador to the world, and thanking them for their outstanding service to future generations of artists.

<DOCNO>Mr. NADLER. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2082, INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - December 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, today we have an opportunity to affirm America's values and our respect for the rule of law. This bill includes language drawn from the American Anti-Torture Act, introduced by myself and Representative Delahunt, that would extend the interrogation standards in the U.S. Army Field Manual to all interrogations conducted on persons in the custody or effective control of any element of the intelligence community. This will ensure a single, uniform baseline standard for interrogations. That means no more torture, no more waterboarding, no more clever word play, no more evasive answers, no more dishonesty. 
   People in nations do terrible things in war, but civilized nations long ago recognized that there must be limits on their conduct even during military conflict. Our Army Field Manual is an outstanding example of a modern military dedicated to observing international norms of conduct while waging war effectively. It is a credit to our men and women in uniform that they continue to abide by these rules. It is unforgivable that some civilians here in Washington seem to think that they know better and we must be more brutal than our military and professional interrogators. 
   I understand the critical role that intelligence plays in protecting ourselves, but torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, besides being contrary to American values and traditions, have proven not to be effective in obtaining actionable intelligence. 
   Current and former members of the military have made this clear. General David Petraeus, the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, recently wrote in an open letter to U.S. troops that the standards in the Army Field Manual ``work effectively and humanely in eliciting information from detainees.'' 
   Lieutenant General Kimmons, Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence similarly stated ``no good intelligence is going to come from abusive practices. Any piece of intelligence which is obtained under duress through the use of abusive techniques would be of questionable credibility.'' 
   The Bush administration has long argued that it does not torture but it does waterboard. And we prosecuted, we sent to jail Japanese officers for waterboarding prisoners after World  War II. We knew then that waterboarding was torture, and despite statements from the Bush administration or the nonstatements, we know now that it is torture. Torture places our servicemen and women and our allies at grave risk. We must accept that whatever we authorize and use against our enemies will be turned against our own men and women. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time to restore the honor of the United States. It is time to restore the good name of the United States in a world that has been so sullied by the conduct of this administration. It is time to compel the administration to act in a manner consistent with the Constitution of the United States. 
   I applaud the leadership of the conferees in including the antitorture language in this bill. I urge support for the conference report. I hope this will begin the process of restoring the honor and the integrity of the United States.

<DOCNO>Mr. NADLER. (RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE MODERN STATE OF ISRAEL -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the bipartisan House Leadership Resolution, H. Con. Res. 322, of which I am a cosponsor, to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the State of Israel. 
   In 1947, the year I was born, the area now known as Israel was about to go through a birth of its own. In 1948, with the founding of the only Jewish state to ever exist in history, Jews found that their new homeland was filled with sand and little water, but it was also filled with great hope and resolve. Following the murder of 6 million Jews in the Holocaust, this small country would soon become a homeland for another 6 million Jews, free to practice Judaism, but still targeted for their faith. 
   While Israel was formed, Jews all over the Middle East were facing a crisis of their own; Jewish refugees in Arab lands were expelled systematically, under an official regime policy which included anti-Jewish decrees, pogroms, murders and hangings, anti-Semitic incitement and ethnic cleansing. The Arab League's 1947 decree provided a formula for state-sanctioned discriminatory measures, replicated in many Arab countries, in a deliberate campaign to expel the Jewish refugees from their home countries. Unlike the Palestinians, the Jewish refugees were absorbed into their new host countries, mostly by Israel. About 600,000 stayed in Israel and the remaining 300,000 fled to other countries, such as France, Canada, Italy, and the United States. In Israel today, the Jewish refugees from Arab countries and their children comprise the majority of the Jewish population. 
   This House recently adopted my resolution, H. Res. 185, urging that the rights of Jewish refugees be recognized in any future comprehensive Middle East settlement. We are continually working to ensure that any Middle East peace agreement is just, fully just to all parties. 
   This is a continual process. From its first day, Israel has fought for its right to exist when it was attacked by its Arab neighbors. Since then, continuous wars have been waged, all aiming to destroy the Jewish state  and its people. At times, mothers and fathers have had to buy gas masks for their children; young children have had to celebrate their birthdays in bomb shelters. Despite this, families have shared laughter on the beaches of the Mediterranean; young couples have danced on the rooftops of Jerusalem. That all of these times have been simultaneous is a testament to the strength and determination for not only the State of Israel, but for humanity. 
   Following their independence, Israel's people, driven to immigrate for fear of persecution and for their ideological dreams, struggled with basic life, rationing food and living in makeshift shelters. The early immigrants began building the land, irrigating, 
   planting, and educating their children. Working in the sun, Israel's wrinkles began to show the stress, but the outcome can be seen today; flowers and olive trees on the hillsides and universities at full capacity. In cooperation with the United States and other countries, innovations by Israelis in science, energy, agriculture, technology, and medicine have been felt around the world. 
   Today, the country is flowing with milk and honey, as a nation of immigrants and a home for the persecuted. But it is also facing much hardship. Like the United States, Israel was founded by immigrants escaping persecution and wanting to live in peace. But while Israel remains a sanctuary for Judaism, it remains a dangerous place to be a Jew. 
   In its 60th year, Israel faces some of its greatest challenges and needs its allies and friends more than ever. The Middle East is still a very dangerous place, and scapegoating Israel is still a very convenient means of holding power for some very dangerous autocrats. Such tactics are deplorable, and we must do everything we can to stop them. 
   While some Arab states have been working with us to respond to Iran's vicious lies and rhetoric, we must also continue to demand that Israel, our democratic ally, be recognized by these very states. And we must call for the immediate and unconditional release of Israeli soldiers kidnapped and held captive by Hamas and Hezbollah, which is called for by H. Res. 107, a bill I cosponsored. 
   Indeed, Israel is now at a critical crossroads. We hope for the best, but we remain mindful that peace cannot be achieved unless sincere and substantive acts are forthcoming from the Palestinians. Terror must come to an end, as must incitement. At middle age, and I speak of personal experience, as I am also marking my 60th year, one must take stock of their past and look forward to the future. The Israeli State and its people continue to work to preserve its foundation as a Jewish state with Jewish values, while they live in a region where the very idea of the existence of a Jewish state continues to be challenged. As Israel looks toward the future, integrating its immigrants, expanding its economy, preserving its heritage, and providing foreign assistance and refuge to Jews throughout the world, the United States will stand alongside her in her quest for peace and prosperity. 
   We hope to learn from each other; Israel continues to fight terror alongside the United States and stands as an example of how to balance civil liberties and security, religious freedom and the expression of religious values in its economic and political structure. Like the United States, the Jewish democratic State has a robust freedom of press that serves to teach the public and government how to better itself, and an independent judiciary which seeks to preserve the liberties for which it has fought. 
   The relationship the United States has with Israel is special; we have more in common than we do apart, and we continue to work in cooperation to achieve the broader goals of a peaceful future for our children and grandchildren. As we grow together as democratic nations facing challenging times, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution acknowledging the special bonds of friendship the United States shares with our only democratic ally in the Middle East, Israel. I thank our leadership for sponsoring this resolution and I strongly urge its passage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, a few moments ago, the former chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Mr. Young of Alaska, was excoriating this side of the aisle and saying that our provisions in this bill for 100 percent scanning of containers were impractical and couldn't be done. I would simply point out that the provision in this bill is word for word the same as the provision that was negotiated by Mr. Oberstar and me with Mr. Young and Mr. LoBiondo and included in the bill in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee last year by unanimous vote, supported by Mr. Young and Mr. LoBiondo, who thought it was very practical last year.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, for the last 4 years I have worked to ensure that no shipping container should be put on a ship bound for the United States until it is scanned for radiation and density, and sealed with a tamper-proof seal. The 9/11 Commission insisted on better port security measures. 
   Last year, along with Mr. Oberstar, I introduced the Sail Only if Scanned Act. We tried to insert into the SAFE Port Act, but the Republican leadership opposed this provision with near party-line votes in committee and on the floor. 
   But now, Title V of this bill will implement the Sail Only if Scanned Act, and require that every container be scanned and sealed with a tamper-proof seal before being placed on a ship bound for the U.S. We phase in the requirement, within 3 years for large ports, 5 years for small. But it must be done. 
   We must be serious about protecting ourselves against the terrorists. Studies are not enough. This bill finally takes the threat seriously. 
   The cost to scan each container is only about $6.50. The startup cost to purchase and install the scanning equipment world wide is about $1.5 billion. Foreign ports can recover the cost by charging about $20 per container. Given the fact that it costs about $4,000 to ship a container from Asia to the United States and a container might hold $50,000 or $100,000 worth of goods, that is a drop in the bucket. 
   This bill also includes critical provisions to strengthen aviation security, to distribute homeland security grants based on risk, and it will strengthen the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program to secure nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union. For years, some of us have been pushing to accelerate counter-proliferation programs. This bill will go a long way toward securing loose nuclear materials around the world. 
   I congratulate the new leadership of this House for pressing this bill. I urge all my colleagues to vote for this and finally implement the key recommendations of the 9/11 Commission and make this country safer.  
   Madam. Speaker, for the last four years, I have worked to insure that no shipping container should be put on a ship bound for the U.S. until it is scanned for radiation and density, and sealed with a tamper-proof seal. The 9/11 Commission insisted on better port security measures. 
   Last year, along with Chairman OBERSTAR, I introduced the Sail Only if Scanned (SOS) Act. We then tried to insert it into the SAFE Port Act. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership opposed this provision, with near party-line votes in committee and on the floor. 
   But now, Title V of this bill will implement the Sail Only if Scanned Act, and require that every container be scanned and sealed with a tamper-proof seal before being placed on a ship bound for the U.S. We phase in the requirement--within three years for large ports, five years for small. But it must be done. 
   We know our port security system is vulnerable. The 9/11 Commission said the opportunities to do harm are as great, or greater, in maritime transportation than in our aviation system. 
   Luckily, the Democratic Leadership is willing to follow through on our promise to scan 100 percent of shipping containers so that we can prevent nuclear weapons from being smuggled into the United States through our ports. We recognize that it is time for Congress to catch up to the rest of the World. In Hong Kong, the Integrated Container Inspection System (ICIS) pilot program has successfully achieved 100 percent scanning, proving that the technology works without slowing down commerce. Many other ports are already starting to purchase this equipment, and many in the shipping industry realize that it is in their best interest to secure their cargo before, G-d forbid, someone uses our ports to cause harm, and the system has to be completely shut down. 
   We must be serious about protecting ourselves against the terrorists. Studies are not enough. This bill, finally takes the threat seriously. 
   The cost to institute this system is minimal. It could be folded into the cost of doing business and the consumer would never even notice. The cost to scan each container is only about $6.50. The startup cost to purchase and install the scanning equipment worldwide is about $1.5 billion. Foreign ports can recover the cost by charging about $20 per container. This is a drop in the bucket given that it costs about $4,000 to ship a container from Asia to the United States, and that container might hold $50,000-$100,000 or more worth of goods. We waste billions of dollars in Iraq and on other Defense Programs, such as ``Star Wars,'' but we can protect ourselves against this very real threat to our port security system with virtually no cost to the U.S. Government. 
   We must not wait to impose security measures until containers reach the United States.  If there is a bomb inside a container, and it is detected in Newark, or Miami, or Los Angeles, it may be too late. Reading the cargo manifest is not enough. Trusting the shippers is not enough. We must verify the contents of the containers at the point of origin, before they are loaded onto a ship destined for America. This bill will do just that. 
   This bill also includes critical provisions to strengthen aviation security, to distribute homeland security grants based on risk, and it will strengthen the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program to secure nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union. For years, I have been pushing to accelerate counter proliferation programs, and this bill will go a long way toward securing loose nuclear materials around the world. 
   I urge all my colleagues to vote for H.R. 1 and finally implement all of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission.

<DOCNO>Mr. NADLER. (RESTORE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation restores the proper role of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in the maintenance of our national security infrastructure. Let's get the terms of this debate clear before we begin. Anyone who can read will see that this bill does not inhibit the government's ability to spy on terrorists or on suspected terrorists or to act swiftly and effectively on the information we gather.     
   The American people expect that their government will keep us all safe and free. This bill does that. 
   The bill does not require individual warrants of foreign terrorists located outside the United States. That has been the law for three decades; that is still the law. 
   The bill does provide reasonable FISA Court oversight to ensure that when our government starts spying on Americans, it does so lawfully by getting a warrant from the FISA Court. It will put an end to this administration's well-worn ``trust me'' routine. 
   I trust our intelligence community to gather solid intelligence on threats to our Nation. But protecting constitutional rights is not their prime job. That is why we have courts. 
   This bill provides for Congress to receive independent reports on how the act is working and what our government is doing. This administration's penchant for secrecy and aversion to accountability will come to an end, at least in this area. 
   Let me say a word for demands for retroactive immunity for the telecom companies. As many of our colleagues have pointed out, any such discussion is premature. We do not even know what we are being asked to immunize or whose rights would be compromised if we did so. 
   More importantly, Congress should not decide legal cases between private parties; that's for the courts. If the claims are not meritorious, the courts will throw them out. But if the claims do have merit, we have no right to wipe them without even reviewing the evidence. How dare we have the presumption to decide the rights of allegedly injured parties in the blind. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill meets every single principle set forth by the Congressional Progressive Caucus. As one of the co-chairs of the caucus' FISA Task Force, I am pleased to support this important bill. It is true to our Constitution. It is true to our values. It is true to our safety. It will keep us safe and free.  
   This bill gives our intelligence agencies the tools they have told us they need to make us safe, and gives the FISA Court the tools it needs to ensure that the extraordinary powers we are giving to the intelligence community are used correctly and consistently with our laws and our Constitution. 
   It's called the separation of powers, with each branch of the government doing what it is supposed to do and acting as a check on the others. FISA exists to ensure that the balance between the needs of intelligence gathering and the protection of the rights of all Americans are balanced. 
   Most importantly, it restores the role of FISA as the exclusive legal basis for foreign intelligence surveillance. No more making it up as you go along. 
   Did the telecoms break the law? Were they acting appropriately? Were the rights of innocent Americans violated? We don't know. 
   How dare we have the presumption to decide the rights of allegedly injured parties in the blind?

<DOCNO>Mr. NADLER. (COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, this amendment will increase the Violence Against Women Prevention Programs by $5 million intended to fund a specific provision, namely the Jessica Gonzalez Victim Assistance Program. To offset this cost the Department of Justice general activities accounts will be reduced by the same amount, $5 million. 
   The Jessica Gonzalez program places special victim assistants to act as liaisons between local law enforcement agencies and victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking in order to improve the enforcement of protection orders. It develops, in collaboration with prosecutors, courts and victim service providers, standardized response policies for local law enforcement agencies, including triage protocols to ensure that dangerous or potentially lethal cases are identified and prioritized. 
   Victims of domestic violence need the Jessica Gonzales program because the current system has undermined the effectiveness of restraining orders. In Castle Rock v. Gonzalez, the Supreme Court held that the police did not have a mandatory duty to make an arrest under a court-issued protective order  to protect a woman from her violent husband. This case came as a result of an incident in 1999 involving the kidnapping of Ms. Gonzalez's children by her estranged husband. Despite her numerous pleas to the police to arrest her husband for violating a protection order, including providing them with information on his whereabouts, the police failed to do so. Later that night, Mr. Gonzalez murdered their three children. 
   The Jessica Gonzalez Victim Assistance Program restores some of the effectiveness of restraining orders that the Supreme Court took away with its ruling. 
   This is the first opportunity we have had to grow the Jessica Gonzalez Victim Assistance Program since it was first funded last year after its initial authorization in the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization of 2005 in order to strengthen the effectiveness of restraining orders. 
   This program strengthens the efficacy of restraining orders against the prevalent matter of domestic violence. Tragically, as we know, violence against women is a pervasive problem which goes beyond class, culture, age or ethnic background. Every 9 seconds a woman is battered in the United States, and every 2 minutes someone is sexually assaulted. 
   According to the Department of Justice, more than three women are murdered by their husbands or boyfriends every day. More than 2 1/2 million women are victims of violence each year, and nearly one in three women experience at least one physical assault by a partner during adulthood. Many more cases go unmentioned as women, fearing to come forward, leave the assaults unreported. 
   The Jessica Gonzalez Victim Assistance Program helps to enforce restraining orders and protect women who are victims of domestic violence, and it is a great step forward from when we authorized it 2 years ago and when we first funded it last year. 
   Mr. Chairman, we need more funds for this program. I am aware that this bill, because of the good work of the chairman and the committee members, includes approximately $430 million to support grants under the Violence Against Women Act which is $47 million more than the current budget and $59 million above the President's meager request for fiscal year 2008. 
   I'm also aware that in amendments we passed last night, we increased funding for the Violence Against Women Act by about 40 or $45 million, and I hope that some of that will survive in conference. 
   And in light of that, I will now withdraw the amendment, but urge my colleagues to support the CJS appropriations amount granted to programs that protect women and their families, especially the Jessica Gonzalez Victim Assistance Program, and hope that in conferences all of these matters are hashed out, that a little more money can be spared for this program, especially in light of the amendments approved last night. 
   Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN (Mr. Hastings of Florida). Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I commend the chairman of the committee for including in this act a provision that no funds shall be made available to authorize or issue a National Security Letter, NSL, in contravention of current law. That should go without saying, but as we have seen, apparently not with the current administration. 
   My amendment asks for an accounting by the Department of Justice of the FBI's collection and use of information on U.S. persons who are not suspected of being terrorists or agents of a foreign power before we provide further funding for the issuance of more National Security Letters. 
   This amendment prohibits funds from being used to issue a National Security Letter under the provisions amended by section 505 of the PATRIOT Act until the Department of Justice conducts a full review and delivers a report to Congress on the use of NSLs to collect information on U.S. persons who are not suspected of being agents of a foreign power, or terrorists, as that is defined in 50 U.S.C. 1801. 
   The underlying bill asks for the FBI to conduct a report within 2 months on what has been done to implement the inspector general's recommendations with respect to NSLs. This would simply ask that that report be more specific and more inclusive and include the following information: 
   How many National Security Letters have been issued; what standards are used to determine when to seek information on a person who is not suspected of being an agent of a foreign power; the current guidance as to what is ``relevant'' to an investigation when the targets are not suspected of being agents of a foreign power; how that information is stored; how the information is used; whether the information is used; whether that information is ever destroyed; whether that information has led to any substantial leads in terrorism cases; whether that information has ever been used in criminal cases; and whether that information has led to any adverse government action against people not suspected of being enemy agents, agents of a foreign power, or terrorists. 
   Almost limitless sensitive private information from communication providers, financial institutions, and consumer credit agencies can now be collected secretly by simply issuing a National Security Letter on an FBI field director's simple assertion that the request is merely relevant to a national  security investigation. These communications and records can be of people who are U.S. citizens who are not suspected of being agents of a foreign power or terrorists. These communications and records can be demanded without any court review or any court approval. Worse yet, the target of the NSL will never know that his communications and records were inspected by government agents because the company, the financial agent, the service provider, the bank is barred by law from telling him or anyone else of the demand. And as we know from the FBI inspector general's audit, this broad discretion has been abused by the FBI, whose agents may have violated either the law or internal rules more than 1,000 times while misusing the authority to issue National Security Letters. 
   This recent IG report heightens the clear need for more adequate checks on the FBI's investigatory powers with respect to NSLs. The FBI has far-reaching compulsory powers to obtain documents in terrorism investigations without NSLs. In criminal investigations the FBI can obtain a search warrant if there is a judicial finding of probable cause or a grand jury subpoena issued under the supervision of a judge and a U.S. attorney. And in international terrorism cases, the FBI has sweeping authority to obtain records under section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, all this separate from NSLs. 
   I intend to introduce this week, with Congressman Flake, the National Security Letters Reform Act of 2007 to address more fully the issues presented by section 505 of the National Security Letters. 
   The bill would restore a pre-PATRIOT Act requirement that the FBI make a factual, individualized showing that the records sought pertain to a suspected terrorist or spy. It also gives the recipient of a National Security Letter an opportunity to obtain legal counsel. It thus preserves the constitutional right to their day in court. 
   Already courts have found part of the NSL authority to be too broad and unconstitutional. The provisions that state that NSL recipients are forbidden from disclosing the demand to the targeted individual and are forbidden even from consulting with an attorney have already been struck down. Another court found the NSL authority to be unconstitutional on its face because it violates the fourth amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. 
   The National Security Letters Reform Act of 2007 would allow the FBI to continue issuing National Security Letters by correcting the constitutional deficiencies in the law. This bill would enable the FBI to obtain documents that it legitimately needs, while protecting the privacy of law-abiding American citizens. 
   I ask that my colleagues vote for this amendment so that we can protect the privacy of U.S. persons who are not terrorists or agents of terrorists before we provide funding for those broad and sweeping powers provided under the PATRIOT Act. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   I do express the hope that in the report that the underlying bill demands that they will include the information requested by this amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Chair is prepared to rule. 
   The Chair finds that this amendment imposes new duties on the Secretary to conduct a full review and deliver a report. The amendment therefore constitutes legislation in violation of clause 2 of rule XXI.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I entirely agree with the gentleman from New York. I entirely agree with the purpose of this amendment. The problem I have with this amendment is that, as I understand it, it says no funds may be spent to enforce a court decision. 
   If that is what this amendment says, and I just heard it briefly, then it is the wrong way to do it. We have to put in a bill. I am sure the Judiciary Committee will entertain, I assume would entertain it quickly, to clarify the law and say that that is not what the law is, and that what the gentleman seeks to do we ought to do legislatively. 
   But the idea of saying we will not permit funds to be used to carry out an order of a court destroys, undermines, and subverts the rule of law in this country. We cannot subvert the rule of law in this country by denying funds to carry out an order of the court. 
   If we don't agree with the order of the court, and I agree, I certainly don't agree with the order of the court in this case, it is terrible, we ought to change the law. That is why we have a Congress. That is our job. Let's change the law. 
   If the court interprets the law wrongly, as it has, in my opinion, along with the gentleman, we ought to put in a bill, change the law and clarify it. I think that bill would sail through here pretty quickly in all likelihood. That is the way to do it. 
   But to make an amendment to say no funds appropriated may be used to enforce the court order, what's next? A different court order that we dislike? That subverts the rule of law. It is the wrong way to go. 
   Mr. Chairman, I hope this amendment is not agreed to.

   Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I will be happy to work with the gentleman and anyone else who will try to effectuate this policy. I would hope that the gentleman and others and I can address the administration and urge them for the next few weeks that it may take for the Congress to act, for the administration to withhold action, that they should not engage in deportations. 
   Now, I hope that comity with the administration would allow them to delay a little on enforcing. After all, the court didn't say, ``You must.'' The  court didn't say, ``You must deport these people.'' It said, ``You may deport these people.'' It is up to the administration to determine that. 
   So I would hope that the administration would delay for the few weeks it may take for Congress to show our will on this matter and that we don't agree with the court. But, again, I hope this amendment doesn't pass because it sets a terrible precedent. It may even be unconstitutional. I am not sure. 
   But clearly we don't want to start passing bills that say you can't enforce a court order, because once you start down that road, where do you end? But I certainly do anticipate working to make sure that nobody is deported under this. I hope the administration will delay that, and we can move legislation quickly on that.

Madam Speaker, we were told by the administration, by the Director of National Intelligence, a couple of weeks ago that they needed two things: They needed to clarify that we didn't need a court order for a foreign-to-foreign communications. This bill does it. They needed an assurance that telecommunications companies would be compelled to assist in gathering of national security information under this bill. This bill contains it. 
   Yesterday, we were told they needed three more things: They needed that we should deal with not just relating to terrorism but to matters relating to our foreign intelligence. It's in this bill. We were told we should eliminate the requirement that the FISA Court adjudicate our recurring communications to the U.S. from foreign targets would be handled. It's in this bill. We were told that we should allow for foreign targets to be added to the basket warrant after the warrant was approved. It's in this bill. 
   The DNI, Admiral McConnell, said that this bill would significantly enhance America's security until he spoke to the White House, and now he changes politically, and he says we need more.

<DOCNO>Mr. NADLER. (WILLIAM WILBERFORCE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2007. 
   This bill delivers on the promise of the 13th amendment by creating tough new enforcement tools to punish exploitation, whether by unscrupulous labor recruiters, diplomats who abuse their servants, or brutal pimps. 
   It provides resources so that nongovernmental organizations, Federal and local law enforcement, and the faith community can work together to liberate victims and bring their traffickers to justice. 
   It will protect victims of modern slavery in the United States and provide foreign aid and diplomatic tools to combat modern slavery overseas as well. 
   In many ways, the fight against modern slavery began in New York City in the mid-1990s. There was the infamous ``Bowery Brothel'' case in which Thai women were held in prostitution and literally chained to their beds. And there were the so-called ``Deaf Mexican'' trinket peddlers who were enslaved under our own eyes, unable to ask for help as they were forced to beg on the subways. 
   Since then, criminal civil rights investigators have uncovered examples of enslavement across the country, including many in the New York City area. 
   Recently, we have seen the liberation of Honduran women who were forced to drink and dance with clients in dance halls in New Jersey; Peruvian families freed from enslavement by a labor recruiter on Long Island; and the rescue of young American women from a street pimp in Connecticut. All of their traffickers have been convicted and imprisoned because they violated the Constitution prohibition against involuntary servitude and slavery. 
   More than a century after the abolition of slavery, we would expect slavery to be a closed chapter in our Nation's history. But, unfortunately, it is not. The Constitution promises to end the suffering of all those who have been held in bondage. As a country, we owe it to the victims of modern-day slavery never to stop fighting for their freedom. 
   This bill, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, renews our commitment to fulfilling the promise of the 13th amendment by providing new enforcement tools and more resources to remove the stain of modern-day slavery from our Nation. 
   I urge its adoption and thank the chairman of the committee and Mr. Smith who was involved in developing the 2000 act and in developing this act, and I urge its adoption.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, it is a stain on our national honor that the citizens of our Capital City are disenfranchised without any votes in Congress. We presume to lecture other nations on the importance of democracy; but today we are being put to our own test, and we must not fail. 
   Now, speakers on the other side say that this bill is unconstitutional. They say, and they point out correctly, that the Constitution says that the House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second year by the people of the several States. Washington, they say, isn't a State. QED. That's the end of the subject. But no, it isn't. It is not the end of the subject. The fact is, article III, section 2 says the judicial power, Federal jurisdiction shall extend to controversies between citizens of different States. Controversies between citizens of different States, that is the basis for jurisdiction for Federal lawsuits, some Federal lawsuits, many Federal lawsuits. 
   Well, what about a controversy when someone from the District of Columbia sues someone from Virginia or New York or Pennsylvania? Well, in 1805, the Supreme Court ruled that diversity jurisdiction did not exist between a citizen of the District of Columbia and a citizen of Virginia, in the case of Hepburn v. Ellzey, because the District of Columbia was not a State. 
   But the Court also said that Congress, under its power to legislate for the District of Columbia, could decide that, for purposes of diversity jurisdiction, the city of Washington, D.C. should be considered a State. Congress took its time in doing so, but did make that decision. 
   And there was a Supreme Court decision in 1949, a mere 145 years later. These things don't go that rapidly. 1949, in National Mutual Insurance Company of the District of Columbia v. Tidewater, the United States Supreme Court said, aha, Congress, having acted, the District of Columbia is a State for purposes of diversity jurisdiction under article III of the Constitution. 
   Congress has as much power to decide that the residents of the District of Columbia have the right to vote for Congress, which requires States, as Congress has the right to decide, upheld by the Supreme Court, that residents of the District of Columbia, have the right to sue citizens of other States. If the Congress has that power for purposes of giving the District of Columbia residents the right to sue and be sued by citizens of other States in Federal courts for diversity jurisdiction, it has the same power, the exact same constitutional power to decide that, for purposes of representation in Congress, citizens of the District of Columbia may have that representation in Congress. 
   So it is, I think, clear, but certainly very arguable, that Congress has ample power constitutionally. And if someone wants to challenge them, let them go to court. But it is not a valid argument to oppose this bill which is necessary for elementary democracy in this country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today in support of this resolution. Like all of my colleagues, I was deeply saddened to learn that our good friend, the distinguished gentleman from California, Tom Lantos, had passed away. And he was our good friend, unfailingly courteous and kind and helpful to all. 
   Tom has left an inspiring legacy, and his passing is a great loss to our country and to the entire world. Throughout his life, Tom devoted himself to human rights and to the cause of persecuted racial, religious, and ethnic minorities. As a survivor of the Holocaust, and the only survivor ever to serve in Congress, he had seen firsthand real evil, and he became a tireless advocate for human rights. 
   As a youth, he was a member of the anti-Nazi underground, and his life's work was built on opposing anti-Semitism and all forms of racism and oppression and attempted genocide, and on supporting Israel, the country that emerged as the haven for the survivors and refugees from the Holocaust. 
   Congressman Lantos once said, ``I will never be able to express fully my profoundly felt gratitude to this great country.'' But it is this Nation that will never be able to express adequately its gratitude to this great man. His life and devotion to human rights should serve as an inspiration to us all. 
   My thoughts and prayers, our thoughts and prayers, and those of a grateful Nation, are with Annette and with the rest of Tom's family and friends during this sad time. And in this hour of bereavement, as we mourn the loss of this great man, what can we finally say other than to thank God for Tom's life and work, and to repeat that ancient refrain, ``The Lord giveth, the Lord taketh away, blessed be the name of the Lord.''

<DOCNO>Mr. NADLER. (FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, in order to uphold the principle of the rule of law and the supremacy of the Constitution, we must reject this bill. This bill limits the courts hearing lawsuits alleging illegal wiretapping, to considering only whether the telecom companies received a ``written request or directive indicating that the activity was authorized by the President and determined to be lawful,'' not whether that request was actually lawful or that telecom companies knew that it was unlawful. 
   The bill is a fig leaf granting blanket immunity to the telecom companies for possibly illegal acts without allowing the courts to consider the facts or the law. It denies people whose rights are violated their fair day in court, and it denies the American people the right to have the actions of this administration subjected to fair and independent scrutiny. 
   Even the court's limited review will remain secret. The lawsuits will be dismissed, but the basis for that dismissal that the defendants were innocent of misconduct or that they were guilty, but that Congress commands their immunity, must remain secret. 
   The constitutionality of the immunity granted by this bill is very questionable. As Judge Walker put it in the AT&T case, ``AT&T's alleged actions here violate the constitutional rights clearly established in the Keith decision. Moreover, because the very action in question has previously been held unlawful, AT&T cannot seriously contend that a reasonable entity in its position could have believed that the alleged domestic dragnet was legal.'' 
   I would hope that the courts will find that because the constitutional rights of Americans have been violated, Congress' attempt to prevent court review is unconstitutional. I regret we may today abandon the Constitution's protections and insulate lawless behavior from legal scrutiny. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote on this legislation.

   Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, Members of the House must decide today whether to uphold the rule of low and the supremacy of the Constitution or whether to protect and reward the lawless behavior of the administration and of the telecommunications companies that participated in its clearly illegal program of spying on innocent Americans. 
   This bill limits the courts hearing lawsuits alleging illegal wiretapping to consider only whether the telecom companies received a ``written request or directive ..... indicating that the activity was [ ] authorized by the President; and [ ] determined to be lawful''--not whether the request was actually lawful or whether the telecom companies knew that it was unlawful. 
   The bill is a fig-leaf, granting blanket immunity to the telecom companies for illegal acts without allowing the courts to consider the facts or the law. It denies people whose rights were violated their fair day in court, and it denies the American people their right to have the actions of the administration subjected to fair and independent scrutiny. 
   Even the courts' limited review will remain secret. The lawsuits will be dismissed, but the basis for the dismissal--that the defendants were innocent of misconduct, or that they were guilty but Congress commands their immunity--must remain secret. 
   And the constitutionality of the immunity granted by this bill is very questionable. As Judge Walker put it in the AT&T case:  
   AT&T's alleged actions here violate the constitutional rights clearly established in [the] Keith decision. Moreover, because `the very action in question has previously been held unlawful,' AT&T cannot seriously contend that a reasonable entity in its position could have believed that the alleged domestic dragnet was legal.  
   I would hope that the courts will find that, because the Constitutional rights of Americans have been violated, Congress' attempt to prevent court review is unconstitutional. 
   The bill also reiterates than FISA and specified other statutes are the exclusive legal authority for electronic surveillance. The Act has always said that. This bill adds some new mechanisms to ensure that any future legislation may not be read to override this exclusivity by implication, but only by explicitly saying that that is its purpose. 
   No one and no court should draw the false conclusion that we are thereby implying that the exclusivity provision was, or could have been, overridden either by the President's claim of inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution, or by the Authorization for the Use of Military Force of 2001. This bill does not say or imply that. If there is any doubt of this point, the blanket immunity provisions of this bill reflect Congress' understanding that this domestic spying was not legal. If it were, there would not be any necessity for these provisions. 
   This bill abandons the Constitution's protections and insulates lawless behavior from legal scrutiny. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote.

   Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I will respond again. It proves nothing because the fact is that if you are just looking at etymology, it may make sense. But if you look at usage in the Middle East, the Arab and Iranian people who wish the State of Israel eliminated have, since 1947 or 1948, referred to Israel either as the ``Zionist regime'' or the ``Zionist entity.'' And you can look back at the rhetoric of 1967 when they lined up the troops and they said all the Jews will be killed. They talked about the Zionist regime or the Zionist entity being eliminated. They weren't talking about regime change; they were talking about genocide.

<DOCNO>Mr. NADLER. (HONORING THE LIFE OF JACOB BIRNBAUM -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. I thank the gentlelady for her support, and I thank Ms. Ros-Lehtinen for her support. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to join me in supporting House Resolution 137, a resolution to honor the life and six decades of public service of Jacob Birnbaum, known more familiarly as Jacob Birnbaum, especially his commitment freeing Soviet Jews from religious, cultural and communal extinction. 
   It is fitting that Jacob Birnbaum was born on December 10, which is also International Human Rights Day. This past December, Mr. Birnbaum celebrated his 80th birthday. It is time for this body to honor the life and work, the 60 years of public service of this remarkable human rights activist. I am very proud to call him a fellow New Yorker. 
   Jacob Birnbaum was born in Germany, and during World War II, his family fled the Nazis and settled in the United Kingdom. Throughout the war, the Birnbaum family knew the plight of Jews, especially their own relatives, under the Nazis. His personal experience with the horrors of evil sparked the activism of Jacob Birnbaum. 
   Beginning in 1946, following the end of the war, 19-year-old Jacob Birnbaum devoted several years to providing relief for younger survivors of the Nazi and Soviet totalitarian systems. Through his work with young Polish Jews who managed to leave the USSR after the war, he became familiar with the iniquities of the Soviet system. These earlier experiences fueled his later passion to mobilize American Jewry in the drive to rescue Jews from oppression in the Soviet Union. 
   In the mid 1950s and early 1960s, he became involved in assisting people from the disintegrating Jewish communities of North Africa caught up in the struggles of the host countries for independence from France and in the persecution of the Jews of North Africa after the independence of Israel. 
   His activism did not end then. After traveling to the United States, he decided to create a national student organization to activate the grass roots of the American Jewish community. Settling in New York, in 1964, he set up his first student committee. Then he concentrated on building a student core at Yeshiva University. Mr. Birnbaum named the new organization the Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry, known familiarly as the SSSJ. 
   Finally, he called a national founding meeting at Columbia University on April 27, 1964, followed by a large student demonstration 4 days later on the Soviet holiday May Day in front of the Soviet United Nations Mission. The authoritative Center for Jewish History has listed the demonstration as the beginning of the public struggle for the freedom of Soviet Jews. 
   Many consider this action as the reason to consider Mr. Birnbaum the father of the movement to liberate Soviet Jewry. Indeed, the evidence supports this notion. Throughout the rest of the 1960s, under his direction, the Student Struggle continued working full time in response to the oppression of Soviet Jews. 
   As we know, the Bolshevik Resolution in Russia led to the imprisonment of Soviet Jews behind the Iron Curtain. Jewish culture, Jewish religion and Jewish communal life were forcibly extinguished under the Soviet regime, which also indulged in numerous anti-Semitic actions. 
   Even after Stalin's death, the Soviet kingdom of fear abated only slightly. The Cold War effectively continued to cut off the Jews of Russia and Eastern Europe from their fellow Jews in the West, and almost all expressions of Jewish religion and culture continued to be prohibited. 
   Nevertheless, expressions of outrage began to accumulate in the early 1960s, with a few pioneers leading the way. Shortly after the initial organizing by Jacob Birnbaum, the major Jewish organizations met in Washington, D.C., and established the American Conference on Soviet Jewry. The SSSJ that Mr. Birnbaum had established functioned as its handbook said, to mobilize a tidal wave of public opinion. 
   After the mass arrests of young Jewish dissidents on June 15, 1970, and the  death sentences handed down to them in the Leningrad trial of December 1970, the National Conference on Soviet Jewry was created.     
   The Greater New York Conference, under the direction of the then young activist Malcolm Hoenlein, initiated the profoundly important Solidarity Day marches, modeled after Jacob Birnbaum's Jericho, Redemption, and Exodus marches and rallies of the 1960s. Mr. Hoenlein is now the Executive Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. Of great significance was the creation in 1970 of the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews, a coalition of non-established regional groups, under the chairmanship of Dr. Louis Rosenblum, with whom Jacob Birnbaum worked for many years. 
   Mr. Hoenlein has publicly stated that he considers Mr. Birnbaum ``the father of the Soviet Jewry movement.'' Similar statements have been made by other major public figures such as Dr. Meir Rosenne, who worked closely with Mr. Birnbaum in the early formative period of 1964 to 1967. Dr. Rosenne later became Israel's Ambassador to France and then to the United States. Sir Martin Gilbert, the official British historian of Winston Churchill and his times, has made a similar statement. 
   In May, 1965, Mr. Birnbaum was the first person to testify before a congressional committee on the importance of utilizing economic leverage on the Kremlin to secure the liberation of Soviet Jews. When the late Senator Henry Jackson initiated the legislation which finally resulted in the passage of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment in 1974, Mr. Birnbaum worked closely with the director of Senator Jackson's office, Dorothy Fosdick, and, of course, with his other aide, Richard Perle, who played a major role in the initiation and development of the legislation. 
   The idea of placing economic pressure on Communist states to increase emigration played a key role in softening up the Kremlin regimes to make possible the Soviet Jewry demand of ``Let My People Go.'' For the first time, there was legislation to put teeth into the previous congressional humanitarian resolutions. 
   From 1976 to 1986, Jacob Birnbaum conducted annual Most Favored Nation campaigns, based on Jackson-Vanik, to pressure various countries, including Romania, to increase emigration and to release prisoners. He testified annually before both Senate and House Committees. 
   In the latter 1970s, Mr. Birnbaum enlarged his Soviet Jewry strategy. He expanded the slogan ``Let My People Go'' by adding ``Let My People Know.'' Let them know their heritage. The Kremlin had pulverized Jewish religious, cultural and community life, and, in the 1960s, the Soviet Jewish resistance underground began to generate Jewish self-education, cultural, religious and Hebrew-speaking groups in the Soviet Union. 
   Mr. Birnbaum conducted numerous campaigns for their protection, enlisting the aid of many Christian religious denominations. These efforts reached a high point when he organized and led a delegation of the Synagogue Council of America to meet with the Deputy Secretary of State and the Department's Human Rights Director, Warren Zimmermann, in September 1985. 
   Mr. Birnbaum's vision was partially realized with Malcolm Hoenlein's Solidarity Rallies in New York, and, finally, by the great national rally in Washington on December 7, 1987, on the eve of President Gorbachev's meeting with President Reagan. 
   Finally, in 1990, the Kremlin conceded to all the pressure and permitted a mass emigration, which has now totaled more than 2 million people, about 1 million to Israel and 1 million elsewhere, mostly to the United States. This was no small accomplishment. And many people played a role in making it happen. 
   In addition to the courageous work of Mr. Birnbaum, tribute ought to be paid to the many pioneers and the other national organizations which fought so strenuously for the liberation of Soviet Jews: 
   Morris Abram, U.S. Human Rights Commissioner; Dr. Moshe Deeter, the scholar whose research fueled the early movement; former Justice Arthur Goldberg; the distinguished theologian, Rabbi Dr. Abraham J. Heschel; Senator Jacob Javits; NASA scientist Dr. Louis Rosenblum of the Cleveland Committee on Soviet Anti-Semitism; and Elie Wiesel, whose book, ``The Jews of Silence'' was so influential. 
   Many organizations also played an important role, and I will name them in my extended remarks. 
   Following the collapse of the Soviet regime, Mr. Birnbaum spent a substantial part of the 1990s in combating anti-Semitic manifestations in former Soviet Central Asia, mostly in Uzbekistan, intervening through the State Department and enlisting Malcolm Hoenlein's aid in engaging the Uzbek Ambassador in Washington. 
   In his 81st year, Mr. Birnbaum continues to support groups engaged in the Jewish education of former Soviet Jews and their children. His dedication to his beliefs remains as strong as ever. 
   For all these reasons, Mr. Speaker, the House of Representatives ought to honor the life and six decades of public service of Jacob Birnbaum and especially his successful commitment to freeing Soviet Jews from religious, cultural, and communal extinction. He is a true hero. 
   I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, for moving this resolution quickly through his committee. I would also like to thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Watson) for managing the consideration of this resolution today, and the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for her leadership on this. 
   Again, I urge all my colleagues to join me in passing this resolution to honor this work of this unique hero of this century.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. I thank the gentlelady. 
   Mr. Speaker, when the World Trade Center collapsed on September 11, 2001, the towers sent up a plume of poisonous dust that blanketed Lower Manhattan, Brooklyn, and parts of Queens and into New Jersey. A toxic mixture of lead, dioxin, asbestos, mercury, benzene and other hazardous contaminants swirled around the site of the disaster and far afield as rescue workers labored furiously in the wreckage, many without adequate protective  gear. Thousands of first responders inhaled this poisonous dust before it settled onto and into countless homes, shops and office buildings. 
   Immediately after the collapse, and for the weeks after that, the Environmental Protection Agency had the responsibility of being the lead agency responsible for ensuring the safety of the hundreds and thousands of people who live and work and attend school in Lower Manhattan, Brooklyn and Jersey City, and of the first responders. 
   Instead, the EPA and the Federal Government betrayed the people who live in New York and betrayed all the first responders, the police officers and the fire officers, and the volunteers from all over who came to help us clean up. It betrayed them in two ways. 
   First, the EPA assured all that the environmental conditions in New York were not hazardous and that the health of those near the plume was not in danger. Former EPA administrator Christine Todd Whitman irresponsibly declared within a few days after 9/11 that the air was safe to breathe and the water was safe to drink, and EPA continued saying that when they had plenty of data to say it wasn't true. The EPA and the Federal Government lied, and because of these lies, people are sick and dying today. The air was not safe. There is no doubt the EPA initiated two separate cover-ups that go on to this day. 
   For years, the Federal Government, the State government, the city government insisted that there was no evidence, no proof that people who were getting sick, that fire officers and police officers who had annual exams and had been healthy all the time and who suddenly could not breathe and could not work, this had nothing to do with the World Trade Center. You couldn't prove it was because they were poisoned by the atmosphere. 
   It was only last September, in September 2006, 5 years after the World Trade Center collapsed, that this cover-up unraveled. 
   A study released last September by Mount Sinai Hospital found that of the more than 9,000 first responders examined in that study, 70 percent suffered health problems related to their work at Ground Zero. 
   The evidence continues to pile up. Yesterday, the New York Times reported a clear link between World Trade Center dust and life-threatening disease. And yet, until very recently, the Health Department and the City of New York continued to deny that this was the case. 
   The City of New York continues to contest every workers comp case filed because, obviously, these are all malingerers; nothing was true. 
   The article in yesterday's Time cites reports by doctors from the fire department of New York and the Albert Einstein Medical College which again confirm what we have known, that all honest people have known for years: that we are facing a major health crisis as a result of September 11th. And we know that these conditions are very often long-lasting, life-lasting and that they go on and on. 
   In the days and weeks after 9/11, New York City firefighters and police officers joined with workers and volunteers from all 50 States to aid in the colossal rescue and recovery effort. But more than 5 years later, the Federal Government has not begun to do its part. 
   To this day, there has been no comprehensive program by the Federal Government to monitor, as Mrs. Maloney said, to monitor the health of all the victims, the firefighters, the cleanup workers. There has been no provision of medical services. 
   The President finally, in this year's budget that we are now debating, proposes supplying $25 million. And yet we know that the cost of caring for these people will be probably in the neighborhood of $300 million per year for the indefinite future. 
   For every day that goes by, more and more people become sick and are diagnosed with illnesses that their doctors attribute to the contamination of the World Trade Center. That is why a number of pieces of legislation have been introduced. For instance, Senators CLINTON, MENENDEZ, SCHUMER and KENNEDY, and in this House, Congressman Towns, ENGEL, WEINER, and I have introduced the 9/11 Heroes Health Improvement Act of 2007, which would provide more than $1.9 billion in Federal funding for medical and mental health screening, testing, monitoring and treatment grants for institutions that provide care to those whose health was affected in the 9/11 attacks, for the next 6 years, this would cover. 
   And that is just the first cover-up. The second cover-up is that we know that the World Trade Center contamination settled in Lower Manhattan, in Brooklyn, in Queens, probably in Jersey City, in many neighborhoods, buildings and onto streets. Nature cleans up the outdoor air, but it doesn't clean up the indoor air. The rain washes away dust in the outdoors; the wind blows it away. But nothing removes the indoors. People were told, don't worry, it is safe to move back to Lower Manhattan. In high school, students were told to go back after a week. And yet, we know that the indoor contamination was not dealt with properly. We know that, unless properly cleaned up, professionally cleaned up, indoor spaces are still contaminated; that even if you went in, as the New York City Department of Health urged, and said, ``If you see World Trade Center dust in your apartment, clean it up with a wet mop and a wet rag,'' and the EPA echoed this advice. This, too, was a betrayal, because not only is that advice illegal because we know that much of that dust had asbestos in it, and it is illegal to remove asbestos-laden material, to move it, to touch it, to deal with it unless you are properly licensed to, certified to do so and wearing equipment. But EPA and the City of New York Health Department told people to remove it with a wet mop and a wet rag. 
   We also know that, if you did that, besides being illegal, you probably inhaled some of it. And the very often immigrant workers hired by fly-by-night firms, who, not professionally, did this probably inhaled a lot of it. And we also know that, if you did it, you didn't thoroughly do it; that the dust settled into the porous wood surfaces and into the carpets and the drapes and behind the refrigerator and into the HVAC systems. And where the toddler crawls on the rug today and loosens that dust into the air, that toddler is being poisoned today. We probably have thousands or tens of thousands of people all over Manhattan and Brooklyn and Queens and Jersey City who are being poisoned today and who we will see come down with asbestosis and mesothelioma and lung cancer 15 years from now, because it has never been properly cleaned up because the EPA continues to deny its responsibility. 
   The EPA ombudsman's office was called in at my request in February and March of 2002, and held hearings to see what could be done about this. What happened? The EPA abolished the ombudsman's office. 
   The EPA set up, at Senator Clinton's request, a scientific advisory body to look into this. They started saying, ``Hey, wait a minute. We have got a major problem here.'' What happened? They were disbanded by the EPA. 
   The EPA inspector general's office looked into this, and came out with a report in August of 2003, saying that thousands of people are endangered by this; that what we have to do is randomly inspect indoor spaces, apartments and work spaces in concentric circles going out from the World Trade Center so that we can find out where the contamination still exists, maybe 3 blocks in one direction, maybe 3 miles in another direction. But, wherever it is, map it, delineate it, and wherever it is, go in on a building-by-building basis, clean it up so that people are not continually poisoned indefinitely.     
   Clean it up, so that people are not continually poisoned indefinitely. What happened to that report? It was ignored by the EPA, and the people in the Inspector General's Office are no longer there. 
   And again, at Senator Clinton's insistence and because CAROLYN MALONEY and I and others insisted, the EPA set up another scientific advisory body in 2005. What happened? They started saying, you know, the Inspector General is right and what the EPA has done is inadequate. What happened? They were disbanded before they could make official recommendations. 
   To this day, we know that we are poisoning large numbers of people continually and piling up unnecessary cases  of fatal diseases that will come out in 10 and 15 years because the Federal Government and the city government of New York has ignored this problem and covered it up. 
   So, in summary, we have two separate cover-ups, one of which unraveled only within the last year. We are trying to deal with it. We still don't have the funds to deal with it. The Federal Government, the Bush administration has ignored it, basically. They have not come out with proper recommendations. 
   Some of us, Congresswoman Maloney, Congressman Shays, myself, Senator Clinton, have made legislative proposals for long-term care and monitoring of the medical conditions caused that will be with us for the next 50 years. We don't have administration support. We haven't enacted that legislation. We must. 
   But at least, because that cover-up unraveled last year, we're talking about it. But that second cover-up, they're still denying it. The City of New York is still denying it. The Federal Government is still denying it. And until they admit it, until we do the proper investigation in the way that the Inspector General recommended and look at all the areas and find out where the contamination is and go in and clean it up, and it may cost a couple of billion dollars to do that, but until we do that we will continue poisoning people, we will continue making sure that 10 and 15 and 20 years from now we will have thousands perhaps of unnecessary cases of fatal diseases. 
   So I say to you, Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. MALONEY for calling this special order tonight. But I say to you, we must enact a legislation such as CAROLYN has talked about, such as I have talked about, such as others have, to put into place systematic means of monitoring and providing medical services for the victims, the first responders. But we must also make sure that the EPA and the Federal Government step up to the plate, unravel that second cover-up, peel it away, see what the problem is, inspect the areas, find out where the contamination still is. And where it still is, go in and on a building by building basis clean it up so that we can know that people can live and work in areas without being poisoned and without coming down with additional diseases. 
   Without doing this, we are adding to the work of the terrorists. The Federal and city governments are becoming complicit in adding to the victims. It was bad enough the terrorists cost us 3,000 dead that day. The Federal and city government should not be adding to the victims as they still are.

<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Thank you, CAROLYN. 
   What struck me about the hearings was several things. We've had hearings for a number of years, and I remember the first hearing I attended was presided over by Senator Lieberman, a U.S. Senate hearing back in February of 2002. But none of this has changed. It's 5 years later, and it hasn't changed. 
   Number one, you see the victims, the first responders, the people who dropped everything they were doing to help, to help victims that we thought people might be still alive under the debris. They weren't. Who then helped with the cleanup to get, who worked on the pile for 40 and 50 days. And we heard story after story of how healthy people were no longer healthy and they could no longer work and they could no longer breathe, how they now had to take 20 and 30 and 40 different pills and medications a day, how they couldn't pay for the medications, how they had lost their jobs, and because they lost their jobs they lost their health coverage and how the workers comp system didn't work for them.     
   How a hero who was given an award for heroism at the World Trade Center, when he went for workers' comp, they said, Prove you were there.

   Mr. NADLER. So the first thing we saw at those hearings were these people testifying about how they selflessly worked, and we know that they did, and how they had been betrayed by every level of government in treating them, by the workers' comp and the State, by the Federal Government. 
   The second thing was it was clear from the heroic work done by the people at Mount Sinai and the Fire Department of the City of New York, in trying to deal with these sick people and who had to put the funding together for private philanthropic sources, that until last year there was no government funding for any of this whatsoever. Finally we got a few million dollars.

   Mr. NADLER. The Health Commissioner testified that. There has been a denial, a straightforward denial, by City and State people because they don't want to admit liability. 
   The third thing was that even now, even now, when Dr. Agwunobi testified, he said we will have a plan. Well, we haven't seen the plan. We know now that it is going to cost about $300 million a year just to deal with the health conditions of the people we know about. Never mind the cleaning up of the contaminated areas, but just for the first responders, it is going to cost about $300 million a year. The President proposed $25 million, but it was made very clear at the hearing, the last hearing, that the plan that the Federal Government was going to come up with, if they actually come up with a plan, would not deal with residents, would not deal with the health problems of people who are living there, who were beseeched by the City and Federal Government to come back and live and work in lower Manhattan and are suffering because they listened to that.

   Mr. NADLER. And that is a scandal also. The other thing that was very clear, and it has been clear from the EPA right up to date, is that the registry has dealt with people who live or who work in lower Manhattan, below Canal Street, as if there was a 30,000-foot high wall along Canal Street or a Star Trek-type force field along Canal Street and across the East River because, after all, anyone who lives north of Canal Street has no problem. And anybody who lives in Brooklyn, where we saw the satellite photos showed the plume went and where Congressman  Weiner testified that at his office 10 miles away, debris was falling on the terrace at his office, and we know it was falling across all these neighborhoods across Brooklyn; we don't have to deal with that. We are going to be studiously ignorant of all the people in these other places outside of lower Manhattan. That was brought out very clearly in Congressman Towns' hearing. And the fact is, we have to look at all these hearings areas and do the job properly.

   Mr. NADLER. There are a couple of lessons that really should be learned here. One, Abraham Lincoln said, at the end of the Civil War, that you have to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan. We are failing in doing that, when he who shall have borne the battle here are heroes who came in to help, and we are abandoning them. 
   Second, the EPA had a duty to do the job here. They failed in that duty. And that is a danger for the future. The law provides that the EPA must come in and classify the area and make sure and protect people, and the OSHA laws were enforced in Washington so no one got sick. They weren't enforced in New York, and 50,000 people are sick.

<DOCNO>Mr. NADLER. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this conference report. 
   The bill contains several critical homeland security improvements that have been mentioned before. I won't mention them because I want to concentrate on the 100 percent scanning that the gentleman from California opposed. 
   I have pushed for the 100 percent scanning for almost 5 years. The language in this bill is modeled on the language that I introduced 2 years ago, along with Mr. Oberstar, in the SOS, Sail Only if Scanned Act, which was then supporter afterwards by Mr. Markey. 
   As we just heard, the Republicans have opposed this. The Republican leadership opposed it, and last year, it failed on practically party-line vote. This year, it passed on a practically party-line vote, and I thank Mr. Thompson and I thank our leadership for making sure that this was included in the conference report. 
   Twelve million containers a year come into our ports. Our risk-based inspection inspects 6 percent of them. That leaves 94 percent of the 12 million containers uninspected, any one of which could have a chemical or nuclear or radiological bomb inside it and we wouldn't know. We must inspect them, or electronically scan them to be precise, before they're put on a ship bound for the United States in the foreign port if we're going to be safe. We can do it. 
   Yes, this wasn't included in the 9/11 Commission report. This bill improves upon the 9/11 Commission report, and I commend the Democratic leadership of this House and of the Senate for doing that. 
   We are told it's impractical. It is not impractical. The technologies exist for doing it. There are three or four different technologies that exist for doing it. When we were told last year that the tamper-proof seals didn't exist, General Electric had a van across the street from the Rayburn House Office Building showing three different models of the tamper-proof seals that sold for $50, $100, and $150 at the same time. 
   This is eminently doable and it must be done. A few years ago, I debated Mr. Rogers who said we will inspect the high-risk containers. I said, wonderful, they'll put the bomb in the low-risk container. The fact is there is no such thing as the low-risk container. The most reliable shipper with the best record, all it takes is one driver on his way from the factory to the port to have lunch and someone replaces a television set with a nuclear bomb or vice versa in the container. 
   This is a great step forward. It will greatly enhance the safety of this country. I urge that we adopt this, and I thank the leadership of this House for their steadfastness in supporting this very essential measure.
