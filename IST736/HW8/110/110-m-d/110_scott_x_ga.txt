<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, we have had a great debate in here this afternoon. What is on the American people's mind right now are two words: ``quickly'' and ``now.'' They want this economy turned around quickly and now. 
   The best way to do that is in our plans, getting money to the people who will spend it quickly and now, extending the limits on our lending capacity in FHA quickly and now, and in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
   Mr. Speaker, about 143 years ago, Abraham Lincoln, as well as Robert E. Lee, came before this Congress at the end of the Civil War, and they said to this Congress: we need to move. It is not incumbent upon us to complete this task, but neither are we free to desist from doing all we possibly can quickly and now. 
   Those are the words that are tripping off the tongues of the American people. We need to stop them from being put out of their homes with foreclosures. That is why we have the limits for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as for the FHA loans. 
   Americans want to be able to have their jobs. You do that by stimulating the economy and putting the money in the hands of the people who will spend it quickly and now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I too want to thank Mr. Tanner, Mr. Abercrombie, and Mr. Skelton and our Republican colleagues for coming together. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is what I refer to as a soaring golden moment in this Congress because this is the beginning. This is a beginning of effective planning for bringing conclusion in a very responsible way to what the American people truly want. 
   And why is this a golden moment? This is a golden moment in this House because the only way that we are going to bring this Iraqi situation to a positive conclusion is with Democrats working with Republicans.     
   Democrats cannot do it by ourselves, Republicans cannot do it by themselves. 
   The other point why this is a golden moment, Mr. Speaker, is because this shows, and the process of this legislation and the reporting and the involvement of the Congress shows, that we are not going to make the same mistake ending our involvement in Iraq that we made in going in; and that was poor planning, bad information, and ineffective intelligence. That's why I commend this. 
   It's very important for the American people to see us finally, as Democrats and Republicans, working together in this start to take this great step. And let us dare not lose this golden moment of bipartisan cooperation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning in support of this very, very important measure. 
   Today, this House of Representatives will vote on the most comprehensive response yet, bringing badly needed help to this Nation's troubling mortgage crisis. 
   These House measures we will debate today will help in several areas: Number one, it will help families facing foreclosures to keep their homes; two, it will help families avoid foreclosures in the future; and three, it will help the recovery of communities in cities and towns across this Nation who are harmed by empty houses that are caught in the foreclosure process. And that's why I rise to support this bill today. 
   This is our first bill out of the gate on this important measure. And it is extraordinarily important, Mr. Speaker, and that's why I support this rule. 
   As we look across the landscape of America today, in neighborhood after neighborhood, homes empty, buildings empty, vandalism on high, violent crime on high, neighboring homes' property values going down, and right today, mortgages that are higher than the actual value of the property. And my good friends on the other side of the aisle question, why are we moving? Why is this a bailout? This is not a bailout. If anything, my dear friends, this is a bail-in. This is a bail-in to save communities. 
   Some of the same arguments that I heard on this side were heard during when we had other disasters. This is a disaster, just as we had Katrina, just as we had tornados, just as we had unforeseen circumstances. I even heard some say, when Katrina was coming, well, they knew the hurricane was coming, why didn't they get out of the way? This country needs help, and they're looking for their government to do what government is supposed to do, help their country in a moment of greatest need. And there is no greater need today than to help in this mortgage crisis. 
   And foremost for that help is to get into these communities, give our State and local governments, whose fire departments, whose police departments, already strained, are overstrained, and to help those neighboring homes who are going down in value because these properties are standing there idle and empty and are nothing but havens for crime. That's why, Mr. Speaker, this bill is so important. 
   I commend Ms. Waters and Chairman Frank for putting together the leadership of this bill, which I'm proud to be a cosponsor of, because it goes to the heart of the matter, and that is, saving America's communities. Fifteen billion dollars spread in two fashions, 7.5 for loans, 7.5 for grants. It's an excellent idea whose time has come.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Thank you very much, Madam Chairman. 
   This is an extraordinarily important measure. If we don't learn from history, we're doomed to repeat it. Around 1929, we had another crisis that happened as a result of one of our financial legs coming out from under us. At that time, there was a Republican administration that fostered so much of that. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in a Democratic administration, had to come and realize that government had to act. 
   We're not doing this because we don't have anything else to do. We're doing this because we have an economic crisis of soaring magnitude before us. The derivatives of this magnitude are affecting communities and neighborhoods where these foreclosures are leaving these empty homes, many of them in $200,000, $300,000, $400,000 neighborhoods. They're taking down the residential value of communities around them, and these communities in these cities and towns are already strapped with their own financial pressures, much like my own city of Atlanta, and they need help in rescuing these communities. We're coming to their rescue.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. What we see here, Madam Chairman, is a fundamental difference between the Republicans and the Democrats when it comes to responding to the pressing needs of the American people. Let us look at really where we are. 
   We are in a depressed, recessed economy, which means liquidity is drying up, which means there is a slowing supply and circulation of money, which has been caused chiefly by a meltdown of the subprime mortgage market, and it has had a ricocheting effect throughout every fiber of our economy. 
   The American people are hanging on by their fingernails. Between 7,000 and 8,000 American families are foreclosing every day, according to the Federal Reserve, not David Scott, not our Financial Services Committee, but according to the Federal Reserve, between 7,000 and 8,000 individuals are declaring foreclosure. 
   That means communities all across this Nation are impacted. Not only is this a burden upon individuals, homeowners and families, it's devastating enough, but many of these foreclosures, when the property's foreclosed, that means folks are out of them. That means they are left vacant. That means they become fire hazards. That means they become havens to criminals. That means police services, that means fire services, that means a tremendous pressure being placed on already depressed city and county and State budgets. 
   And Madam Chairman, in every State in this Nation, there's been a 20 percent, at least, increase in foreclosures. So this is a problem of soaring magnitude, and the cities and the counties are already, many of them, moving ahead, but they are overwhelmed with the scale of this problem. And that's where the government comes in. 
   There is a role for government. We need to respond to the needs of the American people, and nowhere is it more important than in this bill that has been very brilliantly designed by the gentlelady from California and our chairman of this committee. 
   Now let's speak very briefly about this Hensarling amendment. And, I might add, the gentleman from Texas is a fine person. I consider him a good friend, but he is terribly, terribly wrong with this amendment. This is a terrible amendment because it does what we refer to in the South as, hold still, little fishy, and let me gut you. That's what this amendment does. 
   It goes at the heart of this bill, because what he wants to do is take away the stimulus package for the local communities, and what he wants to do is to deny a way and a requirement in the bill so that we can help the poor elements where this bill says that you must serve those that meet at least 50 percent of the level of poverty. In order to do that, we must have the grant feature in the bill. 
   The other point, as I mentioned earlier, a part of our whole concern in this whole economic issue is liquidity, which means we must have a stimulative nature in terms of what we do here in Washington, to stimulate the economy and put money into the economy. That's why we've got this week and leading on starting in next week $600, $300 and $1,200 checks. To do what? To stimulate. 
   I take great offense from the other side when they constantly want the American people to think we're taking their tax money away and putting it in our pockets or hoarding it. This money is going right back to taxpayers to help to defray the costs of servicing these depressed communities. 
   The grants are needed, Madam Chairman, in order for us to serve those that are at the lower end of the economic level, which we must do and can only be done through grants. If his amendment is adopted, we won't be able to do that which hurts and almost kills this bill. 
   The other thing that it does, it does not allow us to apply the stimulus factor to the bill to provide needed input into this. I urge a defeat of this. It might be intentioned, I won't say well, but it is a terrible amendment from the gentleman from Texas. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman's time has expired.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, this is the most important issue facing the American people today, and it is so important that the American people are watching this debate to see, as we are focusing our energies on this and to also, Mr. Speaker, take a look at the other side and the unfortunate distractions. We are not dealing with the war supplemental here. We are dealing with the issue that is on the minds of the American people. The American people are hanging on by their fingernails to their houses. Millions of families are losing their homes. An average of 7,500 people every day in this country are filing for foreclosure on their homes. As we debate this bill in this one hour  alone, there will be 875 people who will file for foreclosure in each hour we are debating. That is important, Mr. Speaker. 
   There is nothing more important on the American people's minds than to do something that brings some reasonable end to this miserable nightmare we are in as a result of this mortgage-foreclosure issue. 
   Millions of families are seeing their home values drop. Trillions of dollars of household wealth and property values have been lost. Homeowners now owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, and the housing mortgage crisis has caused businesses to lay off workers. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have lost their jobs. This is what is at stake, Mr. Speaker. 
   In terms of liquidity, we are in the worst economic times since the Great Depression, and that is why it is important that we lay this backdrop so the American people can see what we are doing to respond to this issue that is before us today in H.R. 5830 which is a very thoughtful, which is a very responsive response to this very, very serious issue. H.R. 5830, the FHA Housing Stabilization Homeownership Retention Act is the answer to this problem. I commend Chairman Barney Frank for having the foresight in our Committee on Financial Services to put it forward. 
   Essentially what it does is it gives just $300 billion in authority, not cost, Mr. Speaker. It is very important because I know the other side is going to come and talk about a $300 billion bailout. This is a bail-in that is going to cost the American taxpayers just $2.7 billion that has been outlaid and scored by the Congressional Budget Office. 
   Later in the debate we will explain exactly what these costs are. And what this bill will do, it will ensure a refinancing of loans for borrowers who are struggling to afford their current mortgages. Participation is voluntary. The mortgage holder would have to agree to a substantial reduction of the current loan's outstanding principal and provide new loans that that borrower can afford.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. That is what is important here, Mr. Speaker. What we are seeing on our side as what is critical is keeping people in their homes. And in order to do that, we are simply offering that we extend the FHA ability to authorize and simply place a guarantee of loans up to $300 billion which in fact is a $300 billion reinvestment in our economy. And again as I mentioned, the cost is only $2.7 billion. 
   To help defray the government's cost and prevent unjust enrichments such as borrowers' flipping, the bill requires that the borrower shares with the government a substantial position of any profits from selling or refinancing homes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I come from the State of Georgia which is suffering dramatically because of home foreclosures. The State of Georgia ranks number eight in home foreclosures.     
   It is at the top of my agenda to make sure that we bring some relief, certainly to the people of my beloved State of Georgia, but certainly the 13th District, which even has a greater preponderance of foreclosures because of the subprime mortgage meltdown. This is extremely important. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, as I conclude, let me just say this point.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I just wanted to correct an  item. I made the statement about us having the worst times since the Depression. I want to bear those facts out. So I want you to know that I am telling the truth. 
   In this statement from the Joint Economic Committee, it says mortgages exceed equity in homes with falling housing prices. More than 10 percent of homeowners now owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. Homeowners' debt on their houses exceeds their equity in their homes for the first time since 1945. In terms of liquidity, money in the marketplace, it is the worst time since the Depression. 
   Now the important thing to understand as we move forward is to understand the seriousness of the condition. You bring up gas prices. We bring up food prices. We've got all of these problems, but today, the American people are expecting us to deal with the housing crisis.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. (ENCOURAGING DISPLAY OF THE FLAG ON FATHER'S DAY -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, thank you to Ms. Baldwin, the distinguished lady from Wisconsin for her generosity, and thanks to Mr. King and those on the other side of the aisle who are joining in this effort. 
   Mr. Speaker, without question, this is an extraordinary day, it is an extraordinary bill, is an extraordinary occasion. This is America, the greatest country in the world, and our flag represents greatness. To have now, finally, fruition, the manifestation of those precious words that were captured in the book of Exodus in the holy scriptures, where God said, the greatest and the first commandment in relationship of man to man were these words, ``Honor thy father,'' and then He said, ``and thy mother that thy days will be long in the land.'' 
   Finally, today, on this day, June 11, in the year 2007, nearly 4,000 years since those words were written down and inscribed, we are finally recognizing fathers as well as mothers by making sure the flag flies not just on Mother's Day but on Father's Day as well. 
   In the Hebrew language, the word for ``father'' is ``abba, ``and in the Greek language it is ``pater,'' and together those words mean the begatter, the progenitor, the source. But it also means provider and protector. It is no wonder why God in His wisdom said: ``Honor thy father'' and He put father first, and our mother, and now we are rectifying that situation. 
   I am very delighted to be here. This is an important bill, at an important time, because never before have we needed to stress the role of father, to be a good father. 
   It is a gaping hole in the fabric of America that fathers are not being fathers. Throughout so many aspects of our society, the American flag is one of the greatest symbols of our country. It is the representation of our freedoms, our values, our heritage as a Nation. 
   As Americans, our flag code instructs us to fly the flag every day, but especially on a number of very special significant Federal, religious, and cultural holidays. For many years, this list of occasions has included Veterans Day, President's day, Columbus Day and Mother's Day. 
   In the past several years, the list was amended to include the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.'s observation of his birthday as a national holiday, in honor of his outstanding contributions that he made in his lifetime to the advancement of the civil rights of all Americans. 
   But our flag code currently does not reflect the important roles of both men and women in the raising of children, and never before have we needed to emphasize that. It is time that this body officially recognizes the importance of American fathers by passing this important legislation today. 
   I am pleased that the House is considering H.R. 2356, for fathers play an extraordinary role in the development of children. Psychologists have emphasized that the presence of a father significantly influences a child's development in many ways. Infants not only distinguish between their father and strangers' voices within the first 4 weeks of life, but infants also recognize that a father is likely to engage in play time with them. 
   That first impression, to hear that strong comforting voice of a father, to balance that with the mother, is so critical in the development of our children. In later years, the relationship between a father and his children strongly influences success in the classroom, improves relationships with peers, and decreases the likelihood of negative behavior. 
   Is there any wonder that today in so many reaches and depths in our neighborhoods that there is negative behavior, and that is so much associated because there is not a father being a father in the home and in the life of that child. 
   The presence of a father is also a very important determinant in the child's socioeconomic potential later in life. Unfortunately, over the last four decades, research shows that there has been an unprecedented rise in this Nation in the number of fatherless homes, especially when they are first born, no father. 
   The National Fatherhood Initiative emphasizes that children from families with fathers are five times less likely to be poor. What is the answer to poverty? Getting the fathers who produce these children to be fathers, to take care of these children and be responsible for these children. 
   It is important for Congress to emphasize the significance of fathers and their socioeconomic value of the two-parent family as well, for studies also show that children are more likely to engage in recreational activities when their fathers are present. When fathers are involved in organized sports such as soccer, baseball and basketball, they are not only encouraging physical activity in their children, but also character development and sportsmanship. 
   Fathers also benefit for participating in their children's teams, as physical activity contributes to increased wellness and disease prevention in men. Fathers who are active in child rearing may also find themselves more nurturing toward their colleagues in the workplace, improving other aspects of their lives, by taking younger coworkers under their wing or volunteering more time to charitable organizations as well. 
   Schools across this country are developing innovative programs to reach out to parents and to especially get fathers involved in various and positive activities. In Kansas City, Missouri, the Reconnecting Education and DADS organization developed a specific reading program for fathers to use with their children. 
   The Kindering Center of Belleview, Washington, created a weekly support group for fathers of children with special needs. All over the country, schools are facilitating courses in responsible fatherhood, including education on child development, managing stress and good nutrition for their children and themselves. 
   I want to take just a minute here to acknowledge the important work of a similar organization in my own congressional district in Georgia. These men, these fathers are making a difference in the lives of our children by volunteering their time to improve the learning environment, not only for the children, but the many others who are within the school as well. They call it the DADS organization, DADS, whose acronym stands for Diverse and Dedicated Support, and it is a collective effort by fathers in my congressional district to serve as role models, not the athlete, not the rap guy, not the singer, not the superstars. The great role models for our young people need to be their fathers. By doing this today, this Congress is making this bold and much-needed statement. 
   This program places fathers of students in Clayton County, Georgia, middle schools to serve as hallway and classroom monitors to help with the discipline problems in our schools. Who better to do that, helping faculty to maintain order as students transition between classes throughout the day. This is where the violence sometimes starts. But with a parent there, particularly a father, a strong male presence, these men also serve as tutors when students need the help the most,  including Clayton County students to pursue their education and their dreams. 
   One self-employed volunteer at Lovejoy Middle School works while students are in class, and takes breaks throughout the day to monitor hallways and classrooms. That's a father. 
   Another volunteer, a wounded veteran from the war in Iraq, not only sacrificing his life in Iraq, where he was wounded, but he comes back home in Clayton County, Georgia, and walks the halls of Adamson Middle School with a cane. What a sight. These are heroes. No greater role model could we find than this wounded veteran who was wounded in Iraq, but comes back to help shape the lives of our young people in school. 
   He came so that he may assist the faculty in ensuring good discipline among the students. I am so honored, I am so full, I am overflowing up here today to know these fathers are making the ultimate difference in our communities and in my district. These men are not just fathers to individual students. They are dads to the children who lack the involvement of a father in their lives. The expansion of this program to elementary and high school underscores the success to reach out and encourage the involvement of fathers both inside the school and out. 
   In closing, I want to also note that many children from single-parent families are doing well. They are succeeding. But just think what it would be if they had both parents there, if they had been raised to be upstanding and successful members of our community. By passing this legislation today, we will show our support for the important roles that fathers, as well as mothers, play in preparing future generations in this country. 
   Honor thy father and thy mother so that thy days will be long in the land. We are doing that in Congress today, with extraordinary important, meaningful, and significant legislation.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, so much has been said, and I think we are very clear on the purpose of this bill and the importance of it as far as the war in Iraq is concerned. 
   But there is another aspect to this bill. There are literally 2 million children who are without health care. I want to at this point recognize and give due thanks and appreciation to Congressman John Murtha. No State has suffered because of the CHIP program as the children of Georgia's 273,000 children who would be without their health insurance if it were not for this war supplemental. 
   When the issue was taken to the White House, he said no. All hope was gone. I went to John Murtha, and John Murtha said, we will help you, and we will attach it to the Iraqi war supplemental. And he took it to Mr. Obey and to the Speaker. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, I make this plea to you, as the Scripture says clearly, suffer not the little children. This is the only hope for getting our insurance for our children in the SCHIP program. I urge you to not let the children of the United States of America go down the drain. Vote for the children of this Nation and for this bill. 
   Thank you, Mr. Murtha.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1591, the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans Health and Iraq Accountability Act of 2007. 
   There is no doubt that the conflict in Iraq is now a civil war marked primarily by sectarian violence, pitting Sunnis against Shias, with our troops caught in between. This bill is in fact the most responsible means to get our men and women out of this quagmire. 
   This legislation does not call for an immediate withdrawal. Instead, the legislation gives Iraq's government a timeline to achieve political and military progress, a timeline already set by President Bush and Iraqi leaders. If Iraq's government fails to meet the benchmarks outlined in the legislation, U.S. forces must be redeployed by March 2008. If the benchmarks are met by the deadlines established in the legislation, U.S. forces must be redeployed by September 2008. In doing this,  the legislation creates leverage that the U.S. can use to hold Iraq's government accountable and make it ultimately responsible for creating a political solution to this conflict that will result in American troops coming home. 
   I acknowledge that Congress should generally avoid trying to micro-manage a war. When decisions need to be made, there is no time for committee hearings or floor votes; the Commander-in-Chief may need to act immediately. However, this Administration, contrary to the facts of the situation on the ground, continues to claim that success is around the corner. The then-Republican Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee stated that ``in two or three months if this thing hasn't come to fruition and this level of violence is not under control'' then we would need to rethink our policy--he made that statement six months ago. 
   Some have suggested that any deadline is problematic. However, the Administration's original time estimate for the war was `six days, six weeks, no more than six months,' so a firm deadline 18 months from now, after four years of this open ended conflict, cannot create any more problems than we already have and in fact sets a date that we can begin to bring our troops home. 
   Mr. Speaker, today's legislation, for the first time in the four year history of this conflict, finally puts real pressure on the President and Iraq's leaders to bring this war to an end. This bill will begin a responsible process to 
   remove our forces from Iraq. 
   Foreign Policy Experts Support H.R. 1591. Former National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski has stated that ``only a political solution will end this war,'' and that the plan approved by the House today provides ``a means to hold the Iraqi government accountable for its performance by conditioning U.S. support to the meeting of benchmarks already endorsed by President Bush and Iraqi leaders.'' 
   Former Secretary of State Madeline Albright recently stated, ``the bottom line is that there must be a political settlement in Iraq that will end the civil war and reduce the level of insecurity to something that can be managed. With a settlement, we could withdraw gradually, with mission accomplished. Without a settlement, our troops can do little good and might as well come home sooner rather than later.'' 
   In a letter to House Appropriations Committee Chairman DAVID OBEY, former Congressman, 9/11 Commissioner and co-chair of the Iraq Study Group, Lee Hamilton said that ``a strategy of sustained pressure on the Iraqi government to meet benchmarks on national reconciliation, security, and improving the lives of the Iraqi people--backed by clear conditionality of U.S. support--has the best chance of advancing stability in Iraq.'' Congressman Hamilton added under the House proposal, ``the President retains his flexibility and authority as commander-in-chief.'' 
   High Ranking Military Officials have questioned our current policy in Iraq. 
   Former Supreme Allied Commander of NATO Gen. Wesley Clark (Ret.), former President of the National Defense University Lt Gen. Robert G. Gard, Jr. (Ret.), former Deputy Commander of Multinational Force Iraq Lt. Gen. Peter Chiarelli, current Deputy Commander of Multinational Force Iraq Lt. Gen. Raymond Odierno, and First Head of Training of Troops in Iraq Maj. Gen Paul Eaton (Ret.), have all pointed out that the solution in Iraq is primarily political, diplomatic and economic. 
   In an open letter to Congress, several retired generals and other high ranking military officials stated that the situation in Iraq is ``grave and deteriorating'' and that top military officials have ``consistently acknowledged that the repeated and lengthy deployments are straining'' the U.S. military. 
   General David Petraeus, the new Commander of Multinational Force Iraq, recently declared that ``there is no military solution to a problem like that in Iraq.'' 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

It is indeed an honor to stand before this House as a very proud member of our Foreign Affairs Committee under our distinguished Chairman Lantos and also to stand as our co-chair of our Democratic Group on National Security, as well as a voting member of the NATO parliament. 
   I have been to Iraq. I have been to Afghanistan, been to Pakistan, been to Kuwait. I have been there with our soldiers and our generals, and what I am about to say is based upon my experience in this whole arena. 
   Now, a lot has been said and I think it has been misguided, very unfortunate. So allow me, if I may, to state for the record exactly what this resolution does. 
   There has been talk up here about this resolution is here to cut funds. Nothing could be further from the truth. There is no Democrat in this Congress who would dare cut the funds from our soldiers who are in harm's way, and any Member that continues to say that is doing a disservice to this Congress and to the people of the United States. 
   This resolution does not say we are pulling out troops. We know the situation in the Middle East. We know this region is vital to our interests. The issue here is not pulling out troops. The issue here is a vote, up or down, on a policy that says two things, 57 words. Allow me to read them to you. 
   It says that the ``Congress and the American people will continue to support and protect the members of the United States Armed Forces who are serving or who have served bravely and honorably in Iraq.'' 
   Then it says: ``Congress disapproves of the decision of President George W. Bush announced on January 10, 2007, to deploy more than 20,000 additional United States combat troops to Iraq.'' 
   That is what it says. Those two things. Let us not mislead the American public anymore, certainly not on what we are going to vote on here today. I stand as a proud member who has cosponsored, who supports this resolution 100 percent because of four important reasons. 
   The first reason is that this 21,500-man escalation, number one, is deceiving in and of itself, when we know from the CBO account that it is not 21,500. It is more like 48,000 when you put the support troops involved. I am here to tell you, this is a dangerous strain on an already overstrained military. 
   Let me share with you what the National Security Advisory Group is saying. It says this: nearly all of the available combat units in the U.S. Army, Army National Guard, Marine Corps, have been used in the current operations. Every available combat brigade from the active duty Army has already been to Afghanistan or Iraq at least for a 12-month tour, and most are now in  their second or third tours of duty. There is a strain here, and some are on their fourth tours of duty. 
   Approximately 95 percent of the Army National Guard's combat battalions and special operations units have been mobilized since 9/11, and there is very little available combat capacity remaining in the Army National Guard. 
   All active duty Marine units are being used on a dangerously tight rotation schedule, but here is another. 
   We often forget that these are soldiers with families, with mothers, with fathers who are out there, separated from their children. Listen to this. This is why we are against this 21,500, or 48,000, surge. Between 2001 and 2004, divorce rates among active duty Army officers have tripled, and rates among Army enlisted soldiers have gone up. 
   Let me conclude by saying this: on the bleached bones of many great past nations and civilizations are written those pathetic words, ``too late.'' They moved too late. The American people are watching us and they are hoping and they are praying that we not move too late, and let us get our young men and women out of this crossfire of a civil war

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I want to commend the distinguished lady from California and our chairman, Mr. Frank, for doing an excellent job in leading us. 
   This amendment represents the ugly side of this Nation. This amendment is cruel, it is cold, it is calculating, and it is pandering to the schizophrenic dichotomy that has plagued this Nation since they first brought Africans on these shores from Africa, and that is the issue of race and poverty. 
   Let me tell you something, gentleman. Where were you? Where was your amendment when the Twin Towers were hit and people of New York suffered that catastrophe? There was no cry before we give them help, they have got to go get a job. Everybody was there and poured in help, as they should, the American way. 
   Where was your amendment down in Florida when the hurricanes hit down there? Nobody said, make them work before we help them. 
   Where were you last month when the hurricanes hit in Arkansas and then south Georgia, when the President went down and declared a disaster area? We helped those people. 
   My friend, let me remind you of something. I am going to tell you this story. It's a story about some folks that went down the road to Jericho, and this gentleman fell among thieves. He had disaster. He was hurting, and he was pained. Somebody walked by him and said nothing and did nothing. Another person walked by him and did nothing. 
   Your amendment is worse. You want to kick them and say get up and get a job. But that third man had compassion on him, and in his hour of need, picked him up, put him on his horse, took him to an inn and paid him to take care of him and house him. 
   That is what this amendment is doing. It is a Good Samaritan amendment. Yours is the Ugly American amendment, and it needs to be defeated.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. (SUPPORTING OUR TROOPS AND VETERANS HEALTH CARE -- (House of Representatives - March 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to talk about our supplemental, the bill that will be before us on this Thursday for a vote. 
   It is very important that the American people understand what it is we are doing. We have no choice in the matter. Yes, we are Democrats. We are in the leadership, and we must move an appropriations bill that will, in fact, first and foremost support our troops. 
   There is a lot that has been said on the other side of the aisle about the motivations about all that is here.     
   But there is another factor to this, Mr. Speaker, and that is the American people. The American people went to the polls in November, and they put Democrats in charge. They are the bosses. The bosses made a change of leadership. It is incumbent upon us as Democrats to lead. 
   I want to make sure that the American people understand what is in this bill and why it is important. First of all, this bill fully supports our troops and especially our veterans in the need of health care. It ensures that U.S. forces in the field have all of the funds and resources they require. There is no cutting of funds in this bill. 
   It directs more resources to the war against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan, where the terrorists are, where the person is hiding who attacked this country on 9/11. 
   I might add, Mr. Speaker, the people of Iraq did not attack us. The people who attacked us are on the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan. That is where this bill is putting more funds. 
   It improves the health care for returning service members and veterans that is woefully neglected and has been woefully neglected under this administration. There is no question about it. The news items come out daily. All we need to look at is the situation at Walter Reed. This legislation stops the closure of Walter Reed Hospital and pours $2.8 billion into veterans programs, more than has been done in recent times. 
   And, yes, it does what the majority of the American people want and begins to set a reasonable redeployment deadline schedule for us to come out of the civil war in Iraq so that we can better position ourselves to have a new Middle Eastern policy that reflects containment in that region and in a way that gets our young men and women out of the cross hairs of a civil war. 
   Let me just be specific, if I may, Mr. Speaker, on the health care. As I said, there is $2.8 billion for defense health care, which is $1.7 billion above what the President requested. It doesn't look like a cut to me. 
   Additional funds supporting new initiatives to enhance Medicaid services for Active Duty forces, to mobilized personnel and their family members, who have been woefully neglected. 
   This includes $450 million for post-traumatic stress disorder counseling. The psychiatrists have said on more than one occasion that there is a policy of sending our young men and women back into harm's way before they are mentally healed. There is a different way to determine whether you are mentally healed. It is more difficult than a physical wound that you can see. 
   Four hundred fifty million dollars for traumatic brain injury care and research. 
   Mr. Speaker, I just left Landstuhl Medical Center near Ramstein Air Base 4 weeks ago, and I saw firsthand the injuries to our soldiers. I was there. I talked with them. It was my third trip into that base. When you go to Landstuhl, you are seeing the injuries right as they come from downrange in Afghanistan and Iraq. So you are right there where it is, and I saw the need. That is why we put $730 million to prevent health care fee increases for our troops, $20 million to address the problems at Walter Reed, and $14 million in burn care. 
   Mr. Speaker, I know my time is up. I just want to make sure the American people know the Democrats are putting forward a plan that is truly responsive to our troops and to our veterans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Thank you so much. And thank you for those kind words you said about me. I appreciate it. And I would have called my mom, because she would have loved to hear those words, too. 
   You know, over this weekend, I did a couple of things when I was home. One was that I really got into the Constitution of the United States. I really got into that section in article I, section 8, that clearly gives us the exclusive responsibility as Congress to raise and support armies. 
   It is clear as a bell there. It gives it to us, it does not give it to the White House or the President or the executive branch. It gives it to Congress. And up until now we have failed the American people. The large measure of this--you touched upon it earlier, Mr. Ross, but this Republican-led Congress has just completely rolled over and allowed this President to fund this war on emergency supplementals, which means that we in Congress cannot conduct the constitutionally required oversight to do what the Constitution wanted us to do. 
   Now, that is why we are in this situation we are in, and I would like to talk for a moment on two points. 
   When I was home, the other thing I did was I got around and I had some great interaction with my constituents out in Cobb County and Douglas County and in Clayton County and in Henry County. We all had town hall meetings, we had my office open. I mean, we had Chamber of Commerce annual dinners. 
   That is a great opportunity for folks to just come up to you and let you know exactly how they feel. And I can tell you, Mr. Ross, they are proud to see us on this floor, offering this bill. This is not just a resolution that is nonbinding. We are going to have those that voice our opinion about this war, they are going to be voted on up or down. 
   Everybody knows my personal feelings about the mistake of this surge, but this resolution that we have carries a tremendous amount of weight. That is why I care about it so much. And I want to share with the American people exactly what it is in this resolution that we are doing and why it is needed and why, finally, this resolution provides a direct link and connection with what the Founding Fathers wrote in article I, section 8, of the Constitution over 200 years ago that we have the exclusive right to determine how we will manage. 
   Now, why do we need that? 
   The other thing I did over this weekend was, I read my home newspaper, the Atlanta Journal Constitution. And in there there was an extraordinary article by the Associated Press that I would like to make a part of this RECORD because this article points out the very need for this measure that we in the Blue Dog Coalition are pushing. 
   This article in the Atlanta Journal Constitution was written John Heilprin with the Associated Press. The title of it was this: Contractors Investigated After Army Fraud Alleged. Just listen to this, America. ``From high dollar fraud to conspiracy to bribery and bid-rigging, Army investigators have opened up to 50 criminal probes involving battlefield contractors in the war in Iraq and the U.S. fight against terrorism.''     
   What an opening sentence, what a declarative issue we have here. 
   It goes on to say, senior contracting officials, government employees, residents of other countries, and in some cases U.S. military personnel themselves have been implicated in millions of dollars of fraud allegations. ``All of these involve operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and Kuwait,'' Chris Grey, a spokesman for the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command, confirmed just this past Saturday. ``The agents will pursue leads into truth wherever it takes us. We take this very seriously.'' 
   Here is the point. Battlefield contractors have been implicated in allegations of fraud and abuse since the United States invaded Iraq in the spring of 2003. Any wonder why this has happened? Because the Congress did not apply the oversight, because this Republican Congress just simply rubber-stamped everything. 
   The Special Inspector General's Office, focusing solely on reconstruction spending, has developed cases that have led to four criminal convictions. The problems stem in part from the Pentagon's struggle to get a handle on the unprecedented number of contractors now helping run the Nation's wars, and these contractors are used in battle zones to do nearly everything but fight. But they can war-profiteer, they can commit fraud, they can commit bribery, and they can abuse the taxpayers' money on the backs of our good, brave soldiers that are putting their lives on the line for much less than what these contractors are making. 
   They run the cafeterias, the laundries for the troops. They move supplies, run communication systems and repair weapons systems. 
   Special agents from the Army's Major Procurement Fraud Unit were recently dispatched to Iraq, Afghanistan and Kuwait where they are working closely and sharing information. One case involves an Army chief warrant officer accused of taking $50,000 in bribes to steer a contract for paper products and plastic flatware away from a government contractor to a Kuwaiti company, according to an indictment. 
   The Government Accountability Office reported in December that the military has been losing millions of dollars, and contractors are being investigated because it cannot monitor industry workers in far-flung locations. It summarizes this way: Commanders are often unsure how many contractors even use their bases or even require the food and housing protection, according to one report. One Army official quoted said, ``The service estimates losing $43 million each year just on free meals that are provided.'' That is why this bill is important. 
   Let me just mention specifically how this bill will help prevent and address this glaring situation that was reported in the Atlanta Journal Constitution by the Associated Press, John Heilprin, who I commend for doing an excellent job. Our bill will require, within 30 days of passage, that every 90 days hereafter the Department of Defense Inspector General and the Special Inspector General for Iraqi Reconstruction shall prepare and transmit to Congress an unclassified report, but with a classified annex, if necessary, that will contain the following: 
   One, a detailed accounting of how military and reconstruction funds in Iraq have been spent thus far; 
   Two, a detailed accounting of the types and terms of contracts awarded on behalf of the United States, including the methods by which such contracts were awarded and contractors selected; 
   Three, it will require a description of efforts to obtain support and assistance from other countries during the rehabilitation of Iraq; 
   Four, an assessment of what additional funding is needed to complete military operations and reconstruction efforts in Iraq, including a plan for security of Iraq, a detailed plan for how any future funds will be spent, and a statement of how those funds will advance the interests of the United States in Iraq. 
   If either inspector general fails to submit a quarterly report, the Government Accountability Office shall conduct an audit and report to Congress. Sanctions will be imposed against contractors who have engaged in fraud or abuse or war profiteering, and we will create the Truman Committee that Mr. Chandler spoke to earlier. 
   Funding requests for operations in Iraqi Freedom in fiscal year 2008 and  beyond must come through the regular appropriations process and not through these emergency supplementals that are explicitly designed to bypass oversight. That is why we have the problems we have here; and also, that is why there was not enough money put in the budget when we sent our Armed Forces over there 3 years ago, as you recall, the news reports where many of our soldiers were digging in dung heaps and landfills trying to get body armor for them. 
   No. No more. This Blue Dog resolution addresses that, and I would expect an extraordinarily large vote in getting it passed. 
   And it is so good to be on the floor with my good friend, Mr. Ross, and also my good friend, Mr. Israel from New York, who we serve together, both as cochairs on our Democratic Group on National Security. And we have been addressing these issues. So it is just a pleasure to be on the floor with you. I hope with this story and this Associated Press Atlanta Journal Constitution report, it will show the American people why we need the specific legislation and the importance in getting some accountability passed concerning our war funding.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. I want to build on the point that my good friend from New York (Mr. Israel) talked about. 
   It was very important when James Madison wrote into the Constitution the words, ``Raise and support the Army is the exclusive domain of the Members of Congress.''     
   There was a reason for that. The reason was because Members of Congress, unlike the President, unlike the Senate, my good friends in the Senate, it is the Members of Congress that are closest to the people. Every other year we must run, and that is why they put it in there that if we are going to war, yes, we will spread this authority, some of that as Commander in Chief to the executive branch, but we must have a check and a balance. They put that in the bosom of the Congress, which has to go back before the people every other year and be accountable. 
   I am here to tell you the people of the United States are looking to this Congress. They are looking for us to bring some accountability to it. They are looking for us to be fair and understand what is at the core of this. 
   You know what is at the core of this is the soldier. When is somebody going to look at this war from the standpoint of that soldier that we are sending to Iraq now and placing in the cross hairs of a civil war, a questionable gambit at best? 
   The President of the United States does not have to run again. He can have all the surges he wants. He can do everything he wants. His concern now is building his legacy. He has his right to do whatever he wants to do, but the one thing he does not have to do, he does not have to go and face the American people again. We do. That is why Madison gave us the arbitrary decision to raise and support the military. 
   So when the Bush administration made the decision to use large numbers of these private contractors that were talked about on the battlefield in Iraq, it now has had somewhat of a perverse effect of incentivizing highly trained special operation force personnel to leave the Armed Forces. They are there voluntarily, in order to work as some of these contractors for much higher pay. 
   There is so much just built into this for war profiteering, but here is a statistic that we have got to be concerned about. We have got to look at this hardship on the soldier. These are not 21,500 other soldiers just sitting over there waiting. These soldiers are going, many of them, on their third and fourth tour of duties. We have a situation where we are running the military in the ground, and no more pointed example of that is this startling, disturbing and tragic information that has been handed to me by the National Security Advisory Group. Listen to this: 
   Between 2001 and 2004, divorce rates among active duty Army officers tripled and rates among Army enlisted soldiers grew, divorce rates by 50 percent, as deployments lengthened and with increased frequency as they are doing now. These divorce rates have served to underscore the severity of the strains on the active duty personnel and their families, and similarly, incidents of domestic violence increased over the same period. There is wear and tear not just on the equipment that we talked about, not just on not having the bulletproof vests or the Humvees riding around; it is wear and tear on the hearts and souls of our soldiers. It is too much of a strain, and we have got to correct this situation. 
   These and other warning signs have caused some commanders to fear that personnel who were willing to undertake successive deployments as part of, and they use these words, part of the surge cannot sustain this tempo of operations over the long term. If they do so, it will be at the adverse impact on their families. 
   How much more do we want to ask of our soldiers? I would tell you one thing, this Blue Dog resolution is dedicated to giving our soldiers the respect that they are due. We are going to make sure that the money we appropriate in here goes to them, and we are going to make doubly sure that we can end this situation in Iraq quickly and bring our soldiers home to their families.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. The final analysis of what we are saying is what the American people spoke to in November. They spoke to warning this Congress to stand up and demand accountability and be good stewards of their tax dollars, and that is the core of our Blue Dog resolution. I believe that and I hope that within the next couple of months we will have this resolution passed. 
   Might I ask for the benefit of our audience if I could ask Mr. Ross if we could give the number of our House Resolution in the event that there might be some individuals who are in the C-SPAN audience who might want to give us a little helping hand here to help us get this bill passed.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Let me first say, Chairman Frank, how much we all appreciate the outstanding job you have been doing on this issue. 
   Chairman Frank, it's very important that as we consider this financial package, we make sure we do everything we possibly can to reduce the number of foreclosures and keep families in their homes. We are losing 6,300 foreclosures every single day. In this regard, I have been working on, and I presented to you a four-point package to reach this goal. At this time, I certainly want to thank my collaborator, Dr. James Galbraith from the University of Texas, for his advice on this. 
   Essentially, what we want to do is really, quite honestly, in the spirit of our great Treasury Secretary, Alexander Hamilton, for I believe we need to give the Treasury Secretary efficient tools so that he will be able to allow us to be able to use a program such as our HOPE for Homeowners program to make sure that we are doing everything we do as he purchases these assets to put the ingredients in place that we can bring down these foreclosures and keep individuals in their homes, and I have presented this four-point plan to you.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Thank you very much. It is always a pleasure to come down and to be able to communicate with the American people with my distinguished members of our Blue Dog Coalition. What I would like to do as a part of this discussion tonight is to certainly communicate why we need to institute and maintain what we have instituted or reinstituted, and that is PAYGO, to pay our bills as we go. 
   Let me see if I can just set the stage to show the American people just how precarious a position we are in both from a national security standpoint as well as an economic security standpoint. As we stand right now, the national debt is a staggering $9.13 trillion. That is almost $10 trillion of national debt. And just to show you how serious this is, we are accumulating this debt at an astounding rate of $1.4 billion every single day. That amounts to nearly $10 billion every week that we are adding to our national debt. 
   And then we compound that. This debt is not free. We must pay interest on this debt. And the interest on this debt last year alone was an astounding $430 billion. So I can put that in perspective. Just the interest that we pay for borrowing this money is four times more than what we pay for education, for the health of our children, for our veterans and homeland security combined. Folks, that's mighty, mighty dangerous ground for this country to be on. That is one of the foremost reasons why we must change this direction, or else we are going off the cliff. And this is something that is of very, very much concern to Democrats, I think to some Republicans as well, and most assuredly, to our Blue Dog Coalition that is providing the leadership here so that we can be responsible. 
   Now let me just add another point. This money that we are borrowing is broken down into two groups. Of the $9.13 trillion in debt, about $5.1 trillion of that is what we call the public debt. The other $4 trillion is debt that we  incur through our private means, through borrowing from Social Security and other government agencies. But let's just look at that public debt for a moment because the other reason that this is so much of a great concern is the threat to our national security. Because, ladies and gentlemen, 45 percent of our public debt is being borrowed from foreign governments, and not just any foreign government. We are borrowing this money from places like China. They have $500 billion of our debt. Japan has $601 billion of our debt. And then Saudi Arabia and the oil-producing OPEC nations have $153 billion in debt. And then if we go to places like Russia, $43 billion, and to Korea, $42 billion. And I think you are getting the picture, ladies and gentlemen. These are countries that we have got to deal with firmly. It is undermining our security to have our debt in the hands of these countries because he who controls your debt controls you and your future. And it begins to weaken our leverage in dealing on the international stage. 
   Let me just give you one example. About 3 or 4 weeks ago, our President Bush went over to Saudi Arabia, yes, to really try to do something about the high price of gasoline that my dear friends on the other side have just talked about a few moments ago. But here is the President going to Saudi Arabia begging hat in hand basically to ask the Saudis to increase their oil output. Keep in mind that it only costs the Saudis $2 a barrel to get that oil out of the ground. And now it's going for what, $120, $130 a barrel? But the Saudis said ``no.'' In the back of their minds I am sure they were saying, we got your oil, and we got your debt. 
   That's why I'm saying that this debt situation is placing our Nation in a terribly precarious situation from an economic security standpoint as well as a national security standpoint. And we have got to change that. 
   And finally, I want to just add this one point, too, because this business of continually not only having this huge debt, which we've got to saddle on the backs of our grandchildren and other generations, is not fair to them. But not only that, but the monies that we are spending in Iraq and in Afghanistan are being borrowed from China and Japan. 
   Finally, on the foreign standpoint, it is very important to really dramatize the seriousness of this debt. Over the last 8 years, since 2001, we have borrowed under this President and this Congress, he couldn't have done it by himself, more money from foreign governments than we have borrowed in the previous 224 years of our existence. That's right, ladies and gentlemen. We have borrowed more money under the Bush administration and under this last 7 years of Congress than we have done in the previous 42 administrations of this country. That is numbing. It is mind-boggling. This is a terrible situation for us to be in. This is the reason why we have got no choice in this matter. We've got to pay our bills. 
   And it is a great testimony to the leadership of the Blue Dogs and certainly the leadership of the Democratic party in this Congress that we have indeed instituted pay-as-you-go so that we can have both economic security as well as national security. The American people deserve no less.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Thank you very much, Mr. Boyd. 
   I want to go back and complement what you are saying because you are hitting it from the domestic side in terms of our jobs. I want to complement that because I serve on the Foreign Affairs Committee, as you know. In addition to that, I serve on the Middle East Subcommittee and am vice chairman of the Subcommittee on International Trade, Nuclear Proliferation and Terrorism, and I am a sitting member of NATO's Parliamentary Assembly. I mention those committees that I serve on because it puts me in a pretty good position as we get around the world to really focus on this other side as to why we have to pay this debt down. We don't have all of the answers, but it is incumbent upon us to start this ball rolling. The very future of our country is at stake. 
   In this past winter's meeting when we were at NATO, word came out that a Chinese lawmaker, and incidentally, we are borrowing $500 billion from the Chinese, he stands up and he says I think we ought to now start buying euros instead of dollars, and the stock market plunged 300 points. That is what I am talking about in terms of our own national security, the threat that we have if we do not take care of this debt, particularly in the hands of foreign countries. 
   The other point is in Russia, for example, it is tied into our failure to deal with this debt, it is tied into our energy dependence. And $46 billion of our debt is in the hands of Russia whom we are having a difficult time with. Any reason why? And they are now Iran's number one buddy. And dig this, Mr. Boyd, this is the interesting point: 45 percent of all of the natural gas reserves are controlled by Russia and Iran. And they hold our debt. 
   When you combine that with the $153 billion that the OPEC countries hold, and the treatment that they gave our President when he went there and asked for them to increase their oil output and they said no. The comment was we control your oil and we control your debt. 
   The point I am getting at is this, that our failure to pay down this debt will have a devastating impact on the future of our country and our ability to have the leverage we need to survive on the world stage. 
   I just wanted to make that point from the foreign affairs perspective on why we have to put these PAYGO rules in and make them stick.

I know I along with other Members of Congress and our entourage will be going over to Europe and into the Middle East to see firsthand about our troops, and I can't think of a better way to celebrate and commemorate Memorial Day than to be over with our troops as they are in harm's way. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, let me rise to give recognition to an extraordinary American and Georgian and a constituent in my district, in the 13th District of Georgia, and that is Pastor Kenneth E. Marcus, who is now celebrating his 20th anniversary as pastor of the Turner Chapel AME Church in Marietta, Georgia, in Cobb County, in the heart of my district. Let me just say a few words about this outstanding individual. 
   Reverend Marcus was born in Trinidad in the West Indies. He came to this country in 1975. Then he went to Morris Brown College and got his bachelor's degree from Atlanta University. And, Madam Speaker, it was there as a college student that Reverend Marcus received the word and the call from God to preach. He then immediately went to Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, where he received his master's degree in divinity. And he started off his career in Athens as his first assignment at the St. Luke/Nimno Circuit in Athens, Georgia. Then he moved on to the Greater Smith Chapel AME in Atlanta, Georgia. And then in 1988 this extraordinary Georgian Reverend Kenneth E. Marcus was appointed pastor of the Turner Chapel AME Church in Marietta, Georgia. 
   And let me just say, Madam Speaker, to show you the significance of this individual, when he was appointed there at Turner Chapel in 1988, there were just 150 members of that church, and now today, just 20 years later, that church has a membership of over 6,000 people. That in and of itself is testimony to the great leadership and the contribution of this outstanding pastor. And this church that he started, he started in a high school gymnasium in Cobb County, and now today Turner Chapel is in an extraordinary cathedral, a modern edifice of extraordinary magnitude which now seats 3,000 members. This is just the testimony of this great, great pastor. 
   They have over 100 ministries that are serving us throughout Georgia and in some parts of this Nation. And we are so proud of Reverend Kenneth E.  Marcus on his 20th anniversary as the pastor of Turner Chapel AME Church in Marietta. 
   But he did not do that alone. With God's help, God provided him with an extraordinary partner in Ms. Cassandra Young Marcus, who not only is his partner and his wife but is also the assistant pastor at Turner Chapel. What a great story, what a great American story of achievement and attainment, and we are so proud to, in this Congress, celebrate and recognize his 20 years of service. 
   You know, Madam Speaker, God calls people for various purposes, and God each Sunday calls this individual, Reverend Kenneth E. Marcus, and gives him utterance to speak boldly as he ought to speak about the mysteries of the Gospel. And he does it with boldness and vision and inspiration each Sunday. 
   And in conclusion, when you talk about greatness, Madam Speaker, and in this measure we are talking about a great man in Reverend Marcus, that greatness is measured by three people that I would like to mention. When the word ``greatness'' or what it means to be a great person was put to the great philosopher Aristotle, he said in order to be great, you have to, first of all, ``know thyself.'' Well, Reverend Marcus not only knows himself but he knows whose he is as well. 
   And Marcus Aurelius, the great Roman general, said in order to be great, you need to have discipline. But just a measure of moving a church from 150 parishioners to 6,000 is that. 
   And then, finally, when the question was put to the great Messiah, Jesus Christ, Jesus said in order to be great and certainly a great minister, you must, first of all, sacrifice yourself. And this is a story of a great man who has sacrificed himself so that the world can be a better place. 
   It is with great pride that this Congress of the United States commemorates and recognizes Pastor Marcus on his 20th anniversary as the pastor of Turner Chapel AME Church in Marietta, Georgia.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Thank you very much, Mr. Ross. As always, it is indeed a pleasure to be with you on this occasion. 
   I want to talk about two areas, the debt, and, of course the big elephant in the room which all of America is concerned about, the situation in Iraq and Iraq accountability. 
   I happen to serve on the Financial Services Committee and on the Foreign Affairs Committee, so in terms of foreign policy and in terms of our finances, those are the two major critical cross-sections we are in at this point. 
   Concerning the debt, it is very important that we point out, Mr. Ross, that the fastest growing area in our budget is the interest that we are paying on this debt, which is more than what we are spending combined for education, the environment and for veterans affairs. 
   As we segue that into our international situation, when you look at the debt that we have gotten into as a result of the carelessness and the ineffective, inefficient foreign policy as it relates to our debt; for example, under this President and under this previous Republican-controlled Congress, this country has borrowed more money from foreign governments than all of the preceding past Presidents have done since 1789, since the foundation of this country. It has placed us in a very perilous position. And we are fighting this war in Iraq and Afghanistan on borrowed money that our children will have to pay back and the children of our soldiers will have to pay back. 
   Mr. Ross, what is on the minds of the American people is accountability in Iraq. It is very important that we mention two major bills that we are moving in that direction. First is our own troop readiness and Iraqi accountability bill that passed this House, the basic framework of which after the President vetoed the first go around is now in the bill we passed last week, and it is in the conference report that we hope we will be sending back. It is important that the American people understand what the Democrats have put forward in this measure. 
   Our other bill is the Accountability Act, in terms of financial accountability, that we in the Blue Dog Coalition of Democrats have put forward to bring some fiscal responsibility and soundness and transparency to the moneys that we are spending in Iraq and Afghanistan. We know about the Halliburtons, we know about all the war profiteering. We hear about that in the news accounts. 
   It is our bill that we are pushing forward that will give some transparency and accountability. Two important facts that I think the American people need to know about that bill is that, one, it will require that the Inspector General from both the Defense Department over at the Pentagon, will have to come before this Congress quarterly to explain and to account for the moneys that are spent on that basis, as well as the Inspector General from the rebuilding program in Iraq, where so much loss of funds, unaccountability, outright stealing and theft is going on of the taxpayers' money. So we are bringing accountability to that. 
   But we also have got to do more, and that is what is contained in the conference report that we are sending to the President. Not only do we have benchmarks, but there must be accountability to the Iraqi people. They have this opportunity and they must step up to the plate to assume their end of the bargain. There is a government in place, and the benchmarks we have put in, there is no better way to do that. 
   Now, Mr. Ross, I think much has been said about Congress and the role that we have to play in foreign policy. Unfortunately, this President has said time and time again that he is in control of foreign policy; that he is the Commander in Chief, and that the Congress is just here to do pretty much as he wants us to do. And for 5 years, for the first 5 years, that happened, where this Congress just rolled over and gave the President everything that he wants. 
   When we had that change in November and the people went to the polls to put Democrats in charge, they wanted to see a change in direction, and the Democrats are giving the change in direction in the bills that we have sent forward to the President. 
   You talk about fiscal accountability. Yes, indeed, we have that in there. We have put more money in this budget for our troops, $4 billion more, than the President has asked for. But it is so important also that we have accountability when the money gets over, to make sure that the Iraqi people understand, we don't have an endless supply of money to go down over into Iraq, and most certainly we do not have an endless supply of the precious blood and the lives of our soldiers to continually be going down the pike in the Iraqi situation. The American people are saying this situation has to end. We must get our men and women in uniform out of the middle of the crosshairs of what is a civil war. 
   Madam Speaker, we realize that we are in this because of mistakes. More importantly, Mr. Ross, when you talk about accountability, it is important that we realize now that not only have mistakes been made, but we got into Iraq based on not just bad intelligence, but warped intelligence, and we got in there on deceit and lies. All of that is there now. 
   It is very important for us if we want to effectively be able to determine how to get out of Iraq, we must be honest about how we got into Iraq. So it is very important that we do that. 
   The American patience is running out on those two measures of Iraqi accountability, in terms of the money we are spending, in terms of the benchmarks we have put into this effort, and for the transparency that we put in our bill. We, as Democrats, are being very responsive. 
   We do have security in that region. We are not going to abandon our troops, but we are going to get them out of the crosshairs of this civil war and get into a position of containment. That is the direction that we have to go in as we formulate a new, much more effective foreign policy in the Middle East.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Ross. 
   I will try to sum up what we have done this evening. It is very important, as the American people have followed this process, have seen us with the legislative process at work, not only in terms of debating the issue, but they have also witnessed how we are putting this, hopefully, this final piece together that the President will sign. 
   First of all, just to wrap up, we have made concessions with the President on the issues that he was concerned about. The timelines, have, indeed, been removed. Those were his major objections on it. So we have compromised on that point. 
   But we also had, then, accountability, and that's what the American people want. They want to make sure that we have accountability in this. Mr. Thompson from California has played a very leading role in this, and it was so good to have him on the floor talking about it. Mr. Ike Skelton, who is the chairman of our Armed Services Committee, has incorporated all of the major points of financial accountability to get out fraud and waste, to bring in the Defense Department's investigators to report to us on each of these areas, on a 6-month basis, to show us how the money is being spent. 
   All of those things are now in this package, and the benchmarks are in, the benchmarks. So we can hold the Iraqi people to, and say, these are things that must be accomplished, as we go forward. If you don't hold their feet to the fire, if you don't put pressure there, there is no accountability. So we are going to have them on security. 
   We are going to have them where they are going to reach the deal of how, which is at the bottom of the whole situation, is oil, and how they are to divide the oil revenue between the Kurds, between the Sunnis and between the Shias. We have got this in there for benchmarks. 
   The other thing we have in there is funds for the troops, the Humvee protection, the body armor production. Never again will they go in Humvees and have to write back to mom and dad to give them the metals. They are over there fighting for the United States of America. It is our constitutional responsibility as the Congress of the United States to raise and support the military. That's in article 1, section 6 of the Constitution for our duty. This Congress is able to do that in this. 
   Finally, what is so important, we are having in this measure true emergency measures like the children's health program, in which we have $349 million now for that shortfall to help with the SCHIP program, for that lower-income program. 
   Many of those children, incidentally, Mr. Ross, are children of some of these servicemen who are serving in Iraq, because their income level falls too low for Medicaid, yet not high enough to be able to afford the regular practice. The money is in here for the veterans to make sure the Walter Reed situation doesn't happen again. That's what's so important. That's what the American people want. 
   In this measure we have got that, and then plus $2.4 billion more than what the President asks for the troops. But we have got the accountability in, and it's geared to moving us in a way to get us out of the crosshairs of this civil war and in this occupation in Iraq so that we can strengthen our military and put the resources in Afghanistan and Pakistan where we know al Qaeda is and allow the Iraqi people to manifest themselves and solve this civil war among themselves. 
   Thank you. It has been wonderful being with you and being a part of our Blue Dog coalition this evening.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. (JOHN R. JUSTICE PROSECUTORS AND DEFENDERS INCENTIVE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I thank very much Chairman Conyers. This is indeed a great moment. It is a great time, and I appreciate the leadership that you provide as chairman of the committee and all of our colleagues. 
   This is definitely a bipartisan effort to really deal with one of the most pressing issues facing our country today, Madam Speaker. I cannot think of a more significant thing we can do to make the essence of this country a reality for all. For at the cornerstone of America are these words: wisdom and justice and fairness and moderation. That is what makes this country great. 
   And at the cornerstone of that is to be able to have, when you come before the bar of justice, that justice is indeed blind and that everyone will be able to receive justice in a fair way. Regardless of whether or not you are a wealthy person or if you are a poor person, one thing is important: you are an American citizen and you deserve to make sure that you have fairness and justice and integrity when you come before the criminal justice system. 
   Unfortunately, now, Madam Speaker, that is not the case. For in all too many cases, when it comes down to public defenders and prosecutors, that is not the case because of the strains and the interplay of our economic system and the pressures that the marketplace has on that. 
   But what I am talking about is this, that right now the cost of living has gone up 28 percent, but the costs of tuition for 3 years in law school has gone up 167 percent. So that the average cost now per year for a student to go to law school is $50,000 a year. For 3 years, that's $150,000. 
   So, Madam Speaker, what I am saying is when that individual gets out of  school he has to go into a marketplace where the private economy is willing to pay him an average now of $110,000, and in some markets in this country, such as New York or California and even in my home State of Georgia in Atlanta, beginning law school students going into the private sector can earn as much as $160,000 a year. But if you're a public defender, if you're a prosecutor, the average starting salary is just $43,000. 
   That is the crux of the problem, and that's why we have this bill, Madam Speaker, so that we can bring some equity to the playing field; so that we will be able to provide law students with the opportunity to help them with their loan repayment; so that we can have a partial loan forgiveness, not total. 
   This package that we're offering would give an individual up to $10,000 from the Federal Government to help offset his loans, and he must serve in the public sector for 3 years. But there's also contingent in our bill that with agreement with the employer if he wants to extend that after priority has been given to those that come in at 3 years first, that he will be able to extend it for 3 more years. So the maximum they can get is $60,000. 
   No, this will not solve the problem, Madam Speaker, but this is a very complex problem. But there are young people that understand the virtues and the need of this country to serve in the public arena, and we need those bright and talented individuals to be able to come into this arena, and this is a small incentive package for which we give. 
   As my colleague pointed out, this amounts to $25 million a year up to 6 years. It is a small gesture, but it is a meaningful investment because otherwise what we have is today where many innocent people are languishing in jails because we are not addressing this issue and many who are criminals are going free. 
   And that's why for the last 2 years, Madam Speaker, I have been pushing and working on this bill because, at the crux of it all, as I said, America is great because of many things, but paramount is justice, it is wisdom and it is moderation. That's in our flag, that's in our motto, and that's what is in this bill. 
   This bill is a companion bill. We have the Senate who has already moved on this in a bipartisan way under the leadership of Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois, their distinguished majority whip, and we're very proud. 
   So I am very proud for this moment at this time in this House of Representatives for us to move forthright and to be able to bring some help to our college law students and especially into the private sector and to those individuals who cannot afford a high-priced attorney but have to rely on a public defender. 
   Madam Speaker, don't these individuals deserve to be able to have the best legal representation? Yes, they do, and that's why this bill is important and that's why I commend this to the full House of Representatives, and I am sure we will have a strong bipartisan vote for it. 
   I thank the chairman and thank my colleagues, and I urge your passage of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Thank you very much. It is certainly a pleasure to be with both the gentleman from Louisiana, and for you as well, Mr. Melancon. 
   This is definitely a major, major priority as far as the future of this country is concerned. Our energy policy is interwoven directly into our vital national security. There is no question about it. 
   We have, for the past 50 years, progressively gotten more and more dependent on oil from the Middle East. There is a reason why Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, those Middle Eastern countries are so vital. 
   It is so important for us to try to hopefully find a way in which we can get peace in that region. We don't know the answer to all of this; it is largely going to be up to those Middle Eastern countries. But we are so directly tied to the future stability of that region, largely because of one thing, that is, our energy. And that has been a mistake, that we are tied to our future energy needs to the most unstable region in the world. And we now need to move very rapidly to excise ourselves from that. 
   The other reason why our energy policy is so vital and so important, and again, part and parcel of our national security, is because of global warming. Make no mistake about it, there may be differing opinions about global warming, there may be differing opinions about climate change, but one thing is certain, the facts do not lie. This Earth is getting warmer by the day, by the year. 
   Scientists have pointed out that the Earth's climate is increasing in warmth at a rate of one-tenth of a degree in each of the previous decades.     
   That may sound like a little. But when you look at just 2 degrees since the turn of the century, that is a major, major fact; the fact of dependency on oil in the Middle East, the most unstable region, the fact that we are experiencing the damage of global warming. The reason for the global warming is the excretion of carbon dioxides into the air, and that gives us the greenhouse effect. 
   So on those two points, we have no choice but to proceed directly ahead and provide the kind of sterling leadership this Nation deserves, as you so aptly pointed out, Mr. Matheson, in a very responsible way, in which both sides of the aisle can come together. Everybody can come together and understand that this is not a Republican issue. This is not a Democratic issue. This is an issue for the future of the American people and the people of the world.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Matheson, I would like to maybe pick up on a point you made on the diversity and alternative sources of energy. Let's just take one for a few moments and put this one on the table, because I truly believe that this is one of the major directions we are going to have to go in. 
   As you know, one of the problems with our dependence on oil and petroleum, aside from the Middle East and the political volatility there and the unstableness that is there, even if we had and were able to produce some of this oil on our own here, we have a refining problem. We are very short in our refining capacity. 
   It has been almost a quarter of a century since we even built a new refinery. There are reasons for that, environmental, people don't want them around, but they are not there. But that is another reason. 
   So, one of my interesting visits not long ago was to go down to South America, to Brazil, to visit Brazil. One of the reasons I wanted to go to Brazil was because I wanted to find out what they were doing and how they were doing it with their energy problem. 
   Here is one salient fact: Brazil and Argentina both are not dependent upon the Middle East for oil. They have moved very rapidly and are setting the curve for ethanol production. 
   Now, 85 percent of their automobiles are ``flex'' automobiles, in other words, running on a combination of mostly ethanol made from sugar cane. 
   If Brazil can do those two things, get clean energy, get ethanol, make it from a grown product that continually renews itself, and at the same time not be dependent on oil from the Middle East, surely we can learn something from what is going on in Brazil. And I did. A group of us went down to Brazil. We spent a lot of time down there. We talked to people and we found out some things there. 
   I believe, quite honestly, a major feature, not all of it, but a major feature of our way out and our way forward in becoming energy independent rests in the production in this country of ethanol. 
   Again, we have got to be very responsible as we move forward with ethanol production. We have got to have a level of moderation with it and we can't go overboard with it. It is very interesting that President Bush in his State of the Union, if you recall when he was talking about energy, mentioned it. He said we can solve our problem with ethanol made from corn, and he put some large figure out there. 
   But if we even just went with that, it would put such downward pressure on our food stock, on our cost of beef and poultry and chicken and pork, who feed off of corn. Corn cannot do it alone. So it has to be a dual approach with cellulosic, which is made out of pine straw and pine trees and wood chips and switch grass, which we have plenty of. 
   The point that I am making is we can move rapidly here, and we are. As a part of our farm bill that we will be marking up this week, that we are in the process of marking up, we and the Democrats and Blue Dogs, who make up a large part of the Agriculture Committee, are in the leadership on this, and it is one of the areas in which all of us can be very proud. But certainly within our Blue Dog Coalition, we are providing the leadership on finding a way out of our energy dependence, and we are doing it through our farm bill. 
   Just think, that we can grow our way out of dependence on oil in the Middle East. We have got all of it right here in this country, and I think getting the ethanol plants moving, using corn where we can, but there is a certain limit we have to have there, but use these other means of cellulosity, the wood chips, and putting the incentives in this package, as we have in the farm bill to explore and develop ethanol plants and plants of operation.     
   Also, we have to do it near the points of distribution. And in the process of creating this new industry, we create jobs when we create a clean energy source and that is one of the major steps I believe for us as we move towards energy independence.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. I think you made a significant statement there, Mr. Matheson, that when you are in a deep hole, the first thing you do is stop digging. 
   I want to very, very briefly share, and I am sure there are some American people who are watching our discussion this evening, on just how serious a situation we are in. I talked about instability in the Middle East and our dependence upon oil. 
   Clearly there are two known facts. Right now, 42 percent of all of the known oil reserves rest under the basin in the Middle East, in Iraq, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. That is nearly half of all of the available oil supplies that we know of in the Earth. And it is not renewable. It doesn't renew itself. Eventually at some point oil is going to run out. 
   When I was at NATO, and we had a meeting over in Paris this past winter, our winter NATO meetings, a question was put to a noted economist, John Malone, and he made a profound statement. He said we didn't leave the stone age because we ran out of stone; nor will we leave the oil age because we have run out of oil. What he said was that civilization as we know it could very well run out before the oil runs out with the rapid rate we are going with the damage that oil-driven energy sources around the world are causing with the greenhouse effects.  
   I thought it would be very interesting to share with the American people just how serious this is given the fact that oil is not a renewable source of energy, given the fact that almost half of it is in a very unstable region, and much of the world is still depending upon. But according to the Energy Information Administration, here are some startling facts. They say that world daily oil consumption is projected to grow by 1.4 million barrels this year in 2007 and by 1.6 million barrels in 2008. That is daily oil consumption. You talk about running out with that rapid rate, and each year it goes up. In addition, the EIA projects a steady increase in natural gas and electric use in the United States which will create upward pressure on prices. This doesn't paint a very good picture. 
   And then it goes on to say that almost all scientists agree that the Earth's climate is rapidly changing and getting warmer, having increased by 2.6 degrees Fahrenheit since the turn of the century. Now as I mentioned earlier, on the surface of it, 2.6 doesn't seem like much, but it is major. The Earth's global average temperature is now approaching or possibly has passed, according to this report, the warmest experience since human civilization began over 12,000 years ago. Now it is approaching the warmest it has ever been in the history of mankind. Global warming is a fact. Climate change is a fact. 
   And it goes on to say that over the past 150 years, measured carbon dioxide concentrations have risen by more than one-third. The question is not whether greenhouse gases will result in climate change, but rather the magnitude, the speed, and the geographic details and the likelihood of impacts stemming from this trend. 
   I am not painting a gloom and doom picture here. We are talking about facts so we can get a sense, a greater sense of urgency in this Congress and in the world. So many places over in the world we are fighting and killing one another over what could very well be in the scheme of things very trivial. We are all in the same bucket as human beings.     
   This earth of ours is precious, and for no other reason more important than saving this earth for our future generations, the air we breathe all rests in the decisions that we make in this Congress today. 
   I know and I share the same feeling with you all that we feel very honored and very privileged to be elected and serving in Congress at a time when this is our challenge. And when they write the history books and perhaps our grandchildren and children will look and say, well, what did grand-daddy or my daddy do at that time, the history books will reflect very proudly that we provided the leadership at a very crucial time to move this Nation forward in getting away from oil dependency and getting into clean energies. 
   We have the means to do it. We know we need to do it, and we have the direction to do it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Thank you very much. I think in addition to the plans and the points that we have offered here, there's the other side of this that we have got to face, and that is human behavior. We've got to provide leadership to change human behavior when it comes basically to the one instrument that is causing so much of the pollution, that is causing the earth to get warmer. That is the automobile, and we have to move on both fronts. We have to move on the front of getting the American people to do, and we can do this if we use our policy right, if we use our incentives right. 
   One is that we need to provide encouragement and incentives for individuals to get out of their automobiles, to use other means of transportation, especially in our large urban areas. 
   Let me tell you about my region of the country that I represent which is Atlanta. The Atlanta area has one of the highest carbon dioxide emissions area in this country, and with that is traffic congestion, which is about to choke the great promise of our city, not only in our region, not only in terms of the traffic but the air we breathe. 
   So we have got to move and provide the leadership to get alternative means of transportation moving people from place to place without such great dependency on the automobile. Just think about the time and productivity and hours that's a waste in the human productivity of sitting in traffic jams, let alone the waste of energy and the idling of the motors just in the traffic jams alone. We can't continue that way. We've got to do things. 
   Commuter rail is one of the areas that we are working. That's hard. It's hard to get people out of their automobiles, but it might be good policy for us to move to an area of good Federal tax dollars being used as incentives to be able to give people opportunities to get on these commuter rails. Perhaps we ride for free. Perhaps they're down in a subsidized cost. We've got to do something. 
   In Europe and in France and throughout Europe and in Japan, they have got trains now that are zipping people along at 100. They have got one over in Asia and Japan somewhere that's going about 150, 160 miles an hour. Where would we be without the rapid commuter rail systems we have in the northeast? Can you imagine if we didn't have it? You think traffic is bad between New York, Boston and Washington, D.C. Just think it what it would be like if we didn't have those systems. 
   So there are ways in which we've got to do that.     
   The other thing is; and I am not saying, I know how hard it is, I love my car. We are a society in a culture in America that has just grown up with the automobile. It's a part of us from the drive-ins to all the things that we associate with the good life. Get a home, get a car. You are in America. 
   But maybe, in addition to getting them out of those cars with incentives and the commuter rail and other means, maybe we can do something with the car itself. They are doing some things, American ingenuity is already at work in New York. The Ford Motor Company is now putting together an electric car. They are already out there. We have moved, and I think we are moving with the proposal in this Congress, to give an incentive, to give a tax write-off, tax benefit, some help, for people who will buy cars that run on the batteries and electricity. They have this. 
   I think there is a lot more we can do, in changing the habits of the American people, changing to get them out of the automobiles, and then changing the nature of the automobiles themselves, and then, of course, getting the clean sort of renewable energy we can to put them in. These are the kinds of proposals and approaches that I think this issue calls for, and I think it's the way forward in the future.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. The one area we did not mention, because we need to, because it's going to play a very important role in the future, that's nuclear, nuclear energy. I know when you mention the words nuclear energy, folks get a little shaky, but that's an education job, that's a leadership job. But nuclear energy is reliable, it's low cost, everywhere we have the safety necessary, there's a licensing process that we go through, there are all kinds of features there. But nuclear energy is very, very important, it's going to play a very important role, and we have got to invest in it. 
   Finally, I have got to say, I think in reminding a great historian once said, on the bleached bones of many past civilizations are written those pathetic words, too late. Let us hope and let us know for sure with the action we are taking in this Congress that they will not be able to say that about our civilization on this energy and global warming. We are not going to move too late.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Thank you very much, Mr. Matheson. I certainly want to thank the gentleman from Utah for allowing me to share a few thoughts on what, I think, is the most urgent issue facing, really, the survival of the world, not just that of our country. I'd like to talk about this from an additional perspective. 
   This issue is rolling along on about four or five major legs. One is supply. Another is the weakened dollar, of which you spoke. Another is do we do more drilling. Then this other of which we have not dealt as we should, of which I believe is that leg of which we have to deal if we are going to really address the issue facing the American people, is the high price of gasoline. That leg is called demand. We've got speculators who certainly need to be reined in, and we're doing that. 
   I serve on the Agriculture Committee. We've had the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under Chairman Lukken to come before our committee. We want to make sure that we give him the resources and all that he needs to bring title regulation and transparency. We need to look at issues like swapping where these traders use others' pension funds to trade among themselves with little oversight. We need to close the Enron loophole. We need to make sure that everything trading with oil is done in the light and not in foreign exchanges that have very little regulation. All of that needs to be done.     
   Speculation and speculators play a vital role as well. So that we have to make sure that whatever approach we take there, that's a part of the infrastructure. And still we're not addressing the issue facing the American people until we address the issue of demand. 
   The only way we're going to bring down the price of oil, and subsequently the price of gasoline, is to reduce our demand and our dependency on oil. Oil's not in our future if we're going to have one. If we continue with oil, this earth is going to eventually burn up. We're getting to that point now. It is the oil and other matters that are causing global warming at such an epidemic rate that even if you drill for more, that creates more demand. And drilling is where we are now. That is not where we need to go for the future. 
   We have got to erase the high demand or else we're going to be in a footrace with China and India. If we continue at our pace on our current demand for oil, it will go up 22 percent in the next 10 years, China's will go up 160 percent, India 110, and developing countries in the Middle East will go up 125. Increase. The more oil you drill for, the more the demand, the higher the price. 
   Let me tell you something that happened. Just before we left, in Jidda in Saudi Arabia they had a conference. And at that conference, Saudi Arabia said, Okay. I tell you what. We're going to increase during the month of May by 300,000 barrels per day. Then in July and June, last month, they added another 200,000 barrels a day, increase, because we felt the more the supply, then we'd lower the price. No, no, no. Less than 24 hours. That happened on a Sunday. That very Monday, when the first market opened in Singapore, the price went up from $134 a barrel to $137, and now it's rolling along at $145. Does more oil, does more production, does it drive it up? It creates the demand. 
   So what do we do? We've got to move forthrightly on getting off of oil, getting off of dependency on it. We've got a great chance to do that. We have the means to do it. There is no country that has the technology, that has the smarts to be able to get alternative sources of energy to survival. 
   If Brazil can do it, why can't we? I went down to Brazil last year, spent a week down there going into the factories, into the production plants, and 85 percent of their automobiles are running on what is called flex fuel. In other words, ethanol made from sugarcane. Why can't we do that? No. We blindly want to go with ethanol, but we want to go make it on corn. 
   For every unit of energy that it takes to produce a unit of ethanol from sugarcane, they can only yield less--they yield 8 units of energy. That's a great yield. With corn, for every energy it takes to produce it they can only produce less than 2 units of energy. It's not efficient. Plus, it drives up the price on food because corn is the basic for livestock. So corn ethanol is not the future. Nor should it be on any basic food. 
   But now our technologies say we can make ethanol from kudzu, from pine straw, from pinecones, and yes, sugarcane. 
   Now I ask you, here is a question that we need to ask and the American people need to ask Congress. Why can't  we begin to offset our demand for gasoline to run our automobiles, offset, removing our demand bit by bit from importing oil from the Middle East and on oil to making up for that by pouring in ethanol? And why is it that we have a 54 cents-per-gallon tariff on every gallon of ethanol we would import from Brazil? It doesn't make sense. Why would we not want to import ethanol made from sugarcane, the most energetic, the most productive kind of ethanol, into this country from Brazil to offset the loss from importing oil from there as we build up our own capacity for ethanol? 
   And let me just share with you what we're doing in my great State of Georgia. Georgia is at the leadership--and I would like to say, Mr. Matheson, in my own district in Clayton County, for example, we have in Clayton County in Ellenwood, a plant that makes biodiesel fuel. And you know what they make it from? Not oil, not petroleum. They're making it from the fatty parts that you throw away from the chickens and from pork. And they're taking it. And this year, this plant, it's called the BullDog BioDiesel--you can tell we're from Georgia because it's the ``Bull Dog''--but it's the BullDog BioDiesel plant in Ellenwood. They will produce 18 million gallons of biodiesel fuel. 
   And it is not going to have to go on the world market like oil would. That's another thing we need to clarify because people think if we were to drill and get oil, that that oil will come straight on back here and it stays in this country. No. That goes to the world oil market and comes out at $145 a barrel if it was today. The price is there. 
   So my point is this: We need to understand that we are at a critical point in our history, quite honestly, as a civilization, and America must lead in this direction, and that leadership means cutting this demand and dependency on oil and moving to renewable areas. We're already moving with the battery cell automobile. Why can't we put greater emphasis on those things and those items? 
   And as I said, we certainly have to look at ethanol as a future because it would make up for the shortfall we would get once we are able to cut our dependency on oil, especially from the Middle East. 
   So I think that among all of the other things that we've got to do, and there are many things we've got to do, but essentially it comes down to the bottom line: You want the price of gasoline to go down? You want the future of the world to go up? Then what you do is you've got to cut the demand on that petroleum as a base of energy and move to another base of energy that does not threaten our economy or our environment.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - July 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Absolutely. And I just wanted to complement what my colleague from South Dakota, Ms. HERSETH, has said because I serve on the Agriculture Committee with Ms. HERSETH. 
   And this agricultural farm bill, in my estimation, in my 6 years here I've dealt with many bills, but as far as our future and our domestic and international needs, this farm bill is by far one of the absolute, most impactful bills we've had that touches on this. And I think we would do well to share with the American people--and you have alluded to so much of that already, very eloquently I might add--but let me just also point out that what's in this bill because this is so important. 
   We've mentioned ethanol, but it's so important that the people of America know that we have $4.2 billion in loan guarantees in this bill for the construction of ethanol plants, and we are putting the emphasis, as you said, on cellulosic. This is why it's particularly, in my part of the Nation, in Georgia, we are so excited about this bill. We not only have the biodiesel plant in Ellenwood in Clayton County, but over in south Georgia, in Soperton we have a cellulosic ethanol plant that is producing energy off of wood chips, just what you talked about. 
   We have scientists and engineers and chemists working right now at the University of Georgia and Georgia Tech fine-tuning how we extract cellulosic ethanol from pine straw and pine trees. I mean, these are renewable areas, and we're putting the incentives in. 
   Also in the farm bill what we've done, we recognize, as she spoke so eloquent, too, about the corn pressure, that we wanted to also give some emphasis to the cellulosic ethanol. So we have increased the tax credits for ethanol made from cellulosic means, while we slightly decreased it from corn to take some of that pressure off. 
   So I did want to talk for a moment about the leadership of the Agriculture Committee in the future of our energy needs, particularly when it comes down to our renewable fuels, but I also wanted to talk for a moment about this is a world issue, and it's a complex issue. 
   The question that I'm pondering with and I think we all should is this one. Fifteen years ago, just 15 years ago, the price of oil was less than $15 a barrel. Now here we are, 15 years later, and it's busting at about $150 a barrel. Somewhere, somehow we need to ask the question, how and why, because clearly if we're going to find our way out of this mess we have got to examine how we got into this mess. 
   Well, I did a little bit of examining, and it comes down to this. Right now, the world uses 85.4 million barrels of oil per day. Now, I ask Mr. Matheson, you might want to know, that's good, well, how much does the world produce? They produce 85.6 million barrels per day. And as I mentioned earlier, Saudi Arabia just like that said we can increase production just like that, 500 barrels a day. 
   Now, what I'm talking about here is that a lot has happened, but one of the most significant things that has happened has been China and India and the underdeveloped world that is putting tremendous pressure here and an OPEC cartel that tends to want to play like Russian roulette with us. 
   So this is why I am saying and I am concerned that if we move towards drilling, wherever it may be, I am just one voice here. There are all areas of leadership, and my leadership is going to be in trying to get alternative energies on the market, trying to bring down the 54-cent tariff that we have for keeping ethanol out so that we can have some competition. 
   Even as we're speaking, I believe the world is listening, and they're listening to what America is saying. And if America is saying we're making moves to get you out of the back pockets of the American people and we're going to move into a situation where we don't need you, we're going to bring that price down. You watch what we say. If it takes drilling, if it takes a threat of drilling, if it takes moving it and getting the oil companies finally to move on the 68 million acres that we've already leased to drill on--and that is the other question, Mr. Matheson. Not only the other question about what happened in the 15 years, but why is it that we've given the oil companies 68 million acres to drill on and everybody is saying drill, drill, and not one drill has hit the ground in those 68 million acres?     
   The American people ought to get an answer to that. If they want more drilling, why haven't the oil companies drilled on the 68 million acres that's there to drill? Those are some very serious questions that I think we need to ask and examine thoroughly. 
   But I will say this, this Congress is speaking with a loud, precise voice. And I believe the more energetic we speak with this voice, the more precise we speak with it, the more action-oriented we speak with it, both Democrats and Republicans, all of us speak in a loud voice together, saying enough of this, we're not going to take it anymore and move forward with some alternatives, that will get these oil folks out of our back pockets. That's what the American people want. And that's what is going to bring down these oil prices, shaking the demand.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. (COMMEMORATING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ASSASSINATION OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Thank you, Chairman Conyers. It's so good to be here with my good friend Mr. Lewis from Georgia and Mr. Cohen from Tennessee. 
   Mr. Speaker, today, we gather to pay tribute and to recognize an extraordinary life on the 40th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the book of Genesis in the 37th chapter, in the 19th verse, it says these words: Lo, here cometh the dreamer. Let us slay him and then we shall see what will become of his dream. 
   I think that is a most fitting way to enter my remarks this afternoon about Dr. King, for his was truly a dream, but that dream was built on three strong pillars. One was public accommodations. The other was voting rights. But the other, and perhaps the tougher, was economic rights, how do we get the lever to make the dream a reality. Dr.  King knew full well it didn't matter if we could sit anywhere on the bus if we don't have money to get on the bus. It doesn't matter if we could live anywhere we wanted if we didn't have money to buy the house and to keep the house. 
   So, as we reflect today on that economic right, it is so fitting that so much is still to be done. For as we look at the front page of the New York Times yesterday, we find that there are more people who are on food stamps percentage-wise in this country than 40 years ago when Dr. King died. What has happened to his dream after he was slain? 
   It's so fitting that if we start to think for a moment what Dr. King was doing in those moments and hours before his death. He was grappling with the economic question, moving back and forward from Washington, D.C., to Atlanta, Georgia, to Memphis, dealing with the poor people's campaign, the war on poverty, and, most significantly, dealing with the most basic of economic rights, a livable wage for jobs for the sanitation workers in Memphis, Tennessee. 
   And so he knew that the work had not been done. His prophetic words, as Chairman Conyers referred, it's almost as if he was preaching his own funeral when he said he had reached the mountaintop and had looked over and seen the promised land. I may not get there with you, but I want you to know tonight that we, as a people, will get to the promised land. And all the threats that were on his life, it was as if he knew that the bullet in 24 hours was out there waiting for him. 
   And he said in his immortal words: I fear no man, for mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord. 
   So, as we gather here, let us understand that that dream is still not the reality; although the pillars that he planted, part of them are. It is the tough bucket of the economic issues that we are grappling with on the floor of this House of Representatives as we speak, keeping people in their homes, getting people so they can work and have employment and jobs, opening up the economic system so that people will have businesses and participate in a livable way. 
   So, as we reflect, let us remember those words from Genesis: Lo, here cometh the dreamer. Let us slay him and then we shall see what will become of his dream. 
   We in this House of Representatives can make that dream a reality by finishing that final plank, the economic plank.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. (CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964 COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself just a couple of minutes here at the beginning. 
   This is a very, very important and timely piece of legislation. H.R. 2040 is the Civil Rights Act of 1964 Commemorative Coin Act. As a steadfast proponent of this most important legislation, it is indeed my honor and privilege. 
   First and foremost, I wish to commend my good friend and my own personal hero and mentor from the great State of Georgia, my colleague, Mr. JOHN LEWIS, on the extraordinary work that he has done throughout his entire life, and certainly on the work to bring this commemorative coin bill recognizing the 50th anniversary of the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to the floor with the minting of a $1 coin. 
   I applaud the bill for honoring not only the importance of this legislation, but also the many contributions of so many Americans from all walks of life, from all different backgrounds that have come together to make this country great, and certainly have made outstanding contributions during the civil rights era. 
   I further want to acknowledge the vital role of the United Negro College Fund, UNCF, that they have played in ensuring access to and opportunities for higher education for so many deserving students who, if it had not been for the UNCF, would not have received a college education. During its 64-year existence, the UNCF has raised more than $2.3 billion to support its 39 Historically Black Colleges and University member institutions. And during 2007, the UNCF raised an impressive $220 million in scholarships to help some 65,000 students realize their dreams of receiving a college education. So it's important for us to note that this is more than just a piece of legislation for it's important to note that the proceeds from the sale of this coin will go towards advancing what the Civil Rights Act initially made possible, opportunity for education and empowerment by benefiting the United Negro College Fund and those member schools which played such a vital role, Madam Speaker, in the sit-ins, they started on black college campuses, on the marches, the civil rights marches started by students on black college campuses, demonstrations in the deep south and throughout this country energized by those on black college campuses. These United Negro College Fund students, graduates, faculty and institutions played a significant part in the Civil Rights Movement, and I, as a young activist at that time, as many of my colleagues, am a graduate myself of a Historically Black University, Florida A&M University. And I might add, had it not been for Florida A&M University, Madam Speaker, I would not be standing in the Congress of the United States today. 
   Now, granted we've come a long way. However, there is still much, much work to do. I am living proof that minorities are able to elect the candidate of their choice as I was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives 34 years ago, becoming the youngest legislator to serve in the State House of Representatives at that time. I owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to those who came before me, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has been instrumental in achieving all of these successes.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  
   I wanted to first thank our colleague and the ranking member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Ms. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, who introduced this important legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, the human rights situation in North Korea remains one of the bleakest on the planet. This is an extraordinarily important piece of legislation which speaks to some extraordinary abuses of human rights in North Korea. 
   As we speak, millions of North Koreans live in desperate conditions; political, economic, and religious freedoms are nonexistent, and many are starving and undernourished and live in fear of arbitrary arrests when they know they may be tortured or executed. 
   The North Korean government knows that access to information outside the country is a threat to the regime's control, and so it maintains an absolute grip over all legal media using it to manipulate the population into believing that life is no better anywhere else on the planet. 
   Those who manage to leave the country in North Korea face further danger. They face denial of rights and threats to their lives. China stubbornly refuses to categorize North Koreans who flee horrific living conditions and persecution as refugees. Instead, they label them as ``economic migrants.'' This disingenuous semantic trick relieves Beijing of its obligation to assist the North Koreans who escape into China in accordance with international conventions on refugees to which Beijing is a signatory. 
   North Koreans are routinely arrested and abused by the Chinese authorities and sent back to North Korea where they are considered traitors. Upon return, they are arrested. They're likely tortured, and sometimes, Mr. Speaker, they are killed. 
   The suffering people of North Korea need assistance. And in 2004, Congress passed with overwhelming bipartisan support the North Korea Human Rights Act in an effort to focus U.S. attention on their plight. This Act provided new resources to assist North Korean refugees, support democracy and human rights programs and improve access to information through radio broadcasts and other activities. It is also required that the President appoint a special envoy on North Korean human rights. 
   Our bill, H.R. 5834, reauthorizes this vitally important legislation. The current bill extends the North Korean Human Rights Act through fiscal year 2012 and enhances the role of the special envoy by making it an ambassadorial rank and requiring it be a full-time position. 
   H.R. 5834 was passed by the House on May 15 of this year, and the Senate made minor amendments to the bill on September 22. 
   Mr. Speaker, the North Korean Human Rights Act has been instrumental in ensuring the issue of human rights for North Koreans remains a key priority of U.S. policy toward North Korea. I strongly support this legislation. It is badly needed. And I encourage my colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Let me first thank the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Hodes) for offering this important resolution, which marks the 70th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the Night of Broken Glass. His leadership on the Holocaust-related issues is greatly appreciated. 
   On the night of November 9, 1938, the streets of German and Austrian cities were littered with the shattered glass of Jewish homes, businesses and synagogues. Ninety-one people lost their lives and 30,000 were deported to concentration camps during the course of  this pogrom. Buchenwald and Dachau soon filled with Jews who had been deprived of their property, their savings and their livelihoods by the Nazis. 
   Kristallnacht, the Night of Broken Glass, showed the world once and for all the true face of the Nazi regime and served as a prelude to the horrors that would soon befall Europe's Jewish community. As Germany's synagogues burned on this terrible night, the governments of the west, including our own, failed to take meaningful action. Ambassadors were recalled, speeches were made, but the Nazis' orchestrated pogrom resulted in the diplomatic equivalent of just a slap on the wrist. 
   We condemn not just the destruction wrought against Germany and Austria's Jewish community that terrifying night, but we also condemn the world's inaction, which undoubtedly led the Nazis to believe the international community would offer little resistance to their plans to murder all the Jews in Europe. 
   Though 70 years have passed since the Nazis began to set in motion the final solution, and 63 years since the liberation of the last of their death camps, we must continue to maintain our vigilance against all forms of ethnic, national and religious hatreds. 
   Adolf Hitler exploited the world's failure to protect those threatened by the Nazi's vicious ideology of hate. As we reflect upon the anniversary of this infamous night and pay tribute to the over 6 million people killed in the Holocaust, we must recommit ourselves to preventing genocide anywhere and any time. 
   I strongly support this resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I first want to thank our colleague, the newly appointed Democratic cochairman of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, Congressman Jim McGovern, and the distinguished Republican Human Rights Caucus cochairman, Congressman Frank Wolf, for their strong leadership in bringing this important legislation before the House of Representatives. 
   This legislation before us will immediately and fully institutionalize the biggest and most active human rights entity in the United States Congress, the Congressional Human Rights Caucus. The new entity will carry the name Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission and will be led by the current caucus cochairs assisted by the executive committee. 
   This year, the caucus should have joyfully and proudly celebrated its 25th anniversary, on which Members of this House and human rights NGOs could have paid tribute to the tremendous human rights accomplishments of the caucus under the leadership of its founding cochairman, Tom Lantos. 
   This joy was, of course, overshadowed earlier this year with the passing of this extraordinary human being and human rights giant, our good friend and distinguished former chairman of our Foreign Affairs Committee, the Honorable Tom Lantos. 
   With him, the caucus had lost its inspiring cochairman; the Foreign Affairs Committee, its visionary leader; this body, one of its most respected, passionate and eloquent colleagues; and this Nation, a foreign-born public servant who loved this country with every fiber of his body.     
   Given Tom's biography and life experiences before he was elected as the only Holocaust survivor to this distinguished body, and his burning desire to stand up for people around the world who do not have a voice in the corridors of power, it certainly is no surprise that 25 years ago our distinguished former colleague, John Edward Porter, collaborated with Tom to establish a working group dedicated to the defense of global human rights. 
   With Annette Lantos and Kathryn Cameron Porter at their sides, the Congressional Human Rights Caucus was launched. It is impossible today to chronicle every single accomplishment of the Human Rights Caucus. But over the last 25 years, the caucus has intervened on behalf of countless individuals and groups whose human rights have been violated, raised human rights issues which were on nobody's radar screen, used its strong voice for the voiceless, and has actively engaged Members of the United States Congress on the important matter of human rights. 
   Over the last 25 years, the caucus has also proven that human rights is a truly bipartisan issue and has driven totalitarian regimes and their lobbying agents to the brink of utter despair when liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans--and every shade in between--relentlessly stood shoulder to shoulder on global human rights issues. 
   Under the strong leadership of our colleagues, JIM MCGOVERN and FRANK WOLF, I have no doubt that the new commission will continue to stand as a beacon for human rights around the world. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I am pleased to support this resolution that allows the House of Representatives to pause in remembrance of the 75th anniversary of the Ukrainian famine of 1932 and 1933 and extend its sympathies to the victims, survivors and relatives of this tragedy. I commend my distinguished colleague, Representative Levin of Michigan, and the cochair of the Ukrainian Caucus in the House for introducing this important resolution. 
   At the beginning of the 20th century, Mr. Speaker, Ukraine was so renowned for its rich soil and high grain production that it was known as the ``bread basket of Europe.'' Such bounty serves only to amplify the magnitude of the country's loss: The deaths of nearly one-quarter of its entire rural population as a result of the Soviet policy of forced collectivism in 1932 and 1933. 
   This premeditated famine was intended to break the nation's resistance to Communist occupation and destroy its movement for independence. While 7 to 10 million Ukrainians were starving to death, millions of tons of grain were kept in reservoirs, sold or sent to other parts of the Soviet Union. Further compounding this tragedy, Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin ordered that the borders of Ukraine be sealed and that anyone trying to relocate family or children be severely punished or killed. 
   Mr. Speaker, the United States of America has never forgotten this tragedy that occurred in Ukraine 75 years ago. As early as May 1934, former Congressman Hamilton Fish introduced a resolution in this House that called for condemnation of the Soviet Government for its acts of destruction against the Ukrainian people. 
   The United States Commission on the Ukrainian Famine, which was established in December of 1985, worked to uncover the scale and the reasons for and the consequences of this terrible manmade famine. And in October 2006, President Bush signed a law authorizing the Government of Ukraine to construct a memorial in the District of Columbia to honor the victims of the famine. 
   Today, 17 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine is a strong ally of the United States. We fully support the efforts of this young democracy to strengthen its political institutions, its rule of law and civil society. It's so appropriate that we pause today to remember the victims of the famine and reaffirm our continued friendship and solidarity with the Ukrainian people. 
   I strongly support this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   August 7, 1998, is a day that will never be forgotten. With near simultaneous vehicular bombing attacks by members of al Qaeda on our embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the United States was challenged to face a new world. The violence that day claimed the lives of Americans, Kenyans, and Tanzanians with a death toll of 213 individuals in Kenya and 11 in Tanzania. The injured numbered well over 5,000. As great as the tragedy that day, without the dedication and bravery of the security individuals of those embassies, those acts of terrorism would have been far more catastrophic. 
   Shortly after the bombings, Congress provided $50 million in emergency supplemental appropriations to aid in the recovery process. And last October, the House passed the Foreign Service Victims of Terrorism Act of 2007 which provides compensation to the families victimized by these tragedies who are still recovering from their loss. 
   Our embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam have been rebuilt. Nevertheless, we must never forget the tragedy of that fateful day, and we must always remember the significance of the lives of those lost. 
   Madam Speaker, that is why I strongly urge and support this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join me in that support. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I would like to first thank my distinguished colleague, the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for introducing this very, very important legislation. 
   When it comes to arms sales to Taiwan, U.S. policy is clear. We must ensure that the thriving democracy of Taiwan has the military capability necessary to defend itself from outside threats. 
   The United States is obligated to provide defensive military equipment to Taiwan, not just because it is right to aid our democratic friends, but also because it is the law of the land under the Taiwan Relations Act. 
   This act, which has been at the core of our policy towards Taiwan for almost three decades, clearly states that the United States should base its decision whether to supply defensive military equipment to Taiwan solely on the security needs of the Taiwanese military. 
   The Taiwan Relations Act is also clear that it is the President and Congress that determine what military equipment shall be sold to Taiwan. Apparently, the White House does not understand the Taiwan Relations Act. 
   As we speak, the administration is refusing to move forward with $11 billion worth of arms to Taiwan, arms which the administration has already  agreed to sell. The Taiwanese government wants the weapons, and the administration has recommended that the sales be approved. The only thing remaining is for the administration to notify Congress, and yet, no notification has come. 
   To address this peculiar situation, over the past months the Foreign Affairs Committee has repeatedly requested briefings from the administration. Most often, the answer is simply no response. When pressed, State Department and other administration officials throw up their hands and tell us to ask the White House because it is the White House that is making the decision to delay notification of the sales and not to talk to Congress. 
   H.R. 6646 requires the administration to brief the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on all discussions that the administration has had with the Taiwanese Government regarding the arms sales and on any potential transfer of defense equipment to Taiwan. 
   I would like to point out the extraordinary measure we are taking by introducing this legislation. Section 15(b) of the State Department Basic Authorities Act provides that the Department ``shall keep the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives fully and currently informed with respect to all activities and responsibilities within the jurisdiction.'' With respect to these arms sales to Taiwan, this law has been ignored. 
   Because of the importance of the U.S.-Taiwan relationship and the importance of the Taiwan Relations Act, which has helped keep peace in East Asia for almost 30 years, it is time for Congress to take a more direct step in compelling the administration to explain its decision-making on arms sales to Taiwan. 
   The stakes are too high to let the White House continue its policies of secrecy and disregard for congressional oversight. It is an injustice to our Taiwanese friends. It is a danger to our national security, and it is against the law. 
   I strongly support this legislation and encourage my colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   First I would like to thank the gentleman from Florida and the chairman of the Europe Subcommittee, Mr. Wexler, for introducing this important resolution calling for immediate and just restitution of illegally seized property from the Nazi era. Among the many atrocities perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II was the illegal confiscation of private homes, of businesses, of art work, and communal property. Many of these stolen assets were retained by the Communist governments after the war. 
   While the vast majority of Central and Eastern European countries should be praised for passing property restitution laws in order to right historical wrongs, others have failed to enact necessary legislation, or they have thrown legal roadblocks in the way of individuals or religious and communal organizations who are seeking to reclaim property rightfully belonging to them. 
   Though it had the largest pre-war Jewish community in Europe, Poland has, for over half a century, resisted efforts to return private property--be it homes or businesses--stolen by the Nazi and Communist governments to its original owners. 
   I am very heartened now to learn that Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk is currently finalizing a draft restitution bill, and I hope the Polish Parliament approves this long overdue legislation. 
   My concern is that we have been down this road before with previous Polish governments, all of whom have failed to deliver on their promises. The Lithuanian Government has been similarly disappointing in its failure to implement fair and comprehensive restitution legislation. 
   While it should be commended for enacting laws that provide restitution for individual property owners, attempts to pass legislation paving the way for the return of nonreligious communal Jewish property taken by the Nazis, such as schools and hospitals, have stalled. 
   As many of those individuals awaiting restitution are in their waning years, it is imperative that the United States continue to encourage the governments of Poland, Lithuania, and others to adopt meaningful legislation ensuring the prompt return of or compensation for property seized during the Nazi and Communist eras. 
   I strongly support this resolution, Madam Speaker, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in doing the same. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   This is the height of injustice. We have an opportunity to right a terrible wrong, and it is important that we pass this legislation and send a very strong message to these countries to finally, finally restore the property and/or the compensation to these individuals.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Thank you to the gentleman from Michigan. It is a pleasure to be on the floor with you. 
   Madam Speaker, more than anything else, Dr. King was a man of God. You know, when I think of Dr. King, I think of three people. The first one was the great prophet Isaiah. As you recall, Isaiah cried out in the year that King Uzziah died, was the year that I also saw the Lord. He went on to say that there was a voice that came to him that said, who will go for us, and whom shall we send? 
   Like the prophet Isaiah, in 1956, as a young 26-year-old person down in Alabama, it was Martin Luther King, Jr., who said, Here am I, Lord, send me. Just like the prophet Isaiah. The second person is David the shepherd boy, who climbed up to go see about his brethren, and there was Goliath, issuing all kinds of threats. 
   They told him to go back, much as they did with Martin Luther King, Jr., but he didn't go back. Instead, he stood there and Martin Luther King, Jr., like David said, Is there not a cause. There is a cause for me, and there is a cause for you, and that is to beat down the Goliaths of racism, of prejudice and discrimination. 
   The third one is Jesus Christ, for when the Pharisees asked Jesus Christ what was the greatest commandment of all, Jesus said to love thy neighbor as thyself. At the bottom of it all, Dr. King's essence was love. As Jesus said, There is no greater love than that you would give your life for another. Dr. King paid that price and gave his life, love. 
   As the song writer said: Them's that got shall get and them's that not shall not lose cause the Bible says, and it still is news. Your mama may have and your poppa may have, but God bless this child. Martin Luther King, more than anything else, was a child of God, and we thank God for sending Martin Luther King, Jr., our way.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. (PROVIDING NEW EFFECTIVE DATE FOR APPLICABILITY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF LAW -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge today that the House pass H.R. 188, which was introduced by the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey, Representative Pallone. 
   This bill has the simple purpose of addressing a glitch in the distribution of surcharges on the sale of commemorative coins that honor America's great inventor, Thomas Edison. 
   In 1988, legislation authorizing the production of the coin was enacted and the U.S. Mint minted and issued the coin in 2004. But as a result of some unclear language in the documents provided both the Mint and to recipient organizations, it was unclear that the matching funds required by law in the order for recipient organizations to receive the coin's proceeds must be raised entirely from private sources and that no other government funds could be used for this purpose. 
   This bill extends for a period of 6 months the amount of time in which the recipients of surcharges on the sales of the Thomas Edison commemorative coin are allowed to raise matching funds. 
   While the House passed the bill to remedy this problem by voice vote under suspension of rules last November, the Senate failed to act on this in a timely manner, so I would urge the House to consider the bill and immediately adopt the underlying text. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. (AUTHORITY TO CONTINUE TO INSURE HOME EQUITY CONVERSION MORTGAGES -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may need. 
   First of all, H.R. 391 is a bill sponsored by my good friend and colleague from Utah (Mr. Matheson). H.R. 391 would prevent any shutdown of the Federal Housing Administration, FHA, reverse mortgage program. This program is also known as the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage program, or the HECM program. 
   As we are all aware, the Federal Government is currently operating with temporary funding authority that expires on February 15, 2007. The FHA can insure no more than 275,000 FHA reverse mortgages cumulatively nationwide under this authority. 
   A reverse mortgage is a unique loan that enables senior homeowners to remain in their homes and remain financially independent by converting part of their home equity into income without having to sell their home, give up title, or take on a new monthly mortgage payment. 
   Reverse mortgage is an apt name because the payment stream is reversed. Instead of making monthly payments to the lender, as with a regular mortgage, the lender makes payments to the homeowner. Payments to the borrower come in the form of a lump sum, monthly payments, a line of credit, or a combination thereof. Thus, the funds can be adapted to the financial needs of the senior taking out that particular loan. 
   Mr. Matheson's bill is necessary because surging FHA reverse mortgage loan volume could result in this current national volume cap of FHA reverse mortgage loans being reached before February 15. 
   The FHA HECM program is the oldest and most popular reverse mortgage product, accounting for 90 percent of the total market. It has been available since 1989 to homeowners aged 62 or older. HECM loans are insured by the Federal Government through the Federal Housing Administration at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD. 
   The HECM program was created to serve our seniors who are cash poor but equity rich. The majority of loan recipients are elderly widows. The funds from a reverse mortgage can be used for anything: daily living expenses; home repairs or modifications; health care expenses, including prescription drugs or in-home care; existing debts; and other needs. This is extraordinarily important and timely legislation for our seniors. 
   The HUD HECM program has proven to be a growing success, serving its mission, while actually making money for the Federal Government. Its rapid pace of growth created a near crisis in 2005 when the number of FHA reverse mortgage loans began to near a statutory volume cap on the number of reverse mortgages that FHA could insure, leaving the program on the edge of suspension. 
   However, emergency appropriations legislation for fiscal year 2005 raised the volume cap from 150,000 to 250,000. Last fall, in the face of a similar concern, the limit was increased a little further to 275,000. However, current projections show a very real risk that the cap will be met before February 15. 
   In 2006, the House passed a bill that included a provision eliminating the FHA reverse mortgage volume cap, but unfortunately, the Senate did not act on this bill. As a result, in the short term, the statutory cap needs to be kept above the actual number of loans, or HUD will be required under law to suspend the program. That is why we need this very important piece of legislation passed. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Let me just say in concluding, this is vitally important, this is vitally important to all Americans, but it most certainly is extraordinarily important to our seniors, and especially those that are widowed, so that we can lift this cap to save this program. It is a very, very important program. 
   Again, I commend Mrs. Biggert and all of those on the House Financial Services, and Mr. Matheson for the brilliant leadership he has provided us with, and the fact that we all stand ready to assist Mr. Matheson when he brings the other bill back so that we can permanently solve this problem.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Ladies and gentlemen, let me just say this: the American people are waiting on this Congress to finally stand up and be Congress. This is one of the reasons why we are in the position that we are in right now is because Congress has not done its job. 
   One of the most sterling moments of that was 2 years ago when it came to attention on this floor that our young men and women were over in Iraq without body armor. Every news cast had it where they were going into dung heaps, into landfills, trying to get body armor. 
   It was Democrats, at that time, that stepped forward and put the amendment in the resolution to make sure that our troops have body armor. And that is the genesis of this legislation. 
   This is a big ball game, and you have got to get to first base first. And what we are saying is, when we move out with this resolution, paramount is taking care of our troops, making sure that they have the body armor. 
   I am here to tell you the American people know that this war has had a tremendous drain on our American economy. The importance of this measure, ladies and gentlemen in this House, is that we cannot go forward without the confidence of the American people. Passage of this bill gives us that confidence.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise to strongly oppose this amendment. 
   This amendment smacks right at heart of our wage structure, of fair wages and protected wages. Long before Taft-Hartley, before the Wagner Act, this was put on the books in 1931, 76 years ago. 
   And I might add Davis-Bacon was put on the books by a Republican administration, President Hoover, because at that time it was needed to have wage stabilization. Davis-Bacon is the cornerstone of the wage protection structure in this country that has produced the middle class that has been the backbone of this country. Davis-Bacon prevents underbidding of any contractor coming in on a government contract, low bidding and attempting to bring in a contract and hire workers below the prevailing wage. It is most important. And I might say, Mr. Chairman, this amendment was dealt with in the Agriculture Committee and soundly defeated at that time. 
   Essentially, what they are proposing is this: In the Ag bill, we have dedicated $4 billion for loan guarantees to set up ethanol plants. Now, Mr. Chairman, these are highly sophisticated operations. In order to come in and to be able to have the opportunity to be able to process an Internet technology, a foreign operation and a product that is clearly into the future, clearly we need the best talent, the best skills. We don't need not to protect the prevailing wage in this community. 
   Now, my opponents are going to come and say they are probably talking about union wages. Nothing in here says that. It says prevailing wages, prevailing wages that are set by a scientific survey that goes in and takes a survey of the wages in that local community. Why should the government be an instrument to come in and undermine a local community's labor standards? That is what Davis-Bacon was put in to protect, and that is why this is so important here today. 
   We need not be a thief coming in to take away from a local community what they have earned and their wage standards at their level. Why should the government come in and allow for this to happen? These protections were put in to prevent fly-by-night operations from coming into a community. Because so many government contracts are to the lower bidder and sometimes they bid low so they can go out and pay these low wages that are below the prevailing wage in that community. It is wrong to do that and, quite honestly, unAmerican. Because this law, Davis-Bacon, has been on the books for 75 years and has done this country good, and we deserve to keep it in.

   I've gone to Landstuhl in Germany and sat with our soldiers on every trip. I've been three times over there and three times we've been to Germany and talked. The stress is there. 
   In the military report that was just issued, Mr. Speaker, it said that the extension of the duty, the longer the time and the stress of combat, the longer and the greater occurrences of psychological stress. Our Army may not be broken, Mr. Speaker, but it's at the breaking point, and we need to give ample time for our soldiers to come home and rest. 
   If you care about the soldiers, vote for this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. (FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. You know, I'm wondering whether the Republicans are looking at the same America I'm looking at, and that the American people are feeling. Between 7,000 and 8,000 American families file for foreclosure every day. While we were up here debating this bill the last day and today over 15,000 American families have filed for foreclosure. We have a crisis. 
   Now, I want to deal with three points here right quick in my 3 minutes. The  first one is this: I think it is wrong as wrong can be for the other side to continually blame this crisis on the backs of the American family. 
   Let me read here for a moment from this morning's Hill newspaper, and I hope that you all will read this as well, this article by J. Morton Davis of the Harvard Business School, an economist. He tells you what the cause of this is and who is to blame. 
   Because mortgage originators themselves were not taking any of the risk of holding this paper and were being well paid by providing mortgages to Wall Street banks that were packaging them, they became more aggressive, less demanding of the conditions traditionally required upon them. The mortgage brokers and bankers introduced a whole series of new criteria that made it easier to obtain a mortgage, they introduced nothing down, no equity mortgage, interest-only mortgage, no income, no job requirement as sufficient basis to receive the mortgage. That's why we're in the condition that we're in, not on the backs of the poor American family. 
   He goes on to say that ``the changes in lending practices actually transformed what were solid, safe, secure mortgage loans into instruments that were inferior even to the subprime mortgages. The cause of this can be traced to the simple fact that the providers of these mortgages did not end up holding the paper and thus were far less concerned about the quality of the loan.'' Because nobody bothered to look at or take issue with the enormously changed quality of these underlying mortgages, not the Federal Reserve, they didn't look at it, not the Securities and Exchange Commission, not the rating agencies, not even we here in Congress, who surely should have been more responsible and accountable, and not the many Wall Street banks that were coining the money, just as they did. The whole world is now suffering the pain, the outsized losses and the damage to its banking systems and economies. 
   Ladies and gentlemen of this Congress, it is not the American homeowner who is the cause of this, he is the victim, and it's our responsibility to provide the response for it. 
   Now, the other point I wanted to make is I have a copy in my hands here of the Congressional Budget Office co-assessment. Let's put to bed once and for all, this is not $300 billion of the taxpayers' money. The taxpayers' money that's going to this, as clearly as put out in this estimate, is $1.7 billion just to run the program, another $300 million for administrative support, and the counseling of $400,000. And then Mrs. Biggert's own program for counseling of $300 million. That's $2.7 million of the taxpayers' money. 
   Let's do facts right. That's why we need to pass this bill, Mr. Speaker. Let us stop fooling around and give the American people some relief.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. 
   Let me first start by commending our chairman for taking on this very important and timely issue. This is an issue that speaks to the issue of confidence in the American enterprise system. There is no more greater issue that we need to deal with, and I think what the major point that we need to emphasize here is that there is a problem, and obviously there is a terrific problem. There is a terrific problem on several layers. 
   Let me start with the first layer. First of all, we have a problem where we have a stretch of the differences between what the average worker is making in the American economy and this huge leap by multibillions of dollars by what CEOs are making. This is not an aberration. This is a fact in case after case. 
   Plus, on top of that, none of these performances for these huge CEO packages are done based upon performance. As a matter of fact, some of the most outrageous demonstrations of this have been corporate CEO packages that have rewarded companies with hundreds of millions of dollars in their packages for a lack of performance, even while their company has been going down, even while their company has been laying off people, even as they have turned their backs on their pension obligations to employees. No, this is not an aberration, and there is a hue and a cry from the American people across the American landscape that is saying something must be done. 
   Now, we are the people's representatives, and what the chairman has put forward, and I certainly appreciate the chairman for allowing me to have an opportunity to work with him on this, what we are putting forward here is basically a fair and moderate response, no overreaction. 
   We have taken the marketplace with its basic components. What is the most important attribute of our system? It is the free marketplace. And what is the most important part of that? It is the exchange of stock ownership. And who plays that most important role there? It is the investor. Once that investor begins to lose confidence, we are all in a world of trouble. 
   There is nothing in our bill that mandates a certain salary level, none of that. Our bill simply says: Let us let the system work. What is wrong with ending these egregious characteristics of what is happening in the marketplace as far as CEO packages is concerned? It begs for the shareholders who own the company to at least have a say, a nonbinding say. 
   We understand the fragility of what we are doing. We are doing this in a gingerly manner. But let me just state to you in closing that all of the studies, and there will be some amendments which will come forward, some wanting to study this issue, some saying let the SEC rules work out, but what the American people and what the investor and what the situation cries out for are two things: transparency and accountability. That is the hallmark of what we are doing. We are bringing accountability, and we are bringing transparency to what is clearly, from all of the media accounts, from all of the evidence presented to us is clear, and it is dangerous, and it is present. What we have and what we are responding to is something that is clearly a clear and present danger to the future and the heart of our free economic system.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I think it is very important for us to just take a look, very briefly, at what some of the executives, some of the companies are saying and are doing about this now, because I think it goes right to your argument. 
   Let us, first of all, let me just call to your attention, one such company, AFLAC, in Georgia. Now, AFLAC announced that it would give shareholders a nonbinding vote on executive compensation. As a matter of fact, AFLAC CEO Dan Amos said these words, which I want you to pay very important attention to. He said this. He said, as the owners of the company, the shareholders should know how executive compensation works. 
   Now, I think Mr. Amos is right on the money. He simply stated what I think a lot of other companies do in order to maintain integrity.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I rise to oppose the amendment from my good friend from New Jersey. I certainly can appreciate and value his thought and his effort. He presented this amendment in committee. It was voted down at that time. The chairman has seen fit for us to explore it here. 
   I think it is very, very important to, first of all, take a very good look at this amendment because I think the American people have certainly tuned into this debate, and on the surface of it, it sounds very nice and good. You recognize that there is a problem; you are just saying that it ought to be, let us just deal with that that is above 10 percent. 
   But let us look at the wording of this amendment for a moment just to show the difficulty of it. It would allow shareholder votes on executive compensation packages but only if executive compensation at the company exceeds 10 percent or more the average compensation at companies within the same industry and among companies with comparable total market capitalization. A very complicated procedure at best. 
   One of the first and most fundamental reasons why we oppose this amendment is because it is cleverly designed to do one thing and one thing only, and that is basically to gut this bill because it is totally unenforceable. 
   The gentleman from North Carolina raises a very important point that I  raise. You know, how can you determine this? Who determines this? And when you say, the Securities and Exchange Commission, they are not in power to do this. What sanction do you have? And is it ``and'' or is it ``or'' market capitalization of 10 percent? 
   Let me get my point out a little further. As you go in and you talk about the Securities and Exchange Commission and their rules and what they are doing, it is clear to understand that there is nothing within what the SEC is proposing that ensures the bottom line of what we are after, and that is investor confidence in the transparency and accountability. 
   This is a very different time within the history of American enterprise. We have ballooned into a stratosphere of CEO compensation. That is also compounded by a new culture within corporate America. You no longer have the sole cases of the man coming up, working his way up through the company, works his way up and spends 20, 30 years with the company, 25, 40 years with the company and becomes CEO. No, what you have now is a series of hired guns who move from company to company, with a battery of lawyers, with packages and sort of like free agents here at this corporation, one at another, one the next, different industries. 
   So what we have here is a response to that situation that has resulted in these very personalized compensation packages that are made among two or three interested parties and a board of directors member perhaps of a compensation team and this individual without any input from the legitimate owners of the company that invest in it. 
   Now, let me make one other point very clear of what we are doing. All the companies, we should not single out any companies say if it is 10 percent of this or that, even if you could define the rather complicated formula that you have. What we are saying is every stockholder, every company with shareholders publicly traded, should have that opportunity to weigh in and have a say on the compensation packages. 
   I might add that, in the point that was spoken before, when you said, well, these companies will fold up and they will come off and not be public anymore and be private, that in and of itself points out the need for this bill. For if a company, based upon just wanting to keep secret or keep within the domain what one CEO, one employee, that desire would force them to go private, that lets you know right there if that happens, but as the information is flowed to us, every company that has had a say-so on this, you name it, I mentioned AFLAC, the Coca-Cola company and Home Depot, which just had a little hit here, but even they are moving.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   This has been a very lively debate and a very good debate. And I think it points out the need for us to examine this issue within the context of a very pressing concern the American people have. We are not up here because we have sat in a room someplace and decided this is what we ought to do. There is a great demand to bring some integrity, to bring some transparency and accountability to this whole issue of executive pay compensation that has gotten out of bounds. And our answer is simply to look at the system as it is there, as it is situated, and extend to the shareholders, to the board to make available to the shareholders on their proxy statement, a block that says, do you approve or you disapprove of the compensation packages. What happens after that we have nothing to do with. That is their decision to make. 
   And I think we have to also look at the whole issue of what is happening in America today, this whole issue of a war on the middle class; this great divide that is happening. I am telling you, it is dangerous to the future of this country. 
   This is simply an effort to respond, to give some confidence, and to give another tool, an effective tool that works within the system, that is very fair, that is very moderate, as an example of trying to correct a situation that clearly, clearly has gotten out of hand. 
   Now, you all have offered amendments. You have offered them in the committee. Now, in all deference to our chairman, our chairman has been very fair in the committee and on this floor and on the pension issue. He has clearly stated, as he did in committee, and again on the floor, we will have a hearing on this, where it should be. 
   But by the very nature of this issue even exploding into the area of pensions and other fiduciaries, it shows the great need for us to examine our compensation structure in the system. 
   Gentlemen on the other side, we owe it to the American people. We owe it to our system to protect it. Throughout history we have had to make adjustments. Go all the way back to the fall of the stock market, 1929. There are reasons that that happened. The SEC itself was born as a result of a need to do some things. And we continue to muscle right along. 
   I think it is very important that we put in the Record also, before we conclude tonight, because we have had some of our companies names bandied around here, one of which was Home Depot. And I certainly want to recognize Home Depot for moving and taking this issue on and understanding, even to them, the surprise and the concern and the tone that they want to correct for what happened with their predecessor, the CEO, Mr. Darnelli. They are now moving very aggressively to look at this issue itself. 
   And let me just read, for the Record here, Mr. Chairman, where it says that other companies have already begun a process of allowing their shareholders to decide on implementing say on pay. This week Citigroup, no class warfare here, Wachovia. No class war here. Coca-Cola are holding annual meetings at which time their shareholders will vote on say on your pay proposals. 
   Every company that has had a chance to weigh in on this issue is moving ahead because they know it is the right thing to do, because they know, at the end of the day, what is needed is for us to make sure that the confidence of that investor is strong. 
   That is what makes this country great. Our free enterprise system, our move here is to protect it. I commend the chairman, and I thank our committee for pushing this forward.     
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Reclaiming my time, I'd like to get into this dance just a little bit myself, because here we've got this little program that we're trying to offer to help the very, very poor. To show you how desperate the opposition is on the other side, they want to segue this program as a saviour for Social Security, when they spent the last 2 years trying to kill Social Security with private accounts. 
   And then to try to use, when you mentioned the Blue Dog Coalition, I want you to know I'm a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, and I take offense to that particular point. Nobody has been working harder to bring down the deficit that you all created. 
   Let the record speak for itself. How can you even think to take this little poor program here that we're trying to help, would get low income housing, and then claim it to try to use it to try to offset the deficit, when, in fact, we had over a $3 trillion deficit, and under your control of this Congress for the past 4 years, since 2001, you and this President sitting in the White House has borrowed more money from foreign governments and foreign nations, yes indeed, you weren't here, your party, than all of the previous 42 Presidents put together, in other words, since 1789.

Mr. Chairman, what I am saying is that there is very serious hypocrisy here that must be pointed out so the American people can make plain and understand the debate that is before us. This issue has nothing to do with tax increases, nothing to do with raiding Social Security savings and nothing to do with anything dealing with the debt. And my whole point is that the reason it's so hypocritical is the opposition on this side has done so much to destroy Social Security, to raise the debt and not respond. And then to pour this on the backs of this little program that we have targeted to poor people is about as hypocritical as you can get.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett), I don't know what his intention is, but this is probably the most terrible of all of the amendments to come before us tonight. This amendment not just guts the affordable housing program, this amendment guts Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as a viable enterprise. And it would have significant adverse effects on the entire U.S. housing financial system. 
   Now, here's what the amendment does that I understand. It would require that the new GSE regulator restrict Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's portfolio holdings to only mortgage and mortgage-backed securities that exclusively support affordable housing. That is devastating. Particularly mortgages that are extended to households who are having incomes below the median income. 
   Mr. Chairman, that's like taking an orange and squeezing all of the juice out of it and then passing it off to somebody to get orange juice out of it. You are squeezing out of this operation the ability for it to have a very healthy, market-driven portfolio by restricting it to the lower elements of our economy, where there is no juice. 
   The portfolios of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play an important role in stabilizing the supply and reducing the cost of mortgage credit totally within the whole housing financial industry. So enter this effort, just to go after, I have never seen anything like it.

And the amendment would require a drastic reduction in the GSE's portfolios, which, in effect, reduces the access to competitive financing options from community banks and their home buying customers. This is a far-reaching, devastating amendment and must be rejected.

   Your amendment, by limiting the portfolio, does an important thing to bring the juice out.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, to my distinguished friend from Georgia, whom we served in the legislature together there in Georgia, whom I respect greatly, but I have got to disagree with this amendment, with all due respect. 
   First of all, we already have this in an accepted amendment by Mr. Boozman that requires that recipients of housing assistance under the bill's Affordable Housing Fund be able to demonstrate with sufficient evidence that they are lawfully present in the United States. That is sufficient. It is already in there. 
   But let me just point out the real problems and the complexities with this REAL ID. First of all, the REAL ID Act would have States implement new standards, new technology, and new procedures for processing and approving driver's license applications by May of 2008. On March 1 the Department of Homeland Security issued 162 pages of proposed REAL ID regulations acknowledging this one undeniable fact, that compliance by May 2008 would be in their statement an ``impossible task.'' So we could not even do it. By the time the comment period closed last week, the Department of Homeland Security had received over 12,000 comments opposing what the gentleman from Georgia is talking about. The proposed cost for the states, by DHS's own estimation, would be $23.1 million that would be added if the gentleman from Georgia's idea would be incorporated. Only $40 million has been appropriated so far, an amount that wouldn't even begin to cover the costs in one State alone, which would be, let's say, Maine, where the estimate for compliance there is $180 million. 
   The astronomical cost of this mandate is not our only concern with the gentleman from Georgia's amendment. REAL ID requires that States would have to link their DMF databases with every other State in the Union, raising major concerns about privacy issues and security risks of a nationwide interoperable system. 
   The amendment by the gentleman from Georgia may be well intended, but it would throw our entire system on top of its head and would not even begin to even deal with this issue that is already being dealt with in a more appropriate way by Mr. Boozman's amendment, which has been accepted. We have got to ensure that all of our identity documents are secure, but REAL ID will not work in its current form. We need to bring together DHS, DOT, States, and experts in privacy, civil liberties, constitutional rights to establish national standards that will protect both our national security and the privacy of American citizens. This amendment would not deal with that, so we must urge everyone to oppose it. 
   Finally, my point is that immigration is, indeed, a big issue. It is a complex issue, and we are going to deal with that. But, again, you have tried it with the veterans. You have tried it with the debt. You tried it with restricting portfolios. You have even tried to tie it to Social Security and the veterans. And now you are trying to tie this immigration fight onto this simple program to try to bring some affordable housing to the most needy people that need it in our country and especially those that have been devastated from the hurricanes down in Louisiana and in Mississippi. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, I urge defeat of this amendment. Vote ``no'' on the gentleman from Georgia's amendment.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to talk about this amendment very, very briefly, but just prior to getting to that, I wanted to make a very, very important point about the previous amendment, because I think it is very, very important for the record to reflect, for there was denial about the REAL ID Act and its implications on the gentleman from Georgia's amendment. 
   It is very important that I read the language in the bill, in the amendment, that the gentleman from Georgia had previous to this. 
   It says on page 2, starting at line 3, that a driver's license or identification card issued by a State, a State that is in compliance with title II of the REAL ID Act of 2005, title II of division B of Public Law 109-13; 49 USC 30301 note. 
   That is the language that is in the bill. The REAL ID is in the bill. Now, it is there. This is the amendment. This is what we are voting for. The REAL ID is in the language. 
   Now I want to spend the remainder of my time on the gentleman from Texas' amendment. Let us talk about your amendment, the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Sessions. 
   That disclosure that you are requiring, you must admit first of all it is a highly speculative cost. Number two, it does not provide a benefit to consumers. It will add another disclosure to an already cumbersome settlement process, further confusing the homeowners and the home buyers. Again, these are basically poor people who we are trying to help who have been victims of a hurricane. We are also going to, in the process after that first year, apply it to States so that they can apply their own criterion. 
   But, Mr. Sessions, where your amendment really causes a problem is in the broader community of the housing financial market. For example, your amendment would also make it difficult for a Federal Home Loan Bank, for example, to make advances or loans to a community bank member based on a blanket lien on the bank's overall mortgage portfolio, thus raising mortgage costs. These community banks depend on these advances to provide home buyers with competitive credit. 
   So, again, in each of the previous amendments, I cannot understand for the life of me why the Republicans want to so overreach to basically undermine the entire housing financial market just to get at this one small effort to help low income people get relief and get some assistance in becoming homeowners, in the rental capacity as well as the construction of new homes.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. But you don't have valid Social Security number in here. And my point is this: That one of the problems we have got in immigration is there are many illegals, if you are getting at illegal immigrants, who have Social Security numbers. We would place on these this system, much like it is in the employer system, where employers will come and tell you that all of our employees are legal because they have Social Security numbers.     
   But I will also tell you, there is a burgeoning industry within the illegal immigration area of falsified Social Security numbers. That's a big deal. So I think that this raises a very serious problem within your amendment, because if you simply say Social Security Number, you're not really getting at the problem that you feel you're getting at.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Reclaiming my time, again, that does create a problem with your amendment. And further, another problem it creates is because under current requirements, lenders may use any legitimate form of identification, so it would compound the difficulty, because it would make it difficult, again, for community banks to use blanket liens to pledge collateral, raising costs. The point I'm trying to get at is while the intention is good, I think that when you look at all of the problems with immigration, when you look at the problem of the fact of the cottage industry of providing bogus Social Security numbers, unless you put into this feature some mechanism to check to make sure that the Social Security number is valid, then the amendment seems to be moot.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. (FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. I move to strike the last word. 
   Let me see if we can put some of this in perspective for tonight as we wind down in this successful debate. 
   Here we've got an extraordinary emergency problem affecting the very poorest of people. Not just the very poorest of people, but people who have been devastated by the worst natural disaster in the modern history of our country; and on top of that, people who have been denied and denied. What comes to my mind are those images of those individuals who lost everything standing on rooftops to get saved. In a way, they are still standing on those rooftops, without homes. And here we've got a measure to go and address that. 
   This evening has just been an illustrative of attempt after attempt. First you wanted to make this equate to saving Social Security or raiding Social Security. Then you put this program in as being a measure to add to the deficit. Then came immigration. That wasn't enough. Then you want to restrict the means of the GSEs to have the most profitable way of arranging their portfolios. And you want to clamp down and make it so that the only investments they could get would be those at the bottom of the economic heap yielding the lowest return. Because you knew that this would not require a tax increase. You knew that this was based upon shareholders, nontaxable funds, a very creative way. And yet you tried to slam it in. Here are these Democrats raising your taxes again. But the American people are not buying that. That is not the case. 
   Then the game comes that again, this is an entitlement, where nowhere in the legislation is it an entitlement. All of tonight just reminded me, when I remember those images of those poor people still looking for help, but what you have offered them tonight is a massive cut, cutting the legs out from under them and then condemning them for being a cripple. That's devastating. 
   Now we come to the last amendment. Having failed all of that, my good friend from Texas says we're going to cap it. Oh, that's not going to do anything. But your fellow Congressman from Texas game down to that floor, Congressman Green and Congressman Brady asking for help, wanting to help, but no money, and here you are wanting to crimp it, wanting to cap it. 
   Now, you say the cap doesn't mean anything, that it is going to be the lesser of 1.2 basis point average total  mortgage portfolio for the prior year, or $520 million, or a lesser amount determined by the director. The director determines either the higher amount possesses a safety or soundness concern. 
   But what this amendment actually does, it reduces the amount available in the affordable housing program from an estimated $600 million a year down to $520 million a year. But it goes more than that. It just doesn't cap that. It would also cap the amount that the $520 million, even if the actual funds under the formula exceeded the estimated $600 million a year. 
   Chairman Frank has put a very creative measure in. He has tagged it to no set amount, he just put it at 1.2 of the basic points so it allows a free marketplace. And then it allows these GSEs and the shareholders, based upon the profit that they make, to take some of that and help the most needy among us. 
   This has, indeed, been a tremendous debate tonight. We have been going at it since 5 o'clock this afternoon. But it has been worth it because there is no greater thing you can do for your fellow citizens than make sure they have a roof over their heads.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to talk about this for a moment. First of all, let me just address the gentleman from Alabama's amendment, who's a very honorable person and a very, very good and highly thought-of colleague. 
   But it's very important that we recognize that his amendment is designed to do one and one thing only, and that is to gut this bill. And that's what the design is. So no matter which way you talk, whatever the arguments you use, it's designed to gut the bill. 
   Now, for the last year and a half, 2 years in our Committee on Financial Services, we've talked about the affordable housing trust fund. It has been moved out in many respects as a bipartisan measure. 
   Now, this is tailored. It's tailored specifically. I want to put into the Record a letter. It comes from the Most Reverend Nicholas DiMarzio, who is the Bishop of Brooklyn, Chairman of the Domestic Policy Committee for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. Here is what he says. 
   He says, ``As Chairman of the Domestic Policy Committee of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, I write in strong support of a provision in H.R. 1427, the Federal Housing Financial Reform Act of 2007, that provides some $500 million a year from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as a dedicated source of funding for an affordable housing trust fund. 
   ``As you know, the Catholic community serves tens of thousands of men and women and children who struggle to avoid homelessness and maintain adequate housing. Besides sheltering homeless people who turn to us for help, our Catholic Charities, agencies, dioceses and parishes have built and continue to maintain thousands of affordable units. But despite our efforts and the efforts of so many others, there is just not enough affordable housing available. And we believe that a trust fund will be a stable source of money for building and rehabilitating affordable housing for very low income people. 
   ``Our experience demonstrates to us how homelessness and inadequate, substandard housing destroys lives, undermines families, hurts communities and weakens the very social fabric of our Nation. By setting aside money for a National Housing Trust Fund, Congress acts to make the shelter needs of low income families a national priority.'' 
   This brings us to the crux of this matter. And the crux of this matter, gentleman from Alabama, and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, is that we have a pressing need. We have a pressing need for affordable housing. And nowhere is that pressing need more pressing than in Louisiana and Mississippi, where this is targeted to. 
   How those people have suffered; how much they've begged and pleaded for help. And yes, we have passed Katrina funds, but not for this. 
   And in committee, time and time again, we've raised these issues, and your very amendment, my distinguished friend from Alabama, was defeated in committee. 
   Now, it's very clear that 75 percent of the affordable housing funds available in the first year will go to Louisiana. 25 percent of such funds will go to Mississippi for affordable housing arising out of the costs and out of the terrible agonies of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. 
   It's about time that we responded to these needs. And there's no better way of dealing with it than through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
   But I do want to set the record straight so we understand, from the point from the gentleman from New Jersey and others, and the public who's listening to this debate and watching this debate, to make sure that you understand exactly what this housing fund is based upon. It is funds and where the funds are derived from. They're derived through contributions by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in amounts equal to 1.2 basic points on each GSE's total outstanding mortgages, including both those held in the portfolio and those that have been securitized each year, from 2007 through 2011. And the program sunsets in 5 years. This is not a permanency. This is an emergency situation where affordable housing is needed. We're infusing this in. We're targeting it to the area in this country where the greatest need is, and then we're sunsetting it in 5 years. That's the responsible way of doing it. And I submit that the gentleman's amendment should be defeated.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I really believe that it is so comical to see our friends on the other side of the aisle come up with the various and different ways to so-called ``skin this cat'' and gut the bill. This is very clever way my great friend from Texas, whom I have great respect for (Mr. Hensarling), but, Mr. Chairman, let me just read for the Record exactly what his amendment says so that we can really fully understand the lengths to creative linguistic judgments that they will go to cleverly try to skin the cat and gut the bill. 
   Mr. Hensarling says his amendment will permanently eliminate the Affordable Housing Fund contributions in the case of certain factors in the bill that, as written, merely require a suspension of fund contributions. And two, also requires permanent eliminations of the Affordable Housing Fund contributions if a determination is made that such contributions are contributing to an increase in the cost of mortgages to home buyers. Putting the issue in a considerably complex box. 
   Now, we know from the dynamics of economics what is happening in our society today, especially in the housing market. We know what the ravages of Hurricane Rita and Katrina has done to the area which we are targeting the bill. We also know that there is no segment in society that is most impacted and in need of affordable housing than the very, very poor, those people who need the help. This is where this bill is being targeted. 
   And his amendment would prevent the reinstatement of affordable housing funds when a GSE's financial problems temporarily cause a suspension of funds contributions is resolved, and would also create a new condition to shut down the fund that could arbitrarily result in the permanent elimination of the Affordable Housing Fund. That is exactly what the gentleman's amendment does, and that is exactly why we need to defeat it. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   In response to the gentleman's amendment, let me just try to cut through a lot of this to get to exactly why we oppose this amendment and why it's important. And again, this amendment is again designed to obliterate the program. 
   Now, it's very important for us to understand, we're dealing right now with a very volatile housing market. We're dealing with a situation where the subprime market has melted down. We're dealing with a situation where we've had record foreclosures. We're dealing with a situation where the area we're targeting this to go to first for the first year has suffered the worst natural disaster, where people are homeless as we speak. 
   There is a need for government. We have a constitutional responsibility to take care of the public interests. If there ever was a need for the public interest, it is needed in affordable housing. We do not need this kind of amendment that in effect does this, all the studying he may want to say, and I respect the gentleman from North Carolina. I do not question his motives, and I do not dislike him as a person. I just dislike greatly his amendment because his amendment goes, again, at the effort to cut this bill, which is totally designed for the least of us, for people that can't afford it, for people that need our help. 
   That's why we have this measure, and when you look at the marketplace, you cannot apply the activities of the free marketplace dealing with housing and put all of the convertibles you want to put on it as it applies to middle class or upper class individuals. We're not dealing with people with money. We're dealing with people that don't have any money. That's why we're providing this measure to them. 
   So that if your amendment goes into effect, in effect you will be requiring the Director to determine if the GSE's allocations to the fund will decrease the availability or affordability of credit to home buyers or will increase the costs to home buyers. If the Director determines that the GSE's allocation to the fund will decrease the availability or affordability of credit to the home buyer will increase the costs to the home buyers, the requirement to allocate amounts to the funds shall be terminated.     
   All of that power you are putting arbitrarily into a person's hands to say, on his whim, kill the program, done with the program, based upon what he sees and what he says. That's why this bill, this amendment, must be defeated, and we recommend strongly a ``no'' vote on your amendment for that reason. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Committee will rise informally.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. (NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REGISTERED AGENTS AND BROKERS REFORM ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First, I want to thank Chairman Kanjorski of the Capital Markets Subcommittee, as well as Chairman Frank, for working with us and allowing H.R. 5611, the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act, to be considered today. This is, indeed, an important piece of legislation. 
   I was pleased to introduce this bill, along with my good friend, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Davis), as insurance regulatory reform is an issue many involved agree requires action. It, indeed, has been a pleasure to work with Representative Davis on this, who is one of my distinguished colleagues on the Committee on Financial Services. We both believe that this bill is a good starting point for leveling the playing field for insurance agents and brokers. 
   Never before, Mr. Speaker, have we really seen the significance and importance of the financial services industry as we are seeing it today. There are so many, many, many pieces that need to be reformed and looked at and improved upon, and this legislation happens to be one of those pieces. 
   H.R. 5611 will simply establish the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers, which we refer to as NARAB, to provide for nonresident insurance agent and broker licensing while preserving the rights of States to supervise and discipline insurance agents and brokers. The legislation will further benefit consumers through increased competition among agents and brokers, leading to greater consumer choice. 
   This legislation is straightforward. Insurance agents and brokers who are licensed in good standing in their home States can apply for membership in the National Association for Registered Agents and Brokers, NARAB, which will allow them to operate in multiple States. This is very much needed. Membership will be voluntary and not affecting the rights of a nonmember producer under any State license, respecting the sanctity of the State. This legislation will benefit policyholders by increasing marketplace competition and consumer choice by enabling insurance producers to more quickly and responsibly serve the needs of the consumer. 
   A private, nonprofit NARAB entity consisting of State insurance regulators and marketplace representatives will serve as a portal for agents and brokers to obtain nonresident licenses in additional States. This is provided that they pay the required State nonlicensing fees and meet the NARAB standards for membership. 
   This bill would also establish membership criteria which would include standards for personal qualifications, education, training and experience; and further, member applicants must be required to undergo a national criminal background check. And, to be very clear, NARAB would not, I repeat, would not be part of nor report to any Federal agency and would not have any Federal regulatory power. This is being done to streamline and bring greater efficiency and greater choice to consumers. 
   Federal legislation is needed to ensure a reciprocal licensing process for insurance agents and brokers, and Congress already endorsed this concept when we passed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act would have created NARAB if a number of States had not reached a certain number of licensing reciprocity, and although enough reciprocity was provided to avoid the creation of NARAB, it has been brought to my attention and to Mr. Davis' attention by agents across this country that there is a frustration over incomplete insurance licensing reciprocity, and this legislation addresses that important fact. It is abundantly clear that the bar was not set high enough in Gramm-Leach-Bliley, thus the reason behind this important legislation that we are considering today. We, my colleague, Mr. Davis and I, are simply working to ensure an updated version of NARAB. 
   I believe the increased competition among agents and brokers this bill would create will be beneficial to all, and on all accounts, be more fair; and, in addition, lead to greater consumer choice. Mr. Speaker, this is what is important. The bottom line, it is the benefit to the consumer. 
   As more and more agents operate across State lines, this problem of reciprocity has become worse, and it has become apparent to us that true nonresident licensing reform for insurance  agents could only really be achieved through legislation at the Federal level. That is why this Congress is acting today. 
   The NARAB Reform Act that we are looking at today has garnered support from both sides of the aisle, both Democrats and Republicans, with 48 bipartisan cosponsors, and 27 of these cosponsors are Members serving on the Financial Services Committee. 
   Again, I was very much pleased to work with the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Davis) on this legislation which again narrowly targets only the area where there is a problem. We have gone in with a laser beam and simply targeted where there is a problem to fix, and we have done that. 
   Our manager's amendment was recently endorsed by the NAIC, showing that the State insurance regulators believe that this type of legislation is badly needed reform. Other groups that support this bill include the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America, the IIABA; the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisers, the NAIFA; the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, the NAMIC; the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, PCI; and the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers, the CIAB; as well as a number of individual insurance companies. 
   As talks continue on this issue, we are very hopeful for the expansion of our regulatory board to include PIA, the National Association of Professional Insurance Agents. This has been a very inclusive process, Mr. Speaker, working in a very much needed area to bring a greater degree of consumer choice and benefits to the American consumer of insurance products. 
   I am proud to have the opportunity again to work along with my colleagues on the Financial Services Committee and Mr. Davis on this important legislation. And to close, I would just simply urge all of my fellow Members to support H.R. 5611. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Today, I rise in support of H.R. 3019, the Expand and Preserve Home Ownership through Counseling Act. This important legislation establishes an office of housing counseling at the Department of Housing and Urban Development to carry out and to coordinate the responsibilities of the Department with respect to counseling on homeownership and rental housing issues. 
   The House of Representatives has already approved this bipartisan bill in three separate measures that have passed during this Congress. They include H.R. 3915, the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act of 2007; H.R. 5830, the FHA Housing Stabilization and Home Ownership Retention Act of 2008; and the initial House version of H.R. 3221, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008.     
   Given that the Senate has yet to act upon this important housing counseling measure, it is important that the House pass this legislation as a stand-alone bill. 
   HUD's current Housing Counseling Program authorizes HUD to provide or contract with organizations to provide counseling and advice to tenants, homeowners and low and moderate income families on a range of housing issues. However, the current program lacks the stature, organization and prominence in the Department to help ensure that its counseling activities are high quality, widely available and well-coordinated within other Department activities. 
   In the midst of this foreclosure crisis, this extraordinary crisis we are going through at this very moment in our financial markets, there can be no doubt that housing counseling, whether it is pre-purchase or post-purchase, is a vital component of the homeownership process, and I urge this House to support this bill, which will create an Office of Housing Counseling at HUD to better focus the Department's resources in this area. 
   Now, specifically this bill will do the following: It establishes an Office of Housing Counseling to carry out and coordinate the responsibilities of the Department with respect to counseling on homeownership and rental housing issues; it will require and facilitate the coordination of HUD's homeownership and rental housing counseling programs, including programs targeted at low and moderate income individuals, the homeless and senior citizens; it will require the launch of a national public service multi-media campaign to promote housing counseling, including the establishment of a Web site and toll-free hotline; and it will authorize the assurance of homeownership and rental housing counseling grants to HUD-certified State, local and nonprofit organizations. 
   This is an important and critical piece of legislation, and much needed, for all we know that the need for housing counseling far outstrips its current availability. The enactment of H.R. 3019 is a major step in addressing this need in a very comprehensive, thorough, efficient and effective manner, and I urge this full House to support this very important bipartisan home counseling legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, as we conclude this, let me state the appreciation this entire Congress has for the distinguished leadership of Mrs. Biggert on this issue. She has been a pioneer in financial literacy. She has committed a tremendous amount of her time and energy to this bill and to other bills. I want to commend her for that.  
   Another bill which she has provided leadership on has been a financial literacy bill of utmost importance as we see now, and that is K through 12th grade literacy programs, to get them into our schools. I think it is very important for all of us here to know, and the Nation to know, that Mrs. Biggert has provided sterling leadership on this entire issue of financial literacy. I certainly want to say how appreciative we all are for that leadership, Mrs. Biggert. 
   It points out, Mr. Speaker, as we look at where we are today with the downturn of the financial markets, the meltdown of our mortgage industry, at the core of it as we peel back the reasons and the causes we will all find and come to the conclusion that we have a tremendous need for financial literacy and financial education, because the core of our problem is that there are so many complicated and complex entities involved in financing, that we as a nation are coming up short on financial literacy. 
   To you, Mrs. Biggert, I thank you for your leadership on this. It has indeed been a pleasure working with you on this subject, and this bill is a testimonial to your leadership.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, to my distinguished colleagues from Georgia and other Members of Congress who are here, this is indeed a sad occasion. 
   Charlie Norwood led an extraordinary life. He was a combat veteran. He was a dentist. He pulled himself up by his own bootstraps, truly a son of the South, a son of Georgia. 
   He is a person that cared about all of the people of Georgia. Let me give you an example, if I may. I remember when I was serving in the Georgia legislature as a State senator, and we needed some help for the Morehouse School of Medicine's National Primary Care Center. The person that led the fight up here to secure the Federal dollars for the Morehouse School of Medicine's Primary National Care Center was Charlie Norwood. And we thank him for that. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I think of Charlie Norwood, and I think of so many of the great debates and the battles that we have had up here that we have shared, I am reminded of a great conversation that took place between two great men, Abraham Lincoln and Robert E. Lee. It was at a time when this Nation was going through its great Civil War and how to fix that. That conversation went like this. Robert E. Lee said, it is not incumbent upon us to complete the task. And Abraham Lincoln said, nor are we free to desist from doing all we possibly can. 
   That was the essence of Charlie Norwood. We might not have to complete this task, to make America a better place, but neither are we free to desist from doing all we possibly can. 
   Charlie, we appreciate you. You fought the good fight. You stayed the course. And for you, God has put up an extraordinary crown of righteousness. We thank you, and we thank God for passing our way.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. (ALLOWING EXCEPTION FROM $1 COIN DISPENSING CAPABILITY REQUIREMENT -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3703. This is a very timely and important piece of legislation because as you may recall, the Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005 requires retailers, including vending machines that are located on Federal property, to both accept and disburse $1 coins by January of 2008. We are talking about 7 weeks from now. That brings about the urgency and the timeliness of the matter. 
   This requirement additionally applies to transit systems, military bases, and those that take Federal subsidies. Now, while most vending machines are already programmed and able to accept $1 coins, there are very few that are programmed to dispense $1 coins. So that is why this legislation is needed, to exempt those vending machines from dispensing requirements that do not have a reason to dispense the $1 coins in the first place. 
   So that in effect, Mr. Speaker, if we do not pass this bill, we will have unintendedly affected a hindrance of the circulation of the coins by compelling them to be stored in vending machines that will never dispense them. This legislation targets machines that have only $1 in currency and exchange. So you can see there will never be a need for the machine to dispense $1 coins. 
   We believe that these Presidential $1 coins are very important. They should be circulated. The public should circulate them, but certainly having them stored in a vending machine from which they will never be dispensed is not the way to do that. That is why we need this bill. I ask that the House urgently pass this measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 3505, is the Securities Law Technical Corrections Act, and it consists entirely of technical and clerical amendments to the Federal securities laws which were requested by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a minor part of a larger legislative agenda. Included are the Security Act of 1934, the Investment Act of 1940 and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. 
   Mr. Speaker, periodically we in Congress should review our laws in order to make sure that they are current and that they are up to date. Furthermore, this bill addresses certain changes to be made to reduce confusion. We want  to ensure that the laws we pass are current, and periodically clarifying certain aspects of these somewhat complex and complicated laws is a very valuable undertaking. 
   The amendments made by this bill correct drafting errors and remove obsolete references to the Public Utilities Holding Company Act of 1935, which was repealed in 2005. It further corrects numbering and punctuation errors. There are several technical changes that need to be made to the bill, as introduced, one to correct statutory citations and punctuation and also for clarification. 
   Mr. Speaker, as security laws are very complicated, very complex and highly technical, and with many of these laws having been written in the 1930s and the 1940s, periodic overview is very, very important and essential to the financial security of our great Nation, and this, Mr. Speaker, is the purpose of this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. (NATIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST FUND ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Chairman Frank, let me commend you for the excellent leadership you have provided on this issue. 
   Mr. Chairman, never before in the history of this country, the United States of America, have we had as great a need for affordable housing as we need right now.     
   We have just come out of perhaps the most devastating storm and natural disaster in the history of our country and the greatest need in that area, not just in the gulf area, but rippling throughout this country as a result of that is affordable housing. 
   And, Mr. Chairman, one in seven households now spend more than 50 percent of their income on housing, and on any given night in America, across the width and breadth of this country, nearly 1 million of our people are homeless, including men, women, and children, and nowhere is it targeted to the elderly and the low income. 
   So what are we doing with this affordable housing trust fund? We're responding to the hue and the cry of the American people, for we need to make sure that we have affordable housing. 
   Now, yes, we have the HOME program. And there may be coming an amendment on here to strike what we're doing and make it a part of the HOME program. And the HOME program has done some good things, but it does not do the most important things that this country needs now, building and constructing new homes. The HOME program doesn't target that, nor does the HOME program target those in most basic need, the lower income and the disabled. 
   Now, let me just explain for my remaining time because I want to show precisely and explain how this trust fund is funded. This is very important. We've had a lot of things said today. This is how it is funded. 
   It's funded with moneys from the proposed GSE affordable housing fund, H.R. 1427, which we passed. It also funds it from the Federal Housing Administration, FHA, savings that result from the enactment of the expanding of the American homeownership program. And it does not go or cost any money. It's pay-as-you-go and does not add to the Federal deficit. 
   The estimated numbers from these funding sources will result in an initial allocation of $800 million to $1 billion to the States and local communities for affordable housing funds, with a 60-40 match with the States and the local governments. 
   Furthermore, not only will these moneys be used for construction, the moneys will be used for rehabilitation. They will be very diverse in usage, acquisition, preservation and operating assistance. These moneys will also be used for both rental housing and for down payments and costs for closing assistance for first-time homebuyers, very, very important considerations. 
   So we're going to hear a lot from the other side, and I respect my friends on the Republican side, but it is us on the Democratic side that are clearly responding to the needs of the American people here. 
   We're creating, yes, and we're expanding. Why? Because the problem has expanded. As I said at the outset, 1 million people every night homeless. We've been ratcheted from one end of this country to the other for displaced people from Katrina, and God knows what else is going to happen with the global warming and the global climate changing. There could be more. 
   No, this is a great program. It's a program that is needed. The timing is right, and the American people are expecting us to respond, and the best way to respond to the American people is to establish this affordable housing trust fund.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, there is probably, timing-wise, no greater, no more important piece of legislation for the protection of this country than this TRIA risk insurance program. It is very important that I just start my remarks by responding to some of the concerns that the gentleman raised. 
   First of all, in our Financial Services Committee, this is indeed a bipartisan product. Republicans and Democrats worked on this together. This is also a bicameral institution. It is important for the House to have its input. It is important for the Senate to have its input. 
   As a timing matter, it is critically important for us to make sure that we have incorporated into this legislation important issues that the Senate has left out. So what we have before us, Mr. Speaker, is simply a joint product. We asked for the conference. The conference was not permitted. So we have no other choice except to take what the Senate has offered, and we are accepting that. But there are some other important points of this legislation that need to be incorporated into this bill. And so this revised bill is not a repudiation of what the Senate has done. It is an acceptance of what the Senate has done. And it is also recognizing and acquiescing to some of the issues that they raised that we agreed with. The nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological we agreed with that we would not include. 
   So what do we have here? And I think it is important for the American people to know exactly this product that we have that we are putting forward at this point. This revised bill would extend TRIA for 7 years just as the Senate favors. Now, we in the House asked for a 15-year renewal for this. You talk about stability. You talk about making sure that we are responding. This is a heavy, heavy issue with the terrorist attack. 
   We also feel genuinely that if we are going to offer this insurance protection for property, for buildings, my Lord, the most valuable commodity that we lose in a terrorist attack is human life. Group life insurance should be included in this. We are just simply taking what the Senate has offered and again extending back and saying group life insurance must be offered in this bill. The reset mechanism and lowering of the trigger, the Senate wants $100 million. We say $50 million to increase the capacity by encouraging smaller insurers to provide coverage. This is very important as well. And as Chairman Frank just mentioned, life insurance for foreign travel. Why shouldn't people who decide they want to go to a somewhat dangerous destination as Israel have that life insurance covered? So we are certainly adding the reset mechanism for significant terrorist attacks, over $1 billion, to lower the deductibles and triggers to rebuild market capacity and then gradually increase private sector obligations over time. 
   We took a lot of time, my colleague. I am on the Financial Services Committee. We have worked very hard. We had hearings on it. We heard from every factor of the community in the financial services, and this product that we offer reflected that. All we are simply saying is, timing is important. But why not allow the House, which has just as much right as the Senate, to perfect this important legislation? We are taking what they want, we have accepted some of the things that they felt were excesses, and we are simply adding these four major components back to the bill, reset mechanism, group life insurance, lowering the trigger and life insurance coverage for foreign travel.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it baffles me when, on this floor, we, who are Members of the House of Representatives, so quickly, so easily want to abdicate our responsibilities to the Senate. No wonder the Senate does what it does. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, we're not going to abdicate our responsibilities to the Senate. The Founders of this Constitution and this country dedicated two  Houses, one, the Senate, that runs every 6 years, and they made a distinct decision to have the Members of the House of Representatives run every other year because the power of the House closest to the people is that House that the people look to to be most responsive to the day-to-day delicacies of their needs. This is what we're doing here. And the day-to-day delicacies says we've got to pass the most significant, the most meaningful terrorism risk insurance program possible. There's no greater threat we face. 
   My colleagues on the other side have said, well, why can't the private sector do this? The private sector has come to us. We don't know how catastrophic these events may be. But one thing is for certain, Mr. Speaker, we must not allow the terrorists to shut down and destroy our economy. And unless we have this backstop, the insurers have said they cannot rebuild. 
   Not only that, the insurers have come to us, who we've got to listen to, to say we need this backstop so that the economy will be stable. Perhaps we may not need to use it. Let us hope and let us pray that we will not have to.     
   But, Mr. Speaker, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and we must prepare for the storm before the hurricane is raging. 
   This is not a giveaway program. This is not a subsidy program. This is an insurance program, insurance that we hope and we pray that we will not need. But if we do, it is the House of Representatives who are responding to say, We need to insure life, not just property. You ask the American people. Property you can get again and again. Buildings you can rebuild. But a life, a life is gone like that and must be insured. 
   This is the House of Representatives speaking, and I urge passage of this bill.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Neal, I want to thank you and Chairman Rangel for your leadership on this extremely important bill. 
   There are several points I would like to make. First of all, my good friends, my Republicans on the other side of the aisle, it must be clear. There's no question about it. What the Republicans want to do is borrow the money to pay for this tax from China, from Japan, and have our children and grandchildren pay for it. But they don't want to just stop there. They also want to protect those wealthy 1 percent who are using tax loopholes to hide their money away from taxation in offshore accounts. That is what our Republican colleagues want to do. 
   We, on the Democratic side, want to look at this in the responsible way, as the American people expect. We have to provide tax relief for 23 million American families. How to do that is most assuredly to pay for it. And we're doing it by closing these offshore loopholes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Madam Speaker, this issue boils down to a practicality of ideology. The Republicans and the Bush administration has repeatedly shown that they really quite honestly do not get it when it comes down to health care, and particularly for those who need the health care the most. This is not just the beginning of this. This argument started back during the winter when there were 17 States who came up short, and we fought and we fought to try to get that shortage fixed. But there was no help until I drafted an amendment, went to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murtha), and we attached it to the Iraq war supplemental. That is the only way President Bush and the administration signed it. 
   Now, let me just point out two important points. There are scare tactics being used here. Anytime the Republicans and those on the other side want to score a point, they bring up the bogeyman of illegal immigration; these people are going to be illegal aliens. There's nothing in this bill. As a matter of fact, there's express language that prohibits in this bill any illegal immigrant or undocumented person from being eligible for this children's health program. 
   You talk about there are adults on the bill. There are no adults on this bill except an adult who happens to be pregnant with child for prenatal care. Should they not have that care? That strikes at the heart of this bill. 
   I urge everyone to not go with this sad argument and let's sustain and override this veto coming up on January 23.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. (THE STATE OF OUR ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I appreciate this opportunity to address the House for a few moments. 
   I think it's very appropriate for us to pause for a moment here and just reflect on where we are as a Nation and as a people when it comes to our economy and our financial House. This April 15, it's Tax Day. It's important  that this House of Representatives be mindful of the difficulties that the American people are faced with. 
   Madam Speaker, millions of American people and families are absolutely hanging on by their fingernails. They're on the verge of losing their homes. Many have already. And so much of it has been because of bad policies by their government. It is important for us to understand that, Madam Speaker, so much of this could possibly have been prevented had we moved quicker, had we made different policies. 
   This is a very sobering time. Two major events happened today. One is, the American people, many are in line at post offices as we speak trying to meet the midnight deadline to pay their taxes. Others are struggling to do so. Others are having difficulty even beginning to comprehend the complexities, the complications of a tax code that even if they sat down to read it, it would take them over 1 year trying to read the tax code, let alone trying to understand it, just the volume of trying to read it. 
   And Madam Speaker, we in Congress must take into consideration how difficult that is, the fact that the American people, many are not even taking the credits or getting the deductions that they should have because they don't understand it. Twenty-five percent of American families that are entitled to the Earned Income Tax Credit don't even get it because they don't understand how to do it. 
   Last year, over 65 percent of American families had to get a private person from the outside to come help them with their taxes. That has increased up 25 percent, since just 10 years ago it was 40. And in 1950, it was just 20 percent that did that. The complexity of our tax code is just out of whack. Many are gathered around the kitchen tables right now trying to find out how they're going to have ends meet. 
   And Madam Speaker, the other phenomenal event in our economy that took place today was the merger of Delta Airlines and Northwest Airlines, making the largest airline company in the world. That is certainly room to celebrate, but it's very important that we be very mindful to both Delta and Northwest to understand the implications of that, to have the sensitivity that there are many thousands of families that are impacted, and that we do not use the word ``synergy'' to equate with a loss of jobs, but that there are no jobs lost. 
   We in Congress must have the empathy of putting ourselves into the mindset of the American people, and we must show that we understand the difficulties that the American people are faced with; we understand the difficulties of knowing when they wake up the next morning, their car may be repossessed, they may have a foreclosure notice. 
   Our policies must be, here in this House of Representatives going forward, to keep Americans in their homes, even if it means coming up with the policies and moving as fast as we can. If we could move with lickety-split speed to save Wall Street, Bear Stearns, and Madam Speaker, I believe that was the right thing to do because, had we not, global markets would have cascaded and we would have had an extraordinary world calamity in the financial markets, but just as aggressively as we moved with those policies that helped Wall Street and Bear Stearns, we must move to help our homeowners and our families. 
   And then finally, Madam Speaker, the real elephant facing us in the room, the real looming threat economically and financially to this country is our overwhelming debt. Madam Speaker, it is staggering to look at the debt that we are in. Every dime we are spending is on borrowed money. And we have spent, Madam Speaker, as I conclude, in the last 5 or 6 years, more money from foreign governments than in the entire history of this country. 
   Madam Speaker, that's the state of our economy. And it's very important that we reflect it from the perspective of the American people. And I thank you for this opportunity.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5719, TAXPAYER ASSISTANCE AND SIMPLIFICATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. This is an important bill and a timely bill. This is a bill that is due as a gift to the American people on this day which is referred to as Tax Day, April 15. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, this bill simplifies the Tax Code. It also deals with antiharassment. It also deals with making sure that companies who do business in foreign lands are not using offshore accounts as scams to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. 
   And most importantly, Mr. Speaker, it deals with the simplification of the code and applies that to those people  who need it the most, because so many people, Mr. Speaker, are not even getting the advantages and getting their due from paying the taxes because of the fact that our Tax Code is so complicated. It is so complex. And this bill streamlines that. 
   Now let me take just a few minute to go through some very salient points. The Government Accountability Office estimates that Americans overpaid their taxes by over $1 billion a year because they failed to claim deductions. This bill deals with that. About a quarter of Americans who are eligible for the earned income tax credit failed to claim that due to its complexity. 
   But what this bill does, Mr. Speaker, is it makes the Tax Code simpler and fairer. It strengthens the IRS's outreach program to make sure that people know that they are entitled to the tax refunds and to payments earned under the earned income tax credit. As I mentioned, there are 25 percent of households who are eligible for the earned income tax credit in 1999 that did not even claim it. And working Americans may have lost out on approximately $8 billion. This bill corrects that. 
   And one of the most important measures of this bill, Mr. Speaker, is that the American people are tired of the harassment. They are tired of the phone calls, the abuse by these private collectors in which jobs are outsourced by the IRS to go collect the Federal debt. We have talked with the IRS. We have talked with the commissioner of the IRS. And he agrees with us that that can best be done not by outsourcing these jobs out, but by having the IRS employees collect that debt. Personal financial information of our American people is too precious and it is too confidential to be in the hands of private contractors on the outside. 
   And just very quickly, Mr. Speaker, we have foreign companies like KBR that are working and having millions of dollars of contracts servicing in Iraq. But they are using offshore accounts to hide that money to make sure that they do not have to pay the important taxes that go to Medicaid and to Medicare, not only not paying their fair share, Mr. Speaker, and hundreds of millions of dollars, but not even allowing their employees to qualify for Medicare and for Social Security. This bill corrects that. 
   And another important area, Mr. Speaker, is the new taxpayer protections against identity theft and tax fraud. It cracks down on misleading web sites that seek to get personal information by using their web sites and imitating and pretending that they are the IRS. Now Mr. Speaker, the American people are certainly fed up with being abused by these private collectors, being abused by these Web siters who are posing themselves as IRS agents. 
   This is a very important measure. I support this rule going forward. This is a very important bill, giving the taxpayers a due recognition, making the Tax Code simpler, and making sure it is fair for all. It is a good bill. I support this bill rule, and let's pass this bill and move it forward.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. To my distinguished colleague from Georgia, I want to commend you on your excellent leadership on this very, very important and timely piece of legislation. A lot has been said here today. The two points of contention that the other side has brought have been in two areas. And let me just speak to those directly so that we can get to the facts of the matter. 
   Now the other side says that they are opposed to the health savings accounts compliance. Now, what we are saying on our side is this: The health savings accounts are set up for the purpose of helping our constituents with health care services. Now if that is the case, then it is very important that we set up a mechanism so that we can check the abuses of that. They are not set up for them to go and to use those accounts for massage parlors, for country clubs, for other issues and areas, and escort services. 
   So it is important for us to be able to simply do this. The bill simply requires the reporting of a holder of the health service account of any funds used for nonhealth care purposes in order to reduce the tax gap. That's simple. 
   Now, ladies and gentlemen, the American people are holding on by their fingernails in this terrible economy. And you may laugh and scorn about this being April 15. Of course it is April 15. And it is a day that the American people's minds are totally focused on their personal finances. And it is important that this House of Representatives respond in a way that responds to that interest. And so we are closing the gap.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. So it is very important. And let me get to the other area very quickly, and that is the area of these private contractors. We have received complaint after complaint after complaint from your constituents and our constituents who have been abused by calls. Let me give you one example of an elderly couple that was called 150 times, Madam Speaker, including five times in one day, asking for a taxpayer. And it comes to find out that they are innocent. 
   Again, the GAO found out that debt collectors were placing over 1 million calls to innocent people just to reach 35,000 taxpayers. The Federal Trade Commission had 130 complaints as of last year giving unaccountable private tax collectors the right to look into and examine personal financial information of our taxpayers. It is wrong. 
   Now let me tell you this, that the commissioner of the IRS himself, Mr. Douglas Sherman, has asked for this legislation. Madam Speaker, I just simply say that if the IRS is asking for this, that they could do a better job, they are the ones who we are holding responsible. We should make sure we pass this legislation and let the IRS do their job of collecting the taxes and not hand it off to these private bounty hunters.

   This supplemental has over $4 billion more than what the President asked for in everything. I'll tell you what this supplemental is about.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. Again, it is a great privilege to address this House in the Special Order for the Blue Dog Democratic Coalition, and we are delighted to do so. 
   This is a very critical time in the juncture of our Nation. We are faced with a ballooning debt. We have an overextended military. We are in the midst of a very controversial war. It is paramount that Congress not just weigh in, but weigh in heavily as due our constitutional obligations. 
   As we all know, the Constitution speaks very clearly on this matter. In Article I, Section 8, it speaks very clearly that it is exclusively Congress' responsibility when it comes to military action and foreign policy.     
   And that is this: it says that only Congress has the exclusive right to determine the purse strings. In other words, the exact verbiage in the Constitution is ``to raise and support the military.'' And then, secondly, to legislate. And quite naturally, it gave the executive branch comparative duties in a time of war. 
   You know, Madam Speaker, in preparation for this time on the floor, I went back into the Constitution because I wanted to examine how this came about. And if you go back in the Constitution around 1787, if I am not mistaken, there was a great debate on how to handle the question of war and foreign policy facing our Nation. And it was handled by two of our greatest Founding Fathers, one was Alexander Hamilton and the other was James Madison. 
   But you know, Madam Speaker, it was a peculiar circumstance that neither Hamilton nor Madison used their names. That struck me as very strange. Hamilton wrote under the name of Pacificus, and Madison wrote under the name of Helvidius. And I wondered about that. Why? But it was only on this profound question. Because it was so heavily debated, it was so heavily controversial that neither party wanted the public to know exactly who was saying what. But it was very important that they agree on the substance to leave this issue very flexible. 
   But the one important point that they made was it would be the Congress, and expressly the House of Representatives of the Congress, that would have the final say so on the money end and on the legislative end, and that is what we are here to do today. For the American people are looking to this Congress to indeed weigh in. And Hamilton and Madison will smile kindly on us today. 
   Leading off our discussion, Madam Speaker, is one of our distinguished Members, one of our cochairs for communications, one of my dear friends from the great State of Arkansas, Representative Mike Ross.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. You hit upon a point here that the American people need to be aware of as to exactly why we need to pass our bill. I have before me what I would like to share with you, this report from today's Washington Post. It is a story by Ms. Ann Scott Tyson. It is a disheartening story, but it points right to the core of why we need to be doing something very urgent to bring accountability and the total lack of accountability that this administration has had. And this is about our veterans, those who are right off the battlefield. 
   And, Mr. Ross, just like you, we both just came from Germany where we went into Landstuhl and we went into the military hospital near the Ramstein Air Base. And our hearts were broken as we saw 19- and 18- and 20-year-old kids, these are young kids, folks, who are out there at the point of the spear, sacrificing their lives in the middle of a civil war. And when they come back to get treated, here is the report. She says: ``Thousands of soldiers wounded in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have overwhelmed the Army system for evaluating their eligibility for disability benefits, leading to a near total failure to complete such reviews in a timely manner.'' 
   And this is what the services Inspector General concluded in a report released yesterday. The report found this, Mr. Ross, it found that medical hold facilities lack critical staff, formalized training for personnel caring for wounded soldiers, with more than half of unit commanders reporting inadequate, our commanders on the ground are reporting inadequate for our soldiers. This is no way to treat our warriors. 
   It also cited inadequate and unreliable databases for tracking the wounded, not even able to keep track of them. This is why we need our accountability act. This is why we need to have oversight and strong oversight on this administration. We are not talking about something here that doesn't exist. This is a serious problem that goes at the core and the soul of America, and that is our young men and women. Their lives are too precious, their blood is too precious to be sacrificed. Then when they do the sacrifice, they are not taken care of. 
   Just listen to this: some facilities lack wheelchair access, which is directly in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, is going on right now under this administration.     
   That meant that wounded soldiers even had difficulty reaching the restroom. This is the same administration, my friends, this is no wonder why we have this. If you recall, they were sent into war without body armor. Our soldiers, 2 years ago, were going through dung heaps and land mines out in the desert trying to find metal to protect themselves. 
   I said to you, and you and I both agreed when we were over there in Germany, we were going to do everything we could when we got back here to make sure we passed this bill and give the proper attention to our wounded and our veterans. 
   You know, the Lord moves in strange and mysterious ways, and I am convinced that is why the exposure of that terrible situation at Walter Reed was made real at this very time to show the Congress and the American people we need this accountability law.

The reports have been there, in the news. They have covered it left and right, and, meanwhile, our soldiers don't even have wheelchair access. 
   This administration has a day of atonement on this, and history is not going to smile kindly on the abuse that was heaped upon our military and the strain and the drain that it is causing. You mentioned earlier, Mr. Ross, about Halliburton, and in just yesterday's news Halliburton's reward to us for all of the billions of dollars that they have gotten in taxpayers' money was to move their headquarters from the United States over into Dubai in the Middle East so that they could get out from under paying certain levels of taxes in this country. 
   No wonder the American people are crying out. No wonder the American people went to the polls in November and declared in a loud voice, enough of this, we want change, and they put Democrats in charge of this Congress. They, indeed, as I said earlier in my remarks, wanted Alexander Hamilton and James Madison to smile kindly, because finally we are standing up and performing the constitutional duties of oversight, of legislation and controlling the purse that they fought hard to put into the Constitution over two centuries ago. 
   Now I would like to yield time to my distinguished friend from Ohio, from Steubenville, Ohio, the home of one of my most favorite singers, Dean Martin, and I would like to present Representative Charlie Wilson.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Will the gentleman yield for one moment, and don't you agree, there is such a thirst on the part of the American people for their confidence to be restored in this process, that was what was evident in last fall's election, that nobody is saying cut and run, nobody is saying that you will be unpatriotic if you speak to this. They want us to speak to this. They want us to do our job, and I think that is what you were pointing out in your remarks. 
   One of the two points I wanted to mention too that you alluded to in our House Resolution 97, that I would like for you to be able to expand upon, and that is that the American people need to know that in this bill we will require the inspector generals of the Defense Department, of the Pentagon, to come before this Congress quarterly, not once a year, every 90 days, quarterly, to make reports on how the money is being spent. 
   Never again, never again, will our veterans be suffering in the condition  that our veterans are suffering now. The American people are appalled at that. They want some transparency. They want some accountability. 
   You talked about earlier, we talked about Halliburton. We talked about the abuse, the contracting. In this bill, we have made sure that the Inspector General for the Iraqi Reconstruction Program comes before this Congress and gives quarterly reports on how that money is being spent, no more waste, no more fraud, no more war profiteering. The shame of the neglect of oversight is going to be rectified with this bill. 
   I yield back to the gentleman.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Thank you very much, Congressman Wilson. Your comments and your participation is so meaningful in helping us bring some light to this issue, especially in extrapolating and explaining to the American people the legislation that we are putting forward. I look forward to you staying with us as we perhaps get into a few more conversations on this issue. 
   But we are also joined with another Member, a distinguished member of our Blue Dog Coalition and a very good friend and who is a very, very significant voice in this Congress in bringing some truth and some transparency so that we can improve the position of our military and make sure that we are responsive to the American people, and that is Mr. John Salazar from Colorado, a very distinguished Member and a hard-working member of the Blue Dog Coalition and a great friend. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado as much time as he may need.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Would the gentleman yield just for one point because I think it is very important. You bring up this important point that we need to remind the people of America that when that came to our attention, it was Democrats, Democrats who provided the leadership with the amendment to put into the spending bill money for the body armor; that we could have known about the shortage if there was oversight, if that Congress, the Republican Congress, would not just automatically just bend over and rubber stamp. That is why this bill is so important, that we don't have that bypassing with this special emergency supplemental way of funding a war. 
   And I go back to the Constitution, the Founding Fathers, and that is why they gave it to us because the House of Representatives is the House that is closest to the people. We were more sensitive, just as you and I are now, to do everything we can to correct this matter. And we also put in there money to reimburse their parents. So many of our soldiers were writing home to mama and to daddy asking them for money for body armor. The shame of this country. Never again will that happen. And that is why we need this bill. 
   I yield back to the gentleman.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Well, thank you, Mr. Salazar. You have done extraordinarily well in presenting the very crucible of our bill, which is bringing the accountability, bringing the needed transparency. No more, no place is it needed more so than in the care of our wounded soldiers. 
   And so much has fallen through the cracks. I read this report. I just want to, I will go back to it for a moment, Mr. Salazar, because it says this. It says that more than 25,000 service members have been wounded in the two wars, and nearly half seriously enough that they can not return to duty within 72 hours. The delays in the Army's rating of disability have been a source of deep frustration for many, with wounded soldiers waiting hours to be moved on, days, and sometimes months to be moved on with their lives outside the military. Many in the 
   National Guard themselves have lost their jobs. We have yet to even come to the depths of the pain that our soldiers are faced with as a result of this. 
   So when the President says send 21,000 more in, send these in, he never again, this President will never again have to go before the voters. But you do and I do. And when we go back before them, they will know that we have done everything in our power to bring a right look on a wrong situation, and to correct this terrible, terrible imbalance for our veterans. 
   And so I thank you for your participation, and I thank you for highlighting that great need. I appreciate your passion for this. We are very, very, pleased for your presentation. 
   Madam Speaker, before I bring in another person, I want to make a point, because I think it is very important that we take a moment to address what the leadership of the Democratic Party in this House of Representatives is really talking about in our legislation. We had, prior to this, a truth squad, and you have people who are trying to make it this or make it that. 
   We realize, as Democrats, that we have an obligation to fulfill the desires and the wishes of the American people for a change in direction in Iraq, among other places, but definitely in Iraq. And it is not an easy thing to do. But it is, as I pointed out earlier, in our exclusive power to legislate and to appropriate and to provide the oversight. That is critical. And this is what we are proposing in our troop readiness, veterans, health, and Iraq accountability act. This is what the talk is about. 
   Let me just, point by point, go through the points so we understand. As the war in Iraq enters its fifth year, with no end in sight, that is fundamentally the most worrisome thing on the minds of the American people. This has gone on longer than World War II. There has never been the clear mission, beyond go and find if they have got weapons of mass destruction. When the soldiers went and they determined that they didn't, that should have ended it. There was no authorization to go in and remove a regime. There were no Iraqis that marched on the Capitol in Washington and said bring us a democracy. Democracy is hard. It requires people to want it in their gut. We are dealing with a society and a region in the Middle East where these civil wars have been going on, in some shape or form, since Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Abraham and Sarah and Hagar, Ishmael, Esau, the prophet Mohammed and his son-in-law, which brought about the split of the Sunnis and the Shias. Thousands of years, that is what this is. 
   Our children have no business losing their lives in this war. The President has asked that money continue to be provided with no strings attached. The American people want some strings attached. The reason is because as we just got through doing, with what is happening at Walter Reed, with what is happening to our veterans, with the fact of no body armor. We are not going without being rested and properly equipped, well after the American people have called for a new direction. That set the stage for what we are going to offer in this bill. 
   And I want to come back to that, and I want to pause for a moment because we do have another one of our distinguished Members with us, and he has been working very hard as a member of the Blue Dogs and has also been working very hard in this area of bringing transparency and accountability to the situation in Iraq and responding to the needs of the American people. And I want to recognize for as much time as he may need, Congressman Mahoney of Florida.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. I thank Congressman Mahoney. You brought some excellent points up about the need for us to make sure that this funding goes through the normal appropriations process. It might be useful for us to just share with our American people, when we say the normal, the regular appropriations process, is that this President has up to this point funded this war, which has lasted now longer than World War II, on emergency supplementals. And what that does is it foregoes oversight, it doesn't allow Congress to do the job that it has done. And this is why I believe in strong  measure this Congress has changed hands. The American people want to see us do our job and bring about the transparency. And that is what is involved in both House Resolution 97 as well as in our leadership bill on the supplemental, the full supplemental bill that we are working on as well. And I certainly thank the gentleman.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. We are very pleased to have you, and we certainly thank you for bringing those points and for adding to the discussion. 
   As I stated before, I wanted to just share as we go through this, as we talk about House Resolution 97 and our bill on the supplemental, it is important to understand so that we are not caught up in all of this rhetoric and misinformation about what the Democrats are doing, it is very important to understand our shared principles in this legislation and fully funding our national defense. This bill fully funds and supports our troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and we are upholding these points, requiring the President to simply honor the standards the Department of Defense has set for troop readiness, for training, for equipment. We have just seen that many of our troops have gone into harm's way without the body equipment that they need. What is wrong with making sure that our troops are protected, that they have the body armor? That is what the Democratic plan does. What is wrong with making sure that they are rested and that they are ready? That is what the Democratic plan does. We want to send our young men into harm's way? Make sure they are protected, make sure they are ready and that they are rested, and to make sure that they have been trained. And on each one of those counts, Madam Speaker, this administration has fallen short, and the American people know it, and that is the central core of the bill. 
   Secondly, we have got to hold the Iraqi government to the same standards for progress that the President outlined in announcing the escalation. The President made certain standards. All we are doing is reaffirming these in the legislation so that we have those standards. And then, providing urgently needed support to address the military medical care crisis for our veterans at Walter Reed and other hospitals. And that is why the American people are out in front of us and support wholeheartedly what the Democratic proposal is. 
   Let me continue, if I may, on what it is that we are doing so the American people can be clear. 
   On those three points, just simply requiring the President to honor the standards that the Defense Department sets for their military to be ready, that they have rest, that they have equipment. What can be more plain and commonsense than that? And then holding the Iraqis to the same standards that he put forward in support of the escalation he asked for. And then, thirdly, to provide the urgently needed support to address the military medical care and crisis at Walter Reed and other hospitals that I just got through alluding to and the excellent report in the Washington Post today. 
   The need for accountability on Iraq is clear. Holding the President to his own military readiness policies and performance standards is certainly a good way to start. The alternative is only the President's open-ended commitment in this war, and that is one thing we cannot continue. Our children's lives are too precious, our tax dollars are too precious to continue to be pouring in an open-ended policy. We have got to find a way to bring this matter to conclusion, not in any kind of way of, as the opponents would say, my friends on the other side of the aisle, cut and run. That is all they can say. We want to be there until victory. 
   Well, what is victory? What is victory if it is not what we set out what we were to do in the very beginning, finds weapons of mass destruction, which we did, and they are no longer there? Iraq did not attack this country. This country was attacked by al Qaeda. And al Qaeda is in Afghanistan on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Osama bin Ladin is there on the Pakistan side. I was there. I went over to Pakistan, I went over to Afghanistan. I talked with President Karzai. They know where they are. What are we doing in Iraq, and why did we go? 
   The Congress is working hard to achieve consensus around these shared principles. And let me just say, politics is no easy business. Making laws is sort of making sausage: It is not the prettiest thing in the world. But it is our system. It is give and it is take. It is trying to get 218 votes. It is pulling coalitions together. And that is why you see legislation with the variety of different components in it. But there are some standards here, and we hope that the President will join us in the effort to protect our troops in the field, require accountability from the Iraqi government, and fix the care crisis for our wounded soldiers and our veterans. And, finally, understand that he isn't the only one on the ball field. We all have a role to play. 
   The Founding Fathers made our position clear, and that clarity is speaking on this floor today. 
   And now I want to recognize another one of the distinguished Members from New Hampshire (Ms. PORTER) who is doing just a wonderful job, and we thank you for coming on the floor and being a part of our debate and discussion. 
   I yield as much time as she may need to Ms. Porter from New Hampshire.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Well stated. Eloquent and very well stated. And you touched on so many important issues. The strain on our military; and the young lady was so poignant in that. And American people need to understand that, how much more can our military take? Every person, even when the issue was put forward when General Casey and General Abizaid came over here, our Armed Services Committee, I think you may have been on that committee, asked them: Do you need more troops? No, we don't need any more troops. That was just in November. And something changed just in about 30 or 50 days, for all of a sudden now it came. 
   And I want to thank the young lady for your statement. It was very well stated and hit all of the points right on the head in terms of the direction we need to go. And the American people are definitely in step with us. 
   Madam Speaker, I thank you for the time. Please remember this is our Blue Dog hour, and we appreciate the opportunity to talk.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentleman, Mr. Speaker, this bill requires our urgent action to override the President's veto. The American people are concerned about many, many things, but they are most concerned about the high cost of food and the high cost of gasoline. And as soon as this bill is made into law, we will deal with these two issues right away. 
   The first thing that this bill does to address the high cost of food and the high cost of gasoline is that we immediately look at the corn-based ethanol, and we reduce the tax credits on corn-based ethanol and we increase the tax credits on ethanol made from cellulosic materials, which are switch grass and pine straw. 
   The other reason why we need to make sure we override this veto is simply because, Mr. Speaker, this bill will reach out and bring in individual segments of our population that were left out. The African American farmers are entitled to their due, and this bill will require that African American farmers who in the past have been discriminated against will have this, and it provides millions of dollars for traditionally African American schools. That is why it is important that we override the veto of this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. (HONORING THE MEMORY OF WARREN G. DAVIS -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise on this occasion to first of all say how much I appreciate this opportunity to address my colleagues and the Nation and to talk for just a few moments on a good and decent person, a great American. His name is Warren G. Davis. 
   Warren G. Davis passed away a few days ago. He was more than just an ordinary person. God blesses us with many blessings. But there is no greater blessing that he blesses you with than that to have a friend, a friend for life. And that is what Warren G. Davis meant to me and our friendship. 
   Warren G. Davis comes out of Texas. He was born out of Refugio, Texas, near Victoria and near Corpus Christi, a man of God from the very beginning. Warren Davis was a loving husband to his wife of over 38 years, Linda. He was a loving father to his two sons, Brad and Warren Junior. He was a loving brother to Fred Davis and his cousin Harold Martin. And of course his mother, his father and his entire beloved family mourns this hour. 
   But let me just say, Mr. Speaker, that not only his family mourns, his immediate family, for this young man touched many lives. In his community of South Lake, Texas, he played such an important role as a community leader, for Warren not only gave to his family, but he gave to his extended family and his entire community. He served on the school board of South Lake from 1993 to 1996. He was a member of the Red Creek Community Association. As a matter of fact, he served as its president. He was also a member of the very elite community group called the Dragons Council. It was no ordinary group, for this is an elite fan-based booster group for the young people in that community and supported the South Lake teams. 
   To show you a measure of his commitment, over the many years Warren G. Davis never missed a single game. He gave so much of his life to this community. 
   Warren Davis and I go back from the very beginning of our college careers. He has been a friend for over 45 years to me, Mr. Speaker, for in 1963 we both went to Florida A&M University where this young man was also my college roommate for 4 years. We pledged fraternity together, the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity; oh, did he love Alpha Phi Alpha, and we pledged the Beta Nu Chapter. We affectionately referred to ourselves as the 12 disciples. But Warren Davis was the enforcer of our group. He was the glue that kept us together. He learned very early to work with different people. He not only was there as a fraternity person, but also worked early in the student movement when we had the task of integrating many of the public facilities in Tallahassee, Florida, as we matriculated through Florida A&M University. 
   When he left Florida A&M, he started a very distinguished career in the computer field as one of the foremost African-American executives with the IBM corporation, working as an executive in the management and the market and the accounting areas, and paving the way for other African Americans to be able to follow in his footsteps. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a great American and one who was humble and humbled himself before God and understood not only who he was but whose he was. 
   And so I just want to rise this afternoon to say these few words about my  great friend, my good friend, Warren Davis. Let me just say in conclusion, Mr. Speaker, that Warren Davis fought the good fight. Warren Davis finished his course, and Warren Davis kept the faith. And henceforth there is put up for him a crown of righteousness which the Lord, that righteous judge, has made available to Warren G. Davis, and so many people both near and far all across the breadth and the scope of America collectively say we thank God for sending Warren G. Davis our way.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Thank you very much, Mr. Ross. It is always a pleasure to be on the floor with you. 
   There is so much we need to cover. Sometimes, you wonder where to really begin. But I think today we need to begin with what the President brought over here in his budget. I have had a chance to look at it, to go through it, and I am just astounded. I truly am astounded at the recklessness of the President's budget, at the irresponsibleness of the President's budget. 
   Here we are at a time when this country is crying out for very serious attention in health care, especially health care for those at the lower income end and the middle class, and what do we get in the President's budget but a tax increase for the middle class in health care. What we get in this budget is a slash to Medicare and to Medicaid. 
   I want to go through it just very quickly so the American people and our colleagues who might not have had a chance to really get into this budget can see how surprisingly irresponsible this budget is. 
   The President's budget that he just sent to us slashes Medicare and Medicaid by about $300 billion, at a time when Medicare and Medicaid are in greatest need, to slash those programs by $300 billion over the next 10 years, with legislative and regulatory Medicaid cuts totaling about $50 billion and Medicare cuts totaling $252 billion. 
   And rather than using these monies to reverse the growing number of uninsured Americans, and, indeed, listen to this startling statistic, since President  Bush took office in the last 6 years, we have added an additional 6.8 million uninsured Americans. This is not a time to cut the basic government safety net program for insuring Americans when we are having more. This is why I say it is reckless. This is why I say it is irresponsible. And these monies are being offset, in his mind, by tax cuts to millionaires. It is totally out of sync. 
   The Medicare cuts include premium increases for millions of beneficiaries totaling $10 million over the next 10 years. And at the same time the budget slashes Medicare funding, it protects special interests. Here is how: It leaves untouched massive overpayments by Medicare to HMOs under the GOP 2003 Medicare Modernization Act. And many of the Federal Medicaid cuts will simply increase State costs or lead to further restrictions in Medicaid benefits. Thus, instead of assisting State efforts to reduce the number of uninsured, the Bush budget will impede those efforts. 
   But in the area of health care, and I mentioned at the outset that there would be in here this hidden tax increase for the middle class. Here is where we find it. Under the President's budget, employee health benefits would, for the first time, be treated as income and would be subject to income and payroll taxes, just like wages. This is new, for the first time. 
   Listen carefully. At the same time, the President would create a tax deduction for health insurance of $15,000 for families and $7,500 for individuals. This proposal would fail to reduce the number of uninsured, and it would also mean a tax increase for millions of middle-class families who have employer-sponsored health insurance worth more than $15,000. You have to really look at the fine print. 
   And also, because the new deduction would reduce taxable income, people's future Social Security benefits would be reduced as well; and, as many health experts have pointed out, the President's proposal would undermine employer-provided health insurance and would push people into the individual health insurance market, a market where insurers are able to refuse coverage to workers based on their health. 
   As Karen Davis, who is head of the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund, pointed out about the President's proposal, it is not solving the uninsured problem and it is not solving the cost problem, so it is not really advancing what we need to have happen. 
   Here at the most basic need, where government and people need the help, soaring high health care costs, this budget not only fails but, to add insult to injury, adds a tax increase to the middle class in the process.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Will the gentleman yield just a moment? 
   On the issue of China and our lending, we are now in debt to China well over $350 billion. Now just to show you why this debt in the hands of foreign governments is such a threat to our national security, just this example. China is now engaged with Iran in building a, supposedly building, a gas pipeline from China to Iran. The United States, in its efforts to tighten certain screws, economic and political, on Iran, in addition to the saber rattling we are doing, has begun to ask China if they would desist from that relationship. To this point, China has stonewalled; and in large measure it is because we don't have the leverage. If you owe me $360 billion, that weakens my position. 
   The other area, in terms of our national security, is the situation in Iran as we are dealing with it, because that is in the news now. There are all kinds of questions and issues now of whether or not we are going to attack Iran, which is why we have got to hurry up and get our resolution passed and make sure that the President understands what article I, section 8 of our Constitution gives the Congress the extreme role, the exclusive role in determining the funding and the declaration of war in that regard. 
   But the whole reason why this whole funding operation puts us in a weakening position from our lending and our debt with our foreign countries is this: Iran has to depend upon a tremendous amount of lending from other countries to support them. It puts our Treasury Department, our Secretary of Treasury, our Secretary of State, and I plan to ask Ms. Condoleezza Rice tomorrow, we will have an opportunity to meet with her, this specific question. The fact that we need our partners, who we are working with, to stop lending to Iran, if we tighten that financial economic screw, that is how you avoid this unfortunate military clash that might be pending. 
   But the point I wanted to make is, as long as we are so overly dependent and have this indebtedness in the hands of the foreign governments, we lose the leverage we need to secure our Nation and to secure a better peace in the world.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. I thank you, Mr. Ross. 
   I just want to make clear, as colleagues are saying, and I want to make sure that this debate is within the right frame of mind. This is not a debate that is personally against the President. The President is a likeable person. It is just his policies. His policies are wrong for the American people. Even the American people are rising up and saying so. 
   We have, as Congress, the responsibility to respectfully disagree with the President. That is what we are doing. We are simply saying it is wrong to cut veterans', it is wrong to cut seniors' programs, it is wrong to cut education, it is wrong to cut the COPS program out, from getting folks in to be employed for first responders. It is wrong to cut homeland security. It is wrong to cut every single basic domestic program that is cut in this budget. It is wrong to do that. 
   It is wrong also for the President to say on the one hand that he is going to have a surge of 21,500 more troops, when, in fact, we now know that it is not 21,500. It is more like 48,000, according to the CBO that has just corrected that. 
   So when we have these kinds of situations, this is what makes this government what it is. This is what makes us the envy of the world. This is why we have this House. This is why we run every other year, why people hold us accountable, to come and to make sure that the voters and the people of America and their tax dollars, that we are good stewards of them. That is our responsibility. 
   And we have a right, more than that, we have a duty, to raise the tough questions and to hold the President's  feet to the fire when he comes with such a wrong-headed budget as this that goes right to the heart of where America is hurting. This is why we are here today, and this is why the Blue Dogs are offering this. This is why the Blue Dogs are also offering Resolution 98, to bring this fiscal accountability and financial accountability, to stop war profiteering, and to make sure the money goes to the soldiers so that we can take care of them while they are on the battlefield and to make sure we restore these cuts to make sure we take care of them when they come home. This budget doesn't do it, and it is our obligation to raise these questions and to make sure that this budget responds appropriately.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Thank you very much, Mr. Ross, for yielding. And to my fellow colleagues, it is such a pleasure to join you once again. 
   When we were here last, we were in the minority, and we said some things. We said what we wanted to do. We said some of the first things we would do when we got here, and one of those was to address this serious problem of financial and fiscal responsibility. 
   I had some time to reflect on our history, and as we looked at the very first move that we made when we came back last week, one of our first measures was to establish pay-as-you-go, PAYGO. It is very interesting that this is not a new phenomenon. Not only did we have it in store when we had the Clinton administration and prior to that, but from the very foundation of our country, it was Thomas Jefferson. First, Thomas Jefferson was so against government debt and its inherent dangers that, back in 1789, in a letter that he wrote to James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, Framers of our Constitution, in that letter, Thomas Jefferson wondered in the letter as he wrote to Madison and Hamilton, he wondered this, whether, quote, ``one generation of men has a right to bind another.'' And he came to his answer with an exclamation point in the letter: ``No.'' He said that ``the Earth belongs in usufruct to the living.''     
   Jefferson concluded in this letter with these words. He said no generation can contract debts greater than may be paid during the course of its own existence. In other words, financial responsibility. Fiscal responsibility was at the cornerstone of this great Republic, of this great Nation, the cornerstone of a lasting and free Nation. 
   One generation of consumers borrowing and spending then hands that bill to the next generation, that get the benefits of spending the money in the present while passing on the debt to future generations, that is not what the Founding Fathers had in mind. And each generation as we move through our history paid down its debt before it moved on, oftentimes marked by war. In 1812, the debt was paid down. The Civil War, borrowed money, the debt was paid down. And into World War I and World War II when the debt really amassed up to $62 billion, and yet over time and those generations those debts were paid down. All of the way up through the Cold War, even into the Reagan years, and up to Clinton, up to the year 2001. 
   But then after 2001 when this Republican administration took hold, in the 5 years that ensued, this President and the preceding Congress, controlled by Republicans, borrowed more money from foreign governments and foreign nations than the entire preceding 218 years of this country. From 1789, the year Thomas Jefferson wrote these words to caution us and set the pattern to pay as we go, here we are now with that big situation hanging over us of the borrowing from our debt. 
   And I mention that because we are now faced with that situation where we are borrowing this money, over $1.5 trillion over the last 5 years, from countries in the most unstable regions of the world: $310 billion from Communist China; nearly $700 billion from Japan; and nearly $300 billion from the unstable OPEC countries in the Middle East which we are dealing with now. This is the background which we are having to deal with today.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is important that we remind people that not only are we talking about the billions of dollars that we just articulated we are borrowing from these foreign governments, more than we borrowed over the last 218 years, but the interest, the money that these folks are making off of us now constitutes the fastest growing part of our budget. We are spending more just paying for the money on the interest that is being charged than we are spending on education, the environment, and veterans at a time when our veterans are making such fantastic contributions and at a time when there needs to be a greater emphasis placed on those who have been on the battlefield and are coming home, and we are spending more on the interest there.  
   Let me just finalize this for a moment, and I just want to mention because we are here and we talked about what we wanted to do. Pay-as-you-go was one of the deals we made. We passed earlier today the 9/11 Commission recommendations. We have worked on so many other things, but I do want to just mention the earmark reform legislation that we passed, and just to share with the American people what we have already passed in our earmark reform. 
   It will require committees to disclose the sponsors of any earmarks included in appropriations authorizing measures such as the highway bill and the tax or trade legislation that benefits 10 or fewer. We will have new rules that will prohibit trading earmarks for votes and require Members to disclose their earmark request and certify that they and their spouses have no personal financial interest in the requests. These provisions comprehensively require committees of jurisdiction and conference committees to publish lists of the earmarks, limit tax benefits, and limit tariff benefits, along with their sponsors contained in the reported bills and the managers' amendments and conference reports brought to the House floor for consideration.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. If the gentleman will yield for a moment, I would like to respond to your point, because we owe it to those generations. That is one of the reasons why I spoke out and set the stage for my remarks, to go back to the beginning of this country, when the foundation of this country was laid out. That is what has made us great. We honor our debts. That is what Hamilton and that is what Jefferson and that is what Madison were all about. 
   You talk about your parents and your grandparents. What would they say? What would my grandparents say? They would say, by George, we love this country. This is our country. We are hoping and we are praying that the Congress will stand and get it right. 
   As I looked at the polls in Georgia, we had a rainy day in the election down in Georgia, but when I looked over the precincts, I could see that it wasn't 25 or 30 percent turnout, in that rain there was 50 and 60 and 70 percent turnout. The people in this country love this country, and they know that we need a new direction, and the first order of this new direction is to get our finances in order. 
   Your parents brought you up, my parents brought me up saying watch your money, son. Work hard. Save it. Invest it. Make sure you honor your debt. That is what they would want us to do.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Thank you very much, Mr. Ross. It is indeed a pleasure to be here with everyone, as I said earlier. 
   I think in conclusion tonight it is very important that we let the American people know that we very soberly understand this charge that has been handed to us as Democrats to lead in this Congress, and we also understand why and we handle that responsibility with great care. 
   One of the things that it is important for us to point out, when they ask what can we do and what is expected of us, is to stand up for the American people finally at last and lift up our way of life. 
   We have two duties to do under the Constitution as Members of Congress and they are expecting us to use these tools and do them well, and these tools are, one, oversight. Through our ability to oversee this government we can make these changes happen. The other is appropriations, to handle their money as good stewards. These are the things that we are committed to do, and this is how we will get to the new direction that the American people expect us to get to.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Ross. It is a pleasure, as always, to be on the floor with you and my fellow Blue Dogs. 
   I want to talk about two issues here that relate. One, of course, is the debt, the deficit that we have; the lack of accountability, financial accountability. But I would like to talk about it from the standpoint of what is really on the minds of the American people today, and that is the situation that faces us in Iraq and what we desperately need to do. 
   We need to do two things: One is be honest with the American people; and, two, be honest with the money that the American people send up here for us to apportion. Nowhere is that more significant than with military affairs. 
   As I stand here, Mr. Ross, I am trying to think of the best illustration I can come up with that would kind of paint a picture for where we are. I think if we look back in history, a certain event took place around 1952 when we were in a similar position of debating this issue of who has control of military affairs or how do we deal with the issues in time of war. Is it the executive branch, or is it the Congress, and what is the role therein? 
   This debate is heated on those two things today. The President says Congress has no role in this. Congress says we definitely do. And we are right that we do.     
   It was borne out in a case in 1952 when there was a decision made by the Supreme Court when this issue came up on who had the right to determine whether the steel mills would be seized during a time of war, during the Korean War. 
   And it got so hot and heavy in that debate it went to the courts. Is it the Congress or is it the President? Well, the Supreme Court ruled on that which brings us to a point here today. But in the concurrence that was written by Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, he said some very important, significant and prophetic words. 
   He said that this is a case that clearly fits within the realm of Congress's responsibility in a time of war. And in his concurrence he said that when the executive branch operates in tandem with the congressional branch, with congressional authority, he said that is a time of maximum power for the President. He said, but when the President acts counter to the express constitutional authority of the Congress,  he said, we enter into what he referred to then as a zone of twilight, or in essence a twilight zone which, quite ironically, is where Rod Sterling got the name for his television program ``The Twilight Zone.'' 
   That is where we find ourselves here, in the twilight zone. 
   He went on to say, when we enter this twilight zone, the Presidency in at its lowest ebb when it does not recognize the authority of the Congress. 
   Our authority rests with the purse. Our authority rests with making sure that we raise and support the military. Our authority rests with legislation. And when you wrap those two things together, that is what is the embodiment of what we have captured in our resolution for financial responsibility and accountability in a time of war to make sure that the money is accounted for; to make sure when our troops are going into war, that they have the money for the armor. 
   That is exactly why when they were sent into war by this President and this administration without the body armor, we had to amend the appropriations bill with over $200 million to get it in there, led by Democrats, led by Blue Dog Democrats, if you recall, to get the money in the budget for that. 
   The reason that happened is, up until January, this President has had the luxury of a rollover Congress that did exactly what he wanted them to do without even a whimper or a bang. They just rolled over, gave the President everything that he wanted, and we did not do the constitutional function of oversight, of making sure that there is financial accountability and responsibility in the actions that we are giving. 
   That is why it is important what we do today. Now this is incorporated into our presentation, into each of the bills that we have put forward. The status is now that these efforts are being worked between the House and the Senate. But I think it is very important for the public to also know that in this bill we have the accountability features in. But we also have the responsibility where we are not going to cut off any funds as long as our troops are in danger on the battlefield. 
   It is our hope, however, that we will be responsive to the American people and bring this matter to a close in terms of the loss of life of our soldiers that are caught in the cross hairs of a civil war. 
   Now, the Middle East is a region of vital interest, and there is absolutely no way we will ever be able to completely disappear from the Middle East, nor is that our intent. Nor is it the intent of the American people. 
   The point is our nose has been poked into a civil war, a civil war that has been festering for thousands of years between the Sunnis and the Shiites. That is their civil war. It is not right to have our soldiers in the middle of that. That needs to be brought back and we need to enter into a more reasonable support of containment and redeployment of our troops, and in a manner that pays attention to the wear and tear on our military. 
   Mr. Ross, it is shameful when we have to say that so many of our troops are over there for the third or fourth time. That is not right. The American people are against that. It is my hope that we will bring financial accountability and responsibility to this matter. The American people, who are very much engaged with us on this Iraq situation, are looking to Democrats; and quite honestly, they are looking to Blue Dog Democrats. They are looking to people who have fiscal responsibility and also understand that we know we are in a dangerous world. 
   The most important thing we need for our advancement right now is to make sure we have a strong defense and we have got that, but we also want our policies to be responsive to the American people. That is what the Democrats are putting forward as we move forward on our way out of this terrible civil war that our Nation finds itself in. We are going to do exactly that. 
   Mr. Ross, it is a pleasure to be here, and I am sure the American people fully support our efforts and understand exactly what we are talking about when we say it is time to bring financial accountability and transparency to our efforts here on Capitol Hill, and nowhere is that more important than dealing with our military affairs and the men and women serving in harm's way overseas.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, we are gathered here this evening to talk about the budget, to talk about the debt and to talk about the Blue Dogs' Iraqi accountability legislation. This is a very, very important time for us, and we hope that this hour will be illuminating and be very informative for everyone. 
   We are accustomed having my good friend, MIKE ROSS, in this position. MIKE ROSS is from Arkansas, and, as we know, there was a tornado that went through there. MIKE ROSS and a group of us just came back yesterday from Europe. MIKE ROSS had to jump on a plane and go down to Arkansas to see about his constituents, and we want to make sure that we send our prayers down to the folks in Arkansas. 
   Of course, MIKE knows that we stand ready to help in every way we can to make sure that they get the services that they need. So we are here to carry on. 
   We have a great lineup and array of Blue Dogs here tonight to carry on and to talk about the budget, we want to talk about the debt, we want to talk about our Iraq resolution that we have before us, and the whole issue of accountability. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we get started, I want to call your attention to our chart. As you know, one of the hallmarks of the Blue Dogs is fiscal responsibility and accountability. Let's look at the national debt and what it is today. 
   If we look at it correctly, it is now $8.773 trillion. The share for each individual in this Nation is $29,000, and it continues to go up. We want to talk about that tonight. The Blue Dogs have a plan. We want to talk about our 12-point plan to bring down this debt. It is one of the most horrendous areas that we have to deliberate on. 
   We want to get started with some of our Blue Dogs that are here. First, I  want to recognize our distinguished cochair from the great State of Tennessee, Representative Cooper. I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. The gentleman mentioned what happened today in the stock market. It is very interesting to note that this whole change happened and started early in the morning in China. When you look at how much money we are borrowing from foreign governments, needless to say China with $360 billion in debt, the interconnectedness of this, and our liability to these other countries, make us so dependent on them. In some cases when they sneeze, we are getting a cold, which is what happened today.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. I thank the gentleman from Tennessee. You brought some very significant wisdom, that our debt burden is $50 trillion, and a very important piece of information from the Treasury Department which gave great expanse to what our burden is: $8.73 trillion in national debt, and our share for each individual in this country is $29,000. 
   I would like to call on a distinguished Blue Dog, one of our hardworking Blue Dogs, and one of my fellow travelers. We just returned from an extraordinary trip abroad with NATO, had some very interesting meetings there, BEN CHANDLER, a Representative from the great State of Kentucky.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. If the gentleman would yield, you bring up a very good point. The waste that has happened in Iraq with our military is just astounding. It is very important that the American people realize this is the trust of our legislation. We are going to support the troops. We are going to have a military and we are going to spend more on our military. We are going to enlarge our military. Under our Democratic leadership, we are going to make our military stronger. 
   In order to do that, there are two important points, as the gentleman pointed out, in our legislation that will address and act as a catch to stop some of this waste, and that is under our legislation, we will require that the Inspector General in the Defense Department report to Congress quarterly on exactly how the money that Congress is allocating is being spent. And the Inspector General in Iraq for the Reconstruction of Iraq will also report to Congress on how that money is being spent. 
   So our financial accountability act for Iraq accountability is very important, and I want to just take a minute to point those things out that address how we are going to respond to the concerns of waste and fraud that you have just spoken about.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chandler, I want to make sure that the American people got what you just said. Now, just to make sure that they get it, what you said was that in the last 6 years under this administration this country has borrowed more money from foreign governments than all of the previous administrations going all of the way back to 1789, counting all of the wars, counting the Depression, World War I and World War II, all of the way up to now. From 1789 to 2001, we didn't borrow as much money as we have borrowed in the last 6 years. That is very important. 
   And the other staggering point about that is just the interest that we are paying on this loan is the fastest growing segment of our budget, and just the interest that we are paying to these countries is more than we are collectively spending on our veterans, on homeland security, and on education. That is a remarkable state of financial irresponsibility; and the Blue Dogs are providing the leadership, have been for many years, and finally we got a first step into this process during the first 100 days under the leadership of Speaker  Nancy Pelosi in passing the PAYGO legislation.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Thank you, and the gentleman brought up some very interesting points. We are going to talk a little bit more about that, but I know the Americans may be asking, well, what are the Blue Dogs going to do? What is their plan? 
   We have a 12-point plan for budget reform. I want to briefly hit the points right quick. One, require a balanced budget; two, do not let Congress buy on credit; three, put a lid on spending; four, require agencies to put their fiscal house in order; five, make Congress tell taxpayers how much they are spending; six, set aside a rainy day fund; seven, do not hide votes to raise the debt limit; eight, justify spending for all projects; nine, ensure that Congress reads the bills that it is voting on; ten, require honest cost estimates for every bill that Congress votes on; eleven, make sure new bills fit the budget; and twelve, make Congress do a better job of keeping tabs on government programs. 
   Now, I want to yield to my distinguished friend from Tennessee who is just one of the hardest working Members up here and a leader in the Blue Dogs, Congressman LINCOLN DAVIS from Tennessee. I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. You make a very good point, and I think it is tantamount and the American people have seen through and are seeing through the rhetoric of the Bush administration. They are not buying cut and run. The American people went to the polls in November and they did not go to the polls to cut and run. They went to the polls to change direction, a new direction. 
   There is no question about the fact that we have a vital interest in the Middle East. We know that for the foreseeable future, clearly 45 percent of all of the known oil reserves would be under that region and certainly under Iran alone. All of the geologists have pointed out that 25 percent is under that region. There is a great responsibility for us all there. Nobody is talking about cut and run. 
   We are talking about what is happening here is a civil war, and these Iraqis have got to fight that out for themselves, just as surely as it would not have been right for Germany or France to come and plop a hundred or 200,000 troops in the middle of our civil war. That had to be settled by us. They have got to settle their civil war. We have got to contain the situation, and that is how this new direction needs to evolve. 
   I yield back to the gentleman.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. If the gentleman will yield for a point. I think it is very important, you pointed out that in 2004, if I heard you correctly, $24 billion of Federal Government spending went absolutely unaccounted for. But the other point of that is that this Congress, or the Republican-controlled Congress during that time, did not hold the executive branch accountable for the omission. So not only was the money unaccounted for, there was no means of putting forward accountability by the executive branch.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. If the gentlelady would yield for a moment, I think it very important for us to realize, you also alluded to it, you might want to hit on it a little more, the unfairness of it all, the war being paid on borrowed money. Every dime we are spending in our government, for our services, on borrowed money, it is not going to last that long. Many civilizations and nations have gone down because of ballooning debt. 
   If you look at all of them that have gone down, ballooning debt is what played such a great part, and the selfishness of the tax cuts, the war, whatever we are doing, and we are selfishly doing that and putting the burden, as you alluded to, on the backs of our children and our grandchildren. I think you make an excellent point there.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 755) to require annual oral testimony before the Financial Services Committee of the Chairperson or a designee of the Chairperson of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, relating to their efforts to promote transparency in financial reporting.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. (PROMOTING TRANSPARENCY IN FINANCIAL REPORTING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, this Promoting Transparency in Financial Reporting Act is a bipartisan bill that the House considered last year and passed on a voice vote. The legislation, however, failed to become law during the 109th Congress; and as a result, we now must consider these matters anew in the 110th Congress. 
   H.R. 755 has a simple premise, Mr. Speaker. For the next 5 years, it would require annual testimony before the House Financial Services Committee by those entities most involved in establishing and implementing our Nation's financial reporting system. These parties include the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. 
   Since the 1930s, the Securities and Exchange Commission has required public companies to file financial reports like income statements and balance sheets. Today, companies also rely on the generally accepted accounting principles developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board to prepare these reporting documents. This independent accounting standard-setter came into existence in the 1970s. The tidal wave of accounting scandals at the start of this decade led Congress to reassess our Nation's financial reporting system and adopt further reforms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Among other things, this landmark law created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. This body establishes the auditing standards used to examine public company accounting statements. It also registers and inspects the auditors of public companies. 
   Even without this legislation, the Financial Services Committee is already working to examine accounting and auditing issues and the work of each of these parties. Earlier this month we approved an oversight plan for the 110th Congress. Several of the action items in that plan address accounting issues. For example, the oversight plan calls for the committee to review the efforts of the Financial Accounting Standards Board to improve financial accounting standards. It also calls for us to study the progress being made on establishing international accounting standards. The plan further calls for the committee to examine the work of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board as it implements the auditing improvements made by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This legislation, therefore, builds on what we had already planned to do in the 110th Congress and what other sessions of Congress should plan to do. 
   These proposed annual hearings over the next 5 years will help us to reassess complex accounting standards. It will help us improve the understandability of financial statements, and it will encourage the acceptance of interactive data. Even though it seems highly likely that the parties subject to this legislation would testify before the Financial Services Committee on these matters if asked, this bill will make certain that the committee remains focused on these important issues in the immediate future. 
   In addition, the adoption of H.R. 755 will help to encourage our regulators and standard-setters to fulfill their own roles and initiatives to achieve greater transparency, promote greater uniformity, and reduce complexity in financial reporting not only at home but also around the world. 
   In recent years, our financial reporting standards have become more and more complex and complicated, especially as we have sought to address more difficult issues like the accounting treatment of derivatives and hedging instruments. This complexity has created difficulties not only for the companies that operate in the United States or that access our capital markets but also the investors and advisers who read and use financial statements. 
   For our Nation to remain competitive, we need to have robust capital markets. For our capital markets to be strong, we need to have transparent, clear, and understandable financial reporting. We also need to ensure that the entities responsible for accounting and auditing issues continue to work smoothly together. H.R. 755 will help us to stay focused on achieving these important and desirable goals. 
   In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the hard work of the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Davis), who is the primary sponsor on this bill. And I want to commend Mr. Davis for introducing this measure, and I am proud to work with him as the lead cosponsor over these last years. And, hopefully, this time will be the charm. 
   This bill is aimed at ensuring that individuals have access to the information that they truly need to make better investment decisions. And I urge support for H.R. 755. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. I thank my distinguished colleague from New York (Mr. Arcuri). I really appreciate this opportunity. 
   Mr. Speaker, I stand here with 100 percent support for H.R. 3915. Let me just start off my comments by sharing with you and the Members of the House and the people of this country how severe this issue within the mortgage industry is, particularly within my district and my beloved State of Georgia. We are one of the leading States that have been victims of abusive lending practices, predatory lending, and certainly we are at the epicenter of this mortgage crisis facing us in this country. 
   For example, Mr. Speaker, 40 percent of the loans in my district are in the subprime area. Homeowners in my district have lost $159 million in home equity value. One of the counties in my district, Clayton County, is one the leading counties in this State that has suffered so desperately from home foreclosures due to subprime lending, abuses within the lending practice, and certainly the epicenter of it all, the eye of the storm, is predatory lending. 
   My State of Georgia has been fighting this battle for an awfully long time. Even during my days in the Georgia State Legislature as a Georgia State Senator, we had to deal with this issue of abuse from Fleet Finance. 
   So I want to just start with laying that out, Mr. Speaker, so you can see how critical this issue is, not only within my State of Georgia, but facing this entire Nation. That is why we have this bill. It is an important bill, and it is important because it is urgent that we move in a timely manner. 
   Let me just state very quickly, Mr. Speaker, if I may, what the key areas are in the reform of this bill. 
   First of all, it creates a new licensing structure for mortgage brokers and loan originators. This is done to ensure that they are licensed and that they are held accountable for the quality of the loans that they originate. This is very important. 
   Second, it creates a new minimum standard for mortgages and protections to ensure that all loans are properly underwritten, and eases the way for high-quality or qualified loans, qualified mortgages, to be securitized. This is very important. This is especially important because it ensures continued liquidity in the mortgage securities market, and that is what we really need to make sure that we do foremost, is to make sure we have the money there, to make sure we have the liquidity there. 
   The third key area is it expands the definition for high-cost mortgages, which greatly increases the protections available for consumers if they desire to select a subprime mortgage. 
   Now, this bill also addresses reckless loan underwriting, it addresses abusive subprime payment penalties, and it deals with direct incentives for mortgage brokers to steer families into expensive and risky loans. There are a lot of these kinds of unsatisfactory practices that are going on in this industry, let me say not by everyone, but there are some bad actors in this mortgage industry situation. This bill attempts to weave a delicate balance to move in and deal with those that are doing wrong and provide the kinds of protections that our consumers need. 
   This legislation is needed because all Americans should be protected against predatory lenders. Those are the ones that we are after the most, these folks that sit there and they look and they target areas. They target the most vulnerable people among us. They target minorities. They target African Americans especially. They target Hispanics. They target senior citizens, some of the most vulnerable people. They take advantage of the significant complexity of the language and the complicated situations that are involved in the mortgage industry, so that many people don't know what they are signing for on the bottom line, and they take advantage of that. 
   We need this legislation because consumers should get good credit. The best thing we can do for consumers currently on bad loans and for future borrowers is to ensure that they can get good credit. 
   This legislation is needed because credit availability must be preserved, especially in the troubled market that we are in right now. Lenders should not make loans that they know that the consumer cannot pay back. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is almost unspeakable for many of these loan originators, who know that many of these people can't pay these loans, but they go ahead and they deal with it. 
   Let me just deal finally with the arguments that there are some on the side that say the legislation is too weak. There are others that say the legislation is too strong. Well, I would just like to say we in Congress have to work with almost everything. It is sort of like making sausage. We have to pull this. We have to pull that. We have to try to come up with a bill that, first of all, we can get through the Congress. 
   But I am willing to bank my stake on it, Mr. Speaker, that this is a good bill. This is a bill which is a first step which we can deal with. And if they say that this bill is so weak, why are my phones ringing in my office, ringing both here and in Atlanta, Georgia, from bankers and from brokers who are saying that this bill is too strong? 
   This bill is an effort to move. It is important national lending legislation that, for the first time, prohibits steering a consumer to a loan that would do these four things: A loan that the consumer cannot pay, a loan that does not provide net tangible benefits, a loan that has predatory characteristics, and a loan that treats borrowers differently based on their race or their economic standing.  
   In most cases, this bill also will allow States, if they want to, to have even a stronger bill, in most cases. 
   Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate this opportunity. I thank Mr. Arcuri for your patience with me. I hope we will have a chance to come back later in the day and address some of the issues of signing liability and preemption.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I think it is very important because the assignee liability issue did come up, and I think as we move through this debate it would be clear to get a clear understanding of what we have in that so we will have a point of reference. 
   First of all, in this issue, if a consumer gets a loan that violates the minimum standards, in this bill are minimum standards, then the consumer has cause of action against assignees that have purchased that loan. The consumer may sue to rescind the loan and recoup other costs. There has to be an element of liability in the issue. We have worked to get a delicate balance that both protects the consumer while at the same time also saving some elements of liability so that we keep the market free of unnecessary suits. 
   Further, when the holder of a bad loan initiates a foreclosure, the consumer may exercise a rescission right under this to stop foreclosure. This is important. If the rescission right has expired, the consumer may seek actual damages plus costs against the creditor, the assignee or the securitizer. This provision gives real power to the consumer who can sue to stop a foreclosure of a bad loan or to rescind the bad loan. 
   Now, we also have some protections from liability for the loan originator. Number one, somebody may ask, why even give some protection from lawsuits to any entity that buys a loan? I believe that most consumers realize that the market provides the funding for loans and that the constant threat of legal action will indeed increase the cost of those loans for everybody. Somebody will have to pay that cost. And normally, that cost will fall on the consumer. So we have struck a delicate balance in the assignee liability.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, the Price amendment attempts to exempt prime loans from the requirement of the bill. The Price amendment takes out prime loans from the definition of residential mortgage loans. Now, Mr. Chairman, this is one of the most significant financial crises that has impacted every sphere of our economy. While, yes, subprime issues may be at the eye of the storm, these winds are howling and they are blowing fierce and hard throughout every length and breadth of this country. More than three-fourths of Americans with mortgages have prime loans. The Price amendment will do one essential thing. It will deprive the vast majority of Americans, 78 percent of Americans will be deprived by his amendment of the many important critical protections in this bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, all Americans need consumer protections against risky loans. This crisis has weakened the entire American economy. Look at  Citigroup. Look at Countrywide. Major Fortune 200, 500 corporations have suffered tremendously. That has a ripple effect and has made millions of middle- and upper-income American families, as well as the lower-income families less secure. All Americans deserve to have the protections to stop bad loans from being made in the first place. 
   We need to make sure that both prime and subprime consumers get mortgages that they can repay. We need to make sure that prime and subprime mortgageholders are strengthened by consumer protections against reckless, abusive lending practices for both prime and subprime, and we need to make sure that both prime and subprime borrowers are not steered into more expensive mortgages. For example, Mr. Chairman, for prime borrowers, the Price amendment removes the important requirement in this bill that mortgage originators comply with what is known as ``Federal duty of care.'' By that we mean what we have under this bill, where mortgage originators have to offer prime borrowers full disclosures that are mandated by the bill. This bill ensures that all borrowers can make informed decisions when taking out loans. All borrowers deserve that, both prime and subprime. 
   Also under our bill, mortgage originators must present all borrowers, including prime borrowers, with the range of loan products that the borrowers can repay or that provide them with a net tangible benefit. The question was raised, what is net tangible benefit? It is making sure that the loan doesn't leave you in a worse-off position, for example, such as when you refinance, where your cash-out is less than the fees that you are paying. 
   The Price amendment also would take away this important protection from our borrowers. It removes the protection of prime borrowers against steering. This is critically important, as the gentleman from North Carolina that preceded me talked about. This carefully crafted bill requires strong rules against talking borrowers into more expensive loans that they cannot afford. 
   Mr. Chairman, both subprime and prime borrowers deserve that. These 78 percent of homeowners, borrowers would not have that kind of protection if we adopt the Price amendment. We need to protect our borrowers, both prime and sub, from having borrowers being talked into loans that have predatory characteristics like equity stripping, they do that for prime as well as subprime, excessive fees that leave them in a worse position than they were before. 
   The Price amendment would take away the important consumer protection that protects a consumer from loans they cannot repay, does not provide the tangible benefit, and then, Mr. Chairman, one important measure that treats borrowers differently based on race. At the bottom of this is this tug of war in this whole fight because this is targeted. There are many African Americans who are target or are prime, but they are targeted to move into subprime. 
   This issue bleeds all across the horizon, Mr. Chairman. This amendment that Mr. Price is offering severely weakens and guts this measure and deprives all Americans from having the equality of protection under the law. It must be rejected.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, this is an important and urgent and critical bill. All across this Nation, families are struggling and suffering. In my own district of Georgia and in one of my major counties, which is Clayton County, which is one of the leading counties that has had over a 200 percent increase in foreclosures of homes, they have lost over $158 million in terms of their home equity. 
   Now, Mr. Chairman, the speaker just spoke a moment ago about one of the major features of this bill, and that is trying to grapple with assigning liability. I want to just make sure that everybody understands what we are talking about, because we are going to have that debate. Just what is an assignee? An assignee is a mortgage broker or lender, any loan originator that makes these loans but they don't keep them. They repackage these loans. They often are loans that are delivered to the secondary market to a group of investors and these are parties that own an interest in the loan as it flows through the investment process, and they are known as assignees. 
   Since these loan originators don't keep the loans they make, they often deliver what the secondary market will buy, with little regard for whether the homeowners can make their payments or afford these loans. Unfortunately, many of them get into these loans on what is known as ``teaser rates.'' They put forward a loan at a very low rate but, unbeknownst to the homeowner, in a short period of time the payment balloons out of kilter and the homeowner cannot afford it. Some people say this is not by design. But in so many cases, they are by design. 
   So what does that consumer have? He must have some recourse by which to have an ability to stop the foreclosure on his home. That victim has to hire  legal counsel to bring separate action against the loan originator. This bill attempts to address that. An assignee liability is an important feature of this measure.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Reserving the right to object, Madam Speaker, I just wanted to very briefly come down because I think we need to remember, first of all, that we are standing on some very hallowed ground here. We are standing on the grounds of the citadel of this Nation where some heavy prices were paid for the foundation of our government, the hallmark of which is openness and freedom. So when we take a step to close our proceedings to the American people, we are treading on treacherous ground. 
   And so I believe, I think that it is very important, Mr. Minority Whip, that I ask you this question because I think you certainly need to answer this for those of us here and the American people, and that question is: Is this a political ploy? In the land of Greek mythology was a land called Troy, and in that land they brought a Trojan horse. And so when you look at the facts that have been exposed in this discourse this evening, you say you have information that is of high intelligence matter, that you are asking us to undermine the very hallmark and foundation of our free, open Republic to present, that has not even been presented to the proper channels of our Intelligence Committee on the eve of a vote that has been moving around these Chambers for well over a month. 
   Here, just before we are about to go for a 2-week recess, we come with this mysterious information. So the question has to be answered: Is this a Trojan horse? Is this a political ploy? To call a meeting in secret to give secret information, those of us that would come have to abide by the secrecy, then when the vote takes place, if it doesn't go the way that you want it, you can say to the press, well, hey, we called a secret meeting. We gave them valuable information, and see what they did. 
   It puts this whole situation in a very confounding box, and I ask you to answer that question. Is this not a political ploy? Is this not a Trojan horse? And if so, could it not be a misuse of the sanctity of the House of Representatives?

My final concern is, and I will let this rest, is that after tomorrow when we read the accounts of this, or when we go home and the American people ask us that question, the issue is going to be, Was it worth it? Was it, did it reach that level to really undermine the openness in government? 
   Our Nation is littered with examples of secrecy when it should have been openness. And as we've seen from those who've been here long before I have, who've gone through these previous times, in the five times and the most recent two or three times that some of those that spoke have been here, it proved to not reach that bar. And I'd just say, these are hallowed grounds. This is a precious country, the centerpiece of which is openness, and if we keep tipping away at this, we undermine the 
   very fabric of our country. And I just submit to you, Mr. Leader, this is really what's at stake tonight.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Thank you very much, Mr. Ross. Good to be with you again. 
   I thought I would just start for a few moments on the fact that we are going to vote on a ban to lift the ban on offshore drilling. Democrats are taking the lead and Democrats are moving forward in a very responsible way to take the ban off offshore drilling and drill. 
   What is important here are two points. One is that we need to make sure--and I understand that we are making sure--that whatever oil we are able to get from offshore drilling stays in America. This is a very tricky maneuver. Right now, as I understand it, all oil goes on the world market, but I do understand that we have the Continental Lands Act, and in that Act of 1953, as amended, it states that all oil that is discovered or pulled out of waters in the United States coastal areas will be American and will stay in America. That's very important. 
   That's the question that a lot of my constituents want to know, if we go, we get this oil, are we going to be able to keep this oil in America, because fundamentally, that's what's at issue. This is more than just a just basic energy crisis as we've had before. This is a national security issue of the highest regard. 
   I spent this afternoon for about 3 hours in our Foreign Affairs Committee talking with the Under Secretary of the Secretary of State and discussing the ramifications of Russia invading Georgia and what that was all about, and I hasten to add that this was all about, in many respects, energy and about Russia's position in that. 
   Europe gets 31 percent of its oil--I mean, we get a lot of ours from foreign sources, but right now, Europe gets 31 percent of its oil and gas from one Nation, Russia. There is a lot at stake that is going on in that part of the world, and underneath it all is oil and gas and energy and who's going to remain in control. 
   We need to understand that our basic charge is to get American dependent. So that part of the question has to be answered, and I think we've done that. 
   The other part is, and I think and I hope in this legislation, as we have worked and crafted--I might add that this legislation that's being crafted that we will vote on before we go back home on many, many sources. We're pulling in many ideas because no one has a monopoly on these ideas. Some of these ideas that we'll be voting on are contained in what the Senate calls the ``Gang of 10.'' That is very important. 
   But I think one aspect of that--and I've been very supportive of that--is that we will allow four to five States on the eastern seaboard, Georgia being one of them, to decide and opt in to whether they want to drill. We are going to have to come up with what the mileage is offshore, whether it's 3, 5, 10, 50 or 100 miles offshore. But I think we ought to entertain the possibility of allowing it open to every State, that every State may make that choice so that you're not deciding one or the other. Perhaps we will go in that direction, to allow the entirety of America, the United States of America, wherever we can get oil that we can keep, that is American dependent oil, we must do so, and wherever that drilling needs to take place, we must do so. And hopefully, that will be incorporated into the bill. 
   But we must not stop there. What we have more than any other country, we have the greatest amount of technology. Nobody's smarter than we are. We've got to unleash our technology, our scientists, our chemists, our engineers to go and hurry up and get alternative sources of fuel away from fossil fuels. We can't drill our way out, no matter what it is. There's just so much oil there. We've got to grow our way out of it. 
   And that's why we hope that this bill will be multifaceted, but drilling will be an important component on it, and we're excited for the future. I think the 
   American people can be proud of what the Congress is about to do.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. To my two distinguished colleagues who have taken the leadership on this time on the floor, I thank you for your graciousness in allowing us to bring up H. Res. 944 and at the same time to recognize what is arguably an extraordinary and great moment in American history. 
   For this man, Lieutenant General Russel Honore, the only word that comes to mind, Mr. Speaker, is that word ``great.'' There have been some great moments and great events in the last 7 years of this country that have threatened the very foundation of our country. The 9/11 of 2001 that launched the vicious attack on this country that led us into this extraordinary period of this war on terror, and then just 4 years later a great catastrophe, one of the greatest natural disasters to have ever hit the United States of America and to the gulf coast of this country: Hurricane Katrina. Great events, great occasions bring forth the need to rise up to this occasion and these great occasions great men. 
   We are here today to honor a great American, and we ought to pause for a moment and think about this word ``great'' that we are using to describe this great American, Lieutenant General Russel Honore. The word ``great'' means something of great magnificence. When that question was put to the great philosopher Aristotle, what does it take to be a great man, Aristotle said the first thing you've got to do is know thyself. 
   Well, I am here to tell you, Mr. Speaker, Russel Honore knew himself, and not only did he know who he was, Russel Honore knew whose he was, that he was foremost and first of all a child of God that had been brought on this Earth for a great need and a great occasion. 
   Later on in history that question was put to the great Roman general and soldier Marcus Aurelius. The question was put to Marcus Aurelius, what does it take to be a great man? Marcus Aurelius said, in order to be a great man, you must, first of all, discipline yourself. And so much has been said about the great soldiering of this great American. The hallmark word is ``discipline,'' ``focus.'' He endured hardness and toughness as a good soldier, and through that discipline came the loyalty, came the courage that it took to fighting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan but, more than that, to expound the toughness and the discipline that was needed to our fellow soldiers that came under his care. For there is no greater thing of General Honore than the love of his soldiers, and he exemplified that by heading up the commandant post in my district at Fort Gillem, Georgia. For three-quarters of the National Guard that had to be positioned, had to be trained, had to be deployed into the war zones came through the hand of Russel Honore at Fort Gillem in Clayton County and Forest Park in Georgia and my congressional district. 
   And, finally, that question was put to the great Messiah and prophet Jesus Christ when He was asked, Jesus, what does it take to be a great man? And Jesus replied, first of all, in order to be a great man, you must sacrifice yourself. And, oh, what a great sacrifice. And you must love your fellow man as you do yourself. And what greater exemplary of that was in going down into Katrina and not just soldiering, not just taking the time to protect the area, but clothing the people there, finding food and shelter for them, and taking the time to stop beside the road of the agony that they were experiencing, put an arm around them, and help that gulf coast to recovery. 
   Yes, ``greatness'' is the word for General Russel Honore. And we are so grateful for him, for the role that he has played, and for the greatness of this man. For he came at the most opportune time to provide the most opportune service, and he is truly a great American serving a great Nation.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, let me just say, is this a perfect bill? No, but is it a good bill, yes. It's a good bill for the people of America in response precisely to their needs now. 
   The American people are concerned about high food prices, this brings it down. They are concerned about high gas prices, this bill brings it down. One of the most pressing areas that this bill does good on, it corrects a major injustice to African American farmers by passing a bill which includes $100 million to set up a fund so that these black farmers can have their day in court, something they fought for for years. 
   It also has money in here to set up research grants for predominantly African American land-grant colleges of 1890, Florida A&M University, agriculture, mechanical; Arkansas A&M University, agriculture, mechanical; North Carolina A&T, agriculture and technical. These schools were grounded in agriculture. But, yet, because of past discrimination, the black farmers and black colleges have been denied.

But let me just urge those in the minority on the other side of the aisle that many of these 273,000 children who are in Georgia without health insurance belong to the soldiers who are serving in Iraq, and we have been working feverishly in each step of the way to make sure we had the SCHIP program included.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. (WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JULY 26, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Madam Chairman, I serve on both Agriculture and Financial Services, so I can look at this with a very jaundiced eye. And I think what we have to do is make a decision in this move based upon what the lay of the land is. First, we're talking about renewable energy and ethanol. Where is that going to take place? It's going to take place in the rural communities where the products, where the crops are that will make renewable energy. 
   This proposal is tied very tight, and I think that farm credit deserves to have an opportunity to compete in this new burgeoning industry. The businesses that are made eligible are ones that process or handle farm products that are directly used in renewable energy. This is very tight. I do not believe that the farm credit needs to be denied this opportunity. I do not think it blurs jurisdictional lines. We should not close the door on an industry, an opportunity for farm credit to provide a service that is not directly competitive with our bankers.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. (HOPE VI IMPROVEMENT AND REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Iowa very cleverly uses the words ``union scale.'' This is not union scale; this is prevailing wage scale. This is set by scientific surveys within a community, based upon what is the prevailing wage in that community. It moves from community to community. There is a reason for that. 
   Davis-Bacon has been one of the foremost agents that we have been able to use in our entire economic structure to make sure that the American worker has a livable wage that maintains the standards in that community. The Davis-Bacon requirement has been on the books since 1931, and, if I might add, put on by a Republican, one of my opponents' party members, President Hoover, and it has served us well. 
   Now, this amendment is certainly an amendment that is very timely. Here we are in the throes of a recession, one of the most damaging economic crises that this Nation has faced in the last quarter of a century, and we have the gentleman from Iowa wanting to put on an amendment that would diametrically affect the living wages of the people who need the help the most. 
   Now, by preventing workers on HOPE VI projects from earning a living wage is certainly not the right way to go. It is a hole in the head bucket strategy, given that those very same workers in the absence of Davis-Bacon protections would be unable to find housing themselves. A part of the HOPE VI mission, Mr. Chairman, is to make construction of units more efficient and to ensure that the HOPE VI housing units are more environmentally friendly and cost effective. The Davis-Bacon prevailing wages helps attract the necessary skilled workforce to build housing in the most efficient and cost-effective manner. This is a bad amendment. 
   I yield 2 minutes to Mr. George Miller to put his statement in the Record at this point.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, let it be noted that the gentleman from Iowa, my good friend, is the one who brought up the race card, not I. But I will be the one who quickly puts it back into the middle of the deck, where it should stay and belong forever. 
   The fact of the matter is this: For 77 years, Mr. Chairman, this country has had the prevailing wage. Not a union  wage. The prevailing wage standards are set by scientific surveys of actual wages paid in the local communities, and anyone awarded a government contract pays at least those prevailing wages. It is not a union scale. If you had union scale, that is it no matter where you go. Prevailing wages are what is established based upon that local economy, that local situation. 
   You talk about New York. When Hoover put this in in 1931, he didn't put it in for New York. It was for the entire Nation, because we were at the throes of the depression, at the beginning of the depression. 
   And now in a similar situation, while we are not in the beginning of a depression, but certainly in a recession, you misguidedly, my good friend, want to remove it. How ironic. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is a terrible amendment. It certainly is not the right time to even think about in any fashion any measure that would constrict the economic sector in this country rather than at a much greater need when we need to expand it, and we need to stand and protect the wage earner and working America on this amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Ross very much. It is always a pleasure to be on the floor with you and my other colleagues in the Blue Dog Coalition. 
   I would like to maybe start just responding to what we are doing so that we can set the stage properly for the American people who are watching to understand why we are doing this and the important confirmation that we have for doing it that is embedded deep in the Constitution of the United States. 
   The question on what role does Congress have in this has been put before pundits and before commentators, news articles once the President made his statement about the surge, and I, too, want to go on record as saying that I oppose this surge, almost exclusively because of the strain that it is placing on our military, which is already overstrained, and taking our young men and women and not only just putting them in harm's way, but placing them in the cross-hairs of a civil war. 
   But fundamentally, as I mentioned earlier, what this legislation is that we are here to bring some transparency and to bring some understanding of how the taxpayers' money is being spent is embedded, as I said early, deep into the Constitution. 
   Now, I want everybody to understand that when we put forward this bill, we are not putting it forward based upon what we feel like today. We are putting this forward so that we can be responsive to the job that we were created to do. 
   In Article I in Section 8 of the Constitution, it states clearly, when that question was put to James Madison and to Alexander Hamilton at the beginning of the formation of the Continental Army, the fight for the freedom of this country at the very beginning, the question was this: Who has the authority to declare war; who has the authority to raise and support our military? Here is what it says in Article I, Section 8, that was written well over 200 years ago. 
   Article I, Section 8, gives Congress, not the White House, not the executive branch, not the President, it says clearly it gives Congress the power to ``raise and support armies.'' Those words are in there. In other words, it gives Congress the exclusive power to appropriate the funds for war and then to determine the manner in which those funds are handled and used. 
   That is what undergirds our resolution that we are putting forth as Blue Dogs and as Democrats and as Republicans, because I believe that we will get bipartisan support for standing up and finally allowing this Congress to do what the Founding Fathers put us here to do. 
   Just for a moment, our war in Iraq has been prosecuted at a tremendous cost to our Nation, a tremendous cost in terms of especially our soldiers' lives, and we cannot thank our soldiers enough for the sacrifice that they have given, but also the strain that it has placed on their families through repeated and increasingly hefty deployments, wear and tear on our equipment and, of course, the taxpayers' money. 
   That is what the Founding Fathers said when they said raise and support our Army. They just did not say tax the money. It did not say that. It said raise and support, which means put your arms around it and make sure you take care of your Army. 
   I will tell you, up to this point this Congress has not done so. The strain on our military is extraordinary. Our service members, as we know, are all volunteers. They and their families are more than willing to sacrifice, as they have and as they will continue to do, for the good of our Nation, and the American public at large is also willing to allow its tax dollars to be spent on a worthy cause. However, we in Congress owe it to the whole country to make sure that our service members are not sacrificing needlessly in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that tax money is not being squandered. 
   The American public and Members of Congress have largely not been aware of exactly where the money is going, where the funding that we are providing has been going, and there is widespread reports of contractor fraud. There is bribery, there is waste, there is theft of reconstruction funds for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the reason it has been is because we have not fulfilled Article I in Section 8 which gives Congress the power to raise and support our armies and determine how this money is being spent, because this Congress, up to now, has rolled over and given this President everything he asked for without asking the questions because they have allowed him to use the emergency supplemental funding process. 
   For those in America and those on C-SPAN, what that means is that that is a type of funding that prohibits us in Congress from doing exactly what the Founding Fathers said we must do in Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution, and that is to raise and support armies and determine how this money is being spent. 
   It is because this administration has used the dubious practice of emergency supplementals to fund the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan away from congressional oversight, that is why we have had fraud. 
   That is why we have had bribery. Emergency supplementals do not go through the normal budgeting and appropriations cycle. 
   The administration has also not been forthcoming in providing the detail as to what specifically the funds in the supplemental budget request is being used for, and as a result, Members of Congress typically have not had the opportunity to scrutinize the request thoroughly. Supplementals are considered on an expedited basis and basically a sight unseen. 
   That is why what the Blue Dogs are doing with our resolution is so important. It pulls the covers off and it says let the Congress do the job that the Founding Fathers put us here to do. 
   One more point I want to make in the Iraq Study Group report that came  out, it recognized this problem, and it mentions briefly the issue of budgeting for Operation Iraqi Freedom, and specifically they recommended that funding be placed back in the regular budget process, away from the supplemental, saying that this should be done to increase transparency and accountability. The Blue Dogs are taking that recommendation and doing with it what was recommended, and for those of you that have that report, you might find that recommendation on page 59 and 60. It is recommendation 72. 
   So, to correct this problem, we in the Blue Dog Coalition are introducing this bill. As Mr. Ross said, we will be doing it later this week. This bill will allow the Members of Congress the time and the information required to provide proper oversight of defense spending and contracting, and it will allow us the time to apply the new PAYGO rules recently passed by the House of Representatives, and, most importantly, it will allow the American people, that is what this election was about, it was about this country and this country taking this country back and putting into practice those things that the Founding Fathers gave us to do, and in the process the American people will become more fully educated on the true costs of this war and the sacrifices they are making and make sure that this money goes where it is supposed to go, and will hopefully, prayerfully bring our sons and daughters, our husbands and our wives, our fathers and our mothers back home safe as soon as we possibly can and end this war.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of this most important piece of legislation. This is the most important piece of legislation to stimulate our economy in this entire session. 
   What we have before us in this House today is a choice: Will you stand with the few, as my friends on the right are doing? Will you stand with the few multibillionaires who are not paying their fair share while the rest of America is paying a 35 percent rate on their income? Will you stand over there on that side with multibillionaires who are paying just 15 percent? Will you stand with 30 million American families who will get property tax relief? Or will you stand with those who have not, who are hiding behind capital gains, when they know very well that they are not putting capital in. That's why we have capital gains at 15 percent. But these fund managers are not. They are being compensated for ordinary income. Why should they be different than the housewife and the fireman? 
   Make the right choice today. Stand with America and let's vote for this bill.

   The Republicans are plain wrong; and, worse than that, they are not telling the truth when they stand over there and say that our budget raises taxes. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
   This Democratic budget does not raise taxes one single penny. In fact, section 203 of the Democratic budget explicitly provides for tax cuts. 
   One, middle-income tax cuts, including the marriage penalty. That is in this budget. That is a tax cut. Including child tax credits. That is in this budget. That is a tax cut. And the 10 percent tax bracket. And on top of that, you talk about the President's tax cuts, the President's tax cuts in 2001--

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Well, Mr. Chairman, my point was simply to try to respond to the accusations that were made to our side. I will respect that. 
   But my point, if I may continue, is that it really gets on your nerves a bit when the other side makes these accusations which are totally bald-faced wrong. When it says, for example, the previous speaker said, for example, that we did not support the President's tax cuts. Not only did we, as they said, on the Democratic side, some of us did, but we have very seriously kept, the tax cuts of the President from 2001 and 2003 are secured in this budget. That is a fact. And they are consistent with our House pay-as-you-go rule. 
   The alternative minimum tax, which otherwise would hit tens of millions of families, these families are protected in this. 
   And the area where it presses us so and in previous budgets, the President's previous budgets have cut veterans. We increase the funding for veterans by over $2 billion in this budget. 
   It is a good budget.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, we have just heard from the other side about what we are doing. And based upon what they are doing, it is very important for us to set the record straight, that they have had control of this place; and for the last 5 years, since 2001, under this Congress and this administration, they have borrowed more money just from foreign governments alone, from foreign nations, more money than all of the previous 42 Presidents and administrations. 
   And I know that is shocking to the American people. But it is important. That alone is a glaring example of the outright mismanagement and the lack of fiscal responsibility that they put us in debt to that tune. 
   Again, since 1789, the foundation of this country, all the way up to 2001, they borrowed more money in the last 5 years, $1.6 trillion. We only borrowed $1.3 trillion from 1789 from foreign countries to 2001. That is why we have to move with a responsible measure like this. 
   On top of that, Mr. Chairman, finally, I want to say that, in addition to borrowing that money, they inherited a surplus of $5.6 trillion that was squandered in addition to the debt that was acquired.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I stand here tonight as probably the only Member of this House of Representatives that is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, the Blue Dogs, as well as the New Dems. That is a broad cross-section of diversity within our party that is not shared by this party, and I make that observation only because the American people are watching this tonight. The truth must come out and be said properly. 
   That is why all three of these groups, moderate, conservative to the liberal are behind this budget. Let me state very quickly, because there is one fact I want understood tonight, and that is that this budget is not a tax increase, does not raise taxes one penny. 
   Let me quote, for example, and this is not Democrats who are just saying this, this is what economists from the Concord Coalition, moderate conservative economists say. ``Thus to be  clear, the Democratic budget resolution does not call for or require a tax increase.'' That is not just us saying it. 
   From the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, this is what they say: ``The House plan does not include a tax increase.'' 
   The Alexander Hamilton Project of the Brookings Institute says this: ``This Democratic budget does not raise taxes.'' 
   Now, that is so important for us to get across tonight. They have run the polls. They did their surveys. Stick it to the Democrats, just say they are raising taxes. That will stick with them. 
   But not tonight, Mr. Chairman, not tonight. These are other people who are speaking and saying that the Democrats' budget does not raise taxes.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. (SUPPORT THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS BUDGET -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Black Caucus is offering a budget to help us get out of the financial mess that we're in. We have seen this chart before, it shows the deficit over the years, how in 1993 we started to eliminate the deficit, ran the budget up to a surplus, creating a 10-year budget of over $5.5 trillion. The policies that have now gotten us into a mess have changed that $5.5 trillion surplus into an almost $3 trillion deficit, a swing of $8.5 trillion. 
   The first thing the Black Congressional Caucus budget does is to repeal the policies that got us into this mess by rolling back the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts for that portion of a person's household income over $200,000. By rolling back the brackets for the first two brackets and eliminating the tax cuts for capital gains and dividends, primarily for that portion of the household income over $200,000. People will say it is a big tax cut. So what. Those policies got us in the ditch. We are repealing those policies to get out of the ditch. 
   Now what does that do to the budget? The Congressional Black Caucus deficit is better every year than the President's budget. The President's budget is in red, the Democratic alternative is in blue. The Congressional Black Caucus beats both of them every year, except the last year, we only had a $141 billion surplus in the last year, the Democratic budget has $153 billion, but of course, the President's budget is still in the ditch. We have significantly reduced the deficit $339 billion better bottom line cumulatively than the President. 
   We also save interest. By reducing the deficit, we save interest. Every year, we have saved more and more interest. $27 billion less interest paid over 5 years than the President's budget. In fact, $18 billion more than the Democratic alternative. 
   We have also addressed our priorities with the money left over. After we have reduced the deficit and reduced the amount of interest, we have also made important investments. SCHIP, $66 billion more in health care than the Democratic budget, over $100 billion more than the President. We can fund health care for each and every child in America. 
   No Child Left Behind. We are funding over $158 billion more in education and training than the President. We have honored our veterans by spending $42 billion more than the President's budget. We have attacked fraud, waste and abuse in the Democratic budget. We have made communities more secure with investments in juvenile justice, gang prevention, prison re-entry. We have provided community support through community development block grants in nutrition and housing. We have contributed to diplomacy by fighting global AIDS, child survival. We have spent significantly more in these priorities, Mr. Speaker, than both the Democratic alternative and certainly the President's budget. 
   The Congressional Black Caucus repeals the policy that put us into a mess. We address important priorities that are so important, and we have a much more fiscally responsible budget. 
   We would ask the House to adopt the Congressional Black Caucus budget that gets us out of the mess and puts on the right track.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving me this opportunity. I want to speak very briefly about this bill. This is a very, very important bill. It is critical to the future of education of our young people. 
   Let me start out by letting you know how important this is to my State of Georgia, and especially the metro Atlanta area. The metro Atlanta area is the third fastest growing child population in this country. Some 120,000 school children will enter area schools over the next 5 years. They need additional space. They're meeting in trailers. They're meeting in broken down buildings. They need help. 
   Now, Madam Chairman, I just came from a trip from Afghanistan and Iraq, and I'm very proud to say our soldiers are doing a wonderful job and all of our contractors are doing a wonderful job. They come to tell us, oh, we're doing great, we're building these many schools, we're building these many hospitals, which is wonderful, but then to come back here and to see us crawling and falling back instead of going forward to do the same thing for our own people. Not since 2001, 7 years ago, was the last time we even gave direct Federal aid to the States and the counties of our Nation to build schools, to help repair schools. 
   This bill is important because not only does it build schools, it builds them in a way that helps our environment, it builds them in a way that preserves our energy, cuts down on emissions that help global warming. It is an effective measure, Madam Chairman. It is a bill we must pass, and the time to do it is now.

   There are some who say we're not in a recession, but I can tell you this from my constituency and others all across this country, a recession is upon us. And in some areas with high unemployment, it borders on a depression. 
   So this is much needed. It comes in a timely manner. We are putting money into the hands of those who will spend it the quickest, and that means the moderate and lower income individuals. And at the same time, I am proud as a member of the Financial Services Committee to have played a small role in helping this move forward, especially in expanding the limits of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and our FHA loan extensions.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. We have just heard the gentleman from Texas lay out a scenario that is ripe full of holes. This amendment is drastic. It is costly. It is inefficient. It affects all families and individuals currently using a voucher or living in section 8 project-based housing. It's impossible to administer. Even HUD and the administration itself has not even requested it. It imposes a new unfunded mandate on private sector landlords owning Federally assisted housing, forcing them to assume the role of a welfare agency. 
   The gentleman talks about a boom on the taxpayers. This imposes a significant cost to taxpayers by raising the costs incurred by public housing. 
   And I have in my hands a letter from just about every housing and real estate and housing association in this country saying, in effect, that we are not able to support the Hensarling amendment. 
   Most exemplary of the ridiculousness of this amendment is that he asks for 20 hours of work, but doesn't say how, doesn't say when. Twenty hours when? Twenty hours a week? Twenty hours a month? Twenty hours a year? There is no way to administer it. 
   But Madam Chair, what is so hurtful to me about this amendment; yes, it is mean-spirited. But not only is it mean-spirited, my friend, it is, indeed, bigoted. It is, yes, a bigoted amendment. Let me tell you why. It reflects a very  stereotypical negative view of certain economic racial groups of poor people, poor families, because it singles them out for an ill-defined work requirement that does not apply to other families and individuals receiving Federal assistance. 
   This amendment needs to be dealt with for what it really is, and quite honestly, it is an insult to the Congress of the United States. And I submit it is even beneath the dignity of the Congress of the United States to even entertain this amendment.

This is a message that is targeted to a group of people, no matter how small they may be, who believe that certain people are categorized as wanting a handout, or that they are lazy, or that they don't want to work. So then the cry comes, before we can give them any help, make them work. Make them get a job. 
   Madam Chairman, that is what this is about. In my humble opinion, 20 hours of work, not even defined, whether it is a day, whether it is a month, whether it is a week, no requirements in it, is an unfunded mandate. 
   On top of that, Madam Chairman, there are already included in this bill a number of provisions to encourage work, to encourage self-sufficiency, including reduced work disincentives. 
   So in closing, may I say, Madam Chairman, please vote against the gentleman's amendment.

   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I stand 100 percent behind this bill for a responsible redeployment of our troops out of Iraq. Much has been said. There are several points I would like to make going forward.  
   First of all, this is responsible. This is not something that was just put together. This was put together with military advisers of the first order, generals on the ground who were consulted, and by two of the most distinguished individuals in this Chamber, our distinguished chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. TOM LANTOS, and our distinguished chairman of our Armed Services Committee, Mr. IKE SKELTON. Nobody can argue their credentials. Nobody can argue the credentials of the military advisers that put this together. 
   But most importantly, the people that no one has mentioned, the entity that no one has mentioned, the most important entity of all is the American people. This bill represents the will of the American people. Seventy percent of the American people support this action today. 
   Now, let me remind you of the words of Robert Jackson, one of our distinguished Supreme Court Justices in the steel seizure case of 1952, when a similar situation was in place, where we were at loggerheads then with the executive branch and the legislative branch, but at that point, the Supreme Court decided that Congress has the authority. And Jackson went on to say that when the executive branch denies, disrespects and disavows the authority of Congress, we enter into what is referred to as a zone of twilight, or a twilight zone.     
   That's where we are now, to get out of this twilight zone of destruction and mayhem, of instability in the Middle East. You talk about stability in the Middle East. We are more unstable in the Middle East now as a result of what we have done. 
   Get us out of this twilight zone. This bill is the way to do it, and I commend it and hope we pass it overwhelmingly.

   First of all, this is a responsible effort for redeployment so that we can refocus and fight the war on terror. The situation in Iraq is a civil war compounded by civil wars that have been going on ever since Abraham, Hagar, Sarah, Isaac, Ishmael, Esau, Mohammed and his son-in-law, which has broken into the Shi'as and the Sunnis; hundreds of thousands of years, folks. 
   None of the people from Iraq came to this country and asked, please come over and pump in $500 billion, 3,600 of the lives of your precious sons and daughters to make a democracy for us. That was a decision that was made counter to the authorization in the first place. It was a go against weapons of mass destruction. 
   It is responsible. It is focused. We need to do it, and I urge passage of this bill.

   The other point is that there are 16 companies who provide crop insurance. If this rather draconian amendment were even adopted, it would severely wreak havoc in the crop insurance industry as we know it and provide fewer choices for our farmers. 
   Again, it is beyond the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Committee.  
   I respectfully ask that we oppose the gentleman's amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. (HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank very much the gentleman from Massachusetts. 
   First of all, some of my colleagues may not realize this but our economy is ill. It is sick. It's in a desperate situation, and more than that, millions of American citizens are just barely hanging on by their fingernails. At the core of this problem is housing. 
   Now, it's important for us to realize that this is not a Democratic plan. It's not a Republican plan. This is a plan that has been put together by both Democrats and Republicans and the White House and the Financial Services Committee in the House and the Banking Committee in the Senate.     
   The American people are crying out for help. They are watching us intently to see if we are going to respond. 
   Everything in this bill has been worked out, and everything in this bill has been applied with safety and soundness. We hope, Mr. Speaker, that especially what we are offering in support of the GSEs, Fannie and Freddie, and to an extent the home loan banks, is a piece of medicine that will be taken lightly, simply from the mere fact of us putting this forward. Hopefully we will send a loud message to all the financial markets and to the investors and give them the confidence to move in without us even having to go the extra step. 
   In the process of this, as Secretary Paulson has indicated, it is important that we give this strong medicine an opportunity to get a vote of confidence from Wall Street and the investors. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac control half of the outstanding mortgage loans in this country. That's an extraordinary amount. That's nearly $6 trillion. If that goes by the wind, our economy sinks. It will be a dereliction of our duty as the Congress of the United States for us not to put the full weight of the Treasury Department with the consultation of the Federal Reserve Chairman in place to make sure there is stability. Before the Secretary even moves, he must send a declaration to document that this is necessary to protect the stability of the market. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, on the other point, we can't just deal with Fannie, we have got to protect that. But we have also got to protect our States, our local communities, right at the grassroots level. There are communities that are being devastated due to foreclosures, where we are averaging over 1,000 foreclosures each day, to give the local communities the help they need to buy up these loans.

<DOCNO>Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. (IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Thank you very much. It is indeed a pleasure to be on the floor with you, gentlelady and good friend from Ohio. You are doing a wonderful job in leading this hour. 
   To the Congressional Black Caucus and the leadership of the Congressional Black Caucus, America must take its collective hats off to the Congressional Black Caucus for from the very beginning it has been the Congressional Black Caucus that has provided the leadership in speaking out on this war in Iraq and in speaking out from a standpoint of what is wrong with it. And I am proud to be on the floor with you this evening. 
   I thought that I might come at this from the perspective of where I sit in the Congress. I was not here when the actual vote took place 6 years ago to commit our forces to Iraq. I was a part 5 years ago coming into Congress with that first class that came in after 9/11, and it was an extraordinary time. But I think it's very good for us, as we look at this situation in Iraq, to be able to reflect from it. My father always would tell me, Son, the best way for you to get out of a problem is to remember how you got into it in the first place. And it might be good for us to do that. 
   I happen to serve on the Foreign Affairs Committee. I am the vice chairman of our Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and International Trade. I also am a member of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, and I am the co-chairman of our Democratic group on National Security. I mentioned those positions that I work with here in the Congress so that you can understand the perspective from which I come to this very important issue of Iraq. And let me just state at the very beginning, as I said, it's good to know how you got into a situation. 
   There is one profound fact that happened on 9/11. On the very day of 9/11 after a conference in the White House between our Vice President Cheney, Defense Secretary Rumsfield, and Deputy Defense Secretary Wolfowitz, collectively they said these words: Iraq must pay for this. That's very profound. On the day of the 9/11 attack, the basic architects of this policy said, without one iota of evidence, without one iota of anything, Iraq must pay for this. Not even knowing it was al Qaeda, but automatically. 
   Now, I mention that simply because, as I said, we have got to know how we got into a situation to know how we get out of it. That's very profound. The reason I mention that is that from the very beginning there has been a line of direct effort by some, the major architects of this most misguided foreign policy, to equate Iraq with the war on terror. A colossal mistake and the history books will reflect that. We then prepared to go in and attack a country that did not attack us. 
   I am on the Foreign Affairs Committee, and last week I sat with great admiration and I truly believe I have great admiration for General David Petraeus. He's a general, he's a soldier's soldier, and he is doing and has done a remarkable job, as have all of our military. But as I sat there and I watched him, this general, my mind went back to another general at the beginning of this by the name of Colin Powell. Here was the same situation. After 9/11 we sat there and a general was put in front of us to sell us on going to war with Iraq, with information and intelligence that many in the administration knew was not true. The books that are pouring out now by the bushel tell us that everybody, from the CIA to the Defense Department to so many who were saying this, in other words, that the intelligence books were cooked. Not a single person from Iraq came over to us and asked us, Come over to our country and turn us into a democracy. 
   No, this was a war of choice based upon lies and deceit, and that is why this will go down in history as the biggest foreign policy blunder in the history of these United States. Make no mistake about it. 
   So the question has to be now, why? Here we are in Iraq on lies and misinformation that are out now by the book loads; so we can't deny it.     
   And the American people know it. And they are expecting this Congress of the United States to stand up to this White House and say, ``No more.'' 
   Let me tell you something, folks; I've been over there to Iraq, three times I've been over there. I have met with our soldiers, I have eaten with them. But the most important part of my trips over there was not to Camp Victory or to the Green Zone or to Baghdad. Even my meetings with General Casey, General Abizaid, all of them, which I cherish and I have pictures and all of that, and even the meeting I had with one soldier from Georgia who came up to me and hugged me with tears streaming down his eyes, tears streaming down my eyes, and he said to me, Congressman Scott, when I'm hugging you, it's like I'm hugging a piece of home. I can't tell you how I felt. 
   But ladies and gentlemen, let me just tell you the most significant parts of these trips was on the way back. Each stop that I went over to go to Ramstein Air Base, Landstuhl, that's the hospital, that's the medical center. That's where they come, the injured come when they are injured in down country, as they call it, in Afghanistan and Iraq. That's where they are. You want to know about this war, you want to know why this war needs to be ended, that's the story, to look into these 18- and 19- and 20- and 21-year-old kids' eyes, half their heads blown off, arms missing, blind, and they ask the question, why? Why? Why are we here? 
   I'm telling you, somebody's going to have to answer that question. On the bleached bones of many past great civilizations and nations are written those pathetic words, ``Too late.'' They moved too late to correct a great wrong. I beg and I hope that this Congress has the resolve in it to not move too late now. The whole world is depending on us. 
   One of the things that President Bush did, and we've got to understand it, what he did in sending General Petraeus up is the same he did in sending Colin Powell up. And history is going to write it, not DAVID SCOTT, not Mrs. TUBBS JONES, not this Congress, history is going to write that this President will go down in history as being a President that highly used and  misused our military. That is one of the greatest shames coming out of this Iraq situation. 
   And now, here we are in Iraq. I don't think the American people know that over one-half of our entire combat capacity is involved in Iraq. If I'm China, if I'm Russia, if I'm Iran, which they are, they're sitting back fat and happy, anxious to see us continue to run our military in the ground in this fruitless effort in Iraq. Soldiers, many of them on their third and fourth tours of duty. Fifteen months they've extended it to, not even giving an equal amount of time for rest because they know that the military is at the breaking point. No way we can continue this war. It will run our military into the ground. 
   And now let me just say one word about the President's move here. What this is is the President is saying to us, I'm not going to end this. It's not going to be on my watch. Even out of his own mouth he says we will hand this enduring relationship in Iraq over, as he says it, to my successor. That's what he said, to his successor. 
   So the American people have nixed that. The President is out of the picture, but we here in Congress are in the picture. It's up to us to not move too late. We must correct the direction we're headed, and the first order of business is to end this war in Iraq.
