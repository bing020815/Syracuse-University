   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California for yielding. 
   Of the many concerns my constituents had as they looked at the Congress over the last few years, one of the most important and troubling had to do with the minimal amount of time we were repeatedly given to address important pieces of legislation. Indeed, it seemed often that the more important the legislation before us, the less time we had to read it. 
   My colleague from Georgia talked momentarily ago about the Medicare prescription drug benefit. During debate on that bill, there were important elements of it that no one seemed to understand. I asked repeatedly if people could explain it. I was told by one speaker on the then-majority side, You will have to ask somebody on the Ways and Means Committee; I am only on the Rules Committee. But we all voted on it. We voted on things repeatedly that we had not been given a chance to read, that were not allowed for amendment, and that was wrong. And I commend our leadership for trying to set a new tone, and I welcome the support of our colleagues on the minority side as they commit to trying to work with us. 
   Included in this rules package is a commitment by our leadership to allow adequate time for consideration of legislation before it comes to a vote. The situation here is this: we ought to make sure that we can look our constituents and our colleagues in the eye  and say that before we voted on this legislation, we had ample time for ourselves and our staff to study it and we knew what was in it. 
   For too long lobbyists have written legislation. On some of the legislation I have talked about before, I had lobbyists calling me to say I should vote for a bill, the text of which was not even available to the Members themselves. 
   Members of Congress have the responsibility to give themselves and one another time to study legislation, to debate it, to hear from both sides, because there are good ideas on both sides and, frankly, there are bad ideas on both sides. So let's work together in this new Congress to set a new tone and a new precedent and a new practice.

   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to respond. And let me say I acknowledge the gentleman's concern and I share it to a significant degree.

   Mr. BAIRD. I appreciate the gentleman's point. I would just echo the sentiments of the gentleman from New York earlier. 
   Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us in these early opening days of this session is legislation that has been debated extensively and been available extensively over the past couple of months, indeed, some of it was passed in the last Congress. I would suggest that we have had time to look at this. 
   I would concur, and I will say that in the future, when future measures come up, especially measures that are new to this body, I will work very vigorously to ensure that the minority has adequate time to study, to debate and offer amendments to that legislation.

   Mr. BAIRD. I have great respect for the gentlelady's intent here. As a clinical psychologist before entering this body, I worked with victims of domestic violence and have been a strong advocate for the Violence Against Women  Act and other things to support victims of domestic violence. 
   The challenge I face here, and I think we all face, is that this is not a good offset. As Chair of the Research and Education Subcommittee of the Science Committee, I have met extensively with the National Science Foundation, and I will tell you that they are already substantially overstretched in their ability to manage the numbers of grant applications and oversee the grants that are already being administered. 
   The President himself has asked for a substantial increase in funding for the National Science Foundation. That has broad bipartisan support within this body and within the other body. 
   If we were to cut the management funds, as this proposes, we would dramatically impair the NSF's ability to manage that increase; indeed, to manage their current workload. 
   I have met with the people managing the grant process at the NSF. I have met with the applicants, and we have spent extensive time on this in our subcommittee. While I support the intent of trying to provide more funding for violence against women, this is not the way to do it.

   Mr. BAIRD. I appreciate that. I understand you have done that, and I respect the diligence here. 
   The challenge they face is they are literally bursting at the seams. They do not have office space, sufficient computer architecture, they do not have sufficient personnel. I can't vouch, and it would be foolish for any of us to try to line-item or justify each and every expense, but I can tell you what they have told me is they lack the space. 
   If you are finding items for conference room rentals for meetings, that is perfectly understandable to me that when you have people coming back to have meetings, you may occasionally need additional space. 
   My bottom line here is this is an agency that I think by and large gives a very strong return on investment for the government and for the taxpayers, and a $10 million cut to an administrative fund for an agency that already tells us they lack adequate resources I think is excessive. 
   I am sorry, I am going to have to say we should defeat this amendment and try to find other ways. As the distinguished gentleman mentioned earlier, we have already seen substantial investments in this area over and above the President's request as far as the area of violence against women.     
   I would just encourage the gentlelady to say well done to the Democratic majority for adding to this relative to what the President offered. 
   But I would urge my colleagues, and I can tell you personally from having met with and visited with NSF administration, they do not feel, and my understanding, they can sustain a $10 million cut to any portion of their budget. But the administration portion is what enables them to manage the grants, to manage the research that this country's future and domestic security and economic competitiveness depends on. 
   So I'd urge defeat of this well-intentioned amendment with unfortunately an undesirable offset. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, no votes in Congress are more wrenching or difficult than those involving war; whether that vote involves initiating combat, or in this instance, steps to bring about the end. The consequences are profound, uncertainty about the right course is great, and there are strong feelings on all sides. 
   Every member of Congress is committed to the security of this Nation and to supporting our troops and their families. There are legitimate differences about how best to achieve those goals, but the core commitment to security and to support of our troops should not be doubted or questioned, regardless of where one stands on this matter. 
   Before the first vote authorizing force in Iraq in 2002, I asked fundamental questions of the President: `What will the cost be in human casualties on all sides? What are the international and potential regional scenarios that might be developed? What is our long term strategy for the region?' I also asked about the economic costs to our Nation and the world, and about the likelihood of religious conflicts leaving our soldiers caught between warring religious factions with grievances that are centuries old. I asked what provisions had been made to care for the wounded and their families when they return? I called for greater commitment to resolving the Israeli/Palestinian issues and for reducing our Nation's dependence on petroleum. Finally, knowing well the history of the region, I asked how long our commitment was expected to last if hostilities were initiated. 
   Not one of these questions was answered by President Bush, Secretary Rumsfeld or any member of the administration. That is why I voted ``no'' on that initial resolution. Sadly, the same questions remain today and they have still not been answered by the President, which is why I will vote ``yes'' on the bill before the House today. 
   For the sake of our Nation's security, for the safety or our troops, for the sake of our economy at home, for the sake of our international standing, we must say to the Iraqi leaders and to the world, `We have removed a dictator from power, we have disarmed a tyrant, elections have been held, and a constitution is in place. We have shed the blood of our finest, we have indebted our children, we have tried to help rebuild infrastructure and put in place the basis of a democratic republic. Now, it is up to the Iraqi people themselves to find a political solution that is in everyone's interest and will lead to an end to the bloodshed.' Our Nation cannot and should not attempt to impose that solution indefinitely; it must come from the Iraqis themselves. 
   Today's bill says just that. It provides the necessary funds to continue to support our soldiers in the field. It adds much needed resources to ensure they receive care when they come home. It addresses needed priorities within our own Nation. And, most importantly, it says affirmatively, there will be an end to our role in combat in Iraq and it is time for our Nation, for the Iraqis, and for the world, to begin to prepare for that time. This cannot go on forever. 
   Those who talk about staying the course without end, as well as those who would call for opposing this bill because they want the war to end tomorrow, must all recognize that in the process of this conflict, our overall military readiness has been profoundly impaired and our Nation is now vulnerable should other, more severe, threats emerge elsewhere in the world. At the same time, our local preparedness of the National Guard is in tatters. Our Guard lacks key resources, equipment, and manpower to respond to fires, floods, or other disasters or to join in serious conflicts elsewhere if called upon to do so. This bill, quite rightly, seeks to correct these deficits. 
   The reality before us today is that we cannot immediately stop funding for our forces or neglect the readiness deficits that now endanger our Nation. That would be irresponsible and would leave our soldiers on the ground and our citizens at home and abroad in greater danger. It would also endanger the lives and hopes of the Iraqi people themselves and leave them vulnerable to extremists and chaos. 
   At the same time, however, it would be equally irresponsible to allow this hemorrhaging of blood and money, this neglect of our own Nation's needs here at home, to continue unchecked. This legislation changes the direction for our Nation and says the Iraqi's must change the direction of their Nation. They must take responsibility for their own security, share their oil wealth equitably with their own citizens, arid establish fundamental constitutional reforms. This bill requires that our President must certify that such things are being done. 
   Far from `tying the hands' of the President, this legislation gives him much needed direction. If it becomes law, President Bush must at long last say that his own people, the American people, in the constitutional democratic republic that is our Nation, and that he is sworn to defend, have spoken through their representatives and have said it is time for change. It will soon be up to the Iraqi's themselves to determine the fate of their own Nation so that we can, at long last, may again determine the fate of ours. 
   If you care about the security of this Nation, vote ``yes'' to restore our military readiness. If you care about our soldiers, vote ``yes'' to give them the equipment they need while deployed and the care they need when they return home. If you want to see an end to this conflict, vote ``yes'' to begin the process that will at last bring that about.

   Mr. BAIRD.

<DOCNO>Mr. BAIRD. (FEDERAL OCEAN ACIDIFICATION RESEARCH AND MONITORING ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by complimenting my dear friend, Mr. Allen, and Mr. Gilchrest, as well as Mr. Inslee, and particularly Mr. Inglis, who worked so closely with me on the manager's amendment to this bill. 
   We have an enormous problem facing this world, and it is often neglected. This bill addresses that. 
   On Monday, I had the privilege of being in Fort Lauderdale at the International Society for Reef Studies, their coral reef symposium, which happens every 4 years. Based on reports there and recent studies published in Science and other leading journals, it is clear that although ocean acidification is not often talked about, it may well be a challenge as great or perhaps even greater as climate change. 
   Approximately one-half of the carbon dioxide released by burning fossil fuels has been absorbed by the oceans. The good news is that this absorption has helped reduce and delay the impact of global warming. The bad news, however, is that the absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide has caused and will continue to cause changes in ocean chemistry. 
   The disruption in ocean chemistry causes the pH to decrease and results in a phenomenon identified as ocean acidification. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ocean hydrogen ion concentration, a measure of acidity, has increased 30 percent since industrialization. Studies have projected that by the end of the century, carbon dioxide emission scenarios could result in the lowest levels of ocean pH in 20 million years. 
   The potential impacts of acidification are diverse and far-reaching. These impacts include adverse effects on marine ecosystems, food webs for many fish and marine mammals, and the economies of many coastal States that rely upon the seafood industry and coastal and ocean tourism. 
   Increasing acidity and changes in ocean chemistry are also corrosive to corals and shell-forming plankton, a major food source for baleen whales and commercially important fish species such as salmon, mackerel, herring, cod and others. 
   Some studies have also suggested that ocean acidification could be detrimental to shellfish, including scallops, clams, oysters and lobsters. Evidence shows that calcification rates will decrease and carbon dissolution rates will increase for these calcifying organisms leaving them unable to compete ecologically, perhaps even threatening them to the point of extinction. 
   Shallow water corals face similar threats due to decreased ocean rates and increased shell corrosion. Corals comprise some of the richest habitats on Earth. According to NOAA, about 4,000 species of fish, including approximately half of all federally managed fisheries, depend on coral reefs and their related habitat for a portion of their life cycles. 
   Juvenile fish may face physiological challenges, including respiratory stress and acidosis associated with increased acidification. Deep sea corals and other animals are also threatened by changes in chemistry, and may find parts of the deep ocean uninhabitable by the end of the century. 
   We must do more to assess this grave problem. There is significant uncertainty as to the rate and magnitude of change that will occur, but national investment in a coordinated program of research and monitoring could improve the understanding of ecosystem responses, assess socioeconomic impacts due to increasing acidification, and provide resource managers the information they need to develop strategies and protect these critical species. 
   That's why I have joined Representatives Allen, Inslee, and others, in introducing the Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act. This bill establishes an interagency program through the Joint Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology of the National Science and Technology Council to develop and coordinate a comprehensive plan to better understand and address the impacts of acidification, to provide for assessment of ecosystem and socioeconomic impact of ocean acidification, and to provide for research on adaptation strategies to conserve marine resources. It also directs NOAA, the National Science Foundation, and NASA to conduct research and monitoring activities on ocean acidification consistent with the strategic plan developed by the subcommittee. 
   I want to thank the researchers who have led the way on this important topic, also my fellow sponsors for their important work, and particularly Chairman Gordon and the other members of the Science and Technology Committee for moving this bill and getting it to the floor. 
   Finally, I want to thank the Science Committee staff, including Jean Fruci, Shimere Williams on the majority staff, and my own staff member, Hillary Cain. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from South Carolina for his input and involvement and for his genuine interest in this. It has been a privilege to travel with him, and we actually had the opportunity to meet with some of the world's leading scientists on this, and I know Mr. Inglis has maintained that dialogue ever since those journeys, and those scientists send their regards. I met with them just 2 days ago, in fact. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to now acknowledge a dear friend from Washington who has been a leader not only in the Congress but in the world on the issue of renewable energy and climate change. This issue of acidification took particular relevance off our own Pacific Northwest coast about 2 months ago when NOAA published studies suggesting that the rate of acidification is much more rapid and much closer to our shores than they had ever anticipated, and it is deeply concerning. Jay Inslee has been a champion of responsible energy policies. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee).

   Mr. BAIRD. I thank the gentleman from Florida for his support. I also want to acknowledge the leadership of Mr. Lampson from Texas and Mr. Hall and their support of this as well. 
   Let me close with this, and it takes off from something that Mr. Inslee said a moment ago. We can debate the temperature changes. I think the evidence is compelling from the IPCC report. But ocean acidification is something you can demonstrate in a lab. You can introduce CO  
   2 into the air, above water. The water will take up the CO 
   2. That will make the water more acidic. The more acidic water will reduce the availability of calcium carbonate and other minerals. And then, as Mr. Inslee described, and as laboratory scientists are doing throughout the world in Australia and Israel and Jordan and off our own Florida coast, you can take these organisms, put them in this more acidic water, and you will see their growth be retarded. You will see their mortality rates increase. And, importantly, when you combine higher acidification levels with increased temperature, the mortality grows dramatically up. We are effectively killing the oceans and then possibly killing ourselves. 
   I am speaking on behalf of two little boys, William and Walter, my own sons, whom some of you know. They stop by here from time to time. They're 3 1/2 . I would like them to enjoy the oceans the way we have. I would like them to see the magnificent species that we now enjoy. I do not want to bequeath to those young boys or to anyone's children or grandchildren a world bereft of the coral reefs and the many species they depend on. 
   So with that I urge passage of this legislation and would urge that we vigorously endeavor to reduce the factors that are contributing to this dangerous problem. I urge a ``yes'' vote.

   I am particularly pleased about the aspect of this legislation that will eliminate what I feel are counterproductive barriers to participation by firms that receive venture capital in the SBIR program. This issue was brought to my attention by a local  firm, nLight Photonics, which is leading the world in high-capacity semiconductor lasers. 
   Many of our top high-tech companies demand startup venture capital in order to build the infrastructure they need to produce the products which save us money, save us lives, and help stimulate our economy. These successful companies, however, often would like to branch out into a parallel area, perhaps not their primary pursuit, but a parallel area for which SBIR funds would be fully appropriate and advantageous. Unfortunately, under current rules, that is prohibited. In other words, the very companies that have proven successful and have been able to demonstrate to venture capital that they have a process, personnel, and products that are worth supporting are then precluded from Federal support. This bill corrects that. I commend the gentlelady and Mr. Wu for recognizing that. 
   I want to thank Mr. Graves, who worked on this with me several years ago, and again thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle. It is a good bill. It will help, by the way, address some of those energy challenges that the gentleman who just spoke alluded to.

   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, this is indeed a landmark day in the United States of America in the history of health care because the Congress of the United States, the House of Representatives, is going to say that mental illness deserves treatment and people suffering from mental illness deserve to have that treatment covered under their insurance plans. 
   I want to commend Jim Ramstad and Patrick Kennedy for decades of work on this project. They are American heroes, in my judgment. They joined me for a field hearing in my congressional district where we heard from families, patients and providers about the toll mental illness takes on their lives. 
   As a clinical psychologist who spent 23 years providing mental health care, I want to share with my colleagues this simple fact. I have never met, and I am sure you have never met, anyone who has not been touched personally by a family member, a friend, or a coworker whose lives have been disrupted by mental illness. All of us in some way have been touched by mental illness, in our families, our friends, or our coworkers. What this bill does is say that people suffering from such illnesses will be covered under insurance plans. 
   I want to be clear about one thing. This is research-based, it is effective, it saves lives, and it saves dollars for our economy. Research-based, effective, it saves lives, and it saves dollars. This legislation supports it. 
   Congratulations, Patrick Kennedy and Jim Ramstad. I urge a ``yes'' vote on behalf of millions of Americans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, it is indeed an honor for me to be here along with such distinguished colleagues giving just praise and recognition to a nation which is a leader in a very, very difficult environment. I want to thank Ms. Ros-Lehtinen and the distinguished gentleman from American Samoa, and I particularly want to thank the chairman of the committee, Mr. Lantos, for supporting and introducing this resolution. 
   We all know the Middle East is a region which is fraught with difficulties. If ever there is a region that needs and deserves models of courage, integrity and vision that is such a region, and if ever there were such models of integrity, vision and courage, Jordan and King Abdullah II are precisely those models. 
   In the most recent municipal elections, we saw not only a commitment to democratic reforms, but a commitment to moving forward with women's rights, and as many of us who have had the privilege traveling to Jordan know, the kingdom has been a real leader in this region, not only in promoting democratic reforms, but seeing that women are promoted to high positions of office within the cabinet and within the Parliament. It is a lesson that not only nations within the Middle East but within the world at large could benefit from. 
   In addition, the Kingdom of Jordan and King Abdullah II have led efforts to try to bring Islamic scholars from around the world to craft new visions for modern, pluralistic, tolerant and progressive visions of Islam, and the Oman declaration, which does not get nearly the attention it deserves, has been, I think, a visionary statement guiding and inspiring many people throughout the region. 
   In addition, I think it is worth saying that the Kingdom of Jordan has stepped up to try to help in the region. As we deal with the conflict in Iraq, they have provided valuable training to the Iraqi police and others. One of the challenges Jordan faces right now is the influx of nearly 1 million refugees, as was mentioned. This is a country that faces challenges in terms of energy costs, water availability, et cetera, and still, with all the challenges they face, they have reached out to try to assist others. 
   We have talked a lot in this body and elsewhere about the need for models in the Middle East in the hope that Iraq could one day become a model of democracy. I certainly share that hope. But I would say to my colleagues, we already have some very, very good models in that region, and it is deserved that we would commend them and recognize them today. Jordan is precisely such a model. King Abdullah is precisely such a leader. 
   I am grateful that my colleagues today would take the time and the effort to recognize such achievements by such a courageous leader in such a wonderful country. 
   I would urge my colleagues to visit Jordan, to meet with their King, with the members of their Parliament and their cabinet officials, and I am sure they will share my sense of deep admiration and respect for what has been happening there. 
   So I urge passage of this legislation. I hope it marks a positive step, not only in recognition of Jordan, but a step in which this body finds ways to acknowledge the many positive achievements that are taking place in a region which we all know has many difficulties. But if we only focus on the difficulties or the bad news and we neglect the good news and the accomplishments, particularly when they are achieved by nations and individuals of such prestige and courage as Jordan, we would be missing a golden opportunity. 
   Thankfully, today, this House of Representatives will not miss that opportunity. We will acknowledge and recognize the recent elections and reforms by the Kingdom of Jordan and extend a hand of friendship and admiration to all the people of Jordan and to King Abdullah II himself. 
   With that, I thank all of those who cosponsored this legislation on both sides of the aisle. It truly has been a bipartisan effort. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of this fine resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. BAIRD. (AMENDING THE HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING ACT OF 1991 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 1068, a bill to amend the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991. This is a bipartisan bill which Congresswoman Biggert and I introduced. 
   I want particularly to acknowledge the role Mrs. Biggert has played in working to develop this legislation over the past several years. This bill is based on a bill introduced by Congresswoman Biggert and Congressman Lincoln Davis during the past two Congresses. And in both those Congresses, the bill passed the House. 
   I also want to thank Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall for their support for the legislation, for helping to advance it through the committee and to bring it to the floor. 
   H.R. 1068 will improve the planning and coordination process for the major Federal interagency research program in information technology. Information technology is a major driver of economic growth. It creates high-wage jobs, provides for rapid communication throughout the world, and provides the tools for acquiring knowledge. 
   For example, information technology helps to make the workplace more productive, to improve the quality of health care, and to make government more responsive and accessible to the needs of our citizens. 
   High-performance computing and networking is not only an essential component of U.S. scientific competitiveness, it also has important industrial, medical, and defense applications. 
   Vigorous long-term research is essential for realizing the potential of information technology. The technical advances that led to today's computers and the Internet evolved from past federally sponsored research, in partnership with industry and universities. High-performance computing is necessary as we work to develop new ways to transfer vast amounts of information around the world. 
   The depth and strength of U.S. capability in information technology stems in part from the sustained research and development program carried out by Federal research agencies under a program codified by the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991. That act is widely credited with reinvigorating U.S. high-performance computing capabilities after a period of relative decline during the late 1980s. 
   The 1991 act created a multi-agency R&D program to accelerate development of information technology and to attack challenging computational science and engineering problems. The 1991 act also put in place a formal process for planning and budgeting for the activities carried out under the interagency R&D program, which is formally known as the Networking and Information Technology R&D Program. 
   The need for this legislation today arises from what I would characterize as a weakening over time of the planning and prioritization process for the program. 
   In order to maintain our competitiveness, we must ensure that the resources available to advance high-performance computing technology are allocated to the highest priority areas and that the activities supported are carefully coordinated among the performing agencies. 
   Toward that end, H.R. 1068 requires formal biennial reviews of the interagency program by its external advisory committee in order to provide advice from the research community and from the information technology industries on how to sharpen program priorities and improve program implementation. Also, the required annual progress report for the program must now include a formal response to the recommendations of the advisory committee. 
   H.R. 1068 calls on the agencies carrying out the program to focus more effort on high-end computing. The key requirement is for the Office of Science and Technology Policy to create and maintain a road map for developing and deploying high-end systems necessary to ensure that the U.S. research community has sustained access to the most capable computing systems. 
   Finally, this bill clarifies the grand challenge problems supported under the interagency program, such as clean energy production, climate change, and patient safety and health quality, which are intended to involve multidisciplinary teams of researchers and demand the most capable high-performance computing and networking resources. 
   Consistent with this requirement, the bill also specifies the provisions for access to high-end computing systems includes technical support to users of these systems. 
   Mr. Speaker, the interagency information technology research program launched by the 1991 act has been largely a success. H.R. 1068 will serve to strengthen this vital research program and deserves the approval of this House. I ask my colleagues for their support in passing H.R. 1068. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

We hope with the changes we made to this bill, it will meet the approval of the other body. This is not a partisan issue. This is about keeping American science and industry at the very forefront of the world. This bill will help us do that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, when we examine market barriers for advanced research energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies, we find that a simple lack of public knowledge often keeps those technologies on the laboratory shelf and out of the marketplace. Outreach and education of building and industry professionals and other key decisionmakers will undoubtedly accelerate the deployment of beneficial energy technologies and practices into the larger marketplace. 
   Through the guidance of Congressman Brad Miller, we sought to address these challenges in the energy bill of 2005 by establishing in section 917 a network of Advanced Energy Technology Transfer Centers. These centers would be a partnership between local entities and DOE to showcase advanced energy technologies and simply teach the right people how to utilize them. 
   Mrs. Biggert worked with Mr. Miller to refine this section of the EPA Act in her bill, H.R. 85, and I believe it is a valuable improvement that will get these centers up and running sooner. 
   This bill came through the Science Committee and passed the House last year as part of H.R. 6203. It was a good idea then, and Chairman Gordon saw that it should be treated the same in this Congress. Like the other two bills before us today, the Science and Technology Committee passed this bill out of committee with no objection. I again commend my colleague from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert) for working with the majority on this important bill, and I urge its approval by the House. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I just would echo Mrs. Biggert's astute comments. We talk a lot in this body and in the administration about the importance of launching new energy research initiatives. The fact is we have a number of efficient technologies before us today, and the real challenge is getting those out to the public to be implemented as soon as possible. 
   The quickest way to address our energy challenge is not to immediately invent some miracle cure. The quickest way is to implement the existing technologies and mechanisms that we have already before us to begin saving energy today. 
   I encourage passage of this bill and commend Mrs. Biggert for her leadership.

<DOCNO>Mr. BAIRD. (COMMENDING THE PEOPLE OF WASHINGTON FOR SHOWING THEIR SUPPORT FOR VETERANS -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BAIRD. I thank my friend and colleague from Texas and the gentleman from Florida as well. I want to commend Chairman Filner for his support as well. 
   I am very, very pleased today to recognize the efforts of my constituents, who joined together with many others from across Washington State to unite in a common endeavor, to help our veterans and their families. The desire of Washington residents to help our veterans has led to the creation of the Veterans Family Fund Certificate of Deposit in November of last year. 
   As my friends have described earlier, anyone wishing to show their personal support for our veterans can do so in a simple way: They can simply invest in a 6-month Veterans Family Fund Certificate of Deposit. After the 6 months, as mentioned earlier, half of the interest earned on the certificate goes back to the individual who invested, but the other half of the interest is donated as a charitable contribution to the Washington State Department of Veterans Affairs' Veterans Innovation Program. 
   The Department of Veterans Affairs will use the new funding to provide assistance to veterans and their families in areas where none is otherwise available through the State or Federal Government. This will include direct grants for emergency financial assistance and efforts to promote the long-term financial stability of Washington State's veterans. Speaking personally, as someone who worked in the VA system as a clinical psychologist, I can tell you how valuable this sort of flexible individualized assistance can be to helping our veterans and families. 
   Last year, Congress stepped up to the plate and provided significant increases in funding for our Nation's veterans, but this is a creative way for the average citizen to show his or her support for the brave men and women who  have served in the Armed Forces. This program was entirely citizen-driven, and it demonstrates the power of interested individuals who come together to make a difference. 
   I would like to particularly acknowledge Jane Jacobsen, who was the first to come up with the idea for the program, and Mike Worthy of the Bank of Clark County who made his institution the first to participate in the program and has already sold more than $300,000 in CDs, including one which I was happy to invest in myself. I also want to acknowledge John Lee, the director of the Washington State Department of Veterans Affairs, who has supported the project from the very start. And, in particular, I want to give special recognition to the outstanding Governor of the State of Washington, Governor Christine Gregoire, who has been a key supporter and advocate for this program from its infancy. 
   I am joined in this effort by the entire Washington delegation on this resolution to commend the people of our State for showing their support for the needs of our veterans, and we encourage residents of other States to pursue similar creative ways to show their support for veterans. Again, I thank the Chair, I thank the gentleman from Texas and the gentleman from Florida for their time, and urge passage of this resolution.

   Mr. BAIRD. I would just like to thank you for supporting this initiative and would in turn support your proposal. 
   What this comes out of is citizens saying, Look, we've got young men and women, and as many people know in this conflict, it's not just young men and women, it's people of all ages overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan and throughout the country. And when they come back home, we want to show them our support. It's a fine thing and a proper thing that we would wave a flag and say thank you for your service. But sometimes people need more than just a thanks. Sometimes they need the ability to visit a loved one; sometimes they need a home repaired; sometimes they need a little bit of help financially to go to school. And the kind of program that we are putting forward today allows over and above what we are already providing through our VA services to average citizens to provide support for doing just that. It sounds like that is what you are seeking to do, Mr. Kennedy. I commend you for your efforts and look forward to working with you. 
   Mr. KENNEDY: I likewise thank the gentleman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I simply rise to congratulate my dear friend and colleague, Congressman Larsen, for his tireless efforts on this. 
   This bill has been around for several Congresses. It has had wide bipartisan support. And as my friend, Mr. Inslee, said, this was done the right way. Mr. Larsen held countless hearings, met with virtually every imaginable interest group. There were compromises, sometimes difficult, sometimes painful compromises. But in the end, we have a truly remarkable area of land set aside. And, Mr. Larsen, our friends in the other body, Senator Murray and Senator Cantwell, worked very vigorously on this, and I congratulate them. And, as Mr. Inslee did, I also want to congratulate the many citizen groups who worked so hard on this. 
   I encourage my friends on the other side to recognize that no bill will be perfect, but this is about as good as you are going to get. This is an area definitely worth preserving, and the people on the ground support it, by and large. It is one thing to say that it is nice for people to set aside wilderness in their own area and not other areas, but doesn't that converse also apply in not opposing an effort of someone to set aside a wilderness in his own area? I would think the reasoning would suggest that it would, and I urge support from both sides of the aisle on this. 
   I would just finally conclude with this. It is not possible for us to construct or build new wildlands. We can't do that; it is not within our power. What is within our power is to protect the small remaining areas of wildlands for all the future generations. This legislation does an admirable job of achieving this. I urge its passage, and I commend my friend and colleague, Mr. Larsen, and the entire committee for working on this.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BAIRD. My colleagues, as someone who opposed the invasion of Iraq and believes it was one of the most egregious mistakes in the history of this country, I rise today to implore you to not make a mistake today by demanding that we begin an immediate withdrawal. 
   The facts on the ground are that the situation is improving in Iraq. Courageous Americans have given their lives and time away from their families to make that happen. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have died in a conflict that we created. We have a chance now to try to improve the situation. 
   Progress is being made. Do not let anyone today say it is not. Violence is down. Political leaders are reaching out across the aisle. Shias are meeting with Sunnis. Sunnis are meeting with Shias. They need more time to succeed, and an insecure situation will undermine the progress, not further it. 
   We need to have more time to debate this resolution today. We need to take the good parts of it, keep those in, but abandon this requirement for an immediate withdrawal. 
   There is a big difference between 1 year, which this measure says we have to be out in, or a 10-year horizon. We should find the nuance now that we can agree on.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BAIRD. I thank the gentlelady. 
   One of the things I am most proud of about this budget, and I want to commend Chairman Spratt for his work on, is his emphasis on keeping America competitive. And I want to talk about two ways it does that. 
   First of all, as my colleagues have mentioned, it fully funds the America COMPETES Act. It provides funding allowances to make sure that we have adequately trained teachers in science and mathematics to make sure that we have research investments. 
   This morning, on the 50th anniversary of the creation of the Science Committee, we heard from Bill Gates, the CEO of Microsoft. Chairman Gates spoke about the absolutely essential importance of training the next generation of scientists and engineers and of funding critical basic research in applied sciences. If we want our economies to be strong, we must invest in science. This budget provides for that. 
   The other side, which my colleagues have also mentioned, is career and technical education. I am proud to have cofounded the Career and Technical Education Caucus in this Congress. And I can tell you if you talk to business people throughout this country, they will tell you they desperately need trained and skilled workers. The President's budget would zero out the Perkins grant program, which provides essential resources for our career and technical education programs. Our Democratic budget restores that funding. If you or your child want a job in a highly skilled profession, career and technical education can provide that. Our budget makes sure those programs have the resources needed. 
   I am proud to support this budget.

   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Subcommittee on Research and Education, as a scientist, as an educator, and perhaps most importantly of all, as a parent, I commend this legislation. I'm very proud to support it fervently. 
   I want to focus in particular on some of the sections of the bill that we authored along with my dear friend, Dr. Ehlers, on the Science Committee. I especially want to commend Ranking Member Hall and Mr. Gordon for his great leadership. 
   Title VII of this bill reauthorizes the National Science Foundation and is based on legislation authored by Mr. Ehlers and myself. This title includes some very exciting provisions. It helps ensure the strength and vitality of basic research at U.S. colleges. It strengthens and expands K-12 science, technology and math education. It provides additional support for new investigators to help keep the best and brightest in the STEM pipeline. It strengthens STEM programs for 2-year institutions. It focuses attention on interdisciplinary research, and to stretch our Federal dollars, it encourages university and industry partnerships to make every dollar go further. It expands the range of state-of-the-art research tools supported by the foundations. It requires NSF grantees to train their students in responsible and ethical conduct. It specifically recognizes the importance of social science to our Nation's security and competitiveness. And it acknowledges the increasing importance of service science to our Nation's competitiveness. 
   Finally, it includes needed improvements to planning and coordination for the major Federal interagency research program in information technology.     
   I am grateful to all the committee members and to our staff: Chuck Atkins, Jim Wilson; Dahlia Sokolov; Alisa Ferguson; Lewis Finkel; Hilary Cain on my own staff; and soon to depart but with much gratitude, Marc Korman on my staff. 
   Mr. Speaker, our Nation was founded by scientists. We don't talk about that often enough. But Franklin, Jefferson, and Washington were passionate about science. They would be proud of what we are doing today. 
   In the Dome of this magnificent Capitol, if you look up and see the great picture of the Apotheosis of Washington, he is surrounded by images in many cases representing the science and engineering achievements of this great Nation. 
   For the sake of our future, for the sake of our children, for the sake of our economy and our security, pass this good bill. 
   I commend all those who participated in making it a success.

<DOCNO>Mr. BAIRD. (NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support today of H.R. 1867, the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2007. 
   H.R. 1867 was introduced by myself, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ehlers), and several other members of the Subcommittee on Research and Science Education. It was ordered reported by the unanimous vote of the Committee on Science and Technology, and is widely supported by industry and academia. 
   The National Science Foundation was last authorized by Congress in 2002 for 5 years, so we are right on track to ensure the continued growth and relevance of this very important agency. 
   The National Science Foundation is the only Federal agency whose mission is to support science and engineering research across all disciplines. Currently NSF funds 20 percent of all basic research conducted at American colleges and universities. In many fields such as mathematics, computer sciences and social science, NSF is the major source of Federal backing. 
   In its 57-year history, NSF has helped cultivate a scientific research enterprise in which the capacity for creativity and innovation is unrivaled in the world. Some economists estimate that half of the U.S. economic growth since World War II has been the result of technological innovation stemming from basic research and development. 
   NSF also has a mission to achieve excellence in U.S. science, technology, engineering and mathematics education at all levels and in all settings from kindergarten through postdoctoral training. 
   I don't think we can stress enough the critical leadership role that NSF has in improving STEM education, and I want to especially thank Science and Technology Chairman Gordon for tireless efforts on these issues. 
   In addition to supporting research and education grants at colleges and universities across the country, NSF also helps to support the construction of world-class research facilities and equipment that help to attract the top scientists and engineers from around the world to U.S. universities. 
   As we have seen high-paying jobs outsourced, our children graduating high school well behind their international peers in understanding basic science, other nations surging ahead in export of high-tech products, it has finally sunk in, funding basic research and teaching our kids math and science has a huge impact on our economy, our competitiveness, our national security, and our population's well-being. 
   H.R. 1867, like H.R. 362 and H.R. 363, two other Science and Technology Committee bills that passed the House just last week, is one more important piece of the House leadership's innovation agenda. It is also consistent with the administration's own American Competitiveness Initiative, which called for a 10-year doubling for three science agencies, the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Department of Energy's Office of Science. 
   H.R. 1867 was developed with input received during two subcommittee legislative hearings, a number of other NSF policy hearings held over the last many months, and countless informal conversations with NSF stakeholders both inside and outside of government. 
   Dr. Ehlers and I personally traveled over to NSF last month to meet with the Director and all of the Assistant Directors to receive their personal input. 
   In drafting H.R. 1867, we tried to limit it to policy, administrative and budget issues that have arisen since the last authorization in 2002, while leaving the Foundation with maximum flexibility in translating our guidance into practice. 
   Likewise, we minimized the specific carve-outs, especially in the research account, where all of the grants are awarded through a competitive, merit-reviewed process, and where the Foundation often needs to respond quickly to new fields of science and new ways of doing science. 
   I want to especially thank all my colleagues on the committee, especially Dr. Ehlers, Ms. Johnson, Ms. Hooley, Mr. Gingrey, Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall, for helping to improve this bill and move it expeditiously through the committee process. This was a bipartisan effort from beginning to end. 
   Mr. Chair, this bill is critical to American innovation and competitiveness. I urge my colleagues to support passage of H.R. 1867. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

I want to express a special gratitude to my own staff member, Hilary Cain, for her leadership on this and great counsel; as well as the committee staff, Jim Wilson and Dahlia Sokolov for their tireless efforts. They have spent hours and hours on this. We are grateful. 
   With that, as Dr. Ehlers and others have so eloquently said, this is a good bill, it is a bipartisan bill. It has the endorsement of a long list of sponsors, who I did not enumerate here in the interests of time, but virtually every major scientific organization as well as leaders in industry and in academia have endorsed this bill strongly.

   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the sense of what the gentleman is raising with his second order amendment. Having taught science myself, I believe it is absolutely important to share different sides of it. My concern is I think you are sort of micromanaging the education process, however, positive your intent may be. And the gentleman himself just acknowledged that students from K-12 need to have balanced information. 
   I question whether we really want to mandate that a kindergarten teacher educate her or his students on the impact of greenhouse gases on U.S. energy security, global developing nations, et cetera. 
   I think it is a fair point and absolutely an important point that we present different sides of this issue, and I applaud the gentleman for raising that. 
   I would, however, note that the International Panel on Climate Change, which we have had two hearings of in this committee, has clearly unanimously agreed on some general principles: That the climate temperature is increasing; that humans are significantly responsible for at least a substantial portion of that increase; and, that it will have very important consequences for the well-being of the world. 
   So one of the problems I have is the gentleman's amendment would seem to suggest that there is an equal weight of evidence against that perspective as there is in favor of it. And I don't recall if the gentleman attended those two hearings, but if he did, I think it was pretty clear that scientists from around the world do not consider that there is an equal weight among those who might refute the evidence of global warming and the human causes thereof. 
   It is absolutely legitimate that we look at the pros and cons of the various strategies to remedy that; but to micromanage it in this way, which is not what the gentleman from California's initial amendment did, I think is a mistake. I certainly wouldn't want a kindergarten teacher who is trying to educate his or her students about the potential problems of global warming to say, ``Oh, my goodness. I don't have in my curriculum for these 5-year-olds a lesson on the impact of greenhouse gas on developing nations or United States energy security.'' I think a kindergarten teacher might be much more likely to say, ``Hey, kids the world is getting hotter. You and I and your folks can have a role in trying to reduce that problem, and it is in all of our best interests to do so.'' 
   I would hate to see a kindergarten teacher micromanaged like this, however well-intentioned the gentleman's amendment is. And I still reserve the point of order, but if we don't succeed in that, I certainly urge opposition to this at this point.

   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Chairman, I very much appreciate and admire and respect the gentleman from Florida, and I understand full well where he is coming from. He has been a passionate supporter of our manned space program, and I share some of his concerns about the impact on that budget. I do think, however, that his offsets are wrong, and that is why I reserved the point of order which in just a moment I will press.     
   There are many, many places in the Federal budget where we could find possible money to support the gentleman's aims, many within, for example, the Commerce appropriations bill. 
   It is possible for the gentleman to adjust revenue impacts of tax cuts. It would be possible for the gentleman to seek offsets or matches through funding for the war in Iraq, which is burning about $2.5 billion per week from our economy. 
   So if the gentleman is interested, as I know he is, in supporting space flight and continued investment in that, I would suggest that more appropriate offsets are available elsewhere in the Federal budget. 
   And I would also say it would be just terribly unfortunate to hold the Science Foundation budget, which this bill authorizes, hostage. You've got the wrong hostage. There are other places where lots more money is being reduced from the revenue stream or being expended on things that may not be in the best long-term national interest of this country. And for that reason, and for the fact that I actually consider the amendment nongermane, I will have to oppose it.

   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Chair, I have reserved a point of order. The amendment offered by the gentleman is not germane to the bill it is amending and, therefore, violates clause 7 of rule XVI. 
   The underlying section of the bill being amended is specific to the National Science Foundation, while the amendment introduces another unrelated agency, NASA, so the subject matter of the amendment is different than the underlying bill. 
   In addition, the amendment places an unrelated contingency on the authorization of NSF funds. On this point I would cite Deschler's Precedents, Chapter 28, 31.22. 
   Lastly, the purpose of the underlying section of the bill is to authorize appropriations for NSF, while the amendment seeks to affect the appropriations for NASA, so the fundamental purpose of the amendment is different from the underlying provision, and the scope of the underlying provision is significantly enlarged, and, therefore, I would urge that the amendment be ruled out of order.

   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I appreciate the gentleman's comments about the budget deficit, and I would first suggest that the deficit rose to historic levels under the leadership of the former majority party, largest deficits in the history of this country, indeed, were accrued with President Bush and the former majority. 
   Looking to these studies, some of which are $10,000, now absolutely we must make sure that we spend all the taxpayer dollars wisely. But let me just share with you what the American Association for Advancement of Science, probably the most prestigious scientific body in this country, has said. Prohibiting specific grants sets a dangerous precedent for scientific research that has progressed and advanced for decades through freedom of inquiry into a broad spectrum of subjects. While congressional oversight of Federal programs is, of course, important, second-guessing peer review in this way could compromise the fabric of our public research enterprise one thread at a time. Therefore, we urge you to oppose such amendments. 
   Similar sentiments have been voiced by the Association of American Universities. 
   And I would be tempted to ask the gentleman from California, except he's already stated his piece, why he would be opposing research that has been supported by the United States Army Research Institute; that is seen as critical to the security of our troops serving in Iraq. 
   Now, my wager is the gentleman's saying to himself right now, I have no idea what the chairman is speaking about here. And that's the problem. When you look at a cursory examination of the title, or an abstract, you don't have an idea. That's why we have peer review. 
   Which particular study am I talking about? I'm talking about the Study of the Accuracy of Cross Cultural Understanding of Others' Emotions. What we are talking about here is if you're going to be dealing with people from another culture, and you misread their expression of emotions, it can cost you your life, your buddies their life, or the innocent civilians their lives. The U.S. Army Research Institute believes this is important, and they support the basic elements of this kind of study. 
   I also am not sure, the gentleman seems to suggest, it seems, that we here in the Congress, with a cursory evaluation of the abstracts from studies, should insert ourselves in the peer-review process. I wonder if the gentleman had looked at chemistry research or physics research in the same way, and do we really want to spend this body's time, and do you, sir, or you, sir, have the expertise to evaluate these studies? That's why we have a peer-review process. That's why we have a National Science Foundation. It is why we have a Science Foundation Board to direct us. 
   I absolutely agree that if taxpayer dollars are going to be spent on research, it is incumbent upon the scientist to do the research well, ethically, responsibly, and that it be relevant. But I do not believe it is the place of either side of this aisle to single out particular studies, as has been done in this case, and presume that with a 5-minute examination we know better than peer reviewers who have the degrees in the relevant fields and have spent years studying them and have evaluated them. That is a dangerous precedent to set, and I would urge strongly opposition to this amendment and a similar one which will emerge shortly for the sake of our soldiers.

   Mr. BAIRD. I could answer the question. I am just giving you the caveat about staking your life on things. 
   Here is the issue: I don't think we want to say that we should never study the history of things. It is the perspective of this gentleman that we should not study history. And particularly, when you look at bison, I am not an expert in this, but to pretend to be so would be a mistake. To pretend to be so on your side or on my side would be a mistake. The authors of this study have contended that biologists and social scientists have tried to look at how humans make decisions to maximize and minimize risks in different environmental conditions. As you face different food supply systems, how do you deal with that? And that is part of the point here. How did people who live on the plains look at where they were going to harvest bison?

   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for yielding. 
   The challenge here, my friends, is you asked, I think, a question that is  just improperly placed. Neither of us is trained in these areas. You are challenging a fundamental tenet of how we do National Science Foundation research. If you truly believe that the most cost-effective use of this body's time, and that we are qualified to use our time in that fashion, is to, one by one by one, review National Science Foundation grants for our considered and qualified judgment of the appropriateness of those grants, it seems to me that that is a bit of a stretch. It seems to me that you are really making a political statement. 
   If the political statement you want to make is we should spend the taxpayers' dollars wisely, I, 100 percent, agree. You may not know it, and probably don't, that we are working with the National Science Foundation to establish a letter actually that scientists that receive public grants would have to sign saying they understand the money came from the taxpayers, they are committed to doing research that is well designed and ethically high quality and that is relevant. 
   The problem for us, in this brief time we have here and lacking expertise in the field, is it is really presumptuous of us on either side to say I can either attack or defend. I would yield time to either of you if you want to tell us what your personal qualifications are in the area of expertise of any of these studies, and I will hold you to it. What personal qualifications do you have in the broad area of this study to speak to that study?

   Mr. BAIRD. Let me just share with the gentleman the dangerous path you are on. There was a study some time back dealing with the sex life of the screw worm, perhaps aptly noted. The sex life of the screw worm, that would be pretty tempting to come to the floor and say, by God, why are we spending taxpayer dollars studying the sex life of screw worms? The reason being that that research saved the cattle industry millions of dollars by eliminating a parasite that deposited eggs in the placenta of newborn cows. 
   We don't have the knowledge. We are indeed stewards of the taxpayers' money, which is why we created the National Science Foundation, why we are very careful about designating how the peer-review process works, and, quite frankly, why we shouldn't mess with that peer-review process. If we truly want to be stewards of the taxpayers' money, which I believe all of us want to be, then our best approach is to delegate some of the decision making about where some of that money is spent to those who best know the realm in which the research is spent. It is precisely because I believe in the task of being a steward of the taxpayer dollars that I oppose the general purpose of the amendment. 
   I understand you are trying to save money. I just don't think our best way to do so is by micromanaging either this or most of the other foundations. 
   And I thank the gentleman from Virginia for yielding.

   Mr. BAIRD. I thank the gentleman from California. Just a couple of brief comments, and it's getting late, so we don't want to carry this forever. 
   I would suggest that we all agree that consistency is a very dangerous thing. If the gentleman talks about being consistent, I would ask the gentleman why they chose not to micromanage the vast expenditures of dollars, not even to have oversight hearings of the vast expenditure of dollars on the war. 
   If you really want to save the taxpayer dollars, we are burning $2.5 billion a week in Iraq. This entire bill is $21 billion over 3 years. We're talking about 3 full years to fund the basic scientific research of this entire Nation, from mathematics to physics to chemistry to social sciences. That's about 6 or 7 weeks or so of what you spend in Iraq. And yet when it came to oversight of the expenditures in Iraq, the majority, then-majority party was then just virtually silent. If you really want to save the taxpayers' money, and I do, you could have looked at that. 
   But let me suggest what the gentleman from New Jersey misrepresents. And I asked earlier if any folks on the other side were qualified to study this. The gentleman from New Jersey just doesn't seem to understand how this legislation works. He completely misrepresented when he said that it is incumbent upon the majority and the chairman who is bringing this forward to defend these studies. Sir, this bill does not authorize specific studies. That is not how the authorizing language for the National Science Foundation works. It would be ludicrous, and you should know that; and if you don't know it, you are not qualified to speak to this. But it would be ludicrous to suggest that when you authorize a foundation, that you are authorizing every single specific study or that you know what all those specific studies are. That's not how the National Science Foundation works. That's not how we authorize it. That's not how this bill functions. And it's indeed not how many, many of the authorizing bills function here. So to suggest that, to bring forward a broad authorization bill that gives responsibility to a foundation, one has to justify every single study is to misrepresent how this legislation works. And that's the problem. I think the gentleman either misunderstands or misrepresents how the legislation works. 
   I thank the gentleman from California for yielding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, here's the problem with what the gentleman is proposing, however well-intentioned it may be. And I am deeply concerned; as the gentlemen know, I serve on the Budget Committee with some of the gentlemen who are speaking, and we are all concerned about the long-term deficit picture for this country. However, if you cut investments in scientific research and scientific education, in the long run you will increase the deficit of this country, and you will decrease our national security, our national health care and our national and international competitiveness. That is why this is a mistake. 
   And don't just take my word for it. The National Academies of Science, in Rising Above the Gathering Storm, a 2005 publication, called for more than a 10 percent increase; the U.S. Commission on National Security, the Hart-Rudman report, a similar level of increase; the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology, in their publication, Assessing the U.S. R&D Investment in 2003; a coalition of 15 industry associations, in the publication Tapping America's Potential, in 2005; the Council on Competitiveness in their publication, Innovate America. 
   This is not just a Democratic proposal or Republican proposal. I would remind the gentleman that this bill passed unanimously out of committee with bipartisan support. 
   I would also encourage you to ask your faculty administrators, ask your high technology industries, do you think this country is spending sufficient quantities on fundamental basic research and investment such as that funded by National Science Foundation? And do you think we are doing enough to keep our young people educated in science and math in ways such as supported by this legislation? I guarantee you most of them would say no. You would, I think, by this cutting, with due respect, significantly be impairing, and it sounds like a small measure, but remember, we are already falling behind in a number of areas in science and math, not only in the education, but in the applied fields. 
   This is consistent with President Bush's own administration request of a 7 percent per year increase. Again, this is a bipartisan approach, not a Democratic or Republican approach. The President has called for this. And again, as Dr. EHLERS said so eloquently earlier, our return on investment from research is profound. And when you cut that investment, I think you're cutting that return on investment.

   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Chairman, I will be very brief. I want to echo what the distinguished ranking member said. 
   The following countries are increasing their investment in basic research faster than this legislation would authorize, and they've already put the money up front. Listen to these countries and see if you think it is wise for our Nation to reduce its investment even further, and further fall behind: China, Taiwan, European Union, South Korea, Singapore and others. Do we seriously want to further reduce our investment in basic research if we want to keep our Nation competitive? I submit we don't, and I would urge defeat of this amendment. 
   I thank the gentleman.

   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, we have been over the basics. Let me just reiterate, this proposal for the increase in the National Science Foundation is thoroughly consistent with President Bush's own agenda. The competitiveness initiative calls for these kinds of increases. That is point one. 
   Point two: If we hope to maintain our competitiveness, if you look at the proportion of our economy today that is the direct result, and Dr. EHLERS illustrated a number of examples, but the direct result of research and inventions that have come out of funding by the National Science Foundation, a tremendous amount of our economic prosperity today came from those investigations. 
   As Dr. EHLERS so eloquently said, we don't know, ``we'' generally, not just we in the Congress, but especially we in the Congress, don't necessarily know which particular investigation, which particular study, is going to yield those profound results. But some will. 
   I will tell you, I just spoke to a scientist in my district last week and he  said to me, Congressman, the pipeline of U.S. scientists is drying up. You just really have to understand this. The pipeline of U.S.-based scientists is drying up, because the research funding is not adequate to meet the demand. 
   What is happening is many, many young researchers are either not entering the field or are dropping out of the field or abandoning potentially promising careers, promising not just for them, but for our society. 
   The hit rate, if you are a young researcher applying for a grant through NSF, your hit rate is low. You are going to spend a tremendous amount of effort applying for a grant, trying to further your research agenda, and your hit rate is going to be significantly low. That is demoralizing. It blocks important avenues of research that might yield promising results. 
   And when we make these cuts, it is easy for us. I agree that we have got a huge fiscal problem. But, again, I will tell you that if you look at the long-term drivers of the fiscal problems this country faces, nobody says it is that vast waste at the National Science Foundation that is driving this country into debt. That is not what they say. They say it is a combination of revenue, it is a combination of entitlement programs, it is a combination of defense. I agree we ought to debate those, but not on the back of the National Science Foundation, for goodness sake. 
   So I would urge defeat of this amendment for the same reasons I urged defeat previously.

   Very briefly, in 2002, 397 Members of this Congress, including 194 Members of the then-majority party Republicans, voted to double, double, the National Science Foundation. 
   For those members of your party who plan to vote against this bill or who plan to vote for this reduction in the authorized levels for this committee, I would just suggest you well may be voting against something that you voted for just a few years ago at much higher levels and that the President signed into law. The then-majority voted to double the budget. The President signed it into law at much higher levels than what we are talking about today. 
   In the last Presidential election, somebody ran around with a flip-flop guy chasing Mr. Kerry. If you do this, the flip-flop guy might be outside your door.

   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I would like to thank the gentleman from New Jersey for making precisely the case I have tried to make myself. The case I have tried to make myself is that it is not in the best purview of this body to intervene and micromanage specific studies. 
   The reason I point that out is because the gentleman spoke about important health issues. One of the studies he seeks to eliminate funding for addresses an important health issue. Menopause is tremendously important to the women of this society. It is fine for two men to get up here and decide whether we want to fund menopause research; but I will tell you, every woman in this country is going to go through it, and they think menopause matters. 
   One of the studies that the gentleman wants to reduce funding for is very important in terms of addressing the factors that influence how menopause develops. I would share with the gentleman, although my knowledge is somewhat limited, I believe there are correlations between menopause and a number of the issues the gentleman mentioned like cancer and other factors. 
   So if we believe we want to address those important matters, one of the very studies this gentleman is suggesting we eliminate funding for could very well address those very important issues. I would just urge you go back to your women constituents and suggest to them that you decided, based on your vast medical and anthropological expertise, and your vast understanding of women's health, that menopause did not merit research funding from the National Science Foundation. 
   And you may try to pick the title and say what does that have to do with Bangladeshi immigrants, et cetera. It may have a lot to do because natural experiments in which one population and another population may be of the same age, different, but subject to different cultural or dietary or other factors, and thereby have different variations in how they manifest certain biological processes can often give us profound insights into disease processes and the development of natural rhythms. 
   And for you or I to presume that we have the expertise to say that we don't think this study will do that because we know so much about menopause, sir, and I count myself among those ``sirs,'' I think is vastly presumptuous. Menopause is profoundly important to the women of this country. This study deals with menopause, and I am tremendously grateful to the gentleman for picking this study because in so doing, you have made the best possible case for not micromanaging this fine agency.

   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I greatly respect and admire the gentleman from Arizona, who I know is committed to trying to reduce the deficit, as am I, and we have worked on other areas on that, but let me just share a couple of things about this. 
   First of all, the gentleman talked about private industry research, and he is right about that. There is a lot of private industry research. Let me share with the gentleman some of the private industry bodies that endorse this bill, and the list is very impressive. I have got it. I would be happy to share it. If it is such a bad bill or needs to be dramatically modified, these are the organizations that support it: 
   Computing Research Association, National Defense Industrial Association, American Chemical Society, Business Roundtable, Information Technology Association of America, National Venture Capital Association, Semiconductor Industry Association, Software & Information Industry Association, TechNet, Technology CEO Council, Accenture, Advanced Micro Devices, Agilent, Apple, Applied Materials. 
   I have only it four or five. I am just on the A's. I could go on. 
   The point being, yes, private industry does fund a great deal of research. They recognize government has a very important role, and far from being deeply suspicious of that role, they profoundly endorse it. 
   As for the gentleman's amendment per se, I share with the gentleman that much of this legislation develops from research conducted by the National Academy of Science presented in Rising Above the Gathering Storm, which the gentleman may or may not have read. 
   One of the key challenges we face in our research enterprise is keeping young investigators in the pipeline. If you look at the data on when people are most productive, it does not correlate particularly well with when they get the most funding. There are a host of reasons for that. 
   Part of the reason is it takes some time to learn how to do the grants, and what we are trying to do here is to say to people, just remember that only about 25 percent of grants are funded. So the mere fact you did not get funding the first time does not mean your application is a bad application at all. It does not mean we have said it is not worthy of funding. Quite the contrary. 
   What it may well have said is it is a very good application, but given the competition and the constrained funding, in its current state, we will not choose it.  
   What this bill does is basically say to the young investigator, we will give you some help in advancing your career so you can make a second run at this. This is supported by the National Science Foundation. Folks who have done this research, and I have written applications for grants, I am sure Dr. Ehlers has, it takes you a while to learn how to do it. 
   Sometimes the young professors who are the very people who are teaching the undergraduate classes, trying to get their labs put up, they lack the resources. And on top of that, you need to understand the dynamics of the peer review process. 
   Sometimes the more senior members, the people with the long established research credentials and careers are just going to have more access to research because the peer reviewers are going to say, look, it is a safe bet to bet on this guy or this woman, they have been around a long time. The unknown person, the new person who may hold the promise of tomorrow, has a comparative disadvantage.     
   So what we are trying to do is in a small way, a relatively small way with this program, redress the difference between the new investigators. We know what that's like. We have been relatively young Members, not so anymore here in the Congress. We have had the senior Members tell us where the bathroom was, to quit voting with our meal cards and stuff like that. Nobody threw us out. They get a second chance. But what I am saying, that's what this is about. 
   I profoundly respect the gentleman. I hope he knows that. He is committed to try to reduce the deficit. This is not the way to do it. This program is actually a good program. It's by a host of scientists, a host of scientific bodies. I think we ought to defeat the gentleman's amendment, with respect, because I know his intent. In this case I think he would have an adverse effect on what we are trying to do with this legislation.

   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the gentlelady from California's amendment, and let me share with you why. 
   I think most Members of this body have had people from the scientific community come and talk to us about why their research matters or how it is going to help society, and we have said to ourselves or to them, ``Could you please put that in English so I know what you are talking about?'' 
   The challenge is that the esoteric realm that some of the scientists work in is really beyond some of our ken. And I think that is fine. But if we are going to make informed policy decisions, it is essential that we understand the research that we are making decisions about that may have been illustrated earlier tonight in some of the discussion. 
   Let me share with you, and I respect Dr. Ehlers immensely, as everyone knows. But the very researchers who, if there is concern that this proposal by the gentlelady from California would reduce funding for other research, let me point out that many of the associations whose members depend on the core research funding nevertheless believe there is merit to this amendment. And let me share with you, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, I will read in a moment what they have to say, the Federation of American Society for Experimental Biology, the Council of Graduate Schools, the Society for Neuroscience. I absolutely believe as a former teacher of science, I believe it is our obligation as teachers to help our young charges learn how to communicate what they do. But it is not being done well enough, that has been recognized, and the gentlelady is to be commended for it. 
   Let me share with you that the American Association for the Advancement of Science says the following, which I will submit for printing in the Record. ``While Federal support of scientific research is of critical importance to innovation,'' and let me underscore this, ``it is also very important that we find ways to make sure that science is effectively used to advance the human condition. Scientists and engineers must have the tools needed to communicate the work they do. The ability to more effectively communicate scientific information may inspire more children to pursue a career in science, and certainly will help a higher quality dialogue among the research community and the citizens whose investment it relies on.'' 
   So I commend the gentlelady. This is something that we don't talk about a lot; but when people have to communicate information to the policymakers or to the public or to the consumers of their research, it is important they do so in a way that is intelligible. This amendment moves an important step in that direction. I applaud her and urge its passage.

   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss an issue of importance to my congressional district in Southwest Washington. 
   The White Pass Ski Area is located in the majestic Cascade Mountains in the Gifford Pinchot and Wenatchee National Forests. The area is commonly referred to by skiers as ``the jewel of the Pacific Northwest'' for its breathtaking views of Mt. Rainer and exciting skiing opportunities. The area, which provides critical tourism revenue to the surrounding rural communities, is now looking to expand to provide greater opportunities to skiers in the Pacific Northwest. 
   The Washington State Wilderness Act of 1984 added over 23,000 acres of land to the Goat Rocks Wilderness Area and removed from wilderness designation 800 acres adjacent to the White Pass Ski Area as having ``significant potential for ski development'' and urging the Secretary of Agriculture to ``utilize this potential, in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations.'' 
   The Gifford Pinchot National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan allocated the 800-acre area that Congress had withdrawn from the Wilderness Area back in 1984 to Developed Recreation in recognition of the intent of Congress. However, the LRMP concurrently inventoried as roadless the same 800-acre area.

   Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlelady, and I thank my colleague from New York as well. 
   My colleague from New York did a very nice job of honoring our dear friend Charlie Norwood who perished of this disease. My interest comes from the fact that my father died of the disease, and I want to also talk about Mike Castle who has been a strong supporter of this legislation. Mike lost a sister and a brother to this disease. 
   What I would share with people is imagine getting a diagnosis for a disease you may never have heard of, for which there is no known cause and no known treatment, but it will be fatal. That's IPF, and as the gentleman from New York pointed out, it is estimated that the deaths, at least by some sources, that the deaths caused by IPF on an annual basis exceed the number of breast cancer deaths in this country. But my understanding is NIH currently allocates about $14 million total to research on IPF. 
   So we have a disease that is growing in prevalence, that is fatal, that we have no known cause and no known cure of, and it has claimed the life of one of our dear colleagues here and the family members of Members of the Congress. That's why we've introduced this resolution. 
   I want to commend families and friends from the Coalition for Pulmonary Fibrosis who were here a couple of weeks ago on Capitol Hill lobbying in support of this legislation. I'm pleased to see our leadership bring this up. 
   We would hope that this is a first step. Our hope is that by increasing the awareness of our colleagues here in Congress and of the American public that we can not only increase awareness of the disease but begin to work towards actual dedicated funding for this. 
   This is a cruel illness. Anyone who has seen a family member suffer from it has seen the actually rather desperate effort to try to simply breathe, and that's what happens when your lungs scar up and one goes from a stage of diagnosis where you have a little shortness of breath. Then you begin to need oxygen, to then you flat just cannot breathe and you die of this thing. There are a host of other complications that happen along the way that are not particularly pleasant, to say the least. 
   So I want to urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I would urge them to look forward to ways that we can actually do more to actually identify the causes. There is believed to be some genetic component. I know of one woman who has had five family members die of the same illness. We don't know whether that is the cause of all cases. We don't know how it's passed on. 
   But this is the kind of illness that is killing a number of our friends, now one of our colleagues and many family members of Members of Congress right here. So I urge my colleagues to support the resolution. 
   I thank the gentleman from New York. I thank the gentlelady from Wisconsin, and I particularly want to commend Nathan Deal who was one of Charlie Norwood's closest friends. It's very personal for Nathan. Obviously, it's personal for myself and Mike Castle. I would urge passage, and I thank the gentlelady.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BAIRD. I thank the chairwoman for the time and applaud her for her leadership of the Small Business Committee. I also want to thank the ranking member for his leadership as well. 
   I rise today with an amendment to improve and update the Small Business Administration's Small Disadvantaged Business Program. 
   My amendment would direct the administrator of the Small Business Administration to examine the list of groups under the Disadvantaged Business Program and consider whether it should be updated to include additional groups. This amendment does not mandate that any group be added and would not affect those well-deserving groups already included. 
   Let me explain why I believe this issue deserves our attention. The issue was brought to my attention by an Afghani American entrepreneur in my own district who is not eligible to receive SBA assistance under the Small Business Development Program. After researching the matter, I learned that the SBA does not include Afghani or Iraqi Americans in the Small Disadvantaged Business Program. 
   I found this troubling, frankly. As we seek to spread democracy to other nations around the world, we ought to consider how we are helping or not helping individuals from those countries who have come to the United States. For example, at a time when we are promoting the American Dream in Afghanistan, I believe we should be doing more to promote this dream to those of Afghani descent who have come to the United States to seek a better way of life. The same applies to the refugees who've helped our Nation in its Iraq mission but have been forced to flee their own lands for having given us that very assistance. 
   I hope we would all agree that as we work to spread democracy and freedom to other nations, we should consider how we're treating individuals from those countries who have come to the United States. Should my amendment be accepted, I hope that the administrator will pay special attention to those countries to which our Armed Forces have been deployed since September 11. 
   Some may be surprised to learn that the SBA has not updated their list of groups since 1989. I believe it's a good time now to revisit this list and to ensure that this program is not excluding any group who deserve assistance. 
   I would ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this commonsense amendment. I would ask for your support. 
   I reserve the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, while not opposed to the amendment, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition.

I think there are a number of groups under criteria that establish this program, merit discussion and examination, and particularly those who have come to our aid overseas. I'm familiar with some really heart-wrenching stories of folks who have been extraordinarily helpful to our country and face great personal hardship in Iraq and in Afghanistan. If we can help them rebuild their lives over here if they're forced to flee their country, that would be a meritorious deed. 
   But again, this is just calling for a study and, therefore, I urge its passage. I am grateful for the support.

   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend and chairman. 
   This is a good day for science and research, and that means it is a good day for the United States of America and for our economic prosperity and for our children's future. 
   As Chair of the Research and Science Subcommittee, I rise today in support of H.R. 363, the Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Act, and I want to commend Chairman Gordon for his strong leadership on this bill that we are considering now, and on the one that passed earlier today. 
   I share Chairman Gordon's absolute commitment and belief that we must take bold steps now to ensure that American students and workers are prepared for the careers of the future and so our Nation is equipped to compete in the global economy. 
   To accomplish this, however, we must make sure our young scientists receive the support they need. That is why, as many of our prior speakers have pointed out, it is critically important to invest in the minds of young researchers now, because not only are they highly productive, but one day they will fill the ranks of our senior established and groundbreaking scientists on which our country's economy, competitiveness, and indeed our national security depend. 
   That is why I am so pleased we are considering H.R. 363 today. The bill will ensure continued innovation by supporting outstanding researchers in early career stages, and ensuring that graduate students in research fields of particular importance to our future competitiveness receive adequate funding. I also share Ranking Member Ehlers' commitment to the importance of interdisciplinary scientific studies which he so well articulated. 
   This bill and the one before it that we considered already and passed today, are critically important to the future prosperity of our country. I share Chairman Gordon's commitment to them, and I urge passage. 
   I also would like to take this opportunity briefly to express support for the amendment soon to be offered by Mrs. Gillibrand of New York. Her amendment will require the National Science Foundation to institute a program to award scholarships in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics to undergraduate scholars. As a former teacher of undergraduate scholars and researchers, I know how important this stage is to career development and I support her commitment to it, applaud her offering the amendment. I urge passage of that, as well as final passage of the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. BAIRD. (THE SECURE RURAL SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY SELF-DETERMINATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express support for full reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act. 
   My district in southwest Washington state is one of the 10 most forested districts in the entire country. Because so much of the land in my district is under the control of the Forest Service, counties in my district like Lewis, Skamania, and Cowlitz rely on the Secure Rural Schools program. They are among 27 counties in Washington state that rely on funds of over $40 million a year. 
   These communities do not want to rely on this program, but a long series of events have left them without recourse. 
   For decades, heavily forested counties could rely on 25 percent of revenue generated by timber harvest in our federal forests. National Forests cannot be taxed locally, so this was a fair exchange. As timber harvest plummeted in the 1980s and 1990s, these local governments were left with barely enough funds to operate essential government services, including schools. The 2000 Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act saved these communities from dying off. It has allowed them to hire teachers, keep libraries open, and provide the services that many of us take for granted. 
   And Secure Rural Schools is about more then county payments. The program also authorizes Resource Advisory Councils and designates 15 percent to 20 percent of the county payments towards these Councils, known as RACs. RACs bring together members of the community including environmentalists, labor groups, and local elected officials to collaborate on necessary forestry projects. These forestry projects include preventive thinning that limits the danger of fires in our forests. Over 9 million acres of land burned in fires in 2006. Collaborative efforts to prevent this damage are a model that needs to be refined and expanded. That can only happen if we continue funding the program. 
   For the 780 counties, 4,400 school districts, and millions of Americans affected by this program, I implore my colleagues to help reauthorize and fund the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act. If we fail to reauthorize this critical program, counties in my district will see their school district budgets cut by more than 40 percent, community programs and services will be slashed, and jobs will be lost. 
   We must act now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today to pay tribute to a great American scientist, Dr. John Archibald Wheeler. Dr. Wheeler passed away recently at the age of 96. He was a pioneer in the fields of nuclear and theoretical physics. Along with Niels Bohr, Dr. Wheeler worked out the first explanation of how nuclear fission actually worked. During the war years, Dr. Wheeler went to work on the Manhattan Project, helping to understand the theoretical basis for plutonium production. After the war, Dr. Wheeler continued his work for the country by helping to develop the American hydrogen bomb. 
   After returning to academia, Dr. Wheeler continued his contributions to the field of physics. In 1957, Dr. Wheeler created the concept of wormholes to describe tunnels in space-time, and in 1967 he coined the term ``black hole,'' not to describe Congress, but as part of the theory of gravitational collapse. 
   John Wheeler also contributed greatly to the scientific community with his devotion to teaching and training the next generation of scientists. He was a devoted teacher and textbook author, and served as a professor for over 70 years. Some of his graduate students included Richard Feynman, Kip Thorne, and Hugh Everett, all renowned physicists in their own right. 
   Mr. Speaker, last week we lost one of the truly great scientific minds of the 20th century. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution honoring John Wheeler's achievements and expressing our profound condolences on his passing.

   A recent survey asked citizens of the United States if they could name a single living United States scientist, and, sadly, many, many weren't. In this body it is not at all uncommon for us to bring up suspension bills honoring sports teams who may have won an NCAA championship or the Super Bowl or something like that. It is thoroughly appropriate that we do more to recognize outstanding scientists who did not just win a single sporting event, but changed the face of the Earth through their intellect, through their diligence, and through their discoveries. And I very much commend Dr. Foster for raising this, and I thank him. And, I hope it is not the last that he will enlighten us with his knowledge as a physicist. I know it won't be. But I would urge this body to see what we could do more through our actions here on the House Floor and in our districts to do more to honor and elevate the status of U.S. scientists so that we could provide role models for young people and rise above the gathering storm. 
   Our science committee, chaired by BART GORDON, has helped lead the effort in that. We are proud to have passed The America COMPETES Act. The America COMPETES Act is designed to produce many, many more John Wheelers. I want to express our thanks on behalf of the Congress to his family and our condolences for their loss.

<DOCNO>Mr. BAIRD. (INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF THE REEF -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I am very pleased to be here today to speak in support of H. Res. 1112, a resolution I have introduced with my friend from Illinois, MARK KIRK. The resolution expresses the support of the House of Representatives for the International Coral Reef Initiative designation of the year 2008 as the International Year of the Reef, and for strong environmental and marine research efforts that will allow us to better understand the threats facing the planet's coral reef systems. 
   From the Great Barrier Reef that spans over 1,600 miles just off Australia's northeast coast, to the coral reefs found within the Red Sea, to the coral reef system that began forming off the Florida coast nearly 7,000 years ago, coral reefs are among the most vibrant and diverse ecosystems on the planet. Known as the Rain Forest of the Sea, these important treasures are not only the source of food and shelter to millions of sea creatures, they also provide environmental, cultural, and economic value for people around the world. 
   However, coral reefs across the planet are in peril and face an uncertain future. Global estimates suggest that 10 percent of the earth's coral reefs have already been seriously degraded, and an even greater share of reefs face serious decline. Rising sea temperatures, damage by divers and marine vessels, pollution, and other manmade threats have raised the specter that over the next century, a vast number of the world's coral reef systems will cease to exist. 
   One of the most troubling threats facing coral reefs is ocean acidification, a phenomenon that occurs when the ocean becomes so acidic that corals and other shell-making organisms are unable to produce the calcium carbonate or to use the calcium carbonate that they need to form their shells. Another disturbing trend is the onset of coral bleaching, which results from rising sea temperatures causing corals to expel the algae that live within their tissues and provide the corals' different colors. Once the algae has been expelled, corals lose their color and, lacking the nourishment provided by photosynthesis that algae provides, the coral dies. 
   In 1994, recognizing the increasing degradation of the world reefs, the U.S. partnered with other countries to establish the International Coral Reef Initiative. Through its efforts, the International Coral Reef Initiative has mobilized regional and national governments to pursue science-based management of coral reef systems, spurred the establishment of coordinated coral reef protection efforts, and assembled organizations and stakeholders throughout the world to address pollution and other manmade threats that imperil the coral reefs of the world. 
   The International Coral Reef Initiative has declared 2008 the International Year of the Reef. The Initiative is leading an international effort to continue to bring the preservation of coral reefs into the global spotlight so that we can do what needs to be done to protect these vital national resources for generations to come. 
   I would like to commend the International Coral Reef Initiative for its efforts and express my enthusiasm for the level of interest, participation, and action that has been generated as a result of its work. I would also like to thank Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall, as well as their staff, for bringing this resolution to the floor. I look forward to working with them further to ensure that the world's coral reefs are protected and preserved, and I urge passage of the resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend Mr. Kirk for his leadership on this and thank him for mentioning Representative Portman, who is really a champion of efforts to preserve the global environment. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is entirely appropriate that we do this today, on Earth Day. I wore a tie which my wife gave me for Christmas which has a picture of my twin 3-year-old boys on it. When we talk preserving rain forests or preserving coral reefs, I think all of us have this commitment, that our children and our grandchildren should one day be able to enjoy these. But if we do not act promptly, quite frankly, I fear that they will not be able to. 
   I have witnessed firsthand the degradation of some of what were the most the magnificent reefs on Earth. If you did not know what they are supposed to look like, you might not recognize the difference. But when you go underwater and things that are supposed to be there are not, species of fish, certain types of corals, gone; when you see corals that have been knocked over; when you see bleaching of almost every coral you see; when you see areas where marine anchors have been dragged across them; when you see areas where excessive human pressure in the form of divers and other things have damaged the reefs; when you see invasive species that are devouring some of the creatures that should be there; when you see runoff from nearby rivers; that is what is happening already. As populations grow, as temperatures increase,  as ocean acidification worsens, it is a very, very real possibility that reefs which we are able to enjoy, that countless species depend on, that many nations depend on for their very survival, some of the coastal nations, our own areas in Florida and elsewhere on the coast depend on for security from storms, when you see these precious resources in peril, it is deeply moving and profoundly troubling. 
   By recognizing the International Year of the Reef, I hope we can follow what Mr. Kirk said and urge Congress to take more actions to protect these valuable resources. I am proud that we can cosponsor this in a bipartisan fashion, and I will urge passage. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise on this occasion, again I mention it is on Earth Day, to seek support for House Resolution 891, as amended, celebrating 35 years of space-based observation of the Earth by the Landsat spacecraft. 
   This resolution celebrates the world's longest unbroken record of civil Earth observations of the land beginning with the launch of the first Landsat satellite on July 23, 1972. The data collected from Landsat satellites have helped advance our scientific understanding of global change and fostered applications that benefit our private sector, as well as our State, local, regional and Federal Government activities. 
   Mr. Speaker, the scientific and applied uses of these space-based land observations are vast. Landsat data are used to monitor crop patterns, manage natural resources such as water and forests, assist in land use and urban growth planning, help protect wildlife habitats and support national security objectives, to name just a few examples. Landsat's 35 year data record has also been critical in helping to understand the interactions between land cover changes and variations in the Earth's climate. 
   The most recent report of the U.S. Climate Change Science Program Report references Landsat as one of two critical satellites. It states, ``Without these satellite observations, the current pace of discovery and innovation in global land use and land cover change climate research would not be possible.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, this celebration of Landsat's continuous 35 years record of land observations provides a clear example of the societal benefits derived from our Nation's space program. But there is more to be gained from Landsat data. Increases in computing and communications capabilities are stimulating innovative approaches to using Earth observations data such as Landsat. One need only look to the Internet, where anyone can access images of neighborhoods, cities and regions to see firsthand the ways in which Landsat data are finding their ways into our lives. 
   Mr. Speaker, in reflecting on the contributions that Landsat has made over  the past 35 years and the growing applications of these data, we must remember that the success of Landsat begins and continues with people. We owe our gratitude to the many talented and hard-working scientists, engineers and other professionals who have been involved in the Landsat program. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 891. As we address the implications of climate change and the pressure on our environment and resources, it is important that we ensure the continuation of the Landsat program and ensure the research, technology and educational investments that are required to expand the use of Landsat data and the benefits they provide to science and society. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BAIRD. I want to thank the gentleman from Oklahoma. It is an astonishing history, isn't it? The fact that we have now got a continuous record of changes at all sorts of levels, changes in ground cover, changes in agriculture, changes in the water resources, et cetera, is an extraordinary resource for a host of uses. Our agriculture community benefits from this, our national parks benefit from this, flood control managers benefit from this. 
   This Landsat satellite system, which was, as the gentleman from Oklahoma pointed out, once rather controversial, is now seen as something that would be very difficult to plan without. It has produced enormous economic benefits and economic savings. 
   Who would have thought many decades ago before the space program that one day we would be able to send up remote instruments to look back down on Earth, not from the 40,000 foot level, but much higher, to give us the broad sweep; but not only the temporary snapshot, but the vast look over time, so you can see changes, both constructive changes and the losses. Absolutely incredible and important. 
   I want to share the gentleman's concern. We need that continuity to continue. Let us hope that the good engineers of NASA have produced an instrument which can last much longer, as they have in many cases, as we see in the Mars rover system, for example. But we need that continuity in the data records so scientists can see what changes have occurred over time without interruption. We need to continue that not only with the proximate, the next Landsat satellite, but future generations as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank the scientists and engineers, and thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for his support of this resolution.

   Mr. BAIRD. I thank the Chairman for the time and applaud him for his leadership of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. I also want to thank him and Subcommittee Chairman Cummings for their work in bringing this bill to the floor. 
   I rise today in support of the Coast Guard Authorization Act. This bill makes important strides in strengthening the modern day mission of our Coast Guard and enhancing our national security. 
   Also included in this bill is language clarifying the rule related to the taxation of interstate waterway workers. Under current law, most employees whose jobs require them to work in multiple states, such as our rail and airline workers for example, are taxed only by their state of residence. This has previously not been true for waterway workers. In an effort to address the unsettled tax situation of waterway workers throughout the country, I authored legislation in the 106th Congress called the ``Transportation Employment Fair Taxation Act.'' The legislation barred states from taxing a nonresident waterway worker ``who performs regularly-assigned duties while engaged as a master, officer, or crewman on a vessel operating on the navigable waters of more than one state.'' As the House report for this legislation stated, the purpose of the legislation was to ``prohibit any State from taxing the income of a non-resident interstate waterway worker.'' The Senate version of this legislation was signed into law on November 9, 2000. 
   Unfortunately, I have recently been made aware of a 2006 decision by one state's tax court that is inconsistent with the intent of the 2000 law. The court concluded that because the bill uses the word ``of'' instead of ``in,'' it only applies the waterways that are owned jointly by more than one state. This was not the intent of the 2000 law. The legislative history at the time makes clear that it was not the intent of the law. And I know what the intent was because I authored the legislation. 
   The legislation before us today makes a slight wording change to the 2000 law to clarify that the law is intended to apply to all interstate waterway workers on all waterways, not just workers who work on waterways that are jointly owned by two or more states. It is my sincere hope that this minor change will, in no uncertain terms, make clear that states are prohibited from taxing the income of a non-resident interstate waterway worker. I want to make clear that this is the intent of the language in the bill before us today, and it remains the intent of the law I authored in 2000.

   I had the honor of visiting the Kingdom of Bhutan in August of 2006. It is truly a magnificent and beautiful country with delightful people. I am proud to have authored this resolution and urge its passage. 
   Throughout modern history, Bhutan has been one of the most geographically isolated nations in the world. Nestled among the highest peaks in the eastern Himalayas, Bhutan was inaccessible by road, rail, and air throughout the greater portion of the 20th century. 
   This unique seclusion fostered in Bhutan a distinctive culture marked by rich artistic tradition, deep spirituality, and an agrarian heritage emphasizing conservation and environmental stewardship. 
   Bhutan has adopted a principle to guide its development and preserve its rich cultural heritage--the principle of ``gross national happiness,'' or as the King informed us, contentment. This unique philosophy, enshrined as Bhutan's national objective by King Jigme Singye Wanghuck in 1982, measures progress not only in terms of economic gains or technological achievement, but as a complete balance of many important factors encompassing the well-being and prosperity of the communities and individuals who make up the kingdom. 
   The pursuit of gross national happiness promotes Bhutanese cultural values as the key to the nation's development and has enabled Bhutan to progress in the modern world while maintaining its commitment to itself. By respecting these traditions, Bhutan has preserved not only its culture but its pristine national environment and enabled the kingdom to remain one of the most biologically diverse ecosystems on the planet. 
   As Bhutan continued on its careful path of development under the leadership of King Jigme Wangchuck, the kingdom began to pursue political reforms. In 2008, Bhutan observes an important milestone and celebrates a historical achievement: 2008 marks not only the 100th anniversary of the kingdom's monarchy but also the dawn of Bhutan's emergence as a democratic constitutional monarchy. 
   This process of democratization began in 1998 when King Wangchuck devolved executive authority from the throne to the cabinet and initiated the drafting of a constitution by royal decree. 
   On December 14, 2006, King Wangchuck honored his pledge and abdicated the throne, abolished Bhutan's absolute monarchy, and transferred the throne to his son, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck. 
   The new King has continued to oversee the democratization of his country. In March of 2008, Bhutan held its first parliamentary elections, embarking on the final step in its decade-long transition to full constitutional democracy. There are plans for a grant coronation in November of this year. At that time, Bhutan's first constitutional monarch will formally ascend to the throne. 
   H. Res. 1307 recognizes the political achievements of the Kingdom of Bhutan and commends the people and the leadership of the kingdom for their ability to pursue development while serving the nation's gross national happiness. We also commemorate the participation of Bhutan at the 2008 Folklife Festival, marking a unique opportunity for thousands of Americans to appreciate the Bhutanese culture that continues to flourish along Bhutan's path of development. 
   I urge passage of the resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.

<DOCNO>Mr. BAIRD. (RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF BULGARIA -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I'm delighted to support this resolution marking the 100th anniversary of the independence of Bulgaria. I would like to note my good friend Representative Joe Wilson of South Carolina for his leadership in ensuring that the House mark this important date. 
   Founded over 1300 years ago in 681, Bulgaria is one of the most ancient countries in the world. Often referred to as the cradle of Slavic culture, Bulgaria was the birthplace of Orpheus and Spartacus. It has given the world the Cyrillic alphabet, beautiful handicrafts, and folk music. 
   In September 1908, Bulgaria threw off the yoke of Ottoman occupation, proclaimed its independence, and became a sovereign state under the name of the Kingdom of Bulgaria. In the 100 years since it achieved independent statehood, Bulgaria has become a Democratic nation, a staunch ally of the United States, and an active participant in the transatlantic community. 
   Bulgaria joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, in April 2004. It has actively participated in NATO missions aimed at ensuring the security and stability of the Balkans. Bulgaria provided support for Operation Allied Force and Operation Joint Guardian and furnished peacekeeping troops to the Stabilization Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the Kosovo Force. 
   Bulgaria also has been a country of strategic importance to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan allowing the U.S. to establish bases in the country and make use of its technical facilities. Bulgaria was welcomed into the European Union in January 2007, which made the Cyrillic alphabet the third official alphabet of the Union after Latin and Greek. 
   Bulgaria has also sought to strengthen its ties to the United States. Bulgarians began immigrating to this country in large numbers between 1903 and 1910, seeking economic opportunities and political freedoms during a time of great turmoil on the continent. According to the United States Census of 2000, there were 63,000 people of Bulgarian descent living in the United States. They're undoubtedly making a rich contribution to the tapestry of American life. 
   This resolution rightly encourages opportunities for even greater collaboration between our two nations in the political, economic, military, and cultural realms.  
   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Bulgarian people on the 100th anniversary of their independence and in celebrating enduring Bulgarian-American friendship. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I would reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BAIRD. (CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION MONTH -- (House of Representatives - February 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BAIRD. I thank my friends and colleagues from Connecticut and Utah. The reference was I had the privilege of graduating from the University of Utah where, to some degree, I majored in skiing, and for me it was a career and technical path. 
   I am pleased to be here today to speak in support of H. Res. 930, a resolution introduced by myself and my good friend from Pennsylvania, Phil English.  
   The resolution supports the goals and ideals of Career and Technical Education Month, which we are celebrating this month of February. This resolution expresses the support of the House of Representatives for the goals and ideals of Career and Technical Education Month, recognizes the importance of career and technical education in preparing a well-educated and skilled workforce, and encourages educators, counselors, and administrators to promote career and technical education as an option to students. 
   Our country is currently facing a growing problem of not having enough qualified workers to fill high-demand jobs. Across the Nation, employers are facing difficulties in finding skilled employees. Indeed, one survey showed that nearly 75 percent of employers report severe difficulties trying to hire qualified workers. Career and technical education provides students with the skills they need to find employment in skilled professions and to compete in a growing and competitive global economy. 
   Career and technical education also helps students receive and complete their education. Those who participate in these programs have higher grade point averages in college and are less likely to drop out. In fact, according to the Department of Labor, career and technical education prepares students for all of the 20 fastest growing occupations in our Nation today. 
   Career and technical education is also unique in the way it engages students in their learning. I visited skill centers in my district, including the Clark County Skills Center and the New Market Skills Center in Thurston County last year, and I found students genuinely interested and involved in the classroom and in their education. Indeed, in my school visits, it is not at all uncommon to go to one, apparently, academic class, where students seem disinterested or maybe bored with their course of study. You encounter them somewhat later in the career and tech courses, and they're motivated, enlightened and enthused. Indeed, I could well imagine a young person saying they have no concern at all for what the Pythagorean Theorem is; A squared plus B squared equals C squared doesn't mean anything to them until they realize that's how you frame a roof, and that suddenly has relevance. 
   I believe the Federal Government needs to focus more attention and resources on career and technical education. The Federal Government funds career and tech ed through the Perkins Act, which is the primary source of funding for career and technical education at the local level. Unfortunately, as we debate this resolution on the House floor, the administration has once again proposed eliminating funding for these programs. In fact, the Perkins grant program has not received a substantial increase in funding since 2002. I am hopeful we will not only honor career and technical education today, but work in the months ahead to restore funding for these very important programs. 
   I want to applaud the Association for Career and Technical Education for its efforts. I also want to recognize the more than 15 million students currently involved in career and technical education in this country, and the more than 19,000 institutions that are presently offering career and technical education programs nationwide. 
   Those folks who are studying and teaching in career and tech programs should know that they have friends and allies here in the Congress. In fact, last year I joined my colleague from Pennsylvania in creating the Congressional Career and Technical Education Caucus. This bipartisan group is working to raise awareness of the benefits of career and technical education in Congress and to support funding and policies to benefit career and technical education. 
   I would urge my fellow Members to join the caucus and work with us to expand and strengthen career and technical education in this country. 
   Finally, I would just offer a suggestion to my friends and colleagues in this institution and those colleagues who happen to be running for President. We often, in our political speeches, say things like, we want to make college education more affordable. Well, as a former college instructor and a chair of the department, I believe we ought to make college education more affordable, but I would encourage all of us to insert the words ``career and technical education'' when we talk about supporting education in this country. We should make career and technical education every bit as high a priority, as high in prestige, and as fully supported financially as we endeavor to do with college education. 
   With that, I would like to close by thanking again the chairman of the committee, Chairman Miller, and Ranking Member McKeon. And I would also like to thank my good colleagues who spoke on this issue today. I look forward to working with them on issues relating to career and tech education, and I urge passage of this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 694, the Minority Serving Institution Digital and Wireless Opportunity Act of 2007. 
   This bill creates a program to improve computer networks at minority-serving educational institutions. The program will award cost-shared grants to eligible campuses to buy networking equipment and train students and teachers in how to use it. The grants will be awarded by the Secretary of Commerce, and the program will be reviewed by the National Academy of Public Administration every 3 years. 
   In today's digital world, computer networks are a key part of the educational experience. But many campuses, especially minority-serving institutions, do not have the resources to build those networks on their own. That hurts the students and makes them less prepared to find jobs when they graduate. H.R. 694 will help fix that problem and enable many students to get the skills they need to compete in the digital economy. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2850, the Green Chemistry Research and Development Act. 
   Chemical manufacturing produces great wonders for the world, but at the same time it can result in harm to health and the environment due to the use of hazardous materials and the generation of hazardous by-products. Green chemistry seeks to mitigate such harmful outcomes. 
   In short, the goal of green chemistry is to minimize or to eliminate this harm by using safer materials and manufacturing processes. Besides protecting human health and the environment, green chemistry can offer economic advantages and improvements to worker safety, public safety, and our national security. 
   The bill before us today, H.R. 2850, the Green Chemistry Research and Development Act, establishes an interagency program to enhance green chemistry R&D at NSF, EPA, DOE and NIST. 
   This legislation will provide grants to individual researchers, spur university/industry partnerships, fund research at Federal laboratories, and train students in green chemistry science. 
   H.R. 2850 is the third iteration of a bill that Congressman Gingrey has introduced addressing this issue in three  separate Congresses. I want to applaud the gentleman from Georgia for his steadfast leadership on this, and I fully support the legislation. 
   Under Chairman Boehlert's leadership in the 108th and 109th Congresses, Democratic amendments were agreed to, and these amendments now make up sections of H.R. 2850. This bill is the product of good, bipartisan cooperation and has the support of our chairman, Mr. Gordon, from Tennessee. 
   H.R. 2850 is a good first step, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BAIRD. (HAPPY BIRTHDAY VANCOUVER, WASHINGTON -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure today to wish happy birthday to America's Vancouver, Vancouver, Washington. I rise in honor of the 150th birthday of Vancouver, Washington. As we say back home, Vancouver not B.C., Washington not D.C. 
   There was a place up north that was not founded until 29 years later, so we were the first. America's Vancouver was the first incorporated city in what is now Washington State. It hosts its proud heritage with the Vancouver National Historic Reserve. Fort Vancouver, Pearson Field, the site of the first transpolar aviation landing, a host of historic achievements and wonders. 
   I would invite everyone to join us in America's Vancouver on July 7 of this year as we officially celebrate America's Vancouver's 150th anniversary. 
   Mr. Speaker, I include for the RECORD an article from the Columbian.  
   Happy 150th! 
   And the most-senior city in Washington state is ..... Seattle? The biggest city in the Northwest and hub of the state's economy, is a sad non-contender in the competition. It was incorporated in 1869. 
   And Spokane? The Capital of the Inland Empire, as the second-largest city calls itself, is practically a newborn. It was incorporated in 1881 and just celebrated its 125th birthday anniversary. 
   Walla Walla is older than that. It came into being in 1862. 
   But Steilacoom (near Tacoma), now there's an old city: 1854. 
   That was just one year after the oldest incorporated city in Washington, Columbia City ..... Ooops ..... Columbia City was the name as late as 1850, when it was recognized as more than just a military or fur-trapping post. But when it was incorporated seven years later, on Jan. 23, 1857, as the first city in what would become Washington state, it was Vancouver. Our Vancouver! 
   The real newcomer is the other Vancouver, in Canada, eh? Incorporation: 1886. So, if nothing else, on Tuesday this week, when Vancouver USA officially turns 150, you might silently pledge to pay no attention the next time someone suggests, as someone always does, that we rename our city Fort Vancouver in order to avoid confusion with the bigger city to the north. We were here first. Let them rename their city. 
   Much of the story of Vancouver USA's early years and most famous people is efficiently and colorfully told in words and photographs in a special section in today's Columbian, ``Vancouver, Washington--150 Years in the Making.'' Frankly, it's a hoot. There's also an online slide show at columbian com/video. 
   Mayor Royce Pollard, who always calls the state's oldest city ``America's Vancouver,'' will deliver his State of the City Address on Tuesday, kicking off a year-long celebration. While acknowledging the past, the speech will fittingly look ahead. Pollard has titled his address, ``Pride, Progress, Possibilities.'' 
   The signature event of the 150th birthday will be on Saturday, July 7, at the Vancouver National Historic Reserve, which long-time residents still refer to as ``The Barracks'' and newer residents know as the place they have the big fireworks shows on the Fourth of July. The hope is to get country singer Willie Nelson out for the event. He was a disc jockey in the mid-'50s at the old KVAN radio station, 707 1/2 Main St. 
   In a Columbian editorial on May 31, 1921, the writer was effusive about the county and the town, noting that it was the world's greatest prune producer, had ``industrial possibilities second to no other city on the globe ..... has the finest water in (the) state'' and that its ``beautiful homes (and) wide streets elicit wonder from its visitors .....'' 
   Such boosterism brings a snicker today, but you gotta love the spirit behind it and  wish for more like it in this, Vancouver's 150th year.

<DOCNO>Mr. BAIRD. (COLUMBIA-PACIFIC NATIONAL HERITAGE AREA STUDY ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 407, the Columbia-Pacific National Heritage Area Study Act. 
   The Columbia-Pacific National Heritage Area Study Act is an important piece of legislation to my district and the entire Pacific Northwest. I have been privileged to work with David Wu from Oregon in introducing this legislation. In the Senate, the companion legislation has been introduced by Senator Gordon Smith from Oregon and is supported by Washington Senators Murray and Cantwell, as well as Oregon Senator Ron Wyden. Hence, this legislation has both bipartisan and bicameral support. 
   The mouth of the Columbia is a special place with a very rich history. Native American communities have flourished there for thousands of years. It is home to the first American settlement on the Pacific, Astoria. It served as a major trading post for European, American, Chinese, and other nations' ships, and earned its nickname the ``Graveyard of the Pacific'' from the hundreds of shipwrecks along its dangerous coast. Lewis and Clark ended their westward trek there in 1805. Today, the area is home to the fishing, seafood processing, and timber communities that embody the Pacific Northwest. 
   Establishing a national heritage area at the mouth of the river is fitting in recognition of the region and its importance historically. As you know, the national heritage area unites parts of historically and culturally significant areas under a common purpose. In this  case, it will help continue the cooperative efforts that the Lewis and Clark bicentennial helped to create. The bicentennial commemoration helped bring community interests together to plan and work in a collaborative fashion. A national heritage area will continue this momentum and ensure the region continues to attract families, outdoorsmen and women, history buffs, and others to enhance its sustainable tourism economy. 
   Most impressive is that the effort to create a national heritage area at the mouth of the Columbia is really an idea driven by the local community. We have received letters of support from local governments, local businesses, trade associations, chambers of commerce, ports and others who have heard about this effort and wholeheartedly endorsed it. A brief sample of support includes the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission, the Office of the Governor of Oregon, the city of Astoria, Shorebank Pacific Bank, Cannon Beach Chamber of Commerce, the Port of Peninsula, and the Clatsop County Historical Society. 
   During the prior Congress, the legislation was subject to an oversight hearing in the National Parks Subcommittee where the administration expressed their support for the bill. We were also joined by small business owners from the area, notably Bob Andrews, who expressed his particular support. 
   I would like to take this opportunity to thank the National Resource Committee chairman, Nick Rahall; the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands chairman, Mr. Grijalva; and their staffs, including David Watkins and Rick Healy, for their work in bringing this to the floor. I would also like to thank Marc Korman in my office for his work on this important legislation. And especially, my dear friend, David Wu. Again, I thank the Chair for bringing this to the floor and urge final passage.

   Mr. BAIRD. I thank my friend from Arizona. 
   I would just like to correct the record of the gentleman from Colorado. I know a little bit about Colorado myself. I have lived there. I doubt the gentleman from Colorado has lived in my district. 
   I do happen to know that Battleground, Washington, is not anywhere near the affected area. The affected area encompasses Pacific County and Wahkiakum County on my side of the river, two counties on the gentleman from Oregon's side of the river. Battleground is not there. 
   As far as the massive size of this organization you describe, it is not so large. I appreciate they have a voice. I am happy to listen to the voice. This Congress should listen to the voice. But it should not overwhelm the unanimous sense of the people who sponsored this legislation. The committee jurisdiction has had a hearing on this, and I do not think we want to make it the practice of this body, we certainly never have before, to say that every time a relatively noncontroversial bill has been heard well out in the prior Congress, we have to have another hearing. 
   If the gentleman pretends to say that it is his concern that we try to save the taxpayers' money, having continuous, multiple hearings every time a bill does not quite pass out both bodies, both the House and the Senate, from one Congress to the next, I think it would actually cost the taxpayers a lot more money than you would hope to save. 
   Let me speak to the substance of this. My friend from Oregon said it well. If you know the history of this great country and if you know the history of the Pacific Northwest, there can be no doubt that this area warrants designation such as we think this study will ultimately lend it. 
   My friend mentioned Lewis and Clark. Prior to them, the historical trade that went along among the native tribes at the mouth of the Columbia River was legendary. Lewis and Clark, the first American settlement in the Pacific Northwest, the key to trade with Asia in the early years of this great country, it was this mouth of this river where the first northwest settlement of the United States by Americans expanded. The mouth of this river is a key to the commerce, not only of the Pacific Northwest but the inland Northwest, the greater Northwest where great quantities of grain and other cargos are shipped out. 
   This region has a rich cultural, historical legacy that we need to honor and respect and preserve. That is why the administration supports this bill. That is why our friend and colleague in the other body, Senator Smith, supports this bill. That is why we have I think the unanimous support of both delegations. This should be a noncontroversial bill. 
   The gentleman from Colorado I think has raised rather specious arguments against it, and I think we should pass this fine legislation and move forward with honoring a very richly deserving part of this country with this designation.

   Mr. BAIRD. I rise in strong support of H.R. 3058, the Public Land Communities Transition Act, and I commend my dear friend, Peter DeFazio. I have rarely seen a Member of Congress work so diligently on behalf of his constituents. He also works on behalf of my constituents because in southwest Washington, we are one of the 10 most forested districts in the entire country. So much of the land in my district is under control of the Forest Service. Counties like Lewis, Skamania, and Cowlitz rely on Secure Rural Schools money to keep public safety working. 
   My friends, we have to work to pass this bill. It is urgent, as many speakers have said. It is a bit ironic, however, to criticize the bill and say the criticism is because this bill will not become law, and then vote against it. Things don't become law around here when people vote against them. Things become law when people vote for them. 
   Because of that, I would encourage my colleagues to vote for this bill. Without this bill, 600 counties across the country that are home to millions of Americans would be left behind. Without this program, millions of rural communities would face steep job losses, breakdowns in services and infrastructure, and deep cuts to school budgets. Without this funding, almost 7,000 teachers and other educational staff will be laid off across the country. They are facing termination as we speak. 
   Delay should not be an option. Passage should be our remedy. I urge passage of this fine bill.

   Mr. BAIRD. Madam Chairman, I want to address a fundamental problem in our current education and support system and it is this, people who are not able because they lack the money to go to school on their own expense are not eligible for student loans if they can't go more than half time. 
   Ironically, this means that some of the people who are most in need of student loans, and very often most deserving of student loans, are ineligible for such loans. The one law we haven't been able to repeal in Congress is the law of unintended consequences, and this is an unintended consequence. 
   We should not say to hardworking men and women who would like to go back to school to improve their education, improve their standard of living, no, you can't get any Federal help unless you have the time to go more than half time. It just doesn't work. I have spoken to young, hardworking students who say, look, I am doing everything right. I am trying to raise my family. I am working for a living. I am paying my bills. I would like to take courses, but I can't afford to do so without a loan, and yet I am ineligible for the loan. 
   What our amendment does is simply ask the Department to conduct a study of the pros and cons of providing less than half-time students, making them eligible for student loans and of possibly establishing a pilot program to see how this can best be done. This amendment has broad support. The American Association of University Women, the National Education Association, the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, the American Association of Community Colleges and others.  
   I would like to thank, particularly, the Chair and ranking member of this committee and the subcommittee Chair, ranking member and their staffs for their diligent work on this. It is a commonsense amendment that will help literally millions of Americans be eligible for student loans to further their education. 
   Madam Chairman, I would urge passage of this amendment and reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BAIRD. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, every Member of this Congress, every Member is absolutely committed to the security of our families, our communities, and this Nation. And every Member is absolutely committed to supporting our troops and our veterans. 
   The real question today is not whether we are committed to security or whether or not we support the troops; the real question is how we believe that security is best achieved. On that, there is legitimate disagreement which is, or should be, what this debate is about. To have this debate is not only a right but a responsibility of the elected Representatives in a Republic such as ours. Indeed, it is to defend that very right that our young men and women are serving not only in Iraq but around the world. 
   None of us here today need to be reminded about the threat of terrorism from floor speeches or from Presidential homilies. But let us not forget that the terrorists of 9/11 did not originate in Iraq, they came from Afghanistan. And, with only one exception, every Member of this body, Democrat and Republican alike, voted to prosecute the war against the terrorists in Afghanistan, bring al Qaeda to justice, and topple the Taliban. 
   We were united then, along with virtually the entire world, and the fight was right. Iraq, however, is different. The focus on Iraq has distracted and detracted from the mission in Afghanistan and the real battle against terrorists. The President and the rest of the administration took this Nation into an unnecessary and ill-conceived war based on false threats and with a deeply flawed plan. 
   Before this war, I and many of our other colleagues asked the administration some fundamental questions: How many troops will this take? How many lives will be sacrificed? How long will we be there? What will it cost financially? How will we pay for it? And how will this impact our security profile elsewhere in the world? 
   The fact is, this administration has never answered any of those questions fully or honestly. Never. Either they know the answers and refuse to say them, which is duplicitous; or, they do not know the answers, which is incompetent. Sadly, it appears a little of both is operating. 
   I voted against this war from the outset, and believe to this day it was the right vote. But once we were committed and engaged, I, along with most of my colleagues, voted to continue to support our troops, to try to achieve success in our mission, and do our best to help the Iraqis rebuild their country. We fervently hoped and continue to hope the mission would succeed; but now, several years later, more than 3,000 lives later, U.S. lives alone, and nearly $1 trillion later, as we consider the President's latest proposal, we must ask again, ``Mr. President, how many lives? How long will we be there? How much will this cost? And how will you pay for it? And what does it do to the rest of our security position?'' 
   We still have no answers to those questions. And lacking such answers, which are fundamental to the security of this country and the safety of our troops, I must vote ``yes'' on this resolution and ``no'' on expansion. 
   My colleagues, it is irresponsible to allow a Commander in Chief who has not been honest or accurate from the outset to continue sacrificing the lives, the bodies, and the families of our  troops in a mission that lacks a clear end point or a successful strategy. It is dangerous to permit a Commander in Chief to jeopardize our Nation's security by letting our military equipment, readiness, and troop morale continue to decline, and it is shortsighted and unwise to leave our National Guard and Reserve unprepared and under-equipped to respond to challenges overseas or at home. It is strategically unsound to concentrate so much of our intelligence resources in one nation. It is unsustainable for our economy to keep pouring billions of dollars every week into this ill-conceived plan, and to pile debt upon our children with no strategy for paying it back. It is a breach of trust to not fund the needs of our veterans when they return home. And it is immoral to leave our soldiers dying and bleeding in the midst of a centuries-old religious conflict that is not of our making and is not of our power or responsibility to resolve. 
   In written comments, I describe what I believe is a better course. Some of our friends have said there are no plans. I have offered a plan, and I urge you to look at it. 
   But before I conclude, I must also respond to those who suggest that if we don't give unquestioning support to this administration regardless of what they ask for, regardless of history, and regardless of the evidence on the ground, that we are empowering the terrorists or undermining our troops. I believe the evidence suggests, from this war, that while there may be differences of opinion about policy, this Congress and the American people have and will continue to support our troops. It is a sign of strength of our very form of government, which is, after all, what we are hoping to promote in Iraq and elsewhere in the world that we should have this debate. 
   Our allies and adversaries understand that if we turn the course of a failed policy and the President has not been honest with us, that is not cutting and running; that is wisdom, it is courage, and it is honesty. That is what this resolution is about. That is what we owe the soldiers who have already given their lives, and that is what we owe the families and that is what we owe the future of this Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. BAIRD. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, every member of this Congress, every member, regardless of political party, and regardless of their position on this war, or the resolution before us now, is equally committed to the security of this nation, our communities, and our families. And I believe every member of this Congress supports our troops and their families while they  are deployed. We must all support our veterans and their families when they return home. 
   Since this war began, I have attended, as many of my colleagues have, deployment ceremonies as we send the troops off to fight. I have been on the tarmac in the cold and dark mornings when they've come home to their families. I have been many times to Walter Reed to visit the wounded. I have been to funerals for the fallen and held the hands of loved ones left behind. 
   Over the past weeks, months, and in the years since this conflict began, I have heard from constituents on all sides of this issue, including members of our armed forces who have served or are now serving in Iraq. Some of our troops support the war in Iraq, others oppose it, some support an increase, others don't. To suggest that opposing the President's planned escalation means not supporting the troops would imply that many of the troops themselves and many of their loved ones back home don't support the troops. That suggestion simply makes no sense and we should put it to rest for good. 
   The real question today is not whether or not we are committed to security, or whether or not we support the troops. The real question is how we believe protecting security is best achieved. On that, there is legitimate disagreement, which is, or should be, what this debate is about. To have that debate is not only a right, but a responsibility of the elected representatives in a republic such as ours. Indeed, it is to defend that very right that our troops are being asked to serve and sacrifice not just in Iraq, but around the world. 
   I saw the Pentagon explode from my office window on September 11th. We all knew that thousands of our fellow citizens were dying before our eyes and I was worried about the safety of my own family. None of us need to be reminded through floor speeches or Presidential homilies about the threat of terrorism. But let us also not forget that the terrorists of that day did not come from Iraq. And let no one forget that, with only one exception, the entire House of Representatives, Democrats and Republicans alike, all voted to authorize the use of force to destroy the Al Qaeda bases and the Taliban who harbored them in Afghanistan. That is where the terrorists of September 11th were based, that is where the central focus of the fight against terrorists was focused, and we were united, along with virtually the entire world, in that fight. 
   Iraq is different, and the focus on Iraq has distracted and detracted from the mission in Afghanistan and the real battle against terrorists. Administration suggestions aside, none of the terrorists of September 11th came from, or were trained in Iraq, and there were no weapons of mass destruction. 
   President Bush and the rest of the administration took this Nation into an unnecessary and ill conceived war based on false threats and with a deeply flawed plan. Our soldiers, their families, our economy, our overall military readiness, the Iraqi people, friends in the region, and our coalition partners, have all suffered as a result of the administration's misinformation and miscalculations. 
   Before this war, I, and many others, asked the administration to answer fundamental questions. How many troops will this take? How many lives will be sacrificed? How long will we be there? What will it cost financially? How will we pay for it? How will you manage internal conflicts among the Iraqi's themselves? What will be the impact on our overall security elsewhere in the world? 
   The fact is this administration has never answered any of those fundamental questions honestly or fully. Never. Either they knew the answers and refused to give them, or they did not know and went ahead anyway. If the first is true, they were being dishonest. If the second is true, they were incompetent. Sadly, it appears likely that both incompetence and duplicity were at work. 
   Unfortunately, very little has changed since this war began. As we consider the proposed escalation of the occupation in Iraq, none of the most important questions has been answered. 
   I voted against this war from the outset and believe to this day that was the right vote. But once we were committed and engaged, I believed, as most of my colleagues and most Americans, that we had a responsibility to support the troops and try our best to help the Iraqis rebuild their nation, establish a democratic republic, and try to restore stability. I, along with most members of this Congress, voted repeatedly to provide our troops the needed resources to succeed, and I fervently hoped the mission would be successful. To a degree, there have been successes. We determined there were no weapons of mass destruction. Saddam Hussein has been removed from power, and is now dead as a result of a public and open judicial process. There have been free and open elections, and Iraq has a constitution and elected government. 
   Those are good things. But the costs have been horrific and the key questions still have never been, perhaps cannot be, answered by this Administration. As we consider the President's latest proposal we must ask again: How many more lives? How much more will this cost? How will we pay for this? What will it do to the rest of our security internationally and at home? 
   Because these questions are at the core of whether or not this policy will enhance or jeopardize our troops and our security, and because the administration to this day is unwilling or incapable of answering these basic questions honestly, I must vote in favor of this resolution, and oppose further troop increases. 
   It is irresponsible to allow a commander in chief, who has not been honest or accurate from the outset, to continue sacrificing the lives, bodies and families of our troops to a mission that lacks a clear objective or any foreseeable endpoint. 
   It is recklessly dangerous to permit a commander in chief to jeopardize our nation's security by letting our military equipment, readiness and troop morale continue to decline. It is shortsighted and unwise to leave our National Guard and Reserve unprepared and under-equipped to respond to other challenges or crises abroad or within our own borders. It is wasteful and foolhardy to build the largest embassy in the world in this very small nation. It is dangerous and strategically unsound to concentrate more of our intelligence assets in this one city, leaving the rest of the world and other dangerous threats less covered. It is unsustainable for our economy to keep pouring out money, forgoing needed investments at home, and piling debt onto our children with no real plan to pay for it, and no real end in sight. It is a breach of trust to not provide the needed services for our veterans and their families when they return home. It is irrational and inaccurate to believe that securing Iraq is the real key to keeping our nation safe from terror, or that if we withdraw from Iraq the only possible outcome is for our nation to be more vulnerable. It is immoral to leave our soldiers dying and bleeding in the middle of a centuries old religious conflict that is not of our creation and is not within our power or responsibility to resolve. 
   For far too long we have given this President far too much credibility, far too much power, far too many lives and far too much money. It is time to stop. 
   Having said how I will vote, the sad but simple truth is this, neither moving forward with the President's proposed troop increase, nor voting for this resolution of disapproval, will really do what is needed to secure our own nation, solve the problems in Iraq or bring real stability to the region. There are, in fact, better alternatives to the administration proposal and those of us who oppose the President's plan should spell out what we think is the better course. 
   This is where I believe that better course should take us: 
   1. We must renew our focus on securing and rebuilding Afghanistan and increase both troop strength and financial investment in that nation along with our allied partners. The fight in Afghanistan was the real and most important fight against the terrorists of September 11th. It was justified from the beginning and remains just today, and it has the support of the world. We cannot let the Taliban regroup and reinstate their reign of terror and extremism there and we still have a chance, though it is slipping fast, to help the Afghanis establish a successful, tolerant and secure nation. 
   2. In Iraq, the administration should meet confidentially with the Iraqi leaders and give them a timeline with key benchmarks by which our forces will withdraw. The timeline and benchmarks should be sufficient to ensure the safety or our forces and give the elected Iraqi government a reasonable time to train their forces and strengthen their political processes, but there must be a timeline so there is real pressure for real progress. The process of conveying this information and the timeline itself should be confidential. The elected Iraqi government should then announce that it is they who are asking us to begin withdrawal, thereby strengthening their credibility and leadership while giving our nation a graceful way to exit at their request. Frankly, this should have been done by the administration before the Iraq Study Group report and before this debate in Congress, but it is still not too late. 
   3. While beginning a measured and strategic redeployment of our forces from Iraq, we should increase our support for infrastructure repair and shift increasing responsibility for that effort to Iraqi companies and workers and away from foreign contractors. 
   We should, however, maintain close oversight of the spending to ensure the resources are being used as intended and we should link continued financial support to real political and security progress on the part of the Iraqis. Further, we should prevail upon wealthy neighbors in the region, notably the Saudi Arabians and others, to expend some of their own vast funds to enhance the infrastructure effort. We should also dramatically reduce the size of the  embassy complex that is now under construction in Baghdad and we should pledge to no permanent U.S. bases in Iraq. 
   4. To help fund the infrastructure and security activities within Iraq, and to give every Iraqi a stake in the success of their political process. An equitable means of distributing oil revenues should be created that ensures all Iraqis will benefit from the oil resources and, simultaneously, that all Iraqis will lose economically if insurgents damage those resources. 
   5. We should encourage the Iraqis to work more closely with moderate Arab neighbors, notably Jordan, Egypt and others in the region to help with the training of the security forces and with the reconstruction effort. This assistance has been offered since the beginning of the conflict but the Iraqis have not taken advantage of that offer to any real degree as of yet. 
   6. Because the Iraq conflict has had a devastating and destabilizing economic, political and social impact on friendly and moderate nations such as Jordan, Egypt and others, we should provide additional financial aid to those nations, particularly to help them deal with the influx of refugees, the high costs of energy, reductions in trade and tourism, and other adverse impacts. We cannot leave our friends to suffer from this conflict, and we dare not let the instability spread to nations that have been models of change and moderation. 
   7. We must also reach out once again to our traditional allies in Europe, Asia and elsewhere in the world, openly acknowledge past mistakes, spell out this new direction, and ask for their financial, diplomatic, and, if necessary, military help in making it succeed. 
   8. While supporting and working with friendly and moderate nations in the region and elsewhere, we should engage in direct discussions and negotiations with other nations in the region, notably Iran and Syria. We disagree profoundly with these nations on many issues, and we must not be naive or overly optimistic, but it is in our best interests to at least engage in a dialogue and search for areas where we may find common ground. The administration's refusal to do this, even through back channels, is misguided and counterproductive. 
   9. It is dishonest to not include the full costs of this war and the associated increases in defense spending as part of the annual budget and deficit projections. We must at last fully account for the costs of this war and fully fund our commitment to veterans when they return. 
   10. Our focus on the Iraq situation should not cause us to lose sight, as it has for too long, of the real goal, which is promoting broad security, stability and moderation in the region for the sake of that region itself and in the interest of our own security. Even if we could fully secure Iraq with this surge of troops, which is highly doubtful, if we do not improve our overall image and relationships in the region and the world, and if we do not do more to support moderate and friendly nations, we will see continued and worsening threats from extremist groups and rogue nations. 
   A key part of this effort will be playing a constructive role in working to resolve the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians. We also have important and necessary work to do to improve our image and relationships within our own hemisphere and we must not ignore or neglect that work. 
   11. Finally, but importantly, for far too long our energy policy and dependence on petroleum has distorted our foreign policy and thereby endangered our national security, our economy, and our environment. We must recognize that energy policy is coupled with national security and we must change both policies or we will never have real and lasting security. 
   I urge my colleagues to consider this course, but before I conclude, I must respond to those who suggest that if we do not give unquestioning support to this administration regardless of what they ask for, regardless of history, and regardless of the evidence on the ground, we are somehow empowering the terrorists or undermining our troops. The President himself has implied that any questioning of his policies is ``politically motivated'' and anything short of further escalation is sending a message that our Nation will ``cut and run'' when things get tough. 
   I believe the evidence suggests the opposite. The evidence from this war is clear, while there may be differences of opinion about policy, this Congress, and the American people have, and will continue to support our troops to the fullest. The evidence is also clear that our troops will serve valiantly and effectively whenever and wherever they are called. 
   For the elected representatives of the people of this great nation to exercise their constitutional responsibility and demand change is not a sign of weakness, it is a sign of the strength of our own republic. Perhaps more importantly, it is a sign of the strength of our very form of government itself, which is, after all, what we are hoping to promote in Iraq and elsewhere in the world. The rest of the world, our allies and adversaries alike, understand this and understand that the strength, character, courage and commitment of this Nation, its people, and the Congress are separate from, and stronger than the flaws, and mistakes of any one President or administration. 
   We are not turning away from the fight against terrorists or terrorism by changing course in Iraq. We are changing the course of a strategy that has been wrong from the beginning and has not gotten better. Our Nation, our Armed Forces, and our Congress are fully willing to sustain a tough fight when the fight is right and the strategy is sound. But our republic, our people, and this Congress are also strong enough, wise enough and courageous enough, to recognize the truth and change direction when the time comes. That time is now.
