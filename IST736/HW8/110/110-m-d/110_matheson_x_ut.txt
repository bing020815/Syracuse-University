   Mr. MATHESON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I am pleased that the House will consider the bill, H.R. 2339, the Produced Water Utilization Act. 
   I particularly want to acknowledge and thank the ranking member, Mr. Hall from Texas, for introducing this bill. And I look forward to working with him on other water-related issues in the future.     
   Domestic production of oil, natural gas, and coal bed methane are essential to our Nation's economy. The term ``produced water'' refers to the water brought to the surface during the extraction of these fossil fuels. For every barrel of oil generated in the U.S., 10 barrels of produced water are created. 
   Since produced water comprises 98 percent of all waste generated by petroleum production activity, handling and disposal of this water can be a major impediment to efficiently increasing domestic oil production. 
   This bill before us, H.R. 2339, the Produced Water Utilization Act, creates a research, development, and demonstration program for beneficial water produced in connection with oil and gas extraction. The program will focus on improving safety and minimizing environmental impacts during produced water recovery. 
   The utilization of treated produced water will increase water supply, reduce injections into underground formations, and increase domestic energy production through cost reductions. At a time when water supplies are dwindling and oil prices are high, a research program to turn waste water into a clean reusable resource is just good common sense. I urge all Members to support H.R. 2339. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. MATHESON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, dwindling water supplies are creating concern across this country. Thirty-six States are currently or expect to experience significant water shortages within the next 5 years. That's why I introduced H.R. 3957, the Water Use Efficiency and Conservation Act. This bill would establish a research and development program within the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and Development to promote water efficiency and conservation. 
   Madam Speaker, tough decisions lie ahead for water managers who must balance the needs of agriculture, consumption by cities, industrial and energy production, transportation, tourism, wastewater treatment, energy response, and ecosystems. We are not going to solve this problem overnight, but H.R. 3957 will provide us with several important tools to address the coming issues we face with technology and innovative thinking. By encouraging research and development into water-use efficiency, we can create a path to increase our Nation's water supply. 
   H.R. 3957 would expand EPA's scope and involvement solving the Nation's water crisis through the development of technologies and processes to expand water supplies through storage, treatment, and reuse of rainwater, storm water and grey water. 
   The program will also conduct research on water storage and distribution systems, research on behavioral, social, and economic barriers to achieving greater water efficiency, and research on the use of watershed planning. 
   As part of the program, EPA will develop a strategic plan to outline the best path forward to avoid duplication and work towards the most relevant problems facing our water supply. 
   My bill directs the EPA to facilitate the adoption of technology and processes to increase water efficiency and conservation. The new program will collect information on new technologies that achieve more efficient use of water and provide this information through a public clearinghouse. 
   I want to thank Chairman Gordon for his interest in this legislation and for his leadership in ensuring adequate water supply for the 21st century in this country. I also want to thank all of the members of the House Science and Technology Committee for their bipartisan support and for their collaboration--their thoughtful collaboration I would say--on this bill. In the full committee, amendments were adopted that were authored by Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, Congressman PHIL GINGREY, and Congresswoman GABRIELLE GIFFORDS. Their amendments made this a better bill, and I certainly appreciate their input. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this provision. This is a great first start. It is a great first start that this is in the rule; but I agree with my colleague from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), this ought to be done in a statutory way. And, quite frankly, if we want to replicate the success of the 1990s, you have got to include spending caps, too, and I hope that we work together in a bipartisan way to do that. Because that is really, if we want to have fiscal responsibility, you have got to put some teeth in this and you have got to make us all live under what are going to be some tough circumstances. But as a first step, I am pleased this is part of the rules package. I endorse it, I encourage people to support it, and I hope we recognize this as a first step and we are all going to work together to employ all of the 12 points of the Blue Dog plan that are really going to give fiscal responsibility back to this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. MATHESON. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5749, EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. Madam Speaker, we are hearing a lot of concern about PAYGO. I have to tell you that when it comes to having credibility on this issue, as someone who is not a particularly partisan person, I always like to work on both sides of the aisle, I am a little upset that we are hearing this criticism about PAYGO from a group of folks who when they were in charge let the law expire. 
   It is a law that existed for 12 years. It helped move us from deficits to surpluses. It moved us on the glide path to where we wouldn't be burdening future generations with debt, and that law expired. The bottom line is that law as it was written would have allowed this unemployment compensation legislation to go through under emergency spending. 
   Now, the way that the law is written in this Congress, quite frankly, I think the law wasn't crafted properly because it should have allowed this to be emergency spending. That is why I, as a Blue Dog, am comfortable with this bill. 
   But let me assure you, actions speak louder than words. There are so many words that get thrown out on the floor of the House, but actions speak louder than words. And the actions are this: who cares about deficits, who thinks deficits matter? I am not sure that the other side of the aisle does, and their track record demonstrates that.  
   We've seen debt go up by $3 trillion during the first 6 years of the Bush administration with a Republican Congress. Come on, we shouldn't be criticized about our good-faith efforts to try to encourage PAYGO and live within our means. If we have not been perfect on this side of the aisle, we have made the effort. And I have heard no response from the other side whenever we bring up a bill that is paid for to offer an alternative that is also paid for. 
   So if you really care about your future generations, which I do, I think of my two young sons, and I think about the debt burden that we are placing on them, I think that we have a moral obligation to do the right thing for future generations. 
   So please, let's tone down the rhetoric a little and let's acknowledge that if you really care about deficits, instead of just talking about it, do something about it. 
   This side of the aisle has attempted to do something about it in this Congress. They established a PAYGO rule. I am proud of the fact that the Democratic Caucus has done that, and we should all work together because it shouldn't be a partisan issue. If you care about deficits, whether you're Democrat or Republican, let's work together and let's secure the future for our children.

<DOCNO>Mr. MATHESON. (ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. Mr. Chairman, the Department of Energy is currently managing 206 ongoing projects and, unfortunately, the agency has a long record of inadequate management and oversight of contracts. DOE's failure to hold contractors accountable led the GAO to designate DOE contract administration and project management as a high-risk area for waste, fraud, abuse and mismanagement way back in 1990. Although DOE has made some oversight improvements in the intervening years, GAO noted in reports completed this year, 17 years after the 1990 report, that major problems exist in contracting management at the agency. 
   One quick example: On a project started in 2004 to demonstrate an alternative waste treatment technology at DOE's Hanford site, DOE officials decided to accelerate the project's schedule. As a result, the project was initiated without using key project management tools, such as an independent review of the cost and schedule baseline. After the project experienced significant schedule and technical problems and the estimated cost more than tripled to about $230 million, DOE began requiring that the project be managed consistent with its project management requirements. 
   Furthermore, on four additional projects, estimated to cost over $100 million each, cost and schedule information was not being reported into DOE's project tracking system, resulting in less senior management oversight. 
   My amendment would simply require DOE's Inspector General to conduct a root-cause analysis to fully understand the causes of its contract and management problems, as has been recommended by the GAO. 
   I encourage everyone to support this amendment as a necessary first step in order to better address the contract management challenges faced by the DOE. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky).

<DOCNO>Mr. MATHESON. (SUPPLEMENTAL MINE IMPROVEMENT AND NEW EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. Mr. Chairman, I would like to compliment Chairman MILLER. He has been a tireless advocate for America's mine workers and has worked hard to improve mine safety. I appreciate working with the Chairman to include language in H.R. 2768 that will allow for the appropriate use of belt-air in mines.  
   This legislation is very near to my heart and is something that I have been working on in the aftermath of the disaster at Crandall Canyon Mine which is in my district. 
   On August 6, six miners were trapped when rocks and debris exploded off the walls of the tunnels where they were working, more than eighteen hundred feet underground. During the rescue attempt that followed, further disaster struck when underground activity caused a burst of rubble to explode off the cavern wall, killing three rescuers. 
   One of the most difficult aspects of the Crandall Canyon mine collapse was not knowing where the trapped miners were when the cave-in occurred. It made for an excruciating ordeal for the families, the mine owner and the mine rescuers. The lack of communications left the rescuers with the frustrating scenario of trying to drill blindly through hundreds of feet of rock with the hope of reaching survivors. 
   While mines generally have reliable communications systems in place, most mines have properties that make implementation of current technology difficult. For example, the open air pathway required for radio signals and WiFi do not exist and less than ten percent of the radio spectrum used above ground can be used underground. Because of the challenges of the mine environment and the limited nature of the market, much needed technology has not yet been developed or is not commercially available. 
   H.R. 2768 contains a provision that accelerates the deployment of current mine communications technology in mines, which is very important. I would also like to add that the House recently passed legislation that I wrote, H.R. 3877, the Mine Communications Technology Innovation Act. 
   That bill, if enacted, would accelerate the development of innovative, next generation mine tracking and communications technology. Communications issues are critical and must be addressed as soon as possible in order to better protect our miners. 
   I thank you Mr. Chairman for your leadership on mine safety issues.

<DOCNO>Mr. MATHESON. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution. This afternoon I went to Walter Reed and I visited some injured soldiers. One of them was from my congressional district in the State of Utah; had a number of serious injuries. He has been in intensive care at Walter Reed for about 3 weeks now. His wife was there with him. There were pictures of his 2-year old daughter plastered up all over the wall. His daughter is back in Utah with a set of grandparents. 
   I wish everyone could have the experience of going and meeting the soldiers and the families. They inspire me, and they also tell me how serious this issue is about putting people in harm's way, because the lives of that family are changed forever based on these severe injuries that this soldier undertook. 
   With regard to the situation in Iraq, our military personnel have done everything we have asked. We can never thank our troops enough, and we owe them. We have an obligation to them to give them the best opportunity for success. 
   The problem is that we have never really stood here and talked about a strategy for success. A successful strategy has to be comprehensive. That is what has been needed from the outset of the conflict in Iraq, and it is still needed today as Iraq descends into civil war. 
   A strategy for success in Iraq requires more than a military strategy. We have the most powerful military in the world, without a doubt. If military might alone could succeed, we would be done by now. 
   The situation in Iraq has always required a more comprehensive effort. We need a plan for political and diplomatic and economic success. 
   Now, just a couple of months ago, Congress was actually handed just such a strategy in the report from the bipartisan Iraq Study Group. The report was put together by some of the greatest statesmen, diplomats and military minds of our generation. This was a bipartisan group led by former Secretary of State James Baker and former 9/11 Commission Chairman Lee Hamilton. These venerable men and women painstakingly considered all the available options. They talked to military strategists, generals, Iraqis and each and every type of individual who might hold the key to a way forward. They acknowledge that each recommendation of the Iraq Study Group carries its own risk factors. But in the end, this bipartisan group unanimously endorsed a plan to move forward. And in doing so, they rejected the overly simplistic discussion that seemed to dominate the 2006 election season when the primary options that were discussed were either stay the course or cut and run. In fact, the Iraq Study Group report provides reasoned arguments against both of these options. 
   As for staying the course, the Iraq Study Group states that, and I quote, ``The longer the United States remains in Iraq without progress, the more resentment will grow among Iraqis who  believe they are the subjects of a repressive American occupation. As one U.S. official said to us, `Our leaving would make it worse. The current approach without modification will not make it better.' '' 
   As for an immediate withdrawal, the Iraq Study Group states that if we left tomorrow we would simply leave an immense power vacuum in Iraq. The results would have devastating effects on the global economy, the region and the Iraqi people themselves. And specifically, the report says that ``a premature American departure from Iraq would almost certainly produce greater sectarian violence and further deterioration of conditions.'' 
   Now, the resolution we are debating right now addresses the proposal to increase the number of U.S. troops in Iraq by just over 20,000. Let's remember that the Iraq Study Group specifically took a hard look at the surge option. In discussing the merits of a surge the Iraq Study Group report said that a surge ``might temporarily help limit violence in a highly localized area. However, past experience indicates that the violence would simply rekindle as soon as U.S. forces are moved to another area.'' 
   Furthermore, many generals and other military strategists have roundly criticized the surge strategy. 
   Now, I have long believed that the lack of independent, accurate assessments of our progress has hampered our efforts to secure Iraq and assist in its reconstruction. I strongly believe that the U.S. cannot linger in making the important policy and strategic decisions recommended in the report. 
   That is why we need to follow the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group report. U.S. forces should be redeployed from combat missions to support functions. Our troops should be supplementing the Iraqi Army. And at the same time, we have to move forward on the economic development front and the political front and the regional diplomacy front. 
   The resolution we are debating today is very simple. We support our troops and we oppose the surge strategy. I will vote for this resolution. 
   As I said before, our troops have done everything we have asked of them. Their performance is a source of great admiration and pride for everyone in America. At a minimum, we owe them a new approach and a thoughtful approach to the situation in Iraq and the pursuit of a comprehensive strategy for success.

<DOCNO>Mr. MATHESON. (ENERGY MARKETS EMERGENCY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. Mr. Speaker, this is an important first step. This bill asks the CFTC to exercise its ability to determine if undue speculation is having an impact on oil prices in this country. We've heard witnesses before the House of Representatives testify before different committees that suggest this could be upwards of $50 of the price per barrel right now may be due to this type of activity. So I think it's important we take this first step. 
   But I call it a first step. I would encourage our colleagues to continue to work together in a consensus way to have a productive effort in closing what's called the London loophole. 
   I, along with many other Members in this body, have put forth legislation to stop unwarranted speculation in foreign financial markets. Such legislation may be the best available option we have got here in Congress to address oil prices in the short-term. 
   When we do address this issue more fully, however, though, I also want to offer a word of caution. We should be careful not to be too overzealous. While we need to address the London loophole, we must make sure we do not take action that would damage our market-based economy. 
   And finally, I will say this. While we do work on market manipulation, we also need to recognize Congress has other issues to deal with when it comes to the oil price issue. There is no one single factor. As much as folks come down on the floor of the House at times to talk about just one issue, this is a very complex issue that has many dynamics affecting the global price of oil. 
   I think market manipulation is an important one for us to consider, but we also need to look at a more comprehensive package of issues to try to fully address this issue.

   Mr. MATHESON. Thank you, Madam Chairman. 
   First I would like to commend Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez, Ranking Member Chabot and the Small Business Committee, as well as Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall and the Science and Technology Committee, for all their hard work in bringing this important bill to the floor today. 
   I think we all agree that the U.S. economy is built on the growth and success of small businesses and we in Congress should continue to look for ways that we can support small business so it can succeed. That is why I am offering an amendment to H.R. 5819 today. 
   My amendment helps incentivize energy efficient practices for small businesses by rewarding business that seek to reduce their costs through a reduced carbon footprint. This amendment gives priorities to applicants of SBIR, STTR and FAST grants that have demonstrated an ability to reduce their carbon footprint. 
   Many small businesses have already developed practices to reduce their carbon footprint. By adopting energy efficient practices, they are reducing costs  for themselves in the long run and making themselves more competitive with other businesses. 
   A number of companies in my home State of Utah have benefited from SBIR grants. One such company is TechniScan, which has developed a technology intended to aid physicians in diagnosing breast cancer. It has already adopted certain practices to reduce its energy usage and hence reduce its carbon footprint. 
   Many other small businesses across the country have likewise reduced their carbon footprint and would therefore be given priority for receiving these grants under my amendment. 
   I have worked to help government and private entities alike conserve energy. As cochair of the Green Schools Caucus, I have worked with schools to become more energy efficient, which reduces their costs. Small businesses that also seek to reduce their carbon footprint should be rewarded for their efforts as well. 
   This amendment will help position small businesses better as they continue to grow and expand while reducing their energy costs. 
   Again, thank you to Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez, Ranking Member Chabot, Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. I want to thank the gentleman from Utah for yielding and for his amendment and his efforts to improve the bill. Since the Republicans today are so concerned about energy crisis and gasoline prices, this is an opportunity to start addressing this issue. 
   With gasoline at $4 a gallon and the evidence concerning global climate change mounting, the importance of research in the area of clean energy sources is increasingly clear. The amendment recognizes that technologies which can improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions are a critical national research priority. As such, the amendment will give priority to SBIR and STTR applications that address clean energy research topics. I support this amendment and I urge adoption of this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. I thank the chairman for yielding and I also commend Chairman Rangel for his work on this agreement. I think it represents a great step forward on the trade agenda. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think that it's human nature to have difficulty accepting change. Change can be traumatic, and we are in a world that's changing. In a globalized world where technology is taking us to new places, this flatter world that Tom Friedman talked about in his book, that's a change. The question is, do you stick your head in the sand and ignore change, or do you embrace change and try to take advantage of it? 
   That's the fundamental issue I think we ought to be talking about in terms of engaging the rest of the world, engaging the rest of the world in economic opportunity in a changing world. Mind you, globalization is a mixed bag, and there are positives and negatives that come out of it, but the question is, as a country, do we want to try to embrace that opportunity? 
   This agreement represents a wonderful step in embracing that type of opportunity for this country. Beyond the economic benefits, which a lot of speakers have talked about today, there are also the benefits of relationships with these other countries. The eight living former Secretaries of State have all encouraged Congress, in fact, urged Congress to move ahead with this agreement, to build better ties with the country of Peru, a good democratic friend in a region of the world where there are some unsettled countries. This is good policy in terms of how we have those relationships in South America. 
   I encourage my colleagues to step away a bit from some of the rhetoric, as with many issues, that comes out that is not necessarily accurate. I encourage my colleagues to look at the substance of this agreement and see how Chairman Rangel has made such progress in coming up with a responsible new agenda for trade with this Democratic majority. 
   As I started, I will close the same way, I commend the chairman, he has stepped up to the plate in a substantive way. He is moving forward.  
   I urge passage of the Peru FTA.

   Mr. MATHESON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution. And I would like to recognize and thank Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon of the House Education and Labor Committee for their support of this resolution and enabling us to move it to the floor so quickly. I'd also very much like to thank both of my colleagues from Utah, Mr. Bishop and Mr. Cannon, who are here on the floor today also in support of this resolution. And I'd like to acknowledge the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, who is here also to speak on this resolution today. 
   I rise today to honor the sacrifice and the courage of six missing miners and the three rescuers who died in a mine disaster at the Crandall Canyon coal mine in Huntington, Utah just a few weeks ago. It was in the early hours of August 6, the six miners were trapped when rocks and debris exploded off the walls of the tunnel where they were working more than 1,800 feet underground. And the cave-in created a ground shock that measured 3.9 on the Richter scale at the University of Utah's seismographic center. Very quickly, rescue crews assembled in an effort to locate and reach the six men, but, to date, Kerry Allred, Don Erickson, Juan Carlos Payan, Brandon Phillips, Manuel Sanchez and Jose Luis Hernandez are still missing. 
   Ground movement, what miners calls bumps or bounces, continued at the mine. During the rescue attempt further disaster struck. Three rescue miners, Gary Jensen, Brandon Kimber, and Dale ``Bird'' Black were killed when once again underground activity caused a burst of rubble to explode off the cavern walls. Rescuers had to literally dig with their hands to get their colleagues out from beneath piles of coal and rocks. Their efforts saved another six rescuers who were injured but are thankfully recovering. 
   Throughout this catastrophe the local community has remained steadfast. The Emery County Sheriff, his deputies and other first responders worked round the clock to maintain order as private, State and Federal teams maintained the search effort. 
   Community leaders and the families of these mining towns in Emery and Carbon Counties came together to support the trapped miners' families, the rescuers and the emergency crews. They did what they have always done in coal country during hard times; they held each other close, they hoped, and they prayed. 
   Today the House honors the missing and the dead. We extend condolences of our Nation to their families. We recognize the many volunteers who rushed to their aid and who provided endless hours of compassionate support. 
   And finally, we honor the proud heritage of coal mining families. Their skill, their hard work and their dedication contributes to the prosperity and quality of life that each and every one of us enjoys.

<DOCNO>Mr. MATHESON. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. I thank my colleague for his comments, a new Member of this body, but someone who recognizes the importance of fiscal responsibility. 
   I think that it's important to expand on what PAYGO is. This is a term that gets thrown around a lot in Washington, but we really ought to review what it means. And at its basis, it's a pretty simple concept, and that is that if you have new spending, you've got to pay for it. You've got to pay for it by cutting spending elsewhere or raising revenues, but you've got to pay for it. 
   And, you know, this isn't a new concept even here in Washington. It turns out back in 1990, during the presidency of George H.W. Bush, Congress passed legislation to put a pay-as-you-go, or PAYGO, policy into effect. And at that time, Congress came together in a bipartisan way and then President Bush signed that into law. 
   And when it was passed, it put us on a path to where decisions had to be made where you had to live within a budget. Everybody in this town can come up with a new idea about how to spend money, both sides of the aisle, everyone can come up with those ideas. It's easy to say yes to that. It's a lot more difficult to say, you know what, we're going to live within a budget. But you know what, we ought to be doing that because that's what everyone in this country does, everyone who runs a business, everyone in their own household budget, everybody does that. 
   So let's look at what happened after passage of that law in 1990. There were a number of other things that happened during the decade of the 1990s. There was a strong economic growth period, the dot-com industry really took off, and a whole series of reasons, including restraint on spending in Washington, allowed us to move from annual deficits to annual surpluses. It was a remarkable period in our country's history to have that transition take place. And it was an exciting time for this country. And it was good for the government's books to be balanced and it was good for our economy, and it led to a stronger dollar. I mention that, and we'll come back to that later in this discussion, because today we all know we're suffering from a rather low dollar situation in the global economy.  
   So if that was such a good idea, if it worked so well, why is it that we aren't having both the House and the Senate live by that same law today? Well, it turns out that law expired at the end of 2001. And that was really unfortunate that it did because it provided that set of constraints, if you will, on Washington--on Congress, on the President, on everybody, on Democrats, on Republicans. It provided that constraint that asked people to live within a budget. 
   And after it expired, I think we all know what happened. You had over 6 years, 2001 through 2006, you had an explosion of spending. You had an explosion of debt. Annual deficits were so large. And over those 6 years, our national debt went from $6 trillion to $9 trillion. Now, you throw these numbers around, it almost gets to the point where it's hard to recognize what they really mean. But I think we all know a trillion dollars is a lot of money. And I think we all know that when you have $6 trillion created through the whole country's history through the first 42 Presidents, and then during the first 6 years of the 43rd President you add another $3 trillion, you're adding a lot of debt in a short amount of time. And PAYGO didn't exist. Spending took off at a huge rate, greatest increase in government spending since the 1960s, in fact.     
   That is what happened during those first 6 years. And the Blue Dog Coalition during all that time said, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Let's not get into a deficit mode again. Let's not create more debt that creates a burden on future generations who have to pay the interest on that debt. Let's not ensure high taxes on future generations to pay the interest on the debt. Let's recognize that we have an obligation to future generations that they shouldn't have to pay for obligations that we have created on our watch. 
   But we could never get the PAYGO principles put back into place. We couldn't get a vote to put it into statute. We couldn't get it in a rule of the House of Representatives, either, until January of 2007. There was a change in control in the House of Representatives. And on the first day when we were all sworn in here to take the oath of office for the 110th Congress, we set the rules that we are going to work under during that 2-year session. And in that rule, pay-as-you-go was put in place for the House of Representatives. 
   And I am really proud of the Blue Dog Coalition for taking the lead on pushing that rule to be put in place. It is not easy to live under a budget. The PAYGO rule has been attacked. And yes, there have been a couple of circumstances where it has been waived. But I think that the Blue Dog Coalition deserves a lot of credit for taking a stand, forcing the tough decisions, and quite frankly, creating the dynamic where I think there has been a real restraint on this body in terms of what could have happened instead in terms of additional spending and adding to our national debt. 
   It is at the start of a real challenging period we face in this country, because we all know that as baby boomers retire and additional pressures occur on Social Security and Medicare that it is going to take a very thoughtful and aggressive effort by this body in a bipartisan way to navigate through that challenge and make sure that we maintain fiscal discipline and fiscal responsibility. And pay-as-you-go, the PAYGO principles, provide a tool. They provide a tool that would benefit all of us. 
   So this isn't really, again, about Democrats or Republicans. This isn't about trying to place blame on people or anything else. It is really just talking about the fact that if you look at the way we are set up in this country as a government, in the Federal side we are allowed to run deficits. You can have deficits if you don't bring in as much revenues as you spend. In a lot of States, they have constitutional amendments that require a balanced budget. That doesn't exist here in Washington. 
   As a result, as I said earlier, it is easy to spend money. And over the years both parties have shown an ability to spend money. There's no doubt about that. And so we need this external constraint, if you will, of pay-as-you-go. And I will go beyond that to say the Blue Dogs support a balanced budget, as well. That is one of the guiding principles of the Blue Dog Coalition, is a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. It takes a long time to amend the Constitution. It takes many years to get enough States to ratify and whatnot. And that is an important goal. But pay-as-you-go we can do right away. We've had it as a rule in the House. We would like to see it as a law. We want a statute passed by the House and the Senate because it will serve us all so well. 
   I will close with one more comment. And I will recognize a couple of my colleagues from the Blue Dog Coalition to participate in this discussion. But I just want to come back, as I mentioned, to the issue of the low dollar we have today. When you're borrowing lots of money, and the United States has been borrowing a lot of money from foreign lenders, that devalues the dollar. It's a supply-and-demand issue. And we're having to borrow to pay for so much in this country. And we know that that low dollar has had some serious implications for us. Oil is priced on a dollar-per-barrel basis. The global market is one market for everybody. And as other currencies in the world go up, as the dollar goes down, that means the price per barrel in dollars is going up. That's just one example of where a low-dollar policy can have a serious impact on our economy and on the daily lives of all of us. 
   A strong dollar and a dollar that we can be proud of can be reinforced by public policy that encourages balanced budgets. A government that lives within its means has a stronger currency. And again, that shouldn't be about Democrats or Republicans, or the left or the right. That's about what's right for this country. And that's what the Blue Dogs are about. And that's why I'm proud to be a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, because the Blue Dogs like to look out for what's right for this country. And they take an independent approach. And they want to sit down, roll up their sleeves, tackle these issues and work with everybody on these issues. 
   So that's why we are here tonight, to talk about pay-as-you-go, to talk about the benefits of this country. I have been joined by some of my other Blue Dog colleagues. And I would like to now recognize my good friend and colleague from the State of Georgia, Representative DAVID SCOTT, for as much time as he might consume.

<DOCNO>Mr. MATHESON. (BLUE DOG COALITION DEFICITS AND DEBT BACKGROUND -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. Well, I thank my colleague from Arkansas for conducting this Special Order tonight. That list, that article that you just were referring to is not a one-time deal. I think we all have a sense after over 4 years of the Iraqi operation having taken place, I think we have all heard stories, and those news articles seem to come out more and more often where money has been spent and we haven't gotten result in terms of rebuilding the infrastructure. That is a cause of concern and that is one of the motivations behind the Blue Dogs coming together with legislation in this Congress called the Operation Iraqi Freedom Cost Accountability Act. 
   The Blue Dogs have come up with this bill which has been given the number H. Res. 97, and I want to take a brief moment to walk through what this legislation does. 
   Now, quite frankly, before we go through the specifics, I should say it puts forth tangible and commonsense proposals to ensure future transparency and the accountability in the funding of Operation Iraqi Freedom. This is a first step. There is more we probably need to do, but this is an important first step to make sure that resources are getting to our troops in the field in a reasonable manner. 
   There are four crucial points in this legislation demanding for fiscal accountability in Iraq. 
   First, it calls for transparency on how Iraq war funds are spent. 
   Second, it calls for the creation of a Truman Commission to investigate the awarding of contracts. 
   And, third, it calls for the need to fund the Iraqi war through the normal appropriations process and not through emergency supplemental appropriations processes. 
   Fourth, it calls for using American resources to improve the Iraqi assumption of internal policing operations. 
   Now, the resolution also calls for the Iraqi Government and its people to progress towards full responsibility for internal policing of the country because ultimately that is where we need to go. 
   Now recently, and I know other speakers have mentioned this, a significant accomplishment took place in terms of the Blue Dogs working with the Armed Services Committee to include key provisions of the Blue Dog accountability legislation in the Department of Defense authorization bill that we are going to be voting on here in the House of Representatives later on this week.     
   In doing so, I think it's an important first step toward ensuring greater fiscal transparency in the funding of the war in Iraq. 
   The American people deserve to know that their tax dollars are being spent wisely and that our troops have the resources they need to succeed. The Blue Dogs are committed to passing legislation that accomplishes that goal. 
   Now, members of the Blue Dog Coalition also believe strongly that funding requests should come through the normal appropriations process, as I said, rather than through these multiple emergency supplemental requests. Let's make it part of our overall budget so we can plan accordingly. 
   I think that again with the Defense authorization bill coming up this week and with key components of the Blue Dog legislation included in that bill, I think that's a significant step forward for this country. I am proud that the Blue Dogs were able to play an important role in moving this legislation forward.

<DOCNO>Mr. MATHESON. (UNITED STATES FIRE ADMINISTRATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. Mr. Chairman, once again the Science Committee brings to the House floor a bill that makes sense, that was developed in a bipartisan way. It's a great tradition of this committee, and I think Members on both sides of the aisle on that committee know what a great committee it is to work on. 
   And I want to thank Congressman Mitchell, in particular, for taking the lead on this issue, because his approach really fits into the Science Committee approach about how we look at issues, and we try to work together in a bipartisan way to make progress. And that's why I'm happy to stand up and offer my support for this bill today. 
   In the grand scheme of things, one of the reasons why I think this is incredibly important is that the United States has one of the highest fire-related death rates among all industrialized nations. Think about that. With all the technology we have in this country, all the safety measures, we still rank so poorly among industrialized nations in terms of fire-related deaths. And this legislation takes a step in terms of trying to address that problem. 
   Now, I come from a western State, the State of Utah; and in the West, we have particular danger in terms of forest fires. This legislation fully funds the National Fire Incident Reporting System, which is going to help the U.S. Fire Administration prevent future forest fires. Currently, we're only able to capture data from 50 percent of wildfires, which just is not enough. 
   By improving the incident reporting system, the U.S. Fire Administration  will be able to speed up the reporting data, generating a more comprehensive database. In practical terms, that's going to mean better analysis, greater fire prevention, and fewer lives lost. 
   And, in particular, this bill, if enacted, will expand the program to include training in wildland-urban interface areas. And this is an issue that's particularly important in western States where, as population growth has taken place, there has been greater development of housing that's moved more into where the forest exists; and that's a critical problem during these wildfire incidents is how we deal with fire issues in that very sensitive area. 
   Most of my congressional district faces this problem, and my congressional district is not unusual compared to most of the West. I believe better training in terms of this wildland-urban interface will be a huge asset to Fire Departments in similar areas. 
   So Mr. Chairman, I want to again thank you for your leadership on this issue. I thank Chairman Gordon and ranking member HALL. I thank Chairman Wu from the subcommittee. I thank Congressman Mitchell for his leadership. I know Mr. Gingrey's been a leader on this issue as well. And again, the Science Committee, as usual, comes up with a bill that makes sense. I'm sure it will be adopted today, and I urge all my colleagues to support the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. MATHESON. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, both for yielding the time, but more importantly I thank the chairman for his leadership on putting together a bill that really, I think, speaks to a number of issues that we all care about. 
   It's no surprise we're less than 50 days before an election that the rhetoric out here on the House floor may get a little hotter than usual, and on an issue as important as this, I think that's unfortunate. 
   I think if we can, for just a few moments, maybe set that aside and really take a look at what this bill is and talk about what's in the bill, I think that would be productive, because, you know, this bill actually takes ideas and clauses and sections from a lot of different bills that have been introduced by a lot of Members of Congress. There have been all kinds of energy bills introduced by Republicans, by Democrats. This particular bill we're talking about tonight incorporates a lot of those ideas, and that's a good thing, and it reflects a cross-section of the House of Representatives in terms of point of view. 
   If we take a look at this bill, you will see that there are Democrats and Republicans who could actually come together and agree on a lot of these things. I suspect with the election coming up we may have more of a partisan nature on this vote than we would like. At the end of the day, I think we all spent a lot of time in August meeting with our constituents. We all have had the experience of going to the pump and paying a lot more than we are used to and a lot more than we like, and we've all felt the pain of that process. We've talked to a lot of our constituents who have also felt the unease of that circumstance, and they are anxious about looking for opportunities to move beyond that. 
   That's what we're looking to do. I don't think my constituents think the government can wave a magic wand and solve all this. When I talk to my constituents, they know that this is a complicated issue, that it is going to take a comprehensive approach, and a lot of the solutions are going to come not necessarily from government but from the private sector, the innovators in our country. That's why this country has always done so well in global competitions through innovation. 
   I've met with various businesses in my own congressional district just in the last few weeks who are making remarkable progress on technological advances, and it's exciting. It's invigorating. We should be optimistic about the future when you see what's going on out there in the private sector right now to help new technology move forward. We shouldn't be on the blame game of who's responsible for this.     
   Our caucus leader, Mr. Emanuel, said that the oil crisis first started 35 years ago with the 1973 oil embargo. Different parties have been in power in the White House and in the Congress, and we can look back in hindsight and say there may have been a lot of decisions that should have been made but weren't, or other actions that should have happened but didn't. 
   The blame game is not particularly productive. What we ought to talk about doing is how do we move forward as a country? How do we set public privacy that allows the private sector to innovate? How do we make progress with new technology? How do we take ourselves to a new position where we are no longer dependent on foreign energy? That's the type of discussions I think most people around the country want us to have. That's the type of discussion we ought to be having here on the floor tonight. And I'm not hearing enough of that, quite frankly, from both sides of the aisle. 
   This bill does increase production. It opens up substantial amounts of the offshore resource for exploration. The bill also includes oil shale production. A lot of people on the other side of the aisle said it does not, but it does. It eliminates the moratorium. It gives the States the ability to opt in to do that. It is a huge potential resource. 
   It includes the important tax credit extensions that so many people in this body on both sides of the aisle support. Oh, I know there are things in this bill that probably every Member of Congress could come up with something they don't like. I'm sure every Member of Congress could come up with things they would like to see in this bill that are not in it tonight. When you try to put together a consensus bill, that's the nature of the process. 
   But this is an important step. It's a step that allows us to say we are moving ahead with domestic production, we're moving ahead on accruing new technology, we're moving ahead on trying to reduce our dependence on foreign supply. 
   Again, I commend the chairman for his leadership. I ask everyone to support this bill.

   Mr. MATHESON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the bipartisan Vietnam Memorial Resolution commemorating the 25th anniversary of the construction of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, H. Res. 326. This memorial honors the more than 58,000 brave men and women who paid the ultimate sacrifice during the Vietnam war for our great Nation. We must never forget the brave service members who served in Vietnam. 
   Millions of people visit this breathtaking memorial to pay their respect to those people who lost their lives between 1956 and 1975 or are still missing in action. The memorial has been a source of comfort and healing for those families and friends who have lost loved ones in the Vietnam war. 
   I also wish to express my support and gratitude for all the men and women who served with valor in our armed services protecting our freedom and democracy. I believe that the Vietnam memorial encourages all people of the United States, and the world, to remember the sacrifices of American veterans of this war, especially those who served in Vietnam. This memorial is a beautiful work of art and this resolution has my full support.

<DOCNO>Mr. MATHESON. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. Mr. Speaker, I come to the House floor on Tuesday nights, as often the Blue Dog Coalition does. And tonight the Blue Dog Coalition wanted to come to the floor of the House of Representatives to have a discussion about energy policy in this country. I think that energy policy is an issue that is so important on so many levels, in terms of the integrity of our economy, in terms of our national security, in terms of the affordability for those who are underserved. 
   It touches so many different issues. And that's why I think it's important for the Blue Dog Coalition to make its voice heard, to take on this very complicated issue that has so many different components, and to try to address it in a pragmatic and practical way. Because like so many issues in Washington, this is one that's not going to be solved by those on the extreme ends of the ideological spectrum, it is going to be solved by people who want to sit down and roll up their sleeves and come up with practical solutions on how we can provide an affordable and secure energy supply for this country. 
   Now, I am joined by two other Blue Dogs this evening, my colleague, Mr. Scott from Georgia, and my colleague, Mr. Melancon from Louisiana. We look forward to having a discussion tonight about this issue. And the Blue Dog Coalition energy principles is a document, the Blue Dog Coalition has endorsed that identifies certain principles that we think ought to be the basis of how we go about formulating energy policy in this country. 
   And by way of introduction, I wanted to yield as much time as he might consume right now to my colleague, Mr. Scott from Georgia.

<DOCNO>Mr. MATHESON. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. Mr. Speaker, I think the comments from the gentleman from Louisiana are spot on in the context of we need it all. We need to look at a very diverse portfolio of energy supplies in terms of where we are today and where we want to be in the future. We want to, of course, develop as many different types of energy and diversify our portfolio, because, at the end of the day, having an affordable and secure source of energy is what makes the most sense for this country and for our economy. 
   While all of us would like to see a bunch of new technologies put in place immediately, the reality of this situation is it is going to take a commitment in the public policy arena and the private sector to bring a lot these technologies along. 
   These energy principles that the Blue Dogs have published represent a set of guidelines. I don't think the Blue Dogs come to the table saying we have all the answers. These are complicated issues that are going to require a lot of thought and a lot of work. But I do think that these principles help articulate a zone of reasonableness, if you will, within which this debate ought to take place. 
   Since we have kind of led into it, one of the key principles is that of fuel diversity, where the Blue Dogs think we should not be picking winners and losers, as Mr. Melancon said. We think you have to have a diverse energy supply portfolio to have future success in this country. So we encourage any policy that is going to add to fuel diversity, that is going to add to energy infrastructure in this country. 
   In the long term, if we are going to have energy independence, there is no question that a whole basket of opportunities are going to help create that. It is going to include issues of conservation and energy efficiency. It is going to include new fuels. It may be cellulosic ethanol, it may be biofuels. There may be other sources that are alternative sources compared to what we use today. And it is also going to include conventional sources of energy that we have today as well. 
   We have to take the longer view on this, and the longer view is at some point we may have a whole different set of energy options that don't exist today. How we get from here to there is going to take a commitment to develop those technologies and a commitment to make sure we access conventional supplies we have today to keep this economy moving in the right direction so that we can all have the economic growth and opportunity that is going to allow these technologies to 
   develop. 
   So, we as Blue Dogs believe in it all, whether it is oil, or gas, or biofuels, or coal, or nuclear, or hydroelectric, or geothermal, or other technologies that I may not have even mentioned. You really need to put all of that on the table, all that on the table, to give this country the opportunity to make progress and to move forward and to have a responsible, diverse energy supply. 
   That is one of the key principles that the Blue Dogs have tried to articulate, and I think it is one that everyone in this Congress ought to be able to get their arms around in some form and see if they can recognize the value to this country if we do that. 
   Mr. Scott, I am happy to yield to you.

<DOCNO>Mr. MATHESON. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. The gentleman mentioned that up to 16 percent of our natural gas is now being imported. 
   When we throw out the term energy, there are all different forms of energy, and it is dangerous to look at simple policy solutions when oil policy has its own implications. We know about dependence on foreign oil, but I don't think a lot of people realize we are increasing, although not yet to the same degree, but we are increasing our dependence on foreign supplies of natural gas as well. We have seen a lot of price increases over the past 5 to 7 years in the United States, and natural gas is such a key component of our economic model in this country. Those price increases can have such damaging effects on the integrity of our economy, let alone reaching each individual, particularly those on fixed incomes. 
   I think it is important to note, and that is the statistic that my colleague from Louisiana mentioned, we are importing natural gas into this country. I don't think a lot of people know that we are importing a lot of natural gas into this country. I want to piggyback on one other thing, short term and long term. 
   We have talked about how in the long run we hope technology takes us into some new places. But how do we get there. We can invest in developing those technologies, but traditional energy sources that we are using in the country today, be it oil or natural gas or coal or nuclear power, those are key components of the portfolio today. And as we move ahead in the long run and look for alternative fuels, I am sure they will provide a significant piece of that portfolio as well. But in that period before that takes place, this Congress ought to enact policies that help encourage a reliable supply of those conventional fuels that we are utilizing today. It is going to be important for our economy, it is going to be important for making process as an economy, and I think that is consistent, in fact I know that is consistent with where Blue Dog energy policy recommendations have gone. 
   I want to mention a second principle that is in this document, and that is the concept, because we are so concerned about maintaining energy security. We certainly don't want to go in the wrong direction. So we have taken our term PAYGO which is usually in the Congress in the context that if there is a new program that you want to spend money on, you have to find a way to pay for it. We have used that term in terms of Blue Dogs believe in energy PAYGO. That is we don't think that we should be enacting policies in this country that 
   reduce existing domestic production. We are concerned because there are some policies out there by some of our colleagues in this Congress that we are concerned may do just that. That doesn't match up with the notion of trying to make sure that we have a secure, reliable, affordable energy supply. And the statistics that my colleague from Louisiana mentioned about the projected growth demand in the future in this country, you don't want to go backwards and be cut back on our existing domestic capabilities and in that context increasing even more so our reliance on foreign supplies. 
   Another critical part of the Blue Dog principles is the notion that when you find yourself in a hole, stop digging. We don't want to create a greater reliance in terms of our reliance on foreign supply. And it is not just with oils. You have to put natural gas into that discussion as well because we are importing more natural gas than we have in the past, and we have to be very careful about if we reduce our natural gas production capabilities in this country, what that means in terms of prices and putting us in an even less secure, less dependent position than we are today. 
   I yield to my colleague from Georgia.

<DOCNO>Mr. MATHESON. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. Well, I thank my colleague and I want to follow up with two more of the principles. There are eight in total by the way. We've already talked about a couple. 
   But one of the Blue Dog energy principles does have to do with climate change, and my two colleagues really have described mostly the thinking behind these principles, but to put in summary, the Blue Dog principles say, look, there's broad scientific consensus that climate change is happening. 
   Blue Dogs also believe it's taken place over a significant period of time. We need to make sure we get this right with a methodical approach, and it may very well be a long-term approach to try to change the direction we're going, but we want to make sure we get it right. There are some folks who want to act very quickly and in a radical way, and that may not be the best solution.  
   We also wanted to make sure we had a global approach. If we simply enact policies in this country, we may be exporting jobs and pollution overseas, and that doesn't get us to where we need to be because this is a global issue. So the Blue Dogs want to have an approach that tries to encourage global participation, an approach that does not disproportionately affect one industry or one sector. It needs to be an economy-wide approach in how we look at this issue and how we try to reduce our carbon footprint in affecting the climate change issue. 
   So I think the Blue Dogs have laid out a framework that makes a lot of sense. Again, as I said before, we don't claim to have the answer to every single aspect of this issue. We think we've established a framework that makes a lot of sense for people making good, sound decisions. 
   A second principle, and it really follows up on what my colleague from Louisiana said a little earlier, he was 
   talking about how people sometimes don't know what it takes to get energy to the point where you use it. People just pull the pump at the gas station. They don't have any real appreciation for the complex process it takes to get it to that point. And that applies to all forms of energy. 
   I think people take for granted when they flip a switch and the light goes on, that the light just goes on, and they don't have a full appreciation for what it takes to generate that electricity and get it delivered to that building or that house where the light switch exists. 
   And so another one of the Blue Dog energy principles recognizes we need to invest in the energy infrastructure in this country. It doesn't just happen without investment. It costs money, and whether it's a refinery expansion or whether it's an ethanol plant that my colleague from Georgia was talking about that we want to develop in this country or whether it's finding renewable sources, let's say, wind energy that makes electricity, that costs money. It doesn't happen without that type of investment. 
   It's going to take significant commitment from both the public and private sector in this country to ensure we have an energy infrastructure that can deliver reliable sources of supply and affordable sources of supply. 
   So we need to look for those. Again, the Congress we need to look for those public policy options, public policy decisions that create the environment for that to happen. It's not going to be done all by the government, nor should it be by the way. We want the marketplace to evolve and pursue the most efficient technologies and efficient delivery systems, the most efficient ways to make this happen, but we can help set the table, if you will, to make sure we have the right incentives in our economic model to encourage that to happen. 
   So that's another one of the Blue Dog energy principles that I think is very important, and we specifically point out within the electorate sector that we need to make sure we have investment in the transmission grid, investment in making sure it's efficient distributed generation. 
   During the previous hour, one of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle had their Special Order here just before us. I think one of my colleagues mentioned the notion that you may have a significant wind resource where you can put up a number of windmills, but it's going to go be in a remote area, and you have got to get that product, that electricity created by those wind turbines, from that remote area to where the load factor is, and that's going to be let's say in urban area that may be hundreds of miles away, and you have got to invest in a transmission system that allows that to happen. 
   So, as I said at the start of my comments at the start of this hour, it's a complicated issue. You can mention with energy and everyone kind of nods their head, but if you really start looking at all the sub-issues below that, there are a lot of issues out there. And the Blue Dogs are trying to articulate a pragmatic, practical approach to try to capture all those issues and have a good discussion with Members of both parties and try to create those good public policy decisions to help us get to where we want to be as a country. 
   So I wanted to again follow up on those two comments that my colleague from Louisiana mentioned, and with that I'm happy to turn over time again to Mr. Scott.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. I think there are two broad issues out here. Our hour is drawing to a close, but there are two broad issues out here in the energy debate. One is energy independence and security, and the other is climate change challenge. 
   Now those issues are not mutually exclusive. In fact, a number of the provisions to pursue each of those issues are complementary, and we should look at it in that context. But I do think that the Blue Dogs have come up with a set of principles, we haven't been able to talk about every one of them tonight, and we will come back again on the floor to do that. 
   As I said, this is a complicated issue. There are a lot of layers to this issue, and this Congress needs to first recognize that level of complexity to make sure we make good decisions. You have to recognize the magnitude of the issue before you can make good decisions. 
   But I do want to touch on just one other area that is a principle the Blue Dogs feel is very important, and that's the notion that we need to have an aggressive effort at technology development. We talked a little bit about technology development tonight, but let's put it in perspective to where if we really want to get to a point where we have greater energy independence, and if we make progress on the carbon emission issue as well. 
   The technologies aren't there today that need to be there. First of all, is the technology called carbon capture and sequestration. More than half of all the electricity we make in this country is coal. You know what, this country has a lot of coal. In fact, one-fourth of the world's coal is right here in the United States. It's cheap, it's plentiful. 
   The way we burn it now we put CO  
   2 in the atmosphere. The hope is that we can develop the technology to capture that carbon and sequester it. But that technology isn't there yet today. 
   So, when Blue Dogs talk about we need to make a significant and aggressive commitment to technology development, that's one of the technologies. It's real straightforward. We will have coal as part of our energy mix. I think most people think that in terms for the long run in terms of our electric production. But we have got to solve that carbon issue, and we have got to invest in technology. 
   Second, we have had discussions about cellulosic ethanol. We can't rely on corn as our source of ethanol in this country. There has to be a better way to do it. We have got to move technology in that direction. A third one, just to throw an example, battery technology. 
   We want to get to the point where we have the car you can go home and plug in at night and run on electricity. A lot of people have spent a lot of time and money trying to develop that battery technology. We are still not there yet. 
   That's an appropriate Federal role to invest and move ahead with that research and development. I just want to make sure, that's the other principle I get out tonight that the Blue Dogs believe in, that that's the right role for the Federal Government to do, to push the development of these technologies. 
   One of the greatest American strengths is innovation. That's what this country is all about. It's why we are a superpower. We have got to unleash that again and again. The government can't drive all that, but we can sure encourage it. That is what we ought to do.

   Mr. MATHESON. I want to thank both of my colleagues for joining us. As I said, the Blue Dog coalition stands ready to work with people on both sides of the aisle. We approach these issues through a very, practical, pragmatic way. We want to do what's right for this country. 
   We are going to come back and talk about energy more and more. By the way, I think this is one of the great domestic policy issues. By that way,  that's foreign policy implications, as my colleague pointed out in his comments earlier. It's one of the great issues we face as a country, and it's helpful to help drive forward that debate.

   Mr. MATHESON. Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to be able to organize a special order this hour on the part of the Blue Dog Coalition. The Blue Dogs wanted to take advantage of this opportunity tonight to speak about energy policy issues. 
   I think that there is no doubt that when it comes to domestic policy issues that this country faces, that energy policy is right at the top of the list. I think it is clear that this country should be looking for a comprehensive balanced energy policy, and I think that represents the type of politics the Blue Dogs in the House of Representatives have often supported. 
   We have a number of issues that we really want to work through tonight, and I have a number of my fellow Blue  Dog colleagues who are going to join me during this hour to talk about various energy policy issues. And I would like to start right now by recognizing my colleague from the State of Louisiana, one of the newest Members of the House, and someone who is prepared to really contribute on this issue, Representative Cazayoux from Louisiana.

And I appreciate his leadership on the issue and want to thank him for joining us in the Blue Dog hour. 
   Right now I recognize my colleague from Kansas, a long-time Blue Dog, Congressman Moore.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. Well, I thank the gentleman from Kansas for his thoughts, and I appreciate again the introduction of the notion that we need a comprehensive approach. 
   There is just not one silver bullet that's going to solve this circumstance. It really is consistent with what the Blue Dog energy principles that were adopted at the start of the 110th Congress say about fuel diversity, the recognition that long-term U.S. energy independence is going to come from putting everything on the table, everything from conventional oil and gas and from alternative sources such as oil shale and tar sands, nuclear, hydroelectric, geothermal, coal, and biofuels. If we're really going to take this issue on, we've got to look at it in that comprehensive manner. 
   Again, the Blue Dogs have adopted a set of principles that recognize the value of a diverse fuel mix within this country as a long-term solution of creating energy security for this country. 
   With that, I now would like to welcome another fellow Blue Dog to speak, who is a fellow member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and who is cochair for communications for the Blue Dogs in this Congress--Congressman Ross from Arkansas--who has in his years in Congress been a real leader on trying to address energy issues in this country. I welcome him to participate in this discussion. 
   With that, I will yield to him as much time as he would like to consume.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. Well, I thank my colleague from Arkansas for spending time with us this evening but also for trying to take a thoughtful and comprehensive approach. That's really what Blue Dogs are about. I think we really try to discuss items in the context of policy. 
   I'd just like to introduce one other factor into this discussion about the high gas prices that we face today and what we can do in terms of the price of oil, and it's consistent with what Blue Dogs talk about a lot. People probably didn't think I'd raise the issue of fiscal responsibility relative to oil prices, but it turns out that there is a significant relationship here. It has to do with the fact that, during the current administration, so much more money has been borrowed. 
   When our current President took office, the national debt was around $6 trillion. We're approaching $10 trillion now. $4 trillion just in the last 7 1/2 years. Do you know what that has done among many other things? It has created a weaker dollar. Now, oil is a global commodity. It's traded all over the world, and it's traded under one currency, and that's the U.S. dollar. That weaker dollar means that oil costs even more for us in this country than it does for other countries with stronger currencies. 
   I've brought with me tonight this chart to graphically demonstrate the relationship, according to the Energy Information Administration, between the lower dollar--the weaker dollar--and how much the price has gone up in terms of dollars per barrel. It's pretty self-evident that we had a strong dollar for a number of years. Then in the early part of this decade, as the debt started to increase, the value of the dollar dropped precipitously, and the price of oil went up at the same time. 
   It's not the only factor associated with how expensive oil is in the world today, but clearly, in all of the discussion that we've been having about why the oil price is so high in the world, in my opinion, this particular issue has not received much attention. 
   The Blue Dog Coalition has this fundamental principle about balancing budgets and about living within our means. We tell people that you may not see the impact of this debt right away, but here is an impact because, with all of that increased debt, we've had to borrow so much money as a country that we've weakened our currency relative to the rest of the world. Therefore, because that's how it's traded all over the world, the price of oil on a dollar-per-barrel basis has gone up a lot. 
   So I wanted to introduce this concept, which is very appropriate within a Blue Dog Special Order hour here on the floor of the House of Representatives, to talk about the linkage between the need for fiscal responsibility and how it affects energy prices, which is something that, I think, ought to be part of this debate as well. 
   With that, I'd like to yield time to another one of my fellow Blue Dogs, another individual who is very thoughtful and measured in his approach, and that's the type of approach we need for a comprehensive energy policy. He is my colleague Mr. Scott from the State of Georgia.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. Well, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his thoughtful comments tonight. And it is no surprise. He's always been someone who tries to understand issues well. His comments really reflect a couple of the basic principles. You know, as I mentioned earlier in my remarks, the Blue Dog Coalition published a set of energy principles at the start of this Congress, and I think my colleague, Mr. Scott, really touched on two of the important components of those principles. 
   The first is that the Blue Dogs believe in the value of technology development, and energy policy should build on American strengths. One of the great things about this country is its ability to innovate. Research and development capability of this country surpasses any place in the world. Whenever this country has applied itself to solve a problem, it succeeds so well. And that type of innovation is what is going to allow technology to take us to a different place than we are today. 
   And I think Mr. Scott discussed some of those potential technologies in which he's familiar, and there is no question in the long run, if we are going to get to a position where this country is not as dependent on foreign oil, we need technology to take us to a new place in terms of particularly how our transportation and infrastructure are going to operate. 
   And the second Blue Dog energy principle I think Mr. Scott touched on very well is this notion of efficiency. You know, if you can do more with less, we all win. We use less energy, we save money, it's good for the environment. Energy-efficient technologies and energy conservation are other pieces to this puzzle. 
   I think an overriding thing we've said throughout this discussion tonight is that there is no single option here. There is no silver bullet. We, as Blue Dogs, support the furtherance of energy-efficient technologies. We think that we can continue to make progress and push the envelope and that, again, as a country that leads the world in innovation, we can also lead in terms of continuing to be more efficient in how we use energy. 
   Again, I thank Mr. Scott for his comments. As usual, very consistent with Blue Dog principles, and again, it helps further this debate about how we ought to move ahead in our national energy policy. 
   With that, I would like to recognize another of my fellow Blue Dogs, someone who has invested a lot of time and effort to develop an understanding of the energy issues and is a real substantive contributor to the policy debate, and that is my colleague from South Dakota, Representative Herseth Sandlin. 
   I will yield her as much time as she may consume.

   Mr. MATHESON. Well, I want to thank my colleague from South Dakota who is always a very substantive participant in any public policy discussion we have here in Congress, and I know she's invested a lot of time and effort when it comes to the energy issue. I really appreciate her participating in this Blue Dog discussion. 
   There are a couple of points that were raised by my colleague from South Dakota that I think merit one more mention. The discussion of what we've done in this Congress, there have been some actions that have been taken, and one of them is going to bear fruit in the long run. We're not going to see a result right now. It's a process that came out of the Science Committee, of which I'm a member. 
   The chairman of that committee, Mr. Gordon, another Blue Dog, pursued a really aggressive effort to invest in basic research, in R&D, tried to put Federal funding out there to really get things going in a more aggressive way than it has in the past. He created a program called ARPA-E. It's designed after a previously created program within the Defense Department that's called DARPA, which created a lot of research that's helped us with technology advancements in the defense arena. And this legislation created a comparable effort in the energy policy arena, and our Blue Dog colleague, Mr. Gordon, has been a real leader on that. And that is another action this Congress has taken that is an important step to take. And I know we're frustrated by $4 gas today, and that program, the ARPA-E program, is not going to reduce the price of gas next month. I understand that. 
   But the point is there are a series of steps we need to take. There's some short-term, some mid-term, some long-term strategies, but we need to put them all on the table now. We need to do what we can do to make progress on this issue. 
   The second point that my colleague from South Dakota said--and I just want to emphasize--is she talked about opportunities and activities that we can work with our partners, including in Canada. When she mentioned Canada, it reminded me of the fact that as a country Canada has placed a tremendous emphasis on developing their tar sands resources. 
   Now, I represent the State of Utah and a significant amount of the oil that is refined in refineries located right in the Salt Lake City area comes from Canada. It comes from the tar sand resource in Canada, and it is piped to the United States. 
   Now, we can do that here, too. We can maybe take a page out of the Canadian book on how they, as a country, made efforts to develop that resource. It's an unconventional resource, and they took the steps and they made a significant commitment. It has not been without costs. It has not been without setbacks. There are lessons to be learned there, too, which we as a country should do. 
   And I understand that the tar sand resource we have in the United States--and we have it in my own State of Utah--is a little bit different composition than the Canadian tar sands. I understand that there are differences, but there's so much that we can learn from that, and it's a viable source of production today in Canada. 
   And so I appreciate the mention of how we can learn from others and learn from our partners, and I don't know if you had something you wanted to add to that point.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. I again thank my colleague for his comments. I think that he has helped describe the global picture. We haven't discussed that enough about we're part of a global market. And it's important for us to take the lead and develop fuel diversity and try to develop some level of greater independence, because outside of that, in some respects our actions are the tail wagging the dog. And we need to get beyond that as a country. That's not a comfortable position for this country to be in. 
   The first sentence of the Energy Principles Document that the Blue Dogs created at the start of this Congress is that energy independence is a matter of national security and economic security. This country faces so many great opportunities if technology does take us to a new place. We will be in such a better position in terms of our economy, in terms of our foreign policy, in terms of our position in the world. And we can make the world a better place with that technology development, too. That's the exciting opportunity for beyond our borders as well. 
   Blue Dogs supports promotion of a forward-looking, market-based comprehensive national energy strategy. As we've discussed many times tonight, there are short-term, mid-term and long-term issues. It's a complicated issue. In fact, each of the sub-issues on their own are complicated in their nature. And sometimes in the world of politics the rhetoric gets really simple. But on this one, it's time for us to roll up our sleeves and act in a way this body is supposed to act, in a deliberative, thoughtful way to generate comprehensive legislation that truly tries to solve problems and achieve progress. That's what we're elected to do. I think the Blue Dog Coalition approaches most issues in that way. I think we really don't care about if it's a Democratic idea or a Republican idea, we're trying to make progress. 
   And so as I close this hour and this discussion of energy issues, I suspect  that we will be back talking about this again. This issue is not going away. It's something that we all need to learn more about and we all need to work together. None of us have all the answers, but we need to work together as a Congress to try to find solutions as best we can. 
   With that, I thank all of my Blue Dog colleagues for joining me tonight.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2583, the ``Physician Workforce and Graduate Medical Education Enhancement Act.'' I am proud to join Representative Burgess as a lead sponsor of this legislation and want to thank him along with Chairman Dingell and the Energy and Commerce staff for moving this legislation forward. 
   Data shows that physicians typically will practice within 100 miles of where they train. While current residency training programs continue to excel at producing high quality physicians, they do not adequately distribute physicians to communities across the Nation. H.R. 2583 aims to create new residency programs in geographic regions that face physician shortages, especially those in the South, Southwest, Rocky Mountain, and West regions. 
   A major obstacle often preventing the establishment of new residency training programs are the costs associated with the creation of such programs. Under current law, a hospital starting a new residency program is not eligible immediately for direct graduate medical education or indirect medical education funding. This financing arrangement presents challenges for hospitals that operate on narrow margins, especially community hospitals that lack adequate reserve funds to offset the financial commitments associated with staffing a new residency program. 
   I believe this legislation provides the appropriate incentives that would lead to the creation of new residency training programs in geographic areas that lack an adequate supply of physicians, thus enhancing the Nation's ability to meet future physician workforce needs. If carried out over 10 years, the loan program established by the ``Physician Workforce and Graduate Medical Education Enhancement Act'' has the potential of assisting in the establishment of up to 50 new residency programs. 
   Thank you and I urge my colleagues to support this piece of legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 988, a resolution honoring MRSA awareness. I introduced this resolution with my colleague, Congresswoman BARBARA CUBIN. First, I would like to thank Representative CUBIN for working with me on this resolution, as well as the staff of the Energy and Commerce Committee, several stakeholder organizations who advocated in support of this resolution, and most importantly over 80 of my colleagues who joined me on this resolution. 
   Since the 1940s, the widespread availability of antibiotics, such as penicillin, and the subsequent discovery of additional antibiotics have led to a dramatic reduction in illness and death from infectious diseases. Today, antibiotics continue to save lives and also have led to many other advances. However, bacteria and other infectious disease-causing organisms through mutation and other mechanisms are able to develop resistance to antimicrobial drugs. The more antimicrobials are used, whether appropriately or inappropriately, the quicker resistance develops. Worrisome recent examples of drug resistance which have been highlighted in the news include community-associated MRSA. 
   An October 2007 article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) concluded that more than 94,000 invasive methicillin-resistant Staph aureus, MRSA, infections occurred in the United States in 2005. More than 18,500 of these infections ended in death. The CDC estimates that Americans visit doctors more than 12 million times per year for skin infections typical of those caused by staph bacteria. In some areas of the country, more than half of the skin infections are MRSA. In my home State of Utah, reported cases of MRSA are steadily rising. According to the Bureau of Epidemiology for the Utah Department of Health, there were 4,904 cases in 2006. 
   MRSA and other drug-resistant microbes that were once confined to ill hospital patients are now striking down otherwise healthy individuals, including schoolchildren, athletes and members of the Armed Forces. The resulting ``super infections'' are painful, difficult to treat, and cost billions of dollars to the U.S. health care system annually. Patient stories about this silent, yet sinister, pandemic are tragic and heart-wrenching. They should not go unnoticed and unanswered by Congress. 
   By bringing much needed attention to MRSA, this resolution will highlight the need for Congress and Federal health agencies to identify and coordinate efforts to address this growing problem. 
   Thank you and I urge my colleagues to support adoption of the resolution.

   Mr. MATHESON. Madam Speaker, I really would like to first thank Chairman Frank and Ranking Member Bachus for their help in moving ahead with this bill. I am pleased to have worked with the Financial Services Committee on this legislation, and I appreciate leadership's prompt scheduling of this bill today for consideration. 
   I would also like to thank some of the Financial Services Committee members who have worked with me on this legislation, including Congresswoman Ginny Brown-Waite of Florida who introduced the bill with me. It is a good, bipartisan bill. 
   There are many members of the committee who have cosponsored the bill, including Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, Chairwoman Waters and Ranking Member Biggert, members Geoff Davis and Gary Miller. 
   I want to thank the staff of the Financial Services Committee as well. They have been very helpful in moving this legislation along. 
   You have heard a description of this. It is quite frankly a rather simple bill. It will temporarily lift the statutory limitation, or cap, on the number of home equity conversion mortgages that the FHA may insure. As you have heard, the current limit right now is at 275,000 HECM mortgages, and it is important we are considering this legislation right now because we are approaching that limit. In fact, as I understand it, right now the portfolio stands at over 260,000 today, and there are many more loans in the pipeline waiting for HUD endorsement for insurance. So this is a timely bill. 
   My bill would lift the cap in order to prevent FHA lending to shut down this very popular and necessary program, and my bill would suspend the cap through the time covered under the current continuing resolution. 
   This bill is a good step to take today, but it is just one step. We are going to need to go further. Along with many of my colleagues who are on the floor with me today, I plan to introduce a separate bill that will permanently eliminate the cap. 
   Now, this program, you have heard the description from both Mr. Scott and Mrs. Biggert, it helps so many seniors who really have a need.     
   It is such an important program, and it is great that we have an opportunity right now to eliminate what would be an unnecessary impediment to having seniors take advantage of this opportunity. 
   We should provide stability to this program, and we should avoid any disruption and uncertainty in the marketplace by passing this bill today and moving ahead on the broader legislation in the near future. 
   So I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 391 and providing seniors with the assurance that they can utilize this important program and not face an arbitrary deadline by hitting the cap. I urge passage of this bill.

And that's how it is for all of us as Members of Congress. See, we have health insurance and our kids have health insurance. 
   This debate isn't about us, and as we get caught up in these discussions, this rhetoric about process and concerns about the way this bill has come to the floor, I think we're losing sight about who this issue is really about because we've got 11 million kids in this country who are involved in households where they make enough money they don't qualify for Medicare. How do we get them access to health care? 
   The CHIP program's done a great job in the past 10 years, and we've got about 6 million of them covered, but there are 5 million kids out there who still aren't. 
   That's what this debate is about, and I think when you have something sometimes you take it for granted, and all of us take for granted the fact that we have health insurance. 
   Now, let me tell you why I don't take this for granted because, in my household, my wife happens to be a pediatrician, and she works at a children's hospital in Salt Lake City. She tells me the stories about kids who come into that hospital who have not had access to preventive care, who have health problems that escalated into far more serious circumstances because they didn't have access to health care, and I hear those stories all the time.

   Mr. MATHESON. Madam Chairman, I would like to compliment my friend, Chairman WU. He has been a tireless advocate for America's manufacturers and businesses and this bill will be a great benefit to our Nation's workforce. I appreciate working with the Chairman to include language in H.R. 1868 for a pilot program that, among other things, better enables the transfer of technology based on the technological needs of manufacturers and available technologies from institutions of higher education, laboratories, and other technology producing entities. 
   The Manufacturing Extension Partnership Competitive Grant Program described in Section 203(c) of H.R. 1868 is intended to, in addition to traditional manufacturing extension activities, emphasize the need to develop MEP projects that define the technological needs of small-to-medium sized manufacturers and to similarly define the capabilities of new technology and innovations available from institutions of higher education, laboratories, and other technology producing entities. When properly defined and characterized, manufacturers and innovators will have the ability, through computer technology or other means, to match needs with capabilities. I believe that the development and deployment of this matching capability by this Competitive Grant Program will permit access to new and maturing technologies for the 350,000 small-to-medium-sized manufacturers on a broad basis, which has not been possible to date.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of an important program to my district and my state which has been consistently flat funded for the past seven years: the Head Start program. As you know, Head Start is an early childhood program with a proven track record of providing comprehensive developmental, educational, health, nutritional, and social services to low-income preschool children and their families, giving them the tools they need to succeed. By emphasizing parental involvement, Head Start also benefits the entire family and the broader community. For decades, Head Start has served thousands low-income children and their families in Utah, ensuring that they are educationally, socially and medically ready for school. 
   I have always been a strong supporter of Head Start. After years of stalemate on proposed changes to the program, I was pleased to vote for a reauthorization this May, and again in final passage this November, that includes expanded coverage for low-income children, increased funding for teacher and staff salaries and professional development, and strong accountability measures to better ensure that Head Start funds are used appropriately and efficiently. This bill, HR 1429, was signed into law by the President on December 12, 2007. 
   I have appreciated working with countless Utah parents, teachers, and administrators on the importance of the program but also on ways to make it stronger and meet the needs of the community. These perspectives and stories have enhanced my understanding of the valuable role Head Start plays in the lives of disadvantaged children. I believe that Head Start is a program with a long-term record of success with enrollment correlating to IQ gains, improved high school graduation rates and higher achievement in writing, vocabulary and social skills. 
   I applaud my colleague, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, for calling attention to this important program.

<DOCNO>Mr. MATHESON. (ACCOUNTABILITY IN CONTRACTING ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. Mr. Chairman, first of all I do want to commend Chairman Waxman and the Oversight and Government Reform committee for all the work that they have done this week. 
   The four accountability bills that the House has already considered this week are an important step that Congress should take in order to keep a promise to the American people. A government of the people and by the people should do everything to ensure transparency in Federal Government contracting. 
   That is why I rise today to offer an amendment to H.R. 1362, the Accountability in Contracting Act. I believe that the public deserves a great level of accountability and transparency in sole source contracting. 
   Now, over the past several years, there has been a great deal of controversy regarding this type of contract. As a businessman, before I came to Congress and as a supporter of business, I believe that there are, indeed, legitimate reasons for this type of contract to be issued. However, I also believe that we need checkpoints in place at times. 
   My amendment anticipates a limited set of circumstances that call for additional scrutiny. It would simply provide Congress with prior notice of any sole source contract expected to be awarded to a foreign-owned company that is based in or has majority operations in a country known to sponsor terrorist activity. 
   The amendment is intended to allow Congress to review and comment on the proposed contract. As someone who has spent his life in the business world before coming to Congress, I think there are important reasons why Congress should be looking at sole source contracting beyond just the business perspective. 
   My amendment would provide 30 days for the appropriate congressional oversight committees to review this type of contract under the circumstances I have described. Now, this is not an overly long period of time, but it is still a sufficient amount of time for Congress to take a look at major contracts and offer a different perspective, if necessary. 
   I think it's important that we take a step in the right direction to attempt to address this issue in advance, instead of being put in the position of reacting after the fact, if this circumstance were to present itself. 
   Now, I would also stress this amendment is about good government and making sure that U.S. tax dollars aren't inadvertently benefiting countries that sponsor or harbor terrorists. My amendment is not about singling out any specific business or any specific country. This is about having the  best possible process and checkpoints in place to provide for transparency in government. 
   It's clear the public has demanded accountability from Congress and from the Federal Government, which they should demand. This bill is a great vehicle for achieving that goal. 
   We have an opportunity to shine a bright light on contracting procedures in the underlying bill, and I believe that my amendment provides an added layer of appropriate congressional review in, as I described earlier, a rather limited set of potential circumstances in the future. 
   Again, I want to commend the committee. I want to commend Chairman Waxman and also Ranking Member Davis for their efforts in this bill, also Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter for his efforts in pursuing this bill as well. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. MATHESON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. 
   One of the great successes for our country's economy, and we all say it here as Members of Congress as we talk about the value of small business, but it is important for us in Congress to look at effecting public policy in a way that assists small business in making success, in being competitive relative to the rest of the world in terms of pursuing job creation. 
   And I really want to applaud the leadership of our caucus for moving ahead this early in this Congress with the small business tax relief package. I think that is a real important statement. I hope everyone is paying attention to that. It is certainly something that a lot of us in this caucus have advocated for, and I think it is a great step to be taking today. 
   I also want to acknowledge the fact that this is a bipartisan piece of legislation. I want to thank Chairman Rangel for doing such an excellent job in the Ways and Means Committee in working in this bipartisan fashion to come up with this very well-crafted bill. I think this is a great moment for this Congress to work in a bipartisan way to help our economy move forward. I encourage all of us to vote for this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. Mr. Chairman, I rise as a supporter of H.R. 1332, the underlying bill, and I would particularly like to thank the sponsor of the bill, Representative MELISSA BEAN, as well as the chairwoman of the Small Business Committee, Ms. Vel&#225;zquez, and the ranking member, Mr. Chabot, for all their hard work in bringing this bipartisan bill to the floor today. 
   Now, the 7(a) program is SBA's largest primary business loan program and provides loan guarantees to thousands of small businesses that are unable to obtain financing through the traditional lending market. That is why I am pleased that section 105 of the underlying bill will establish the Increased Veteran Participation Program to help increase 7(a) loans to military veterans, which declined by over $170 million between fiscal year 2005 and fiscal year 2006. 
   Section 103 of the bill, which permanently establishes the Community Express Program, will also provide much needed loans to veterans. 
   As 14 percent of small businesses in America are owned by veterans, we should do all we can to support those who have served our country. However, we should not leave out the men and women who continue to serve our country honorably every day in the military reserves. Small business ownership is extremely challenging, especially for members of the Reserve component of the Armed Forces who must carefully balance their civilian careers with their duty to serve our Nation. 
   My amendment would simply include members of the Reserve components of the Armed Forces as eligible to receive loans under the Community Express Program in section 103 of the bill and as eligible to participate in the Increased Veteran Participation Program in section 105. 
   Since 9/11, I think we all know we have relied on members of the Reserve more and more to participate in serving our country, and this increased role should be recognized and supported. 
   I urge colleagues to support my amendment. 
   I yield to the Chair of the full committee, Ms. Vel&#225;zquez. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. I want to thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to accept the amendment, and I will yield to Mr. Chabot for any comments that he may have.

   Mr. MATHESON. Mr. Chairman, as I just explained in the discussion on my previous amendment, SBA's 7(a) loan program helps thousands of entrepreneurs start new businesses, create jobs and grow the economy here in the United States. Unfortunately, many segments of the American population are still unable to obtain necessary capital to successfully become entrepreneurs. Now to help remedy this inequity, the SBA created the Community Express Program to reach out to segments of the small business community that have difficulty accessing capital from traditional lending markets. These businesses are typically owned by women, veterans and socially or economically disadvantaged individuals who are underrepresented as business owners and who need smaller business loans accompanied by technical assistance. 
   Members of Indian tribes especially lack sufficient access to capital for starting new businesses. Of minority-owned businesses, only 6.6 percent were owned by American Indians, the least percentage of any minority group surveyed. And of U.S. nonfarm businesses, less than 1 percent are owned by American Indians. 
   I represent many Native American tribes in my district, and I know the entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well if only scarce capital can be attained for new businesses. 
   My amendment would simply include members of qualified Indian tribes as eligible to receive loans under the Community Express Program in section 103 of the underlying bill. This minor revision will provide loans to a currently underserved population and help participating lenders better determine who is actually eligible to receive loans under the Community Express Program. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   I yield to the Chair of the full committee, Ms. Vel&#225;zquez. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to accept this amendment. I want to thank you for bringing this issue. 
   I yield to the ranking member, Mr. Chabot, for any comment.

<DOCNO>Mr. MATHESON. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1585, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. Madam Speaker, the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense have been proposing the development of a new nuclear warhead under the Reliable Replacement Warhead program, and they are also proposing an ambitious nuclear weapons complex modernization proposal called Complex 2030. And the bill we are going to be voting on today provides funding for those activities. 
   This is a multibillion dollar agenda, and it's being proposed, in my opinion, in a policy vacuum without any administration statement on the national security environment that the future nuclear deterrent is designed to address. 
   The lack of any definitive analysis or strategic assessment defining the agenda of future nuclear stockpiles makes it impossible for Congress to weigh the relative merits of investing the billions of taxpayer dollars in new nuclear weapon production activities when the United States is facing the other challenge of having too large a stockpile as a legacy from the Cold War. 
   Now, the argument for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program started out with a concern that was most frequently expressed, at least was about, the expected lifetimes of the plutonium pits, which are the nuclear core of our existing nuclear weapons. At the time, their projected life span was 45-60 years, and with some of our arsenal having entered the force in the 1970s and 1980s, there would be a cause for concern. 
   However, just a few months ago, we received a new study performed by the independent JASON panel, a highly respected body often consulted on technical issues. That study, using data compiled by the nuclear weapons labs, shows that all the plutonium pits in our existing weapons have life spans of at least 85 years, and most are good for 100 years or more. The labs themselves agree with the studies. So, it seems there isn't a threat to the reliability of our current nuclear warheads. 
   So I think we need to be careful. This bill, while funding was reduced somewhat on the Reliable Replacement Warhead program, I think we need to be careful about going down a path that we may not need to go down. 
   In conclusion, we should be careful not to hurry down a path when the reliable plutonium pit is no longer an issue. Should we be in a hurry to go down a path when the history of the Department of Energy includes a long list of cancelled and over-budget projects that were started before the objective was thoroughly thought through and understood? We should not make that mistake with the Nation's nuclear weapons complex or the decisions to begin building new nuclear weapons.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. Mr. Chairman, as part of this group of en bloc amendments, it includes an amendment I have offered. It has to do with the uranium tailings pile on the banks of the Colorado River in Moab, Utah. 
   Now, that may sound like an interesting issue to have in a Defense authorization bill. It is not the first time it has been in a Defense authorization bill. The last time we dealt with this was when Congress was in session in the year 2000, and at that time Congress directed the Department urging them to move this uranium tailings pile. 
   Make no mistake. This is right on the banks of a major river, and the environmental impact statement that looked at this pile indicated that it is a near certainty that at some point, if it is not moved, it is going to be flushed into the river. And there are 25 million users living downstream of this site. 
   Now, this mill tailings site was part of our military efforts in the 1950s and 1960s when it came to our nuclear weapons efforts, and quite frankly, while Congress has voiced in the past on this very bill 7 years ago that it should be moved, the Department of Energy has exhibited tremendous inaction. They have not provided information for why there has been a delay. They have completed a longstanding environmental impact statement that resulted in a record of a decision saying they wanted to move it. In that, they said it could be done in 7 to 10 years.     
   And yet, the Secretary of Energy said just this year it's not going to be until 2028 when this moves. This is an agency that has consistently underperformed, underpromised, has not answered questions about the progress of this project, and that's why I offer this amendment today, so that once again Congress can make its will known, as it has done in the past, in indicating that this pile ought to be moved. 
   I thank the chairman of the committee, Mr. Skelton, for his cooperation on this issue.

<DOCNO>Mr. MATHESON. (WAKEFIELD ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of H.R. 2464, the Wakefield Act. I am the lead sponsor of this legislation, along with Representative Peter T. King on the other side of the aisle. 
   Today, the hospital emergency department is such a fundamental part of our health system that it's easy to forget that emergency medicine is a relatively new specialty. Emergency rooms were first established in the 1970s as medical personnel returned from the Vietnam War. The skills developed to save soldiers' lives on the battlefield were being put to use saving victims of car crashes and other traumas. 
   However, the bodies of adult soldiers are very different from those of kids. By the early 1980s, doctors were seeing marked disparities in survival rates among adults and children with similar injuries. In fact, kids had twice the death rate in emergencies as adults. 
   In 1984, the Emergency Medical Services for Children program was first Ðcreated. This unique act has driven fundamental changes in America's emergency medical system. Since it was established, child injury death rates have dropped 40 percent. The research that resulted from this legislation helped establish pediatric emergency medicine as its own specialty. 
   Program grants have provided seed money to every State and territory to help first responders and hospitals improve children's emergency care. In the mid-1980s, emergency personnel received little training in caring for children. Now, thanks to this program, paramedics can be exclusively trained, and their ambulances are stocked with the equipment and supplies needed by seriously injured kids. 
   Nowhere has this been more critical than in rural areas where the closest emergency room is often many miles from the scene of an accident. Getting it right for these small patients in the first critical minutes often means the difference between life and death. 
   Data collection and training seminars offered under this program, including from the Emergency Medical Services for Children Data Analysis Resource Center based in my district at the University of Utah, help ensure that best practices are developed and disseminated across the country. 
   The Emergency Medical Services for Children program's authorization expired in September 2005. In the summer of 2006, the Institutes of Medicine released a report which documented the value of this program. It noted the gaps that still remain in providing quality emergency care for children. And there is still a serious gap between the percentage of kids who end up in the emergency room and the percentage of emergency rooms staffed, trained and equipped to respond appropriately. The report said this program is ``well positioned to assume a leadership role'' in closing this gap. 
   I am pleased that H.R. 2464, the Wakefield Act, has bipartisan and bicameral support, including support from 75 of my colleagues in the House of Representatives. The bill is endorsed by over 50 organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Emergency Physicians, the American Medical Association, the Emergency Nurses Association, and many more. 
   Madam Speaker, this legislation enhances the program by authorizing the appropriate funding needed to ensure  the program can drive improvements in emergency and disaster care for children. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to acknowledge the bipartisan nature in which this bill moved through our committee, working on both sides of the aisle within the Energy and Commerce Committee. We worked together to make this bill as good as it can be. 
   Madam Speaker, nobody likes to see a child get hurt. Together, we can assure that when that happens, children have the best possible chance for recovery and a good outcome. I strongly urge the adoption of this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. Mr. Chairman I rise today, first of all, in strong support of H.R. 3355, the Homeowners' Defense Act, and I offer an amendment that I believe will further support the intent of this legislation, namely to better enable State-sponsored reinsurance programs to protect themselves by transferring catastrophic risk into capital markets. 
   I should first commend Congressman Klein and Congressman Mahoney for their proactive approach in this legislation, which allows States to responsibly plan for disasters ahead of time by pooling risk. By accessing capital markets to transfer risk, State-sponsored insurance funds will be better protected in the event of future disaster and will be increasingly able to provide affordable services for homeowners. 
   This legislation will provide an important backstop for many of the larger State-sponsored insurance plans but will also provide States like my home State of Utah with an opportunity to prepare for future catastrophes. The State of Utah does not currently have a State-sponsored catastrophic insurance plan but is considering developing one. 
   Utah has been ranked as one of the top ten U.S. earthquake States in the United States, and in some areas of the State, catastrophe risks also include wildfires, flooding, and mudslides. Of course many of these risks are unique to Utah, but many of these risks, things like fault lines or forest ranges, are spread over many States. I believe that States should be assessing many of these risks on a regional basis given the nature of those risks. 
   Very simply, Mr. Chairman, my amendment would require that the first annual report of the consortium that's established by this legislation should include an assessment of the costs associated with catastrophic risk for States and regions and an analysis of the costs and benefits of participation in the program for States that are not part of the consortium. 
   It is my hope that in providing States with an assessment of the catastrophic risks posed to their respective State and region and the costs associated with trying to address those risks, those States could evaluate and consider developing a State-sponsored catastrophic insurance plan if they do not already have one. I believe this legislation provides an important mechanism for States to protect themselves in the event of catastrophe, and I urge support of this amendment so that States can make a more informed decision going forward. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. MATHESON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my fellow Members to oppose the previous question, and I welcome my colleague from Nebraska. It has been a lonely exercise for me the last few years, and I am glad to have someone else join me on the floor and make this request, because I do think having some transparency and having accountability and having an up-or-down vote on the COLA makes a lot of sense. 
   These are difficult times in our Nation. We are fighting terrorism on so many fronts, our economy faces some challenges, and our future budget deficits continues to be projected in the future at great levels. 
   So I don't think this is the right time for Members of Congress to be allowing a pay raise to go through without even an up-or-down vote. We need to show the American people we are willing to make some sacrifices. We need to budget and live within our means and make careful spending decisions based on our most pressing priorities. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, let us send a signal to the American people that we recognize there is a struggle today for some in today's economy. Vote ``no'' on the previous question so we can have an opportunity to block the automatic cost-of-living adjustment to Members of Congress. Regardless of how Members feel about this issue, they should all be willing to make their position public and on the record. A ``no'' vote will allow Members to vote up or down on the COLA. 
   If the previous question is defeated, I also would intend to offer an amendment to the rule, and my amendment would block the fiscal year 2008 automatic cost-of-living pay raise for Members of Congress. Because this amendment requires a waiver, the only way to get to this issue is to defeat the previous question. So therefore I urge Members to vote no on the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution that supports the goals and ideals of National Consumer Protection Week. Starting yesterday, Sunday, February 4, through this Saturday, February 10, National Consumer Protection Week has the purpose of highlighting consumer protection and education efforts around the Nation. 
   This is a worthy goal that Congress should enthusiastically support. An informed consumer is a powerful consumer. Too often, the average citizen is unaware of the litany of scams being perpetrated at any given time. 
   Many criminals prey on consumers who have fallen on hard financial times, promising them quick fixes to magically solve all of their economic problems. These scams have real consequences for thousands of Americans, and the effects can be devastating to an individual or to a family. 
   However, if consumers are well informed and armed with knowledge, they can better navigate the marketplace and avoid these financial pitfalls. National Consumer Protection Week can help in this regard. Sponsored by the Federal Trade Commission, the Better Business Bureau, AARP, the Consumer Federation of America, and many other government and nonprofit organizations, community leaders can access a Web site with an outreach tool kit to help them educate their citizens and spread the word. 
   Now, this Web site is at www.consumer.gov/ncpw. Let me repeat that: www.consumer.gov/ncpw, which is the acronym for National Consumer Protection Week. On this Web site, consumers can access information about how to protect themselves from fraud. 
   It also gives tips consumers can use to recognize a ripoff when they see one. Lastly, I would be remiss if I did not quickly mention that as a new member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and specifically on the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection, it is my hope that this 110th Congress will be the National Consumer Protection Congress. 
   This week in February is National Consumer Protection Week, but we can do so much more in the coming months ahead. By working with Subcommittee Chairman Rush and Ranking Member Stearns, as well as Energy and Commerce Chairman Dingell and Ranking Member Barton, I believe that we can instigate many reforms to empower consumers and improve the lives of everyday Americans. 
   Our committee is prepared to aggressively examine a whole host of basic consumer protection and pocketbook issues. I look forward to working with my Republican friends in the 110th Congress on this effort. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. MATHESON. (INDUSTRIAL BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. I thank Chairman Frank for his good work. I have great respect for Chairman Frank, and I have great respect for my colleague Mr. Gillmor. On this particular issue, I respectfully have a different point of view, but I do understand the time and effort that has gone into looking at this issue. 
   I think it is important to note that when we look at legislation, we often are trying to solve problems and achieve progress. That is what Congress does, and my concern here is this is legislation that is a solution in search of the problem. 
   We already have a number of banks that have been chartered with commercial parents, and we have a track record of regulation of this type of institution that is a stellar track record. Quite frankly, I think the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the FDIC, and the State of Utah, which regulates these particular banks, has a great track record. So I fear that we have moved down a path where we said, ``Oh, gee, these things could happen; therefore, let's stop this industry from moving in the direction that it has been moving.'' 
   I think it is important for us to show concern and make sure we don't go down a path that could have negative implications, but in this case where we have already had a number of banks chartered and a track record that is so solid and none of these potential problems have manifested themselves, I question whether Congress should be moving in this direction. 
   As this debate has moved along, we have also said, well, what about the auto companies? Maybe we should carve out an exemption for them. What about the ones that already exist? Like Target already has one. We need to cut out an exemption for them. 
   As you start to slice and dice this industry and allow certain exemptions here and there, that calls into question the basic premise of if there really is a problem to have commercial ownership of this industry. 
   I will close with just one other point of fact. I noted in the hearing before the Financial Services Committee a couple weeks ago a comment by one of the witnesses was made that I have heard periodically throughout this debate. They said: My gosh, what if Enron and WorldCom had one of these? Where would we be then? 
   And my answer is: Based on the track record of this industry, I would like to think that, while those parent companies had their financial difficulties, the subsidiary bank would have been fine. We have examples right now where the parent company, like Conseco, went into bankruptcy, and their industrial loan company based in Utah was shielded from all those financial problems and, quite frankly, sold at a premium. 
   So that shows that the style of regulation, which is different, it is a different style of regulation called ``bottom up'' or ``bank centric'' regulation, it shows that type of regulation has worked, it has protected against transgressions, and I think that track record is something we need to keep in mind. 
   So as this issue percolates along, it is clear this bill is going to pass the House today. I suspect the Senate may have a different type of bill as well. And as this issue perks along, I just encourage everyone to keep an open mind about looking at the actual track record, understanding the magnitude of the potential problems, but also keeping in mind that more choices for consumers, greater efficiency for our economy, those are good things, too, and they ought to be balanced in this overall debate. 
   Again, I really thank the chairman for giving me some time when I am speaking out. Quite frankly, I am going to vote against the bill, but I appreciate him giving me time to speak today. 
   Again, I respect all my colleagues that worked on this, and I look forward to continuing to work with them on the adjusted loan bank issue in the future.

   Mr. MATHESON. Mr. Speaker, during my time in this job, I have met with many Utah families, teachers and health professionals about their struggle with autism. I have visited the special education classrooms where dedicated teachers work with youngsters who have been diagnosed as autistic, as well as met with families desperately searching out medical options for their children. I have learned from this that more data, more research and more public education are imperative in order to help these families create a future for their children. 
   In Utah, one in every 133 kids has autism. That is the third highest rate among 14 States, according to a 2007 CDC study. Nationally, 67 children are diagnosed with autism every single day, which costs our country $90 billion a year. I am humbled to represent the Utah family that has the highest number of cases of autism in a single-family in the entire United States, six children. 
   As a member of the Autism Caucus and as a cosponsor of the resolution declaring April National Autism Month, I have been a strong advocate for increased research dollars to help us provide more answers about this disorder and the hardship it inflicts on families. 
   Awareness is only a first step, but every step forward brings us closer I hope to improved diagnosis and treatment of autism.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. Madam Chairman, this amendment is an effort to refine the reporting of requirements in the legislation for schools that receive grants under this program relative to the flooring that is installed in these schools. 
   Schools and local educational agencies receiving grants under this bill would report if they install flooring, whether it was low or no volatile organic compounds flooring; whether it was made from sustainable materials, and report on the cost effective nature of that decision to install that type of flooring. 
   I just want to be clear though. This amendment is not a mandate. It doesn't require schools to install any particular type of flooring. It really is a purpose just to gather information to find out if or not this material has been used in the installation process. 
   One of the motivations behind this amendment is to ensure that we raise this issue about the opportunity for both children and teachers who are in schools, that they are put in the best learning and teaching environment possible. The reason for that is because materials such as flooring in some schools can contain potentially unhealthy levels of volatile organic compounds that can lead to unsafe indoor air quality for both students and teachers. 
   Again, I think this is a relatively straightforward amendment just to increase the reporting requirements to say what happened in terms of how the flooring was required. It does not require any particular type of flooring to be installed, but it helps us gather information and raise awareness about the benefits of using low or no volatile organic compound flooring. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MATHESON. Madam Speaker, I have long stated that caring for our children is always the right thing to do. Every parent in my State of Utah and in this country knows that access to health care and preventive medicine for our kids is the right thing to do. 
   It has been 10 years ago that we passed this program. It has helped insure more than 6 million children, and that is a good thing. And we have made that type of progress even as health care costs have gone up and the number of people struggling to get and to pay for health insurance has increased. We made that progress through the Children's Health Insurance Program because it is a model that works. The States do their part, the Federal Government does its part, private insurance does its part, and the families through copays and premiums do their part as well. 
   At a time when it is often tough to make progress on important issues, why would we want to turn our backs on our kids and stop progress in its tracks? 
   As Members of Congress, none of us have to worry about this. We all have insurance for our kids. We don't need to worry about being one huge medical bill away from facing bankruptcy. Let's think about the folks who aren't in the same situation that we all have as Members of Congress. The best investment we can make is in our kids. I urge Congress to override the President's veto.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4. I think it is important America's seniors have access to the medicines that they need. Quite frankly, that is why I voted for the Medicare Modernization Act when it passed the House in 2003. I believed then, as I do now, that the Medicare Modernization Act would give patients access to medicines. I also believe that the Medicare Modernization Act has made progress. There are more people who have prescription drug coverage as a result of the legislation. 
   Today, I support H.R. 4, as I believe it is an additional measure that will likely provide more affordable medicines to those who need them. However, I have some concerns I would like to mention for the record. 
   While it makes sense for efforts to be made toward negotiating better prices, I would hope the House would not interpret today's support of H.R. 4 as support for government price controls. I have long been a supporter of free and open markets. There is no better marketplace for consumers than one in which competition dictates the going rate for products and consumers are free to choose the products they prefer. 
   I would encourage my colleagues to support free and open markets and oppose future efforts that would involve the government in actually setting price controls, and I encourage support today for H.R. 4.

   Mr. MATHESON. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3877) to require the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology to establish an initiative to promote the research, development, and demonstration of miner tracking and communications systems and to promote the establishment of standards regarding underground communications to protect miners in the United States, as amended. 
   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

   Mr. MATHESON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I'm very pleased that this action is taking place today on the floor of the House of Representatives. I represent the Second Congressional District of Utah, and that includes the Crandall Canyon Mine where this past August I think everyone in this country is aware of the coal mining accident that occurred where six men were trapped, and during the rescue attempt, three rescuers were killed in a cave-in. 
   There were a lot of emotions that we all felt and shared during that disaster; but beyond those emotions, I think something that must have crossed all of our minds as we all watched this tragedy unfold was a question, and that was, how is it as the rescuers tried to locate these six trapped men that we can't know exactly where they are, that there isn't some kind of signal or beacon or some way to communicate such that we can have a better sense of exactly where the six men were trapped? 
   I think that's a question that a lot of us have, and here in Congress, as a  member of the House Science Committee, I asked those questions, and the committee collectively, majority and minority, has looked at that issue. 
   The answer really is that the technology doesn't exist today to communicate in this manner between the surface and folks who are trapped deep underground, and so the effort here and the purpose of this legislation, it's a very narrow piece of legislation, looks at encouraging development of technology that would allow this type of communication to occur in the future. 
   The thing about this bill that I'm really proud of is the fact that the committee worked so well together, and I really want to thank Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall for their extraordinary effort and also the staff, both majority and the minority, for working together to move this bill in a rather quick manner and in a bipartisan manner. Suggestions were taken from folks on both sides of the aisle, and the bill that came out of the committee reflected those discussions and deliberations among everyone involved in the committee. 
   So I think this is an example where Congress is passing good legislation, a substantive piece of legislation. It's a piece of legislation that is so important for the 1,400 underground mines we have in this country and, quite frankly, the many thousands of underground mines that exist around the world today, where this type of technology, if it is developed, will allow better communication capability and allow an opportunity for perhaps more success in rescue operations. 
   Now, I want to be clear on a couple of things. The purpose of the legislation is really to accelerate next-generation technology. The legislation will direct the National Institute of Standards and Technology to establish an initiative to promote research, development, and demonstration of miner tracking and communication systems and to promote the establishment of standards and other measurement services regarding underground mines. I think the legislation will foster much-needed research and development in this field of communications to better protect miners. 
   The time to address this issue is now, before any more accidents leave any additional miner families desperate for word about their loved ones. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. MATHESON. I thank my colleague. I also want to thank him for making one additional really good point in his remarks, and that is that this legislation is complementary with what we are trying to do at NIOSH and MSHA. 
   Madam Speaker, Congress these days doesn't have the best reputation of working together on certain things, but this is an example where this committee worked really well in terms of coming up with legislation, where bills were originally introduced, there were some other questions during the committee process. Folks on the minority side of the aisle offered suggestions for a manager's amendment. We approved this bill. It has good bipartisan support. It's the right thing to do. 
   I again want to thank Dr. Gingrey and everyone on the Science Committee staff for their help in making this legislation work. 
   I will just close by saying that I visited the Crandall Canyon mine families right after the disaster. They were going through so many emotions that it's difficult for us to even imagine, but to not know where their loved ones were was probably the greatest frustration of all. If this legislation can provide a path to help provide answers to those questions in the future, then, clearly, it's the right thing to do. 
   I ask for a favorable vote from everybody on this legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
