<TEXT>
   Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. 
   The passage of this bipartisan bill will continue Congress' commitment to the fight against HIV, TB and malaria around the world. This bill will dramatically boost HIV/AIDS and health care programs for women and girls, as well as strengthen health and education systems in nations hard-hit by the HIV virus. 
   H.R. 5501 also provides funding for orphans and vulnerable children, as well as food and nutrition programs. 
   The World Health Organization estimates that over 38 million people are living with HIV/AIDS and 95 percent of those people live in the developing world. 
   We must be leaders in combating the global AIDS crisis and this bill allows maximum flexibility for our staff on the ground. H.R. 5501 provides needed funding and support to transition the very successful PEPFAR program from the emergency phase to the sustainability phase. I urge all my colleagues to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. SIRES. (DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS SENDS COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT TO THE PRESIDENT'S DESK -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, elections do make a difference. Last November, Democrats promised that if the American people entrusted us with the control of Congress, one of our top six priorities would be putting college in reach for more Americans. 
   This week, the Democratic Congress delivers on that promise, sending the College Cost Reduction and Access Act to the President's desk for his signature. The President says he will sign it, which is good news for millions of students and families who are trying to fulfill the American Dream. 
   The landmark legislation is the largest college aid expansion since the GI Bill in 1944. Under the legislation, the maximum Pell Grant scholarship will increase by more than $1,000 over the next 5 years. More than 5.5 million low- and moderate-income students will receive an immediate boost of almost $500 in their Pell Grant scholarships. The legislation also cuts interest rates in half on student loans, which will save the average student $4,400 over the life of the college loan. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Democratic Congress has delivered on another of our top priorities as we take America in a new direction.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SIRES. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding me time. 
   As you know, my district is in northern New Jersey, right across the river from New York City. I also represent parts of Newark and Jersey City, which are both considered high-threat areas. As a matter of fact, the New York Times has called parts of my district as containing two of the most dangerous miles in the country. As you can imagine, my constituents deal with the threat of terrorism every day. 
   When I was Speaker of the New Jersey Assembly, I made homeland security a top priority. Already in my first year in the U.S. House of Representatives, we have tackled important national security issues. The reauthorization of TRIA is another step in the process and something of great importance to the businesses of my congressional district and to this country. 
   I believe that the Financial Services Committee has thoroughly considered this reauthorization. We held hearings in New York City back in March where we had the opportunity to hear directly from the mayor of New York, Mayor Bloomberg, and Senator Schumer about the need for TRIA reauthorization. I am confident that H.R. 2761 takes their suggestions into consideration. The work of the Financial Services Committee that led to the drafting of this bill makes me proud to be a cosponsor. I think this legislation addresses all the major issues involved in the reauthorization, while maintaining the system that continues to ensure that there is coverage for terrorist attacks. 
   I want to thank Chairman Frank and Congressman Capuano for introducing the reauthorization legislation, and I look forward to working with the committee and the leadership to make sure that this bill passes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, today the House will begin debate on the comprehensive housing package that will help families keep their homes, prevent foreclosures in the future, and help the recovery of communities left almost vacant by the housing crisis. Today, more than 3.5 million homes sit empty in America, and if Washington does not act, another 2 million Americans are expected to lose their homes in the coming months. 
   The Democratic housing package will provide mortgage refinancing assistance to families so they can stay in their homes. We do this by expanding the FHA program so the borrowers in danger of losing their homes can refinance into lower-cost government-issued mortgages. The housing package also provides $15 billion in loans and grants to States so they can acquire foreclosed homes and rehabilitate properties in areas hit hard by the housing crisis. 
   Mr. Speaker, this housing package is the best response to our Nation's housing problem.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, the Bush-Cheney energy plan is now 95 percent implemented and we are paying for it at the pump. It's no mystery how it happened. Two oilmen in the White House let Big Oil literally write the energy plan. And while Republicans continue to demand opening up more areas for drilling, Democrats are asking why not drill on 311 million acres of Federal land already open for energy production? 
   Day after day Republicans say drill, drill, drill. But they haven't once asked why oil companies are sitting on 68 million acres of already-leased land. 
   This country needs a comprehensive plan for energy independence, and responsible drilling is part of that plan. Why not open new areas for development that will save consumers little at the pump decades down the road when there are 68 million acres of land ready for drilling? 
   Mr. Speaker, Democrats don't want to make the American consumer wait another 10 to 20 years for any relief. Today we hope that the Republicans will join us in demanding that Big Oil start drilling on the leases they already have, otherwise lose the leases. It's time to tell Big Oil, ``Use it or lose it.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H. Res. 1109, honoring the memory of Mr. Dith Pran, a constituent of mine from Woodbridge, New Jersey, who passed away on March 30, 2008, at the age of 65. Mr. Dith was a photojournalist for the New York Times and a renowned human rights advocate, who became the face of the atrocities in Cambodia carried out by the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot. After fleeing Cambodia in 1979, Mr. Dith devoted his life to advocating against genocide and finding justice for victims of genocide through his advocacy. 
   After working as a translator and receptionist in Cambodia, he was hired in the early 1970s by Sydney H. Schanberg of the New York Times to be a guide and interpreter. The incredible friendship and partnership that developed between the two men became the basis for the 1984 film, ``The Killing Fields,'' which helped bring to light the brutality of the Khmer Rouge regime. 
   In 1985, Mr. Dith became a U.S. citizen and a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In 1994, he worked with former Senator Charles Robb to help pass the Cambodian Genocide Justice Act. Mr. Dith was a tireless advocate constantly speaking out about the Cambodian genocide, so that the world would know and never forget. 
   This resolution is to honor Mr. Dith's commitment to raising awareness about the atrocities that took place in Cambodia, as well as to recognize the strength and courage of an ordinary man who lived an extraordinary life. Mr. Speaker, I would urge all my colleagues to support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. SIRES. (34TH BLACK ANNIVERSARY OF THE INVASION OF CYPRUS -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 34th anniversary of the invasion of Cyprus, also known as the Black Anniversary. The occupation of Cyprus is an injustice that has gone on for too long, and the Cyprus question can no longer be ignored. 
   I am encouraged by meetings over the last several months between President Christofias and the Turkish Cypriot leader, Mr. Talat. Their efforts to implement the July 2006 agreement are helping to lay the framework for talks about a final solution to the Cyprus question. With the recent establishment of working groups and technical committees to discuss substantive and day-to-day issues between the communities, I am hopeful that the meeting on July 25 between President Christofias and Talat will bring about full negotiations. 
   Mr. Speaker, 13 million crossings have taken place between the Greek and the Turkish Cypriot communities without incident, and yet, there are still 43,000 Turkish troops on the island. That is one Turkish troop for every two Turkish Cypriots. 
   Last year, I introduced House Resolution 620, expressing the sense of the House that Turkey should end its occupation of the Republic of Cyprus. I believe this is an occupation that has divided Cyprus and the Cypriot people for far too long. This occupation stands in the way of a final solution to the Cyprus question, as well as Turkey's accession into the European Union. 
   Mr. Speaker, last November I led a congressional delegation to Greece and Cyprus where I toured the buffer zone in Nicosia. I saw the barbed wire, and I saw with my own eyes an area where time has stood still for 34 years. As we rise today to commemorate the events of July 20, 1974, we must remain committed to working together to end the occupation and to bring down the 113 miles of barbed wire fence that continue to divide Cyprus.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 5749, the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act that will provide immediate relief to 3.8 million unemployed workers who continue to struggle to find work in the slowing economy. 
   Recently, the Nation experienced the biggest one-month jump in the unemployment rate in more than two decades, rising from 5.0 percent to 5.5 percent and is now an entire percentage point higher than a year ago. Americans have been losing jobs in each of the past 5 months, with the number of unemployed now at 3.8 million. The airline and automobile industries alone have laid off over 50,000 employees combined. 
   The current high levels of unemployment have only added to the struggles of the U.S. economy by adding thousands more Americans to those having a hard time making ends meet. This bill will provide the necessary extension of unemployment benefits to those 3.8 million Americans who struggle to find employment within the current timeframe. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this necessary legislation that will give our economy the relief it needs. Extending these benefits is an efficient and quick way to support our country's workers and invigorate the economy. My Democratic colleagues and I are committed to providing the much needed relief to the millions of unemployed workers, who in the face of rising gas and food costs, continue to struggle to support themselves and their families.

   Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, as President Bush moves forward with his unpopular plan to send an additional 22,000 troops to Iraq, it is crucial that this Congress take a hard look at how this surge affects our national security throughout the rest of the world. 
   Last week, General James Conway, the Marine Corps Commandant, told the House Armed Services Committee that if troops were needed somewhere else in the world, the response would be a lot slower than we might like. Army Chief of Staff Peter Schoomaker went as far as saying that pooling resources for troops in Iraq limits our ability to respond to emerging strategic contingencies. 
   Mr. Speaker, after hearing all these warnings from military officials about the President's escalation plan, Congress must step in and voice its opposition in the name of protecting our national security. The days of rubber stamping the President's war plans are over.

The slave Africans who came to the European colonies were forbidden to speak their native languages, use African musical instruments, or practice their spiritual beliefs. To keep their African traditions alive through songs and stories, the slaves created a new kind of music. Today these are known as spirituals. 
   Mr. Calvin Earl, my constituent from Jersey City, has devoted his entire life to educating people about the history and the importance of African American spirituals. He started a program called The Gifts from My Ancestors. Through songs, dances, and storytelling, this program has helped people experience the story of enslaved African Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr. Earl for his work, and I believe it is time to recognize the importance of these spirituals and preserve them for future generations by voting in favor of H. Res. 120.

   Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, across the country more and more Americans are struggling to make ends meet. Unemployment has risen to 5 percent. Home values are dropping and millions of Americans are getting hit with mortgage rate adjustments. At the same time, the costs of health care, groceries, gasoline, home heating oil, and college educations continue to rise. It is welcome news that Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke is signaling that the Fed will cut interest rates to address the slowing economy. But this is not enough. 
   Democrats want to work with the President and the Republican Congress in the coming weeks to jump-start the economy and provide sound relief to American families. I would hope that we can all agree that the economy needs a jolt. Democrats believe a fiscal stimulus plan should adhere to three simple principles to be effective: It must be timely, targeted, and temporary. 
   Madam Speaker, we want to work in a bipartisan fashion immediately to develop a legislative plan based on these three principles so that the stimulus plan can be passed and implemented into law without delay.

I want to thank our colleague, Congresswoman Hilda Solis, the sponsor of this resolution, as well as original cosponsors, the Chair and the ranking member of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, Eliot Engel and Dan Burton, for bringing this issue to us. 
   This important resolution raises awareness of the increasing number of women and girls who have been brutally murdered in Guatemala. Since 2001, more than 2,000 women and girls have been killed in Guatemala, and the murder rate of women has increased sharply, more so than the rate for men. 
   Many of these murders are preceded by mutilation or sexual assault of the victims, and almost none of these cases are properly investigated or prosecuted. The fact that most of the murders go unpunished has contributed to the decline of overall security in Guatemala and demonstrates the dangerous situation for women and girls throughout the country. 
   While Guatemala has made some strides to improve the treatment of women under the law, there are still major obstacles for the country to overcome. For instance, domestic violence and sexual harassment are not considered crimes in Guatemala. This resolution condemns the murders, expresses sympathy and support for the struggle of victims' families for justice and urges that the murders be promptly investigated and prosecuted. 
   I hope that our two countries can work together to end the brutal murders of women and girls in Guatemala and to improve the security for all Guatemalans. I urge all my colleagues to support H. Res. 100.

   Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would first like to commend our colleague from Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, for introducing this important resolution. His efforts to win our Nation the 2016 Olympic games are greatly appreciated. 
   Mr. Speaker, the 2004 summer Olympic games in Athens unfolded before the eyes of hundreds of millions of people around the world, with some watching in person, but many more on television every night. It is fair to say that the Athens games were a success, despite fears of terrorism or that key Olympic venues would not be ready. Athens was prepared to receive thousands of athletes and officials from around the world. The Olympic spirit thrived as athletes lived out their dreams. 
   This resolution before the House seeks to bring the summer Olympic spirit we witnessed in Athens here to America for the first time since 1996 in the Atlanta Olympic games. This measure urges the International Olympic Committee to choose the United States entry of Chicago to host the 2016 summer Olympics. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Olympics bring together people from all over the world. And when they arrive in Chicago, they will find a culturally diverse city ready and willing to host athletes and spectators from every nation. 
   Chicago already has developed a public transportation infrastructure to ensure that visitors from the United States and abroad can easily get to the Olympic games. Once in Chicago, athletes and spectators alike will be able to move seamlessly through all Olympic venues and practice facilities. 
   The Olympic games will be held in the heart of Chicago so that everyone can enjoy Chicago's beautiful waterfront and park system. Hosting the Olympic games will also bring important economic benefits to Chicago and position it to hold important sporting events in the future. 
   Mr. Speaker, Chicago is a beautiful, thriving American city eager to carry on the Olympic tradition. When the International Olympic Committee meets to choose the site of the 2016 summer games, I urge committee members to choose Chicago. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this resolution, and reserve the balance of my time.

   The triumph of the Mexican people over the French in this battle has come to symbolize the fight for freedom and justice. To most of us in the United States, this holiday is expressed through the enjoyment of Mexican and Mexican American culture, the food, the music, and the customs. This resolution encourages continuing those celebrations, but it also reminds us that Cinco de Mayo is a tribute to the contributions that the Mexicans and Mexican Americans have made and continue to make across our Nation. 
   We take pride in these achievements and in the continuing dedication of thousands of Mexican American men and women in uniform. 
   Cinco de Mayo reminds us that the foundation of the United States is built by people from many nations and diverse cultures willing to fight and die to make ours a stronger and freer world.

   We then began to fix some of the laws that were written and passed in the dark of night. During the first 100 hours in power, we gave the Federal Government the ability to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for American seniors, something that should have been done when the law was first passed. 
   Yesterday, we repealed $14 billion in subsidies to big oil companies that simply don't need it right now. We have taken the savings and invested them in renewable fuels so that we can begin to end our dependence on foreign oil.

   Let me start my remarks talking a little bit about 9/11. I was the mayor of a small community across from New York, and I was a citizen. I watched as the Towers burned. I will never forget that vision in my mind. It was a symbolic blow to the Nation's spirit. But we have recovered our spirit. Today, America stands strong and proud again. And an important part of the recovery is due to the fact that we were able to get back to work. In short, we got back our lives. 
   As the Secretary of the Interior, Ms. Norton, said on September 12, 2001 while standing at the Hoover Dam, ``Even though atrocities such as those of September 11 can affect us, they cannot close us down.'' That is why I am cosponsoring this amendment today. 
   The only national park that remains closed from 9/11 is the crown of the Statue of Liberty. I hope that with this amendment we will open up the crown for visiting once again. 
   Yes, it is symbolic, but symbols are important. And let me say that there are three sites that most immigrants, when they come to the area, like to look at.

   Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt is about to begin a 100-day public relations effort to build support for the President's health care proposal. Democrats here in Washington in Congress want to work towards reducing the number of uninsured. Unfortunately, the tax deduction proposal will do very little to assist the 47 million Americans who are now living without health insurance. 
   The President touts his plan as a way to give low-income uninsured Americans more money in their pockets to help them buy their own health insurance. It sounds good, but the President ignores two facts. 
   First, the President's plan does not provide enough of a benefit for low-income Americans. A tax deduction is of little value to low-income workers, who in many cases will receive little more than $1,200 a year back from the Federal Government. That might sound like a lot, but health insurance costs the average family almost $11,000 a year. This small deduction will continue to make health care out of reach. 
   Madam Speaker, unfortunately, the President's proposal is not the right approach.

   This proposed budget is fiscally irresponsible, creating trillions of dollars in new deficit, but it is also morally irresponsible for slashing funding for Medicare, education, energy, homeland security and veterans. 
   The President's budget slashes Medicare and Medicaid funding by about $300 billion over the next 10 years, without offering relief to millions of Americans without health insurance. The Bush budget also cuts funds for renewable energy grants, despite his State of the Union pledge to tackle our Nation's energy crisis. He even reduces State homeland security preparedness grants. Perhaps worst of all, the Bush budget cuts veterans health care by $3.5 billion.

   Mr. SIRES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   I am very happy to be here today discussing my bill to help public housing authorities across the Nation. Let me start by thanking Chairman Barney Frank for his support on this bill and his leadership in the Financial Service Committee. Without his dedication to this issue, we would not be considering this bill today. 
   Let me start by explaining why I introduced this bill. Shortly after I was sworn in, I received a letter from the  Jersey City Housing Authority in my district. They told me they had to lay off 34 employees because of asset management. When I looked into this, I learned that Jersey City was not unique. Over 800 public housing authorities had their operating budgets cut because of the way asset management was implemented by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. At the same time, the Department limited the amount of flexibility given to public housing authorities to make ends meet. I knew something had to be done. 
   With the support of Chairman Frank, Congressman Meek, and others, I introduced H.R. 6216, the Asset Management Improvement Act of 2008. You will note that the title indicates that the bill improves asset management; it does not put an end to asset management. That is because I feel strongly that the goals of asset management are worthwhile. 
   By making public housing authorities run more efficiently, asset management has the potential to improve the lives of all those who live in public housing in this country. 
   My bill simply makes four improvements to the asset management rule and it alters the management of public housing in other aspects. First, it requires new negotiations to establish a reasonable management fee and allows public housing authorities to revert back to the old funding mechanism until final implementation of asset management on January 1, 2011. Congress has previously acted to require this, but HUD failed to act. This bill sets HUD straight. 
   Second, my bill reaffirms current law by allowing public housing authorities to transfer funds between their operating fund and their capital fund. This provision prevents the Department from prohibiting such transfers. This flexibility is vital to agencies, particularly since the housing program is underfunded. Housing authorities know best where they need funding, not Washington. 
   There is wide agreement on this provision. In fact, this provision was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2008. That provision, however, is only valid for 1 year. My bill will make this change permanent. 
   Third, my bill decreases the exemption threshold from small to medium-sized public housing authorities. The Department recognized that small authorities with fewer than 250 units of housing would not benefit from the benefits of asset management, and so they are exempted. My bill simply raises this threshold to 500 units. 
   Again, there is little disagreement on raising the threshold. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2008 raised the exemption threshold to 400. My bill goes a little further; to 500 units. The impact of this change would only affect 110 public housing authorities, some of whom may not opt out of asset management because they think it makes good sense. Even with this change, over two-thirds of all public housing units will still be covered by the asset management rules. 
   Third, my bill restates current law in terms of tenant participation. It simply says tenants should be allowed to participate in the decision affecting their homes. It prohibits the Department from altering tenant participation rights and it encourages public housing authorities to include tenants in discussions about asset management that directly affects their home. 
   The bill alters public housing management in a few other ways. First, it restates current law that undocumented immigrants are ineligible for public housing assistance. It includes language that Congresswoman Bachmann brought to our attention on gun rules. In fact, we have incorporated her language into the bill. 
   Public housing authorities cannot require gun registration or prohibit gun ownership if local laws do not restrict ownership. Public housing authorities, as a whole, feel this is a reasonable requirement. Additionally, this bill allows public housing authorities to evict tenants who use an illegal weapon while on public housing property. This text was added by Representatives Maloney and Boren, recognizing that tenants do not have a right to use illegal weapons in public housing. 
   Together, these changes make several improvements to the management of public housing. It will improve the lives of all the residents.

   Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, let me start by recognizing the good work of my colleague, Congresswoman Gwen Moore. I appreciate her efforts to bring this important program to our attention. 
   The School Breakfast Program began as a pilot program in 1966 and has grown to serve over 10 million children nationwide. In New Jersey, almost 145,000 students ate a school breakfast during the 2007 school year; yet there are many students who cannot participate because their school does not offer this program. 
   This is important because research has shown how vital a good breakfast is for learning. Children who eat a healthy breakfast have higher standardized test scores; do much better in math, reading, and vocabulary tests; and attend school more regularly compared with children who do not eat breakfast. 
   Congress should act to increase funding for this program so that many more students can be served. It is a smart investment in our future. I encourage all of my colleagues to support this resolution and this important program. 
   I thank Congresswoman Moore.

The President should talk to our Nation's Governors, 43 of whom have voiced support for a strengthened CHIP reauthorization. 
   The Republican Governor of Utah, Jon Huntsman, said, ``CHIP is a much needed safety net for uninsured kids, and Congress showed tremendous foresight in authorizing it a decade ago. Uninsured children are the State's number one priority.'' 
   The Republican Governor of Wisconsin, Tim Pawlenty, said, ``We as Governors also want to make sure that the current population, and hopefully some reasonable expansions, could be covered.'' 
   In addition, the Republican Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger said, ``We cannot roll back the clock on the program that has helped to ensure children who need it most to have a healthy start in life.''

   Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, the President's war has already cost the American people dearly in both lives and tax dollars. Congress has appropriated nearly $477 billion for the war since March 2003, and the U.S. is currently spending an estimated $10 billion a month on the war. This spending continues despite reports that 15 of 18 benchmarks for success have not been met and casualties in the war are 65 percent higher this year than last. 
   This Democratic Congress and the American people are ready for a new direction. We believe it is time to bring our troops home and begin investing here in the U.S. 
   If you took just some of the money we are spending in Iraq and invested it here instead, we could take care of a lot of our seniors' prescription drug cost problems. And for the cost of just one week in Iraq, we could hire 51,000 more police officers to make our streets safer. 
   Madam Speaker, it is time for Republicans in this body to listen to the American people and join us in calling for an end to the financial drain of this war. It is time to invest in making our Nation safer here at home.

New Jersey did not wait around years for the Department of Homeland Security to enact strong chemical security regulations. Our State took the initiative to protect its citizens by enacting strong chemical security laws. This House is taking action to make sure that my State will be able to keep our strong standards.

   Our local law enforcement officers serve communities across this Nation as the first line of defense against crime. The number of police on our streets matters for the security of every city in this Nation, and we have a responsibility to ensure that these officers are in place. That is why Congress worked with President Clinton in the 1990s to create the COPS program. 
   Through this program, more than 100,000 cops were hired, putting police in every neighborhood in our Nation. But when President Bush came to office, he eliminated the COPS program, with no objections from the old Republican rubber-stamp Congress. As a result, crime substantially increased over the last decade. 
   Madam Speaker, today this Congress has an opportunity to reverse these troubling trends by passing the COPS Improvement Act. This legislation would allow communities to hire 50,000 police officers over the next 6 years so we can better protect our communities.

Unfortunately, it did not have the support of two crucial parties, President Bush who vetoed it and his Republican friends who voted to uphold his veto. 
   Instead of helping us extend health care to low-income children, the President claims this fully-paid-for bill is excessive spending and instead he proposes to spend just $5 billion more than we do now on the CHIP program. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the President's plan will lead to more than 800,000 children losing their coverage. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to know how the President and his Republican enablers would determine which 800,000 children lose their coverage. And what do they tell the 4 million children who are currently eligible for CHIP, but will have no hope of getting this coverage unless our bipartisan bill passes?

I know this is a problem for many Americans across the country. In fact, recent research has indicated that in order to afford a modest two-bedroom apartment paying no more than 30 percent of their income for housing and working full time, a New Jersey family would need to earn over $20.00 an hour. Wages are simply not increasing fast enough to allow many families to even come close to this affordable housing wage. 
   Families need help. That is why I am so supportive of the Affordable Housing Trust Fund and the revenues that H.R. 1852 will provide to the Fund. This fund will increase home ownership and increase mortgage funding in areas of chronic economic distress. By increasing the level of home ownership, we will then increase the supply of rental housing for families. And where needed, we will increase our investment in affordable housing infrastructure to make a safe and affordable home a reality for every hardworking American. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment that would strike the affordable housing trust fund and I urge everyone to vote in support of final passage the Expanding American Home Ownership Act of 2007.

Just imagine how we could have used $60 billion here at home? We could have improved a lot of Americans' lives and addressed our deficit. 
   The war is also negatively impacting our military. Last week the Army announced it missed its recruiting goals for the 2nd month in a row, falling 1,000 recruits shy of its June goals.

   Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, during these uncertain economic times, American families are struggling to make ends meet. 
   Consider that oil and gas prices are at an all-time high. Health care costs continue to skyrocket out of control, leaving more Americans either uninsured or underinsured. Food prices recently experienced their biggest price increase in more than 3 years. If all that is not bad enough, the U.S. economy lost 63,000 jobs last month. The February jobs numbers are the latest sign that economic growth has virtually stalled. 
   President Bush has the dubious distinction of being tied with his father as the two Presidents with the worst jobs record since the Great Depression. 
   Madam Speaker, congressional Democrats are working hard to strengthen the American economy and create jobs. We worked in a bipartisan fashion on the economic stimulus package that will not only help hardworking Americans pay their bills but will also jump-start our economy and create 50,000 new jobs in America. 
   This was the only the beginning. Strengthening our economy remains a top priority for this Democratic Congress as we move through this year.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, today I rise in strong support of House Resolution 1024, honoring the 187th anniversary of the independence of Greece. March 25 marks the day the Greek people were freed from the Ottoman Empire and asserted their rights to govern themselves. 
   The citizens of Greece and the United States share a long history of Democratic ideals. The philosophical and political ideas of the ancient Greeks were an inspiration to the Founders of our democracy. Showing our support for Greek independence reminds us how important it is to continue defending freedom around the world. We must also remember those individuals that have fought on behalf of the freedom we share. 
   Greece is a friend and ally, and when it comes to helping promote freedom and stability in their region and the global community, I am pleased to honor Greece today on its 187th anniversary, and I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution.

   Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, as America prepares to honor our veterans and those who continue to wear the uniform this weekend, the Democratic Congress is proud of our record over the last 10 months that has provided real support for our troops and our veterans. 
   Today, we will take a vote on a final veterans bill that increases funding for veterans health care by $6.7 billion, making it the single largest increase in veterans funding in the 77-year history of the Veterans Administration. This bill invests $3.8 billion more than the President requested. 
   The final conference report also includes $500 million above the President's request for much-needed maintenance in VA health care facilities, and $600 million more than the President's request for mental health, PTSD and traumatic brain injury. This investment is critically important at a time when one-third of the veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan face mental health challenges. 
   Madam Speaker, today let us ensure that no veteran is left behind by supporting this bill that fulfills our promises to our Nation's veterans.

   Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise proudly this morning to tell this Nation and the children of the State of New Jersey that this House has heard their call for help. 
   Yesterday's passage of H.R. 3162, the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act of 2007, was a significant achievement for the children of working Americans throughout this country. In New Jersey alone, this legislation will maintain coverage for over 120,000 children currently enrolled in New Jersey's FamilyCare program, while also helping the State provide care for the 136,000 children currently eligible for the program but not enrolled in it. The New Jersey FamilyCare program would also be allowed to extend coverage to 126,000 young men and women who are aging out of the program but still need access to health care. 
   I am especially glad that the CHAMP Act will also help 80,000 of the lowest income and most wonderful adults in my State keep their coverage through this program. 
   Mr. Speaker, the SCHIP program that we passed yesterday has the potential to have a significant impact on improving children's health care across this Nation.

   Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3 and Federal stem cell research funding. 
   The Federal Government is behind the times. Many States, including my home State of New Jersey, have already authorized State funding for stem cell research. In fact, just last month I stood next to Governor Corzine as he signed a bill authorizing $270 million for new laboratories and stem cell research facilities throughout New Jersey. The time has come for this Congress and the President to do the same. 
   On the merits, embryonic stem cell research offers great promise to everyone suffering from a disease or illness. We all know someone or have ourselves been affected by diabetes, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, cancer, or another disease that could be cured or treated with therapies formed from stem cells. Cures and treatments will not be found overnight, but we will never know what could be accomplished if we don't make a real commitment to this research. That is why it is so important that we pass H.R. 3 today. 
   There are an estimated 100 million Americans waiting for us to take action. They don't believe this is a partisan or political issue. They just want hope for a cure. Let's give them that hope. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3.

<DOCNO>Mr. SIRES. (PUBLIC HOUSING ASSET MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SIRES. Mr. Chairman, I am very happy to be here debating this bill to help public housing authorities across  this Nation. Let me start by thanking Chairman Barney Frank for his support on this bill and his leadership in the committee. 
   Let me start by explaining why I introduced this bill. Shortly after I was sworn in, I received a letter from the Jersey City Housing Authority in my district. They told me they had laid off 34 employees bec ause of asset management. When I looked into this, I learned that Jersey City was not unique. Over 800 public housing authorities had their operating budgets cut because of the way asset management was implemented by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. At the same time, the Department limited the amount of flexibility given to public housing authorities to make ends meet. 
   I knew something had to be done. With the support of Chairman Frank, Chairwoman Waters, and others, I int roduced H.R. 3521, the Public Housing Asset Management Improvement Act of 2007. You will note that the title indicates that the bill improves asset management. It does not, and I repeat, it does not put an end to asset management. That is because I feel strongly that the goals of the asset management are worthwhile. By making public housing authorities run more efficiently, asset management has the potential to improve the lives of all those who live in public housing in this country. 
   My bill simply mak es four improvements to the asset management rule. First, it requires renewed negotiations over the management fee. A little background in this is probably helpful. In 1998, Congress passed the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998, which called on the Department to replace the old funding system with a new, more efficient system. In 2004, a negotiated rulemaking committee gathered to decide how to implement this new system known as asset management. One key piece was the management fee, and C ongress required that the fee be reasonable. The negotiators never discussed the management fee, and industry groups have argued that it was set arbitrarily by the Department in its final rule because it lacked input from the negotiated rulemaking committee. My bill requires new negotiations to establish a reasonable fee and allows public housing authorities to revert back to their old funding mechanism until final implementation of asset management on January 1, 2011. 
   Second, my bill reaffirms current law by allowing public housing authorities to transfer funds between their operating fund and their capital fund. This provision prevents the Department from prohibiting such transfers. This flexibility is vital to agencies, particularly since the public housing program is underfunded. Housing authorities know best where they need funding, not Washington. There is wide agreement on this provision. In fact, this provision was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2008. That provisio n, however, is only valid for 1 year. My bill would make the change permanent. 
   Third, my bill increases the exemption threshold from small to medium-sized public housing authorities. The Department recognized that small authorities with fewer than 250 units of housing would not benefit from the efficiencies of asset management. The final rule exempts public housing authorities with fewer than 250 units of housing from implementing asset management. My bill simply raises this threshold to 500 units. Agai n, there is little disagreement on raising the threshold. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2008 raised the exemption threshold to 400. My bill goes a little further to 500 units. The impact of this change will only affect 441 public housing authorities, some of whom may not opt out of asset management because they think it makes good sense. Even with this change, over two-thirds of all public housing units still will be covered by asset management rules. 
   Finally, my bill restates curr ent law in terms of tenant participation. It simply says that tenants should be allowed to participate in the decisions affecting their homes. It prohibits the Department from altering tenant participation rights, and it encourages public housing authorities to include tenants in discussion about asset management that directly affects their home. 
   Let me end by talking about who supports this bill. We have received letters of support from the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities, the Public Housin g Authorities Directors Association, the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials, and the National Training and Information Center.

   Mr. SIRES. This manager's amendment covers two different aspects of the bill. The first part addresses compliance with section 2 of the bi ll. Section 2 grants agencies that lost funding because of asset management to walk out of the funding agreement. The bill allows them to set their own reasonable management fee until a new negotiated rulemaking takes place. However, the Department recently announced that any agency compliant with this provision of the bill will be deemed as noncompliant with the Asset Management Final Rule. The manager's amendment makes it clear that these agencies are compliant. 
   The second part of the manager's amendm ent restates current law that undocumented immigrants are ineligible for financial assistance under section 214 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980. These changes are technical and should be adopted. 
   Chairman Frank and I urge a ``yes'' vote on these amendments.

<DOCNO>Mr. SIRES. (SHAREHOLDER VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SIRES. Mr. Chairman, thank you for yielding me time, and thank you for your leadership on this legislation. 
   As an original cosponsor of H.R. 1257, I rise in support of this bill. CEOs should be held accountable to shareholders. Whether you have invested $100 or $100 million in a company as a shareholder, you should be allowed to find out the terms and conditions of the compensation package for the company's CEO. 
   Shareholders should also have the right to express their satisfaction or dissatisfaction over a proposed compensation package. And that is exactly what H.R. 1257 does. It allows shareholders a chance to share their opinion with the board, which will help grant boards pause before approving a questionable compensation package. 
   This bill does not represent a completely new idea. In fact, the United Kingdom has used a nonbinding shareholder vote approach since 2003. Australia has a similar system. Granting shareholders a say over executive compensation in these two countries has improved dialogue between executives and shareholders and has increased the use of long-term performance targets in incentive compensation. This policy change has clearly worked. 
   American companies have also started to take notice. Most recently, AFLAC adopted a nonbinding shareholder vote for its CEO's compensation package. In addition, Institutional Shareholder Services reports that 52 other companies are also considering adopting similar policies. 
   It is now time to grant shareholders in the United States the same rights as their British and Australian counterparts. We need to make sure that all companies take AFLAC's lead by passing H.R. 1257. I urge my colleagues to grant the shareholders more access to the process of forming an executive compensation package. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill.

   As the American Association for the Advancement of Science has argued: We owe it to those with serious illnesses to vigorously pursue both adult stem cell research and embryonic stem cell research. 
   This is not a partisan issue. In fact, many in the President's own party recognize the potential that exists if scientists are allowed to expand their research. 
   Mr. Speaker, over the last 7 years, the President has only vetoed one bill, and that was a similar stem cell research bill that passed the Republican Congress last year. The President should seriously reconsider his veto threat so we can begin life-saving research.

That's right, Cheney does not want to play by the established rules of safeguarding classified national information. He is now saying that he is not actually a member of the executive branch. 
   If the Vice President is not a member of the executive branch, shouldn't he be forced to turn over information to the congressional Democrats requested regarding his secret energy task force? After all, Cheney used executive privilege as an excuse for his secrecy. 
   Also, why should the office of the Vice President receive funding through the bill that funds the executive branch? That bill is actually on the floor today, and the House Democrats will offer an amendment to remove funding for the Vice President's office from this bill. House Democrats are not going to support the Vice President's latest attempt to avoid any accountability to the American people.

Now a dangerous civil war is being waged with no end in sight. 
   The American military did its job. Military experts agree that there is no military solution to the war in Iraq. That is why this Congress approved an emergency supplemental bill last week that sent a strong message to the Iraqi Government that this is the time to get their political house in order.

   I have said before on this floor that I represent the two most dangerous miles in this country. I represent the tunnels, the Lincoln and the Holland Tunnels. I represent the ports, and I also represent the region which also has the largest repository of fuel on the east coast of this country. I represent part of Newark and Jersey City, which are both considered high threat areas. I know firsthand what it is like to have a district that deals with the threat of terrorism every day. That is why it's so important for my district, my State and the entire Nation that we extend TRIA in a way that ensures stabilization for all businesses across this country, as well as those in high-risk areas. 
   Last year, New York City created some 50,000 jobs. It is thought that in the next 10 years New York City could possibly create another 500,000 jobs. That is one of the reasons New Jersey and New York are talking about a new tunnel to bring people to fill some of those jobs, and they need this stability to know that these businesses can come into this city so those people can fill those jobs. And that's the engine not just for New York City or New Jersey but for the region and this country, quite frankly. 
   And I want to thank, at this time, Chairman Frank for his hard work on trying to form a compromise on this bill while holding true to important aspects of the TRIA legislation already passed by this House. It is important that any TRIA reauthorization legislation include reasonable trigger levels, group life insurance and a reset mechanism. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I just want to end by saying I came to this Congress not to follow in lockstep with the Senate. I came in to represent my district, not knowing that I would have to bow to the Senate.

   Frank Guarini was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, and has served his State and country in a variety of positions. Early in his career, he was commissioned as a Naval officer at Columbia University and went on to serve in the United States Navy aboard the USS Mount McKinley, receiving the Naval Commendation Medal and three battle stars during World War II. 
   In 1965, he was elected to the New Jersey State Senate where he served for the next 7 years. On January 3, 1979, he was elected to represent New Jersey's 14th Congressional District in the United States House of Representatives, completing seven terms before retiring in 1993. 
   As a member of the House Committee on Ways and Means, Frank Guarini was a true champion for education, serving as the chief sponsor of legislation that encouraged employers to provide educational assistance to its employees tax free. 
   Even after his retirement, Frank Guarini's commitment to education and public service has not wavered. In 1994, he established the Guarini Center for Government Affairs at St. Peter's College in Jersey City, New Jersey, which strives to provide a forum for nonpartisan discussion of public policy issues and encourages today's students to take up careers in public service. 
   A central part of the Guarini Center's mission is to promote critical thinking and debate among the next generation of leaders at its Annual High School Oratorical Contest. The event is open to all high school students in New Jersey and throughout the tri-State area and attracts more than 100 students from 75 schools to compete each year.

   Today, President Bush will spend more than $338 million in Iraq. What exactly does that mean for the taxpayer sending in his or her form today? The typical taxpayer covers the cost of the war in Iraq for only one-half a second. 
   And while we continue to ship billions of dollars to Iraq while our economy is going south and our budget deficit continues to hit record highs every year, the Iraqi government currently has a surplus and is expecting to receive $40 billion this year in oil revenues. Can someone please make sense of this policy? 
   Madam Speaker, the American taxpayer has every right to demand more accountability from Washington. Congressional Democrats continue to propose a change in policy, one that shifts more responsibility to the Iraqis themselves. They can certainly afford it.

   The new Democratic Congress refuses to ignore America's uninsured, and that is why we passed a budget last month that provides a significant increase in funding of the SCHIP program. The $50 billion increase in funding over the next 5 years would allow us to provide health care to millions of children who are currently uninsured.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, this week, Republicans must decide if they're going to support a bipartisan bill that provides health care for 4 million more children or if they're going to back a Bush administration plan that will leave 800,000 more children uninsured. 
   Today, the Children's Health Insurance Program ensures that 6 million children have access to private health insurance. 
   Earlier this year, President Bush proposed increasing CHIP funding by $5 billion over the next 5 years. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office concluded that this plan will result in 800,000 children losing their health coverage. 
   The President's proposal is unacceptable to many of us. Our bipartisan compromise bill allows us not only to insure all the children currently in this program, but also allows us to cover an additional 4 million children who are already eligible but not enrolled in CHIP. 
   Madam Speaker, House Republicans have a decision to make. I hope they stand up for 10 million children to help us override the President's veto.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a primary analysis of the President's fiscal 2008 budget and found that the administration would fall short of its claim of balancing the Federal budget by 2012 without raising taxes. This contradicts comments made by the President when he unveiled the budget last month and claimed that his budget will be balanced by 2012 without raising taxes. 
   According to the CBO report, the President's budget will run a $9 billion deficit just 5 years from now. That report also concludes that the President's budget will lead to higher taxes for millions of middle-class Americans. First, his budget only includes a 1-year tax fix for the alternative minimum tax, which will lead to a $247 billion tax increase on middle-class families over the next 5 years. Then the President's health care plan will result in a tax increase of $500 billion over the next 10 years on middle-class families. This is unacceptable. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time that the President levels with the American people about the budget that he proposed a month ago.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3307, a bill to designate the post office on Broadway in Bayonne, New Jersey, as the Dennis P. Collins Post Office. Mayor Collins is a legend in my congressional district for his long-time public service to the people of his community and the State of New Jersey. 
   Before entering elected public office, Mayor Collins served his country during World War II in the U.S. Army for 3 years, including time in the China-Burma and India theater of operations. In 1962, Mayor Collins won his first election to public life by serving on the Bayonne Municipal Council. He went on to serve two more terms, both as council president. 
   In 1974, Dennis Collins ran and won his first term as the mayor of Bayonne. Mayor Collins served in his role as mayor of Bayonne for the next 16 years before retiring in 1990. 
   Even though he no longer has an official position, Mayor Collins remains available to elected officials and citizens alike to advise and support. 
   As a former mayor in the same county as Mayor Collins, he served as a role model for me and many other mayors in the region. I always admired how Mayor Collins ran his city so efficiently, while never losing sight of the needs of his constituents. I see no better way to honor him today than by passing this bill to name this Bayonne Post Office after him so his legacy can continue in the city forever.

   Bishop Ralph E. Brower has dedicated more than 50 years of his life in service to the community of Jersey City, New Jersey. In 1954, he was called to build the St. Michael Methodist Church. He started the church with only six members, and served their parish as pastor for over 54 years. 
   In addition to his role as pastor, Bishop Brower served the Jersey City community in  many ways. His professional and ministerial accomplishments also include being president of the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance for 25 years; Hudson County Chaplain for 25 years; commissioner for the Jersey City Redevelopment for 5 years; and deputy mayor for 4 years. 
   With his lifetime of dedication to public service and ministry, Bishop Ralph E. Brower consistently illustrates his caring and commitment to the Jersey City community. 
   I am thrilled to celebrate this dedicated community leader through this legislation. I cannot think of better way to honor Bishop Brower's work then to designate a U.S. Postal Office in his name.

It has been over 5 years since that terrible day and we are still mourning for those who were lost. I can think of no better way to honor the memories of those who were lost and to honor those who were injured than to pass H.R. 1 today. 
   Two and half years ago the bipartisan 9/11 Commission released their report and submitted 41 recommendations to Congress. As of today, many of those recommendations have not been implemented and therefore we have not done everything we can to help secure our nation. 
   One of the most important recommendations is to change the distribution of homeland security funding for high risk States and regions. My district has been named one of the areas in the country that is most susceptible to terrorist attacks. The risk that we live with every day should warrant more federal funding in order to help ensure security. The cities and towns in my district need to know that they can count on funding for overtime, equipment, and all of the other demands that are put on our communities due to these threats.

   Mr. SIRES. I rise in support of this amendment. And this amendment, all it affords is a choice. 
   I want to thank Congresswoman Maloney for her hard work and leadership on this issue, and I appreciate some of the concerns that I had on this amendment. 
   Let me just share a personal story. Before coming to Congress, I was part owner of a title insurance agency, and I have taken out a couple of mortgages in my time. It is fair to say that I had more knowledge about mortgages than the average consumer, and certainly more than a first-time home buyer. Yet, when I sold my home, I sold my home for the reason to come to Congress, I was shocked to learn that I owed $7,500 as a prepayment penalty. The circumstances that I sold the home were the fact that I was elected to Congress, that I had to disassociate myself with the property. If I was surprised by this penalty, imagine how surprised someone with less experience and knowledge would be. That is why I strongly support this amendment. It  presents the consumer with the necessary information so they can make an appropriate choice for their family. 
   The amendment also recognizes that the market should have the flexibility to offer prepayment penalties, and that the secondary market must have confidence that the mortgages they buy and sell are more secure. 
   Our amendment does not prohibit prepayment penalties on prime mortgages, nor does it cap the penalties at unreasonable levels. The penalties allowed by this amendment conform to industry best practices. 
   And I said it before, I strongly support this amendment. It is friendly to consumers and business. It would only serve to improve all mortgage transactions, which will ensure that the mortgage market has some stability. 
   I encourage all my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, for 8 years now Washington Republicans have allowed Big Oil to run our Nation's energy policy. The result: record profits for oil companies and record gas prices at the pump for consumers. 
   All summer long, this Democratic Congress offered real solutions to provide drivers some relief. We proposed legislation to curb excessive speculation which would have reduced oil prices by $20 to $30 a barrel. House Republicans said no. We proposed legislation to tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. When the President's father took this action back in 1991, the price of oil immediately dropped $8 a barrel. But again, House Republicans said no. We also proposed legislation that forced Big Oil to begin drilling on the 68 million acres of land they already have leases for. House Republicans once again said no. 
   Mr. Speaker, the record gas prices of last year are a direct result of failed Republican policies. It is time they face the facts so that we can work together and fashion some real relief at the pump.

They claim that if we allowed big oil to drill more, gas prices would fall. What Republicans neglect to say is that the number of drilling permits increased dramatically over the last 5 years from 3,800 permits in 2002 to 7,500 last year. 
   That's right. Big oil is actually getting access to more land to drill, but is doing nothing to bring down the price of gas. Big oil has access to millions of acres of Federal land. But for some reason, they have yet to do any drilling. According to a new Natural Resources Committee report, oil and gas companies hold leases to nearly 68 million  acres of Federal land that they are not currently drilling. If big oil really wants to drill more, why aren't they drilling? 
   Madam Speaker, Washington Republicans are wrong again to rely on big oil to bring down the prices at the pump. After all, while American consumers battle these record prices, big oil is laughing all the way to the bank.

   This Democratic Congress recognizes the financial hardship these record prices are creating for everyone. That is why we have passed seven bills in the last couple of months to help lower prices. 
   We passed legislation in a strong, bipartisan fashion suspending sending more oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve until the end of the year, which will result in a 25 cents a gallon price reduction in July. We also passed legislation holding OPEC and big oil accountable for price fixing and cracking down on oil companies engaged in market manipulation.

   As a former mayor in New Jersey, I have a unique perspective of this program. Its impact on local communities is real and is positive. Beyond the obvious impact of cleaning up distressed public housing units and providing people with housing, HOPE VI generates economic activity in the community. New housing brings new residents. New residents bring new infrastructure and spurs new businesses. These new residents shop and dine and invest in their community. The new businesses hire employees, which has a positive impact on the economy. 
   The benefits of this program do not end there. Research indicates that HOPE VI increases per capita income of residents and decreases unemployment rates. That same research shows that this program decreases the number of households receiving public assistance and decreases violent crimes in surrounding communities. 
   A reauthorization of this HOPE VI is long overdue. I applaud the efforts of the chairman and Chairwoman Waters for bringing this to the floor today. 
   And I will share a story. I recently visited in Elizabeth, New Jersey, part of my district, a program of HOPE VI. I knew that area before, and the transformation is beyond. As I went there the other day, a new restaurant opened up. People were hired to work in that restaurant. So this program does work. Is it perfect? Nothing is perfect, but it certainly works.

   Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, with President Bush's veto last week, it is clear that if this Congress is going to take this war in a new direction, we need some of our Republican colleagues to join with us. Unfortunately, it seems that the House Republicans are still willing to blindly follow the President, no matter the facts in Iraq. 
   Consider this statement from Minority Leader Boehner over the weekend. He said, and I quote, ``We want a clean bill. We don't want artificial deadlines. We don't want artificial measures in there to try to ensure failure.'' 
   Let's not forget that the artificial measures that the minority leader is referring to were actually measures designed by President Bush himself to hold the Iraqi Government accountable. These are critical measures that will put the pressure on the Iraqi Government to make political, diplomatic and economic reforms. So far, none of these benchmarks have been met. 
   It is time that the House Republicans realize that the status quo is no longer acceptable to the American people. We have to keep pressure on the Iraqis to initiate these reforms and bring our troops home.

<DOCNO>Mr. SIRES. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4, the Medicare Prescription Drug Negotiation Act of 2007. A bidding process exists for contracts and other goods and services at every level of government. As a former Mayor, my experience tells me that bidding and negotiations almost always leads to lower prices, which in turn saves the government and, ultimately, the taxpayers money. 
   Today we have the opportunity to allow the government to negotiate and follow a purchasing process that is similar to the ones used by local and state governments as well as the Federal Government. Having already allowed Veterans Affairs this type of negotiation authority, there is no reason why Medicare should not have the same authorization. 
   I do not believe this authority is going to limit the choices for Medicare beneficiaries as some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have suggested. This legislation will not force the Secretary of Health and Human Services to restrict formularies and will not alter any of the current prescription drug plans. Rather H.R. 4 will help seniors get lower prices on prescription medications under Medicare and that is why I will vote for this bill today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 4.

<DOCNO>Mr. SIRES. (DEMOCRATS WORK TO STIMULATE ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, when Democrats took control of Congress last year, we vowed to work on behalf of all Americans. Last year, we recognized that middle-class families were struggling to make ends meet, and so we worked hard to ease that economic crunch. We passed billions of dollars in tax relief to middle-income families. We increased the minimum wage for the first time in a decade, and we enacted an energy bill that will save the average family anywhere between $700 and $1,000 a year in energy costs, and help families better afford college. 
   This is a good start, but as economic indicators continue to head in the wrong direction, we worked with the White House and House Republicans on an economic stimulus package that will provide a real and significant short-term boost to this economy. 
   The House bipartisan economic stimulus plan is the most progressive package this decade. It will help jump-start  our economy, and will provide real assistance to lower and middle-income families. I hope our friends in the Senate will act on this legislation this week.

<DOCNO>Mr. SIRES. (DR. JACK SMITH, A GREAT AMERICAN -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, I wanted to take a moment to recognize a great American, a constituent of mine from Bayonne, New Jersey, Dr. Jack Smith. 
   After seeing the second plane hit the World Trade Center on 9/11, Dr. Smith immediately left his Bayonne practice and went to help treat victims in Lower Manhattan. He said he felt the world had changed that day, and he decided to enlist in the Army Medical Reserve at the age of 49 years old. 
   Dr. Smith has since served two tours overseas. He was sent on his first tour to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan where he served in the 325th Combat Support Hospital Unit. His second tour was with the First Squadron of the 167th RSTA Cavalry Unit in Iraq. There he worked at the battalion aid station, the Air Force Theatre Hospital, and gave medical support for two intelligence gathering missions outside the wire. 
   When asked about managing his service, family, and practice, Dr. Smith says he's been blessed. I believe we are blessed to have individuals like Dr. Smith serving our country. His courage and service are an example to us all, and I want to thank him and his family for his service.

<DOCNO>Mr. SIRES. (FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SIRES. Mr. Chairman, I rise briefly to respectfully state my strong opposition to this amendment because I believe that we must not open our financial institutions to a state sponsor of terrorism like the Cuban regime.  
   The Rangel amendment has almost nothing to do with agricultural interests. In fact, it may actually cause harm to our agricultural community. What this amendment does do is threaten our national security. This amendment allows the Cuban Regime, a state sponsor of terrorism, access to U.S. financial institutions and allows its agents access to U.S. visas. 
   If adopted, the Rangel amendment will legitimize the Cuban Regime and provide them with the opportunity to continue its sponsorship of terrorism. It will also provide high level regime officials access to U.S. visas to travel throughout the United States. At a time when our country has declared a war on terror and we have worked to cut the flow of money to terrorists and terrorists access to our financial institutions, we must not open our financial institutions to help finance state sponsors of terrorism. By adopting this amendment, we will be doing just that, rewarding the Cuban Regime and supporting the financing of a state sponsor of terrorism. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. SIRES. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution on behalf of the 32,000 men and women from my State of New Jersey, and all the other servicemen and women that have been deployed since 9/11. I am so proud of their sacrifice and service to our Nation, and I will continue and always support them. After all, I am standing in front of you as a product of the sacrifices our soldiers have made in the name of liberty and freedom throughout the history of this country. 
   I also rise on behalf of my constituents, the people of New Jersey, and the people of this Nation whose tax dollars are paying for this war in Iraq. Since the beginning of the war, $379 billion has been appropriated. Another $235 billion is slated for the upcoming supplemental appropriations. We are currently spending $8 billion a month in Iraq, and the American people are footing the bill. 
   All this money could have been used to declare war on some of our domestic problems here at home such as poverty, improving our schools, ensuring access to health care and investing in affordable housing. This money could have been used to invest in our children, our family, our veterans, and especially our elderly. But it wasn't. 
   Instead, American taxpayers have also committed more than $38 billion  to Iraq reconstruction. About 33 percent of this money is targeted for infrastructure projects like roads, sanitation, water, electric power and oil production. However, I am concerned that only 25 percent of the Iraqi population has access to drinkable water.     
   I am concerned that of the 136 sanitation and water projects, only 49 are said to be completed. I am concerned that the residents of Baghdad only have 4 1/2 hours of electricity per day. And I am concerned that the current oil production in Iraq is half of what it was prior to the war. 
   Since the reconstruction project started, the Coalition Provisional Authority can't account for almost $9 billion of the taxpayers' money. Every year, $4 billion has been lost because of lack of oversight. 
   There have also been many problems with poor project and quality management. For example, the Baghdad Police College cost $75 million, and it was built without the proper plumbing for waste water. It has become a health and a structural hazard. The Basrah Children's Hospital is running $48 million over budget and is a year behind schedule. And after spending $186 million, Parsons has only 6 of the 150 planned health care centers completed and only 14 more will be finished. The list goes on and on. 
   Madam Speaker, the Iraqi Government says $100 billion is needed over the next 4 years to rebuild the country's infrastructure. Madam Speaker, the Iraqi Government seems to think they have open access to U.S. dollars. The Iraqi Government and the Iraqi people must take responsibility and help rebuild their country. Our support is not open-ended, and neither are our tax dollars. 
   Madam Speaker, I support this resolution and this debate because our troops and our constituents can no longer afford to have this Congress support the administration's failed Iraqi policies. They failed to give us the necessary oversight for Iraq reconstruction efforts, they failed to listen to the advice of the military commanders, they failed to listen to the American people, and, as a result, they failed to provide a plan to success in Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. SIRES. (HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SIRES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for all your hard work on this bill. 
   I rise today in support of H.R. 3221, the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008. This amendment is very important for a number of reasons. 
   First, this amendment aims to stimulate and increase consumer spending in the mortgage market by creating a new standard deduction for State and local real estate taxes paid for those who do not itemize, and it provides a refundable tax credit for first time home buyers. 
   Second, this amendment provides assistance to all who are looking for a place to call home. It does not forget those who are less fortunate, those who can not afford to buy a home. The permanent affordable housing trust fund will ensure that all Americans have access to a safe and stable place to call home, even those who rent. This amendment also helps those who are looking to buy a home by bolstering the ability of FHA to guarantee more mortgages. 
   Finally, by strengthening and consolidating existing regulatory authorities and giving the Treasury Department new authority, the American taxpayer can have faith that they will not have to bear the weight of future housing financing problems. I urge everyone to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. SIRES. (NATIONAL HIGHWAY BRIDGE RECONSTRUCTION AND INSPECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3999, the National Highway Bridge Reconstruction and Inspection Act. Maintaining our infrastructure, especially our bridges, is vital to enhancing our economy, improving our quality of life, and most importantly protecting the safety of our constituents. I thank Chairman Oberstar for introducing this important legislation and for his leadership in maintaining our Nation's infrastructure. 
   My district is highly impacted by the structural integrity of our bridges. They provide the necessary infrastructure to support one of the largest ports in the U.S. with more than 25 million tons of cargo moving through the port each year. Most importantly, these bridges serve millions of people who travel on them to and from New York City each year. 
   In response to the tragic 1-35-W bridge collapse in Minneapolis, Minnesota, New Jersey undertook an extensive review of bridges and identified the improvements required to bring all of the State's structurally deficient bridges to a state of good repair. This bill will help to further that initiative and increase the safety of our bridges. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Jersey City Fire Department. On September 19, the department received a 2008 Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award, right here in Washington, D.C., for supporting our Guard and Reserve. 
   For deployments of 12 months, the fire department continues all benefits for servicemembers and their families, as well as full pay for deployments of up to 6 months. They have also shown a tremendous personal generosity by collecting $6,000 in phone cards to send to their coworkers and units serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. They also collect gifts during the holidays for the children of servicemembers and help families that are falling on tough times during the deployment. 
   I am so proud of the Jersey City Fire Department's dedication to their coworkers, our community, our Guard and Reserve, and our country. They are very deserving of this high honor.

<DOCNO>Mr. SIRES. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SIRES. Mr. Chairman, the funding that has been provided over the past 10 years to support the pro-democracy movement in Cuba has been working. U.S. assistance has provided books, newsletters and other informational material to the people of Cuba,  as well as over 385,000 pounds of medicine, food and clothing. 
   According to a USAID report, U.S. assistance has a lso funded journalism correspondence courses for more than 200 Cubans, and the publication of about 23,000 reports by independent Cuban journalists about conditions and events in Cuba. 
   Although the Cuban regime restricts nearly all political dissent, and denies its citizens the basic rights of free expression, association and assembly, our funding and assistance has allowed the pro-democracy and civil resistance movement in Cuba to dramatically increase in recent years. 
   As evidenced in this chart, fro m just 2004 to 2005 there was a 54 percent increase in the number of civil resistance actions reported on the island. Some of these civil resistance acts include citizens unwilling to cooperate with regime officials in repressing pro-democracy activities, and citizens boycotting regime control meetings and mass gatherings. 
   By supporting this amendment, the pro-democracy movement in Cuba can continue to organize, communicate their vision for the future of the Cuban people, and prepare to assume the role i n the process of democratic transition. 
   But it is also important to realize that Cuba now is at the same stage that Spain was many years ago when they had a dictator for 40 years. The world looked to Spain and saw that many of the institutions promoting democracy prevailed. If we don't work to promote dissidents who are pro-democratic dissidents in Cuba, we're not going to have any institution when the changes for a Cuban democratic island will exist.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SIRES. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Lowey amendment. 
   This amendment would clarify existing language in the Foreign Operations bill that would onl y, and I repeat, only allow for NGOs to receive U.S.-donated contraceptives. This amendment makes it clear that only contraceptives will be donated and made available to millions of men and women around the world. Not funding. 
   By increasing global contraceptive supplies, this will help many women and men overseas plan their families, protect against sexually transmitted diseases, and minimize at-risk pregnancies. 
   Mr. Chairman, since the administration reinstated this policy in 2001, 20 nations have stopped receiving U.S. shipments of contraceptives. Women and children in these countries often suffer from high maternal and child mortality rates because of a lack of adequate health care and access to family planning. I believe we must give hope to these women and families by providing them with the contraceptives they need to make their own decisions regarding their families. And I also think it is essential to provide individuals with the tools they need to protect themselves against the spread of HIV/ AIDS. 
   I rise in support, and I urge all the Members to support this amendment.
