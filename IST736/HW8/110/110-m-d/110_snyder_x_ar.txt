<DOCNO>Mr. SNYDER. (RECONSTRUCTION AND STABILIZATION CIVILIAN MANAGEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SNYDER. Mr. Speaker, people in Arkansas want to be safe and they want to feel safe. Everyone in America wants to be safe and have a strong national defense. National security means a strong military. National security also means that all the tools in our tool box must be available, including the capacity and availability of the civilian side of our government. 
   Mr. Farr has been leading this charge, along with Mr. Saxton, and I appreciate the great work of Mr. Berman stepping into his new role, to bring forth this issue that all the tools of U.S. strength must be available. As Mrs. DAVIS was pointing out, we have a lot of work to do beyond this bill in terms of the coordination of all our different agencies.  
   I was talking to one of my constituents who is a civilian working in Iraq, and she said, You know, I sometimes think the differences in conflicts between the agencies of the U.S. Government are greater than the differences between us and the Iraqis. I think that really brings home the issues and challenges that we have. 
   But this bill today is a great step towards making sure that we have all the tools in our tool box that we need for our national security, and I applaud its passage today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SNYDER. Mr. Speaker, people in Arkansas who knew of Judge Richard Arnold admired and respected his great legal mind, his integrity, and his remarkable attributes as a human being. Everyone who personally knew him liked him. Not even those who disagreed with him found fault with his judicial demeanor nor his legal analysis. 
   Now we have an opportunity to honor this great man. Tomorrow in Little Rock will be the formal dedication of the Richard Sheppard Arnold United States Courthouse, a wonderful new facility. Not only will this building be a great site for justice in central Arkansas, but it will be a lasting tribute to Judge Arnold. And on this day also we honor his wonderful wife, Kay Kelley Arnold, who will be in attendance at tomorrow's dedication.

<DOCNO>Mr. SNYDER. (RECOGNIZING 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL ARKANSAS -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SNYDER. Madam Speaker, pending before the House today is H. Res. 436, recognizing the 100th anniversary of the University of Central Arkansas. 
   Every citizen of Conway, Arkansas, and Faulkner County, Arkansas, takes great pride in the long history of contribution of UCA to our Nation. Noteworthy in this year of celebration is the fact that UCA currently has more than 100 undergraduate courses of study, 33 master degree programs, and three doctoral programs. 
   Noteworthy also is the fact that UCA currently serves over 12,300 students from all 75 counties in Arkansas, from 35 States, and over 55 countries. Over 52,000 students have graduated from UCA throughout its history, including 1,008 in the spring of 2007. UCA established one of the Nation's first honors colleges. 
   The history of UCA is an interesting one. On May 14, 1907, State Senator Otis sponsored legislation establishing the Arkansas State Normal School. Many of UCA's buildings were built during the Great Depression. After the United States entered World War II, the administration of UCA offered the military its physical plant to assist in the training of military personnel. The president of UCA, Dr. Nolen Irby, and chairman of the UCA board visited Washington and made the offer, and the military agreed. Soon after the offer was accepted, UCA, at that time being called the Arkansas State Teachers College, became home to temporary branches of the Army Reserves, the Naval Cadets, and the Army Air Reserve. And for a short time, the headquarters of the Arkansas National Guard Unit, the 153rd Infantry, was housed on its campus. The Naval cadets and Army Air Reservists were trained in courses related to aviation and took their flying instruction at the local airport. 
   The largest contingent on campus was the Women's Army Corps Branch No. 3. WAC Branch No. 3 was home to 1,800 women between March of 1943 and March 1944. It was one of seven temporary WAC branches in the Nation. The WACs were trained to take the place of a male who was in a noncombat position. They were housed in Bernard Hall and would arrive in classes every 6 to 8 weeks in groups of varying numbers. The first classes were the largest and numbered close to 300. Toward the end of their training in the winter of 1943 and 1944, each class numbered less than 100. 
   There were so many military personnel on the campus of Arkansas State Teachers College in 1943 and 1944 that the Governor of the State, Homer Adkins, wanted to change the name of Arkansas State Teachers College to MacArthur Military College. However, the president of the campus, Dr. Nolen Irby, convinced Governor Adkins that the military personnel on campus would be temporary and the college would return to normal when the war was over. 
   While all of the military units mentioned above were training on the Arkansas State Teachers College campus, the college continued to serve as an institution of higher education and educate those students enrolled in classes. 
   Apparently, Arkansas State Teachers College did its job well in educating military personnel. Out of 85 colleges in the Nation engaged in war-training programs, Arkansas State Teachers College ranked seventh overall. In aviation, aerology and ship recognition, ASTC was first in the Nation, and third in the Nation in navigation. 
   Some of the distinguished alumni that have graduated from UCA: Dr. Wesley Burks was the 2005 UCA Distinguished Alumnus. He is now professor and head of the Division of Allergy and Immunology in the Department of Pediatrics at Duke University Medical School; 
   Ray Simon, the 2006 UCA Distinguished Alumnus, is the current Deputy Secretary of Education and plays a pivotal role overseeing and managing the development of policies, recommendations and initiatives that help define a broad, coherent vision for achieving the President's educational priorities, especially No Child Left Behind; 
   Bill Stiritz, the 2004 Distinguished Alumnus, was the CEO of Ralston Purina Company from 1982 to 1997 and is still on their board; 
   Monte Coleman, the Distinguished Alumnus of 1999, was a football walk-on in 1975 because of very little high school ball due to an injury and went on to play 16 seasons with the Washington Redskins and was a pivotal part of three of the Redskins' Super Bowl victories.     
   In 1996, a distinguished alumnus was Scotty Pippin. He actually graduated in December 2001. He was one of the most versatile and talented players in  basketball and was a big part of the Chicago Bulls' six NBA championship teams in the 1990s. 
   I also want to recognize the current president, Lu Hardin, for all the work that he is currently doing to make UCA one of the great, great institutions currently in higher education in the United States, and we all look forward to the 200th anniversary, 100 years from now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SNYDER. Mr. Speaker, pending before this body June 5, 1941, Mr. Speaker, was a debate on the war in Europe. Everyone listened as Representative John Elliott of Mississippi delivered yet another unfortunate anti-Semitic diatribe. Not even the events of Hitler's rise to power stopped him. Not even knowing there were six Jewish Members of the House stopped him. 
   When he was done, New York Congressman Mike Edelstein jumped to his feet and responded to this diatribe of anti-Semitism and he said the following words: ``I deplore the idea that men in this House attempt to use the Jews as their scapegoat. I say it is unfair and I say it is un-American. All men are created equal, regardless of race, creed or color, and whether a man be Jew or Gentile, he may think what he deems fit.'' 
   Those were the words of Mike Edelstein, June 5, 1941. He left this podium, went into the Speaker's Lobby and died of a heart attack, and I wanted to recognize this on the anniversary of his passing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SNYDER. Mr. Speaker, prayers and praise for our men and women in uniform do not fulfill our responsibilities to provide for the common defense. Every military family deserves the support of every American, and we act today in this Defense bill to provide that support. 
   No Defense bill is perfect. No Defense bill finishes the work. But this Congress comes together today in a bipartisan manner with a good bill. 
   Three quick points. First of all, I want to thank Mr. Skelton and Mr. Hunter for their leadership and the work that they have done on this year's Defense bill. I also want to acknowledge the presence of Mr. Saxton, who has announced his retirement and is in his last term and is providing leadership today, as he often does, of this committee. 
   Second, I am very pleased to see the improvements in the GI Bill for our Reserve component members. It has been grossly unfair that some of our Reserve component members have not been able to get GI Bill benefits when they have left the service. 
   And, third, thanks to Mr. McHugh and Mrs. Davis and others, we have very good provisions in this bill, the so-called Wounded Warrior provisions, that will make life easier for those of our men and women in uniform who are hurt or become ill overseas.

   Mr. SNYDER. Madam Speaker, proclamations and commemorations are a wonderful part of the job that we are honored to have. Elevation of certain historic events so that they are remembered and respected, particularly by our young people, is so important. 
   No one in Arkansas is unaware of the significance of the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School in 1957. No one in America should be unaware of the courage of the Little Rock Nine. That courage is celebrated in one of the two commemorative coins that are part of the U.S. Mint collection this year. 
   Now, I come here this morning to let you know if you don't have your order in by December 14, which is the end of this week, you won't be able to order the coins from usmint.gov, or call 1-800-USA MINT. For you folks on the Hill, the Mint is having their annual Holiday Hill coin sale in Rayburn 2220, where you can buy this coin, and also the wonderful coin sponsored by the late Representative Jo Ann Davis honoring the 400th anniversary of Jamestown.

<DOCNO>Mr. SNYDER. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SNYDER. Personally, Mr. Speaker, I wish this resolution of disapproval articulated our disapproval of the administration's failure to accomplish certain chores in preparation for our fine troops undertaking this new mission under General Petraeus. 
   Everyone, including the President, now acknowledges mistakes over the past 4 years, but those well-documented errors are not the mistakes I am talking about. Now, today, mistakes are being made. Now, today, high-ranking officials in the administration fall short in their performance. 
   Why, after 4 years of the Iraq war, is the Secretary of State unable to get the appropriate reconstruction, economic development, and other necessary personnel to Iraq? Why did the State Department recently have to request the Defense Department to help fill in these necessary positions? Why have the efforts of political reconciliation been so ineffective? Why has the American diplomatic effort in the region been so ineffective? Where are the trained police and judges who will need to deal with all the detainees to be arrested in Baghdad? Why aren't an adequate number of property detention facilities not available for these future detainees that are sure to come from an aggressive effort to decrease the violence in Baghdad? 
   General Petraeus, clearly one of America's finest military leaders, during his recent opening statement before the Senate Armed Services Committee, felt an obligation to plead for the help and commitment from other U.S. government agencies commensurate with what our troops give 24 hours a day, day after day, week after week, month after month. 
   I have had references being made to Winston Churchill, but I remind those speakers who make such comparisons that we are not a parliamentary system. If we were, the Secretary of State and other high-ranking officials would be gone because of their failures. We are, thankfully, the American system; and in our responsibility to support our troops, we know we must not just equip and train them. We know that all agencies of American government, the nonmilitary agencies, must pull their load if our fine troops are to be successful. 
   So we now have a situation where our new commander on the ground, General Petraeus, says he needs the additional troops. On the other hand, he says he needs all the other agencies of government to step forward with, in his words, ``an enormous commitment.'' 
   It is clear this commitment of other agencies is not yet being made. Regardless of the result of this vote today, our troops will still be in Iraq needing the commitment of all government agencies. 
   The House leadership has stated that this resolution today is the first step of other legislation to come. This other legislation to come must address the issues of the shortcomings of other agencies of U.S. government, the nonmilitary agencies of U.S. government. Our troops deserve the help.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SNYDER. Madam Chairman, let me begin by thanking Chairman IKE SKELTON for the work that he has done on this bill. 
   As we can tell by the tone already, there has been a strong spirit of bipartisanship in putting this bill together. Both Ranking Member Duncan HUNTER and Chairman IKE SKELTON have worked very closely together to make this the kind of bill we want in time of war. 
   And, IKE, I just want to say Susie would be proud of the work that you have done on this bill. 
   I also want to thank my colleague, JOHN MCHUGH, the Congressman from New York, for the work that he has done and continues to do year after year. And as many of you know, his district includes Fort Drum that has done more than its fair share of sacrifice in this war in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the war on terrorism. 
   And, finally, a note about the staff. We all can talk about working together in a bipartisan manner, but for us it might mean just shaking hands as we go up and down the aisles. For the staff it is day in and day out, and I think they have done a great job of working together and trying to understand each other's concerns as this bill has come together; and I think the product reflects their great, great work. 
   As somebody who spent 12 months and 20 days in Vietnam a long, long time ago at a time then also of a great foreign policy debate in our country, what I see in this body and in America today is something that a lot of us felt was lacking those 35 or 40 years ago. There is just this strong love of our troops and their families by the American people and by this Congress. And we recognize the need for a strong, well-trained, well-equipped military. And we have never forgotten the importance of families, the importance of families to our men and women in uniform. 
   I think of one of my employees, who spent a year in Iraq, and he told me when he came home the first time for R&R and he had two young children, he came off the plane and he had about a 150-yard walk down the aisle there in the airport, and he could not stop himself. He ran that last 150 yards so he could see his children that he had not seen in several months. And yet we know the sacrifices that our families bear. 
   So because of that, I think we have a lot of good things in this bill, whether it is dealing with medical care, TRICARE, the GI bill. I think it is a good, strong, bipartisan bill, and I appreciate all the work that the staff and Members have done.

<DOCNO>Mr. SNYDER. (2007 COMMEMORATIVE COINS: LITTLE ROCK CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL DESEGREGATION AND JAMESTOWN 400TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SNYDER. Mr. Speaker, public attention 50 years ago, in 1957, was on Little Rock, Arkansas. Everyone in the United States knew of the events that were going on at Little Rock Central High School and in the streets surrounding Little Rock Central High School. 
   Now this year we celebrate the courage of the Little Rock Nine. Now this year, 2007, we commemorate those events, the desegregation of September 25, 1957, very much aware of the work that we have to do in race relations. 
   As part of the honoring of these events and the honoring of the courage of the brave Little Rock Nine, this Congress passed a commemorative coin bill. We authorize two commemorative coins each year. The commemorative coin I want to show the Members, it is a beautiful coin. Now, the real coin is not this big. It's a silver dollar. It is a commemorative coin. While it is legal tender, you would not want to use it for legal tender because it costs substantially more than a dollar. 
   This is the one side. Each star honors one of the Little Rock Nine, the nine stars. And these footprints show young people going to school with no other desire than to get an education. And it says: ``Desegregation in Education, 2007, In God We Trust.''  
   On the other side of the coin is the Little Rock Central High School itself, one of the most beautiful high schools in the United States, and it is noted there: ``Little Rock Central High School.'' 
   Now, the reason I show this coin to the Members on the floor tonight is this coin is currently available for sale at the U.S. Mint, usmint.gov. And for those of you who need some help, go to usmint.gov and then go to the section that says ``Coins and Medals'' and click on that and click on ``Commemoratives,'' and you can find out how to order this beautiful coin. 
   Also available at usmint.gov is the other 2007 coin that was brought by the late Representative Jo Ann Davis, a much beloved Member of this body who recently passed away. That coin honors the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown in 1607. 
   So we have two wonderful commemorative coins: this one honoring the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School by the Little Rock Nine in 1957 and the 400th anniversary of Jamestown. 
   Now, what many people may not realize is $10 of every sale of each coin goes to support these historic sites, and that is why I am down here tonight, Mr. Speaker, encouraging people to go to usmint.gov and order these coins to tell the legacy, to pass a legacy on, to tell the stories. They make wonderful holiday gifts this year, but they also just make wonderful gifts from people to younger people to remember the legacy and the courage of the Little Rock Nine, usmint.gov. 
   I also want to acknowledge this evening in Little Rock, Arkansas, the presence of Kevin Klose, the present president of National Public Radio. Right now he is at a reception at the home of Don and Suzanne Hamilton in Little Rock, Arkansas. They are my neighbors across the street. They are great members of the Friends of KLRE/KUAR. Unfortunately, I can't be there. I believe my wife is ill and can't be there. But I wish them well and welcome Kevin Klose to Arkansas.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SNYDER. Mr. Speaker, passion for collecting things as children is something that we have all gone through. Each of us has perhaps collected coins or stamps. Not everyone collects stamps, not everyone collects coins, not everyone collects insects; but all of us appreciate the value of courage. And I rise tonight, Mr. Speaker, to talk about a coin that is now available for sale on the usmint.gov Web site, the commemorative coin honoring the bravery and courage and great public service of the Little Rock Nine, the nine African American students that desegregated Little Rock Central High School in 1957. This year is the 50th anniversary of their service. 
   This side of the coin depicts a group of school children going to school with no other purpose than to get educated and act like kids. We sometimes forget that the Little Rock Nine 50 years ago were kids. They were children, demonstrating great bravery in trying to overcome the obstacles imposed by adults. And the coin on this side says ``Liberty.'' The nine stars are to represent the Little Rock Nine. And it says: ``Desegregation in Education, 2007, In God We Trust.'' 
   The reverse side of this coin, it is a $1 coin, depicts Little Rock Central High School itself. It is still considered one of the Nation's most beautiful high schools. 
   As you know, Mr. Speaker, each year the Congress may authorize two commemorative coins. One of the coins that we authorize for sale during calendar year 2007 is this coin honoring the 50th anniversary of the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School. The other one was by the late Representative Jo Ann Davis of Virginia honoring the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, our beloved colleague Jo Ann Davis, who recently passed away. Both coins tell a wonderful story. 
   I encourage the Members and encourage the public to go to the usmint.gov Web site and consider purchasing these coins as holiday presents, as a way to pass on the legacy of the story of the bravery of these nine students desegregating Little Rock Central High School. 
   One of the reasons I am interested in these coins being purchased at the usmint.gov Web site is because $10 of  every coin purchased goes to support telling that story of Little Rock Central High School. It is now a national historic site. The school is still functioning, one of the great robust high schools in Arkansas. There is a national park visitors center there. The gas station that was there in 1957 has been restored across the street. So many ways to this story, but they can always use more money. There have been about 160,000 or so of these coins sold, and $10 of every coin goes to help tell this story. 
   And this is a beautiful coin. When you see the coin itself, it's just exquisite in the detail. It is a silver dollar and they make wonderful presents. But, more importantly, they make a wonderful way of telling the legacy and telling the story of the bravery and courage of these nine children that are now adults, in their 60s, who overcame the prejudices that involved segregation of schools in 1957.

<DOCNO>Mr. SNYDER. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SNYDER. Power, Mr. Chairman, is the goal of a good defense bill for this country. Every nation wants to be powerful enough to keep safe. Not every dispute, however, is resolved by military power, not every hope for the future is achieved by military power. Power is more than just military power. It's economic, diplomatic, the moral authority that a nation has. 
   Secretary Robert Gates, our Secretary of Defense, has done, I think, two very admirable things as Secretary of Defense. One, he has restored the confidence in the decision-making process in the Pentagon. Second, he has pointed to the broad aspects of power for this country. We are all very familiar with his speech to Kansas State back in November of last year, in which he called for dramatic increases, not in the Defense Department, but dramatic increases in the State Department, dramatic increases in budget, dramatic increases in staff. 
   He called for the staff and funding for the USAID, the Agency for International Development. Mr. Skelton arranged for Secretary Gates and Secretary Rice to testify before our full Armed Services Committee on the importance of interagency communication and collaboration, not just within the Pentagon, but between the State Department and the Defense and USAID and the other agencies in the government because it is important to our national defense, to our overall concept of power, not just military power. 
   Well, this bill contains some provisions that deal with some of these issues. First of all, some time ago this body, the House, passed H.R. 1084, Representative SAM FARR's bill, that came out of the Foreign Affairs Committee. It deals with the whole issue of establishing a Civilian Reserve Board to deal with the fact that we sometimes need civilian employees to go into areas of instability and even of war. But we haven't been able to have the kind of personnel we wanted and the numbers in the time that we need. 
   So we passed this bill, but it's been hung up in the Senate by one Senator. So just by unanimous agreement of the Democrats and Republicans on the Armed Services Committee and with the consent and advocacy of Mr. Berman, that was included as part of this bill, unchanged from how it was passed before, and so it will now have a second chance to go to the Senate and be passed. 
   I am also looking forward to the fact that tomorrow, Mr. Skelton, along with Mr. Berman and Ms. LOWEY, will be introducing an amendment that will establish a standing advisory panel on improving integration between the Department of Defense, Department of State, and the United States Agency for International Development on matters of national security. 
   I will always remember one of my constituents, a veterinarian from Arkansas, who served in both Afghanistan and then a year in Iraq. She sent me an e-mail about halfway through her year in Iraq, in which she said, and we were talking about this issue of interagency cooperation, she said, I sometimes think and feel that the differences in divisions between the agencies of the United States Government are greater than the differences between us and the Iraqis. That is saying something in terms of inhibiting our ability to have the kind of national defense we want. So I applaud Mr. Berman and Mr. Skelton and Ms. LOWEY for doing this amendment. 
   This bill is about military families, it's about our men and women in uniform. We do a lot of things in this bill for military families in great detail. But it's also time for this country, and I hope it will occur in our Presidential debate that will be going on over the next several months, but it certainly needs to occur in this Congress and in our committee. It's time to step back and look at the big picture. What should the grand national security strategy involving all components of our power, and all the threats out there, what should the grand strategy be for this country to face and achieve over the next 5 years and 10 years and 15 and 20 years. Chairman Skelton and I and Subcommittee Chairman AKIN and I have been talking about these issues and hope to start some efforts to look at these big pictures. 
   Finally, I want to commend both Chairman Skelton, but the three Republican Members that are leaving us. DUNCAN HUNTER, who, when former Chairman Floyd Spence was ill, stepped in as the acting chairman with a great generous spirit and in a very graceful manner to take over for our beloved and ailing Floyd Spence, and then also serve with distinction as chairman, and perhaps partly because of his fine military service as a young man. Mr. Everett, we will be missing his contributions. 
   I finally want to say a word about JIM SAXTON of New Jersey because I was his ranking member when I think it was Speaker Hastert established a panel on terrorism.     
   Before there was ever a September 11, 2001, Jim Saxton was leading a series of  classified briefings and hearings on the threat of terrorism and the threat of al Qaeda, long before any of us learned to pronounce the phrase ``al Qaeda,'' and I commend him for the work that he has done. I would just say that I think this is a great bill and applaud the work.

<DOCNO>Mr. SNYDER. (HONORING SCIPIO A. JONES -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SNYDER. People throughout America, Madam Speaker, celebrate our heroes of the Civil Rights Movement. Every American knows of the great contributions of Martin Luther King. No Arkansan celebrates these heroes without celebrating the Little Rock Nine. No Arkansan remembers these heroes without remember Daisy Bates. 
   I recently introduced a bill to remember another noteworthy Arkansan who is not as well known as he deserves to be, Scipio A. Jones. Scipio A. Jones contributed to moving Arkansas and our Nation forward, and I am pleased that earlier today the House adopted this measure, H.R. 433, to designate the facility at 1700 Main Street in Little Rock as the Scipio A. Jones Post Office Building. 
   His is the life of which movies should be made, Madam Speaker. Scipio Africanus Jones was born a slave in Dallas County, Arkansas in 1863. He moved to Little Rock, Arkansas in the 1880s, took preparatory courses at Philander Smith College and graduated from North Little Rock's Bethel University, now Shorter College, with a Bachelor's Degree in 1887. 
   Jones apprenticed to practicing attorneys and was accepted into the Arkansas Bar in 1889. He was admitted to the Supreme Court of Arkansas in 1900, to the U.S. District Court for the Western Division of the Eastern District of Arkansas and the U.S. Circuit Court for Arkansas in 1901, the U.S. Supreme Court in 1905 and the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1914. 
   In 1915 and 1924, Jones was appointed as a special judge to preside over cases when the regular judge had been incapacitated. 
   He was the National Attorney General for the Mosaic Templars of America, an international fraternal organization headquartered in Little Rock, Arkansas which provided services to African Americans in an era when discrimination resulted in few basic services being readily available. The location of the Post Office we will designate is less than a mile away from the Mosaic Templars headquarters. 
   On a visit to Little Rock, Arkansas by Treasury Secretary W.G. McAdoo during World War I, Scipio A. Jones personally wrote a check to purchase $50,000 worth of Liberty bonds to support the Allied cause in World War I, and soon thereafter raised another $50,000 for this effort. 
   He was honored by President Woodrow Wilson, who appointed him to the National Advisory Board to the Liberty Bond effort. 
   He opposed and helped defeat grandfather clause legislation that some southerners were seeking to add to the Arkansas Constitution to disenfranchise and prevent African American voter participation. 
   In the aftermath of the Elaine Massacre of 1919, which resulted in the deaths of five Caucasians and an estimated 856 African Americans, Scipio A. Jones garnered national attention with the successful defense of 12 sharecroppers who had been condemned to death and by securing the release of nearly 100 other Elaine defendants who had been sent to prison. 
   The legal work of Jones ultimately resulted in the case of Moore v. Dempsey being argued before the United States Supreme Court, which found that mob-dominated trials were a violation of the due process clause of the 14th amendment to the Constitution. 
   He was widely respected by people of all races in the central Arkansas community. He died on March 28, 1943 and is buried at Haven of Rest Cemetery in Little Rock.      
   I am pleased that this designation will acknowledge the lifelong service of Scipio A. Jones as a civic leader, talented lawyer, skillful jurist and civil rights leader and for his remarkable courage and notable contributions to the advancement of social justice. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Waxman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee for bringing H.R. 433 to the floor, and Denise Wilson of that committee for assistance in moving it forward. I also thank Representative Lynch and Representative Shays for the kind words they offered during debate on the bill today, as well as James Savage, of my staff, for his work on this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. SNYDER. (WELCOMING REV. GINGER GAINES-CIRELLI -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SNYDER. Madam Speaker, a couple of years ago, at a time when the House was in session through the weekend, a group of us lonely, forlorn Members during the Christmas season on a Sunday morning ended up in the pews of the Capitol Hill United Methodist Church to be greeted warmly by our guest chaplain today, Rev. Ginger Gaines-Cirelli, and her husband. It was the only time I've heard a sermon in which the phrase, during the Christmas season, ``preggers by God'' was used. 
   We were delighted by her sermon, delighted by her warmth, and she is here with us today. She is a graduate of Southwestern University of Georgetown, Texas, received her master of divinity from Yale Divinity School. She has done church work all of her professional life. Her previous head pastoring job was in Rockville, Maryland. And she has now, for 7 years, with her husband, been the head pastor of the Capitol Hill United Methodist Church. We are very fortunate today to have Rev. Ginger Gaines-Cirelli as our guest pastor.

<DOCNO>Mr. SNYDER. (HONORING THE LIFE OF LOUIS JORDAN ON THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS BIRTH -- (House of Representatives - June 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SNYDER. Proudly today, Madam Speaker, the House of Representatives solutes another great American, acknowledging the contributions of a remarkable man to our great country. 
   Entertainers reflect the rich history of America, and their stories, their personal stories, tell our story. No more worthy among these is Arkansas native Louis Jordan, a musician, songwriter, entertainer, and even movie performer. Nothing could stifle this remarkably talented man, not racial bigotry or upbringing a century ago in rural Arkansas. 
   Louis Jordan was born July 8, 1908, in Brinkley, Arkansas, and in the late 1920s he attended Arkansas Baptist College where I live, in Little Rock, Arkansas, and majored in music. He became a songwriter, performer, and movie actor. He actively recorded for the Armed Forces Radio Service and the V-Disc program during World War II, and one of his songs recorded during this period, ``G.I. Jive,'' was number one on both the R&B and Pop charts. He appeared in soundies, which were short musical films in the 1940s displayed on coin-operated film jukeboxes, and played cameo roles in movies like ``Follow the Boys'' and ``Swing Parade'' of 1946. 
   Previous speakers have acknowledged some of his remarkable accomplishments: the ``Saturday Night Fish Fry'' recording of 1949, which many say was the first rock and roll song; his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland in 1987; and in 2004 being named one of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time by Rolling Stone Magazine. 
   I am pleased that the House today will pass this resolution, but in some ways we don't get the full flavor of his accomplishments and the richness of the heritage of what he did without talking specifically about these songs. Let me go through the list of hits briefly here today. 
   His career began in the early days of World War II, some dark years for America. The 1942 hits included ``I'm Gonna Leave You on the Outskirts of Town'' and ``What's the Use of Getting Sober (When You Gonna Get Drunk Again).'' 
   In 1943: ``The Chicks I Pick are Slender and Tender and Tall,'' ``Five Guys Named Moe,'' ``That'll Just 'Bout Knock Me Out,'' ``Ration Blues.'' 
   In 1944: ``G.I. Jive,'' ``Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby.'' 
   In 1945: ``Mop! Mop!,'' ``You Can't Get That No More,'' ``Caldonia,'' ``Somebody Done Changed the Lock on My Door,'' ``My Baby Said Yes.'' 
   And then truly the remarkable year of 1946 in which he had 13 hits: ``Buzz Me''; ``Don't Worry 'Bout That Mule''; ``Salt Pork, West Virginia''; ``Reconversion Blues''; ``Beware (Brother, Beware)''; ``Don't Let the Sun Catch You Cryin'''; ``Stone Cold Dead in the Market (He Had it Coming)''; ``Petootie Pie''; ``Choo Choo Ch'Boogie''; ``That Chick's Too Young to Fry''; ``Ain't That Just Like a Woman (They'll Do It Every Time)''; ``Ain't Nobody Here But Us Chickens''; ``Let the Good Times Roll.'' 
   And then on to 1947: ``Texas and Pacific''; ``I Like 'Em Fat Like That''; ``Open the Door, Richard!''; ``Jack, You're Dead''; ``I Know What You're Puttin' Down''; ``Boogie Woogie Blue Plate''; ``Early in the Mornin'''; ``Look Out.'' 
   In 1948: ``Barnyard Boogie''; ``How Long Must I Wait for You''; ``Reet, Petite and Gone''; ``Run Joe''; ``All for the Love of Lil''; ``Pinetop's Boogie Woogie''; ``Don't Burn the Candle at Both Ends''; ``We Can't Agree''; ``Daddy-O''; ``Pettin' and Pokin'.'' 
   In 1949: ``Roamin' Blues''; ``You Broke Your Promise''; ``Cole Slaw (Sorghum Switch)''; ``Every Man to His Own Profession''; ``Baby, It's Cold Outside''; ``Beans and Corn Bread''; ``Saturday Night Fish Fry.'' 
   In 1950, four hits: ``School Days, ``Blue Light Boogie,'' ``I'll Never Be Free,'' ``Tamburitza Boogie.'' 
   And in 1951: ``Lemonade,'' ``Tear Drops from My Eyes,'' ``Weak Minded Blues.'' 
   Those song titles from the remarkable career of hits of Louis Jordan give you a flavor for the kinds of songs, the kind of music, the richness of American heritage. 
   This was really brought home to me when I was getting signatures to sign onto this bill, and one of the first people I talked to was one of our colleagues Congressman STEVE ISRAEL from New York, a long way from rural Arkansas, and he immediately told me--he signed on--that he had seen ``Five Guys Named Moe'' in New York three times. He started singing the songs and knew the lyrics of many of these songs, even though Louis Jordan died over 30 years ago. 
   I appreciate the efforts by the majority and minority today to bring this bill to the floor, and today we salute a remarkable American: Louis Jordan.
