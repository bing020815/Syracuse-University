<DOCNO>Mr. BILIRAKIS. (REPUBLICAN FRESHMEN THIRD QUARTERLY REPORT TO THE 110TH CONGRESS -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, before I begin, some of you may have noticed that I have a different haircut. This past August, I kept a promise to my local American Cancer Society chapter that I would shave my head if they met their fundraising goal. 
   My promise was grounded in an effort to bring greater awareness to the American Cancer Society's work on finding a cure for a disease that some estimates show will claim more than 559,000 lives in 2007. 
   The statistics on cancer are mind numbing. Cancer strikes one out of two men and one out of three women, killing 1,500 people every day. 
   Having been at the front lines of cancer research and services for more than half a century, the American Cancer Society remains a pillar of hope for millions of Americans facing this dreadful disease. 
   I encourage my colleagues to get out there and support the work of organizations like the American Cancer Society. The war against cancer is a war we must, and can win--but only together. 
   Well, it has been more than 9 months since the 110th Congress convened under the leadership of Democrats who promised the American people many things, but have since failed to deliver on many of their commitments. This is most evident in recent approval ratings of this Democrat-run Congress, which have reached historic lows. 
   These numbers say everything about the failed promises of this majority. During the 2006 campaign, the Democrats pledged to rein in spending, yet their budget proposal contains more than $217 billion in tax increases, representing the second largest tax increase in American history, and proposes spending $23 billion above the amount proposed in the President's budget blueprint. 
   This is not the kind of reform promised by the new Democrat majority; rather, it is very reminiscent of the old Democrat majority that took more money out of the American taxpayers' wallets, while creating new wasteful spending and sprawling government programs. 
   Now, if the numbers are too much to bear, perhaps we can look at a particular issue of great concern to my constituents, my fellow Floridians, and residents of disaster-prone regions throughout the United States. That is the outrageous cost of homeowners' insurance. 
   Our national economy, and the quality of life for many Americans is severely burdened by the fact that disaster-prone areas, like Florida, continue to suffer from an insurance market that has overblown its rates and refused to take the necessary risk to ensure that every homeowner has access to affordable, quality homeowners' insurance.  
   Earlier this week, my Democrat colleagues took to the House floor to proclaim their outrage over the troubles homeowners are currently facing throughout the United States as a result of the tanking subprime mortgage market. 
   I want you to know that the concern of this body should focus on these same homeowners, in addition to the millions of homeowners who can pay their mortgage, yet are not adequately insured. This disparity is a tragedy of equal or greater measure. 
   You see, faced with increasingly expensive and limited insurance options, Florida embodies the kinds of problems plaguing homeowners in high-risk areas across the country. 
   Owning a home is fundamental to the ``American Dream.'' It should not be an insurmountable burden. Sadly though, such a possibility is slowly eroding under unbelievably high homeowners' insurance. 
   As we speak this week about improving the opportunities for existing and future homeowners, we must not forget the next catastrophe is just around the corner for millions of American homeowners. This catastrophe is not limited to the prospect of home foreclosures, but also hurricanes, flooding and other disasters both man-made and natural. 
   If the American homeowner cannot adequately protect themselves from these dangers, then they are just as vulnerable to losing their homes as those who are facing the sub-prime credit debacle. 
   I recently introduced legislation that would allow Gulf Coast States to pool their resources and jointly coordinate responses and preparation for major disasters. The Gulf Coast All-Hazard Readiness Act would allow the Gulf Coast States to form an interstate compact to mitigate, respond to and recover from major natural disasters. 
   Additionally, I have cosigned important legislation that would remedy the skyrocketing cost of homeowners' insurance in disaster-prone regions of the country. These bills, H.R. 91 and H.R. 330, will go a long way to addressing a problem that is only getting worse. 
   I implore this body to act, and for this Democrat-led majority to make good on their promise to protect American families. They can start by allowing a vote on legislation that will help families adequately protect their homes from future and almost certain disasters.

<DOCNO>Mr. BILIRAKIS. (THE 34TH ANNIVERSARY OF INVASION OF CYPRUS -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise not only as a Member of this esteemed body, but more importantly, as a member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and also as co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on Hellenic Issues. I stand before you today to recall a somber anniversary that has pained the Cypriot and Hellenic communities for the past 34 years. 
   Mr. Speaker, even though the tragic events of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus took place as long ago as July 20, 1974, believe it or not, the suffering of the victims has not subsided. This anniversary is a time for America to respectfully remember the brutal Turkish military invasion of Cyprus, to mourn those who lost their lives, and to condemn the continued occupation. Five thousand Cypriots were killed in 1974, and more than 1,400 Greek Cypriots, including four Americans of Cypriot descent, still remain missing. 
   Since the invasion, Turkey has established a heavily armed military occupation that continues to control nearly 40 percent of the island. Forced expulsions of Greek Cypriots on the occupied land have left nearly 200,000 people displaced. These Cypriots were kicked out of their homes, making them refugees in their own country. Those properties have been unlawfully distributed and are currently being used by the tens of thousands of illegal settlers from Turkey. To this day, Greek Cypriots are prevented by Turkey from returning to their homes and properties. 
   Another tragic result of this 34-year occupation is the division among Greek and Turkish Cypriots, who have been forcibly separated along ethnic lines. This unnatural division of the island Nation is a crime against society and the people of Cyprus that can only be resolved by ending this occupation. 
   Mr. Speaker, 34 years is just too long. On the occasion of this anniversary, we need to take a long, hard look at our own commitment toward helping Cyprus reach a lasting and enduring peace, free from occupation, division, and oppression. 
   Last year, the U.S. House had the wisdom and foresight to unanimously pass H. Res. 405, a measure I introduced, which expressed strong support from this body for the implementation of the July 8 agreement. This year, a new President was elected in Cyprus. President Demitris Christofias has followed through on his promise to make the solution of the Cyprus problem his top priority and principal concern. The day of his election, he extended a hand of friendship to the Turkish Cypriot leader, Mehmet Talat, and called on him to meet face-to-face to begin implementing the July 8 agreement. 
   The Republic of Cyprus has also worked alongside its European neighbors to bring about a stronger integration of Turkish and Greek Cypriot interests for the good of the island. This has included a partial lifting on restrictions of movement across the cease-fire line that continues to forcibly divide Cyprus. As a result, since 2003, more than 13 million Greek and Turkish Cypriots have crossed without incident. 
   Additionally, the per capita income of Turkish Cypriots has nearly tripled in the last 3 years because of an aggressive integration policy by the Republic of Cyprus. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that because of this continued integration between Turkish and Greek Cypriots, and the economic and political successes that the Republic of Cyprus so readily wants to share with its neighbors, it is possible to bring closure to this 34-year occupation. 
   Cyprus has long been a strong and faithful ally of the United States. It continues to work with us in the global war on terrorism and has supported our efforts in both Afghanistan and Iraq. Aside from providing over-flight rights and port access, the Government of Cyprus has joined only a handful of Nations who have acted on their commitment to cancel Iraq's outstanding debt. 
   Mr. Speaker, 34 years is long enough. It is not impossible to conceive one day having a Cyprus that is unified under a bizonal, bicommunal federation with a single sovereignty, single international personality, and single citizenship with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all Cypriots. 
   We, Americans, as friends of the Cypriot people, owe it to them to do everything in our power to support peace and an end to this illegal occupation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, it is with great Greek American pride that I rise today to offer my congratulations on the occasion of the 85th anniversary of the American Hellenic Education Progressive Association. Founded in Atlanta, Georgia, on July 26, 1922, as a reaction to racism and bigotry, AHEPA is the oldest and largest American Hellenic organization in the United States today. Its mission, to promote Hellenism, education, philanthropy, civic responsibility, family and individual excellence, set the standard for ethnic organizations, and has helped Greek Americans become one of the most successful ethnic groups in the United States. 
   AHEPA's list of accomplishments is amazing. It has endowed millions of dollars in academic scholarships, and the AHEPA family has contributed over $1 billion in national projects for such deserving entities as Saint Basil's Academy, Cooley's Anemia Foundation, the Special Olympics, and Muscular Dystrophy research. 
   Additionally, the AHEPA National Housing Corporation has secured over $4 million to develop and complete over 70 housing projects for low-income seniors. 
   AHEPA's patriotic endeavors have included helping thousands of Greek immigrants assimilate into American life, and four of those immigrants were my grandparents, Mr. Speaker, raising $253 million for the U.S. bond drive during World War II, helping to restore the Statue of Liberty, providing tens of thousands of dollars to the 9/11 relief effort, and sending countless care packages to our troops overseas. 
   Its good works are endless, Mr. Speaker. That is why I am so proud to tell you that I am a member of AHEPA. And I will tell you that I am a member on the local level of the Tarpon Springs Chapter in Florida, the George Washington Chapter, Number 16, which was founded in the 1920s. 
   As cochair of the Caucus on Hellenic Affairs, I will continue to work closely with my cochair, CAROLYN MALONEY, my fellow Greek American Congressmen and women, Philhellenes in Congress, as well as AHEPA president, Gus James, to encourage the wonderful educational and philanthropic endeavors that have characterized AHEPA for 85 years. 
   Also, I promise to work in conjunction with AHEPA to continue to strengthen U.S./Greece relations, secure religious freedom and protection for the Ecumenical Patriarchate, and that is our number one issue, Mr. Speaker, and promote solutions to the Cypress and the FYROM issues. 
   I wish Mr. Gus James and the whole AHEPA family continued success and a long life as it continues to serve as a beacon of hope, true and good things. That is what Hellenic Americans want. Bravo AHEPA, and at least 85 more.

<DOCNO>Mr. BILIRAKIS. (HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I'd like to wish a happy birthday to my son, Michael, who was born on June 7, 1993. He's 14 years old today. What a wonderful boy he is. I'm so proud of him; great student, all around great person, great athlete as well. He takes after my father, Congressman Mike Bilirakis, who he was named after. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is with great frustration and disappointment that I rise today. It has been 3 years since the devastating 2004 hurricane season that ravaged my State, which forced homeowners insurance rates to skyrocket to unmanageable levels. And this body, unfortunately, has not acted. 
   Along with many of our gulf coast colleagues, I have pleaded with the Democrat leadership to act on legislation which might ease this financially crippling crisis. Of course, this body has not acted. 
   Countless of my constituents have implored me to help relieve this crisis so they do not have to leave the areas they love. They wish to raise their children and retire in the great State of Florida, but they fear that simply it will not happen because they can't afford it. We must act, Mr. Speaker. 
   The front page of today's Wall Street Journal forewarns of the impending economic emergency if we have another major hurricane here in the United States. The story correctly notes, and I quote, ``If insurers of last resort face major storm losses, those costs could spread to a broad cross section of the public.'' This is just another warning given to this Congress that something must be done immediately. We must act.

   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, in closing, there was nothing hesitant about Prime Minister Blair's resolve to fight back and send a message to terrorists that the United Kingdom, like the United States, would not succumb to ideology that espouses violence and death. 
   Like Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher before him, who stood shoulder to shoulder with President Ronald Reagan to bring down the greatest dark force of the 20th century, communist, Mr. Blair stood with President Bush even when few others would accept the challenge to eliminate the dark force of this new century. 
   Mr. Speaker, as all the previous speakers have suggested, this is most worthy resolution for a most worthy leader. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in congratulating Prime Minister Tony Blair for his remarkable tenure as Prime Minister of the U.K., and for his steadfast support of the United States, and our invaluable alliance with Great Britain. 
   We look forward to his successor, Mr. Gordon Brown, following in Mr. Blair's footsteps by maintaining and building on our transatlantic alliance so we can stand strong and together face the uncertainties of a troubled world. 
   I would like to thank you, Mr. Speaker, and thank Ranking Member King for bringing forth this resolution. And also Ambassador WATSON, I thank you very much. Tony Blair is a true statesman, a man of principle.

<DOCNO>Mr. BILIRAKIS. (NATIONAL SILVER ALERT ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6064, the National Silver Alert Act sponsored by my colleague from Texas, Congressman Lloyd Doggett. 
   I first became involved in the issue of finding missing seniors earlier this year when one of my constituents, Mary Lallucci, lost her mother, who had left her care-giving facility and could not be located. She had driven her car into the Gulf of Mexico and drowned. 
   This tragedy unfortunately highlighted the very real problem of older  individuals who suffer from diseases which leave them easily confused and disoriented, wandering away from their homes or care-giving facilities and meeting harm because family, friends, and authorities cannot find them in time. 
   The inability to find missing elderly is a problem State and Federal policymakers should address before something like this happens again. That is why I support the bill before us today which includes provisions from the Silver Alert legislation I introduced earlier this year. 
   The National Silver Alert Act is a bipartisan bill developed by Congressman Doggett, myself, and Congresswoman Sue Myrick. It combines portions of missing persons bills that each of us have introduced. 
   The National Silver Alert Act includes language from my bill, the Silver Alert Grant Program Act, which creates within the Department of Justice a grant program to help States establish and operate Silver Alert notification systems to help find missing individuals who suffer from Alzheimer's disease and other dementia-related illnesses. 
   The measure we are considering today also establishes a national Silver Alert communications network to assist regional and local missing persons search efforts and requires an annual report to determine the effectiveness of State Silver Alert plans to help guide their establishment in other States. 
   The bill also reauthorizes Kristen's Act. Mrs. Myrick's bill provides grants to public and nonprofit organizations to help them find abducted adults. 
   I was honored to work with these two fine Members, and pleased that we were able to combine these complementary bills. 
   I want to thank them for their work, as well as the willingness of the Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers, Ranking Member Lamar Smith, and Crime Subcommittee Chairman Bobby Scott and Ranking Member Randy Forbes, for moving this bill through their panels in such an expeditious manner. 
   I believe that all States, especially my State of Florida, should establish systems similar to the highly successful Amber Alert program to help find those suffering from dementia-related illnesses and prevent tragedies like the one that occurred in my community. 
   The Amber Alert system has a remarkable track record of success because necessary information is filtered so that relevant details are transmitted to appropriate authorities as quickly as possible. 
   The experiences of States that already have developed such Amber Alert systems suggests that these programs save lives. States have found that, just as with missing and abducted children, timely notification and dissemination of appropriate information about missing seniors greatly improves the chances that they will be found before they harm themselves. 
   I believe that the Federal Government can and should help States develop notification systems to prevent these all-too-frequent tragedies. This is especially important in my State which has more residents age 65 or older than any State in the Nation. My State needs Silver Alert and it needs it now. 
   Passage of this bill today will bring Florida and other States without these life-saving systems one step closer to improving the ability to find missing seniors in the crucial few hours after they go missing. 
   We have many people to thank for that, including Mary Lallucci, whose determined advocacy for Silver Alert has inspired me and serves as a loving tribute to her mother's memory. 
   Mr. Speaker, Mrs. Lallucci was asked whether she thought a Silver Alert system in Florida could have saved her mother. ``Who knows,'' she said. ``Unfortunately, I will never know.'' 
   I urge my colleagues to support the National Silver Alert Act to prevent another family from being forced to struggle with that same uncertainty.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, it is with great Gator pride that I rise today to support this resolution honoring my alma mater, the University of Florida, on winning the 2007 NCAA men's basketball championship. 
   The Gators began this season looking to become the first team since 1992 to repeat as national champions. Everyone in the Gator nation anxiously anticipated this season's tip-off, as all five starters unselfishly returned to school in hopes of making history. And they did. They became the only team in history to repeat as champions with the same starting lineup. 
   Last year, this Gator team came from obscurity to win the championship. However, this year the Gators were expected to win, which made them a target for every school they played. These young men not only handled the pressure and scrutiny, but they used it to fuel another amazing title run through both the SEC and the NCAA tournament. 
   Madam Speaker, I believe that this basketball team represents the true embodiment of sportsmanship and teamwork. For the last 2 years, these young men won with class, not selfishness. The five starters gave up their very lucrative NBA contracts to return to the school they loved. How refreshing. In today's society, this an act that is remarkable. Believe it or not, it is remarkable. I want to commend all of them for their hard work and discipline. 
   I also want to recognize Coach Billy Donovan and all of his assistants for the tremendous job they have done over the years. We are very lucky to have them, and I am glad he stayed at the University of Florida. 
   Finally, I want to thank president Bernie Machen and athletic director Jeremy Foley, whose leadership made it possible for the Gators to be the only team in NCAA history to hold both the football and basketball titles simultaneously. 
   I wish the University of Florida the best of luck in continuing this remarkable trend. And on behalf of my entire family, including my sons Michael, Teddy, Manuel, and Nicholas, thanks for making our dream come true, Gators. 
   Madam Speaker, it truly is great to be a Florida Gator.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, my State of Florida is going through a crisis, a crisis that began with the devastating hurricanes that ripped through my State in recent years, a crisis made worse by the overwhelming tornados that plagued central Florida earlier this month. 
   These and other natural disasters have pushed homeowners' insurance rates to unaffordable levels. As a result, many of my constituents have been forced to leave the area they call home. It is incumbent upon this body to pass legislation that would help my State and others affected by these forces reduce the cost of skyrocketing homeowners' insurance rates. 
   I have introduced H.R. 913, the Hurricane and Tornado Mitigation Investment Act to do just that. My bill would provide tax incentives to home and business owners to better protect their homes and businesses from major storms to reduce the loss of innocent lives and destruction of private property. The end result would be more manageable insurance rates. 
   Mr. Speaker, hurricane season begins in a few months, but the tornados that hit my State are a stark reminder that Mother Nature doesn't keep a calendar. I encourage my colleagues to support and help me pass H.R. 913.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from California for her strong support of H. Res. 405. I rise today to urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 405, which expresses the strong support of the U.S. House of Representatives for the immediate implementation of the July 8, 2006, United Nations-brokered agreement between President Papadopoulos of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot community leader, Mr. Mehmet Ali Talat. 
   More than 33 years after the invasion and occupation of Cyprus by Turkish troops, the country remains divided and has the longest running peacekeeping force in the history of the United Nations. It is important that there is forward movement on properly preparing the grounds for serious negotiations that will lead to sustainable and lasting peace. 
   The international community has helped shepherd an agreement on a process, the Gambari process, that points the way forward to comprehensive negotiations that will lead to the reunification of the island, its people, institutions and economy in a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation. 
   The United Nations Security Council, the European Union, and the United States have all played key roles in trying to bring a lasting and fair resolution to the division of the island. 
   On July 8, 2006, President Papadopoulos and Mr. Talat agreed, under the auspices of the United Nations, to the establishment of technical committees and working groups to examine the issues affecting the daily lives of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot people, as well as issues of substance. 
   H. Res. 405 recognizes the fact that the status quo is unacceptable and that its prolongation would have negative consequences for the Turkish and Greek Cypriots. It also reinforces the proposition that a comprehensive settlement is both desirable and possible and should not be further delayed. 
   In an effort to jump-start the July 8 agreement, President Papadopoulos invited Mr. Talat to a meeting that took place this year on September 5. The two leaders agreed on the need for the earliest start of the Gambari process and to continue their contact through the U.N. and to meet again when appropriate. 
   As a member of the European Union, the Republic of Cyprus has proven itself a committed and influential partner in Europe. Despite its forced division, Cyprus's successful social and economic integration into the European Union is a testament to its focus and dedication to democratic values and regional cooperation. 
   In addition, Cyprus has a long history of working cooperatively with the United States on issues of international defense and security and continues to do so in the global war on terror. Cyprus is also a good friend to this country. In the summer of 2006, Cyprus served as the principal transit for 15,000 Americans evacuating Lebanon. Our citizens were provided with food, shelter, and medical care. 
   It is now time for Congress to demonstrate its strong support of efforts toward the reunification of Cyprus by passing H. Res. 405, calling for the immediate implementation of the July 8 agreement in its entirety and without deviation from the process. 
   H. Res. 405 gives a strong message of support for a reunified Cyprus under a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation with a single sovereignty, single international personality, and single citizenship with respect to human rights and fundamental freedoms of all Cypriots. 
   I wish to thank Chairman Lantos and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen and all of my colleagues who have cosponsored H. Res. 405. I thank them for recognizing what a significant step this great representative body is taking by telling the world community that the sad and tragic division of Cyprus should be no longer.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2553, the Public Diplomacy Resource Centers Act of 2007. Every year, thousands of people living overseas visit an American Cultural Center or one of dozens of American Corners that are maintained by our State Department. Those libraries and cultural outposts are indispensable tools in our public diplomacy efforts around the world. They help foreign audiences better understand our Nation, our people, our government, and our society. 
   The bill before us today will strengthen this American outreach by establishing a new film series and by requiring a report to Congress analyzing the effectiveness of libraries and resource centers. Also, by providing specific statutory authority for the establishment and maintenance of these centers, this bill will create an annual appropriations line item, which will allow Congress to oversee these activities in the future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, early this year, the U.S. and Brazil signed a memorandum of understanding on biofuels cooperation. This document symbolizes not only a shared interest in reducing energy vulnerability, but also a growing relationship between our two countries based on the common goal of regional stability and prosperity throughout the Western Hemisphere. 
   I am pleased to learn of the progress made under the United States-Brazil memorandum of understanding and applaud the proactive efforts being taken by both of our countries in confronting the constraints of oil dependence. 
   As Hugo Chavez continues to exploit Venezuela's oil supply to spread his propaganda across the Western Hemisphere, it is essential that the U.S. and Brazil continue to lead the way in diminishing our historical dependence on oil by finding alternative ways to satisfy our energy needs. 
   Additionally, while I appreciate the growing and valuable role of Brazil as a strategic partner, we must remain vigilant of Brazil's own activities. 
   As the U.S. continues to work to promote freedom and democracy in the hemisphere, we continue to face challenges by the likes of Venezuela's Chavez and Bolivia's Morales, under the tyrannical influences of Castro. 
   We must be cognizant of the fact that President da Silva was in fact a founding member of the Foro de Sao Paolo, which plays host to these men and promoter to their increasingly anti-American rhetoric throughout the region. 
   Brazil has a history of noncompliance with the IAEA obligations and an expressed interest in pursuing future enrichment programs. 
   This mixed with the increasing of rogue regimes, like Iran and Syria, to make inroads into the unstable political, economic and social worlds of Latin America requires the U.S. be vigilant in our assessment of Brazil and the region as a whole. 
   As biofuels cooperation allows our two countries to work increasingly closely together, I am hopeful that continued success in bilateral relations, hemispheric integration, and energy diversification will help to mitigate these challenges. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BILIRAKIS. (TROPICAL FOREST CONSERVATION ACT OF 1998 AMENDMENTS -- (House of Representatives - October 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill H.R. 2185, which would reauthorize and amend the Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998. As the total territory of the world's tropical forests continue to decline, programs such as that created by the Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998 are an important component of international efforts to slow and hopefully reverse the decline at the start of the new century. 
   Under the Tropical Forest Conservation Act, a country with a tropical forest within its borders may seek an agreement with the United States whereby some of the debts it may owe us can instead be utilized to support activities that maintain those tropical forests. The bill would reauthorize this important conservation program through fiscal year 2010. The bill also amends the program in order to make coral reefs eligible for coverage under the program as well. 
   This is an important response to the increasing evidence of decline in the world coral reefs, which, along with tropical forests, are a vital environmental resource. It is important that we preserve such underwater treasures, not just for future generations to enjoy, but to ensure the sustainability of our world's fragile ecology. 
   Mr. Speaker, enactment of this bill would authorize a continuation of these important conservation efforts for the next 3 fiscal years. I support this measure and urge my colleagues as well to support this measure.

<DOCNO>Mr. BILIRAKIS. (DENOUNCING THE PRACTICES OF FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, ``HONOR'' KILLINGS, ACID BURNING, DOWRY DEATHS AND OTHER GENDER-BASED PERSECUTIONS -- (House of Representatives - October 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I'm pleased to rise in support of H. Res. 32, which denounces violence against women and recognizes that women's rights are, indeed, human rights. 
   I also would like to thank Chairman Lantos and the sponsor of this resolution, my good friend and my chairwoman, Ms. Jackson-Lee, for agreeing to modify the introduced text such that it strikes all references to the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women. By striking these references and refocusing our attention on the challenges to human dignity that an alarming number of women are forced to endure around the world, H. Res. 32 is now a much stronger, bipartisan resolution which can be universally embraced. 
   H. Res. 32 recognizes that democracy, political stability, public health and economic development are linked to the welfare of women and children. Two-thirds of the world's work is performed by women, yet women still earn less than 5 percent of its income, own less than 1 percent of its property, and make up nearly 70 percent of the people living in poverty unfortunately. 
   The lack of legal standing of women in many societies makes them especially susceptible to poverty, exploitation, abuse and, inevitably, infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS. 
   Yet as women serve as the provider and educator for their families in many traditional societies, their exploitation threatens the prosperity of their entire family and community. As such, the resolution calls upon governments to address the entrenched gender inequalities which threaten development, as well as national security. 
   It also calls on governments to criminalize such atrocious practices as female genital mutilation, domestic violence, ``honor'' killings, acid burnings, dowry deaths, and other gender-based crimes. 
   This resolution does not seek to bestow upon women any special privilege. It simply recognizes the fact that no matter where one lives, and no matter what their race, religion or culture, we are all human beings who deserve the opportunity to live in dignity and free from oppression or abuse based solely on our gender. 
   I urge unanimous support of H. Res. 32. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BILIRAKIS. (SUPPORTING TAIWAN'S FOURTH DIRECT AND DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IN MARCH 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would also like to thank Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen for authoring this great piece of legislation, the resolution. 
   I would like to take this opportunity also to offer our varied Asian American communities, Taiwanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, and Singaporean, belated wishes for good fortune in the lunar new year which began last month. I wish all these communities health, long life, and prosperity as they welcome the Year of the Rat, a year which brings hard work, activity, and renewal. We also expect hard work and much activity in the months ahead in what promises to be a dynamic 2008. 
   Taiwan faces a very competitive campaign in the next 2 weeks before the March 22 presidential election. No one is able to predict the final outcome. That in itself is an indication of a thriving democracy. 
   Those skeptics who once said that democratic values would never thrive in a Chinese cultural context need to look no further than Taiwan. Free and fair elections in Taiwan bear a significance which reaches far beyond the shores of one island. 
   Taiwan, through its maturing democratic institutions, stands as a shining example for other Asian states struggling with the introduction of representative forms of government and the rule of law. Taiwan's free elections, however, have the greatest impact on those who are still yearning to breathe free in the vast Chinese mainland just across the narrow Taiwan Strait. 
   Taiwan's young democracy faces constant military threat and intimidation from neighboring China. Yet in spite of these belligerent threats and the constant saber-rattling by Beijing, Taipei has continued to stand tall for freedom. Taiwan's evolving and dynamic democracy serves as a beacon of hope for those still suffering under oppression in the Communist Chinese mainland. 
   Taiwan's democracy is a torch which shines ever brighter, far outshining the Olympic torch of the Chinese regime which hopes this year to use sports to achieve propaganda victory. Freedom shines brighter than any medal, Mr. Speaker. 
   Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in giving their strong, enthusiastic support to this resolution which welcomes Taiwan's fourth direct and democratic elections as part of our ongoing efforts to promote democracy around the world and in the Asian region in particular. I wish the people of Taiwan continued peace, prosperity, and liberty in this Year of the Rat, and in the years and decades ahead.

<DOCNO>Mr. BILIRAKIS. (CONDEMNING THE ONGOING PALESTINIAN ROCKET ATTACKS ON ISRAELI CIVILIANS -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 951, which does not merely condemn the ongoing Palestinian rocket attacks on Israeli civilians, but also clearly articulates that the United States stands shoulder to shoulder with the people of Israel in their time of need. 
   Since the inception of the Palestinians' latest war against Israel, which started in September of 2000, Palestinian suicide bombers have struck at crowded buses, hotels, cafes, and other civilian targets, shedding innocent blood in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and other communities. 
   Additionally, during the war in Lebanon during the summer of 2006, Hezbollah rockets rained down on Israeli civilian populations, claiming dozens of innocent lives. And then, Mr. Speaker, there is Sderot and other Israeli communities bordering Gaza where every day ordinary people must cope with the fear that a rocket could fall at any moment, killing or maiming them and their loved ones. 
   Last month, as the international press covered a Palestinian demonstration against Israel, Hamas and other Palestinian jihadist groups launched rockets that struck Sderot and elsewhere. The scene was terrifying. A father of four died of shrapnel wounds after a rocket struck his car, and a 10-year-old boy lay severely injured after being struck in a supermarket as his 8-year-old sister tried to comfort him. These are just a few instances of Israeli suffering in the border communities broadcast internationally, but the trauma endured by innocent Israeli civilians in such attacks has been ongoing and extensive. 
   The psychological impact from continued rocket attacks has affected all segments of the population. However, the brutal impact has been most vivid on the Sderot children. Reports indicate that almost one-third of the people between the ages of 4 and 18 have suffered post-traumatic stress disorder, and I have spoken to some children that were under this situation. Many more exhibit feelings of severe anxiety and feelings of helplessness that warn of more serious problems to come. And, Mr. Speaker, the rockets continue to fall. 
   With the help of Iran and Syria, Hamas and its accomplices are developing, acquiring, and firing rockets with longer range, more accurate lethality. It is an unfortunate situation, Mr. Speaker, and we have to do something. Yet, even though Palestinian extremists continue to target innocent men, women, and children in clear violation of international law, the response of other nations and other international bodies, such as the United Nations, has often been openly hostile to the Israelis, the very people under attack. 
   In multiple U.N. forums, not a word is uttered about the Hamas rockets falling from the sky, and Israel is denounced for inflicting suffering on Gaza when it defends itself against those who attack its citizens, including through an economic blockade, a blockade which does not apply to food, medicine, and other vital necessities. 
   While the European Union earlier this week denounced Israel's actions against those who launch rockets against the Israeli people, it said next to nothing about the countless Israeli victims of Palestinian violence. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, it is vital that Congress takes a stand against this double standard. 
   This resolution states that the Palestinian extremists behind the rocket attacks against Israeli civilians are in clear violation of international humanitarian standards as they not only brutally target civilian populations, but use peace-loving Palestinian civilians as human shields against Israel's self-defense measures. 
   Furthermore, this resolution calls on the President to direct the U.S. permanent representative to the U.N. to introduce a resolution at the U.N. Security Council condemning Palestinian rockets and other attacks against innocent Israeli civilians and direct the Secretary of State to raise this issue in all applicable bilateral and international fora. 
   Finally, this resolution sends a message to the very people under daily attack by these rockets, our Israeli friends and allies, that the Congress of the United States stands firmly behind them in their struggle against Palestinian extremists. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this critical resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BILIRAKIS. (RECONSTRUCTION AND STABILIZATION CIVILIAN MANAGEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1084, the Reconstruction and Stabilization Civilian Management Act. I want to thank Chairman Berman; the gentleman from California (Mr. Farr), the author of the bill; and my dear friend, Mr. Saxton, the lead Republican cosponsor of the legislation, for working to reach the bipartisan agreement before us. 
   The text we are considering today was finalized in consultation with the State Department and the White House. It provides the President and Secretary of State with the basic authorities they have been seeking for expanding reconstruction and stabilization activities in order to assist countries whose descent into internal crisis may endanger the national security interests of the United States. 
   The legislation formally creates and gives full legislative support to the 4-year-old office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization. It also provides the President with the authority to create a Federal Response Readiness Corps and a volunteer Civilian Reserve Corps, a proposal based on a December 2005 Presidential directive and which enjoys the support of a broad cross-section of U.S. agencies. 
   These new corps will work to prevent future conflicts overseas and ensure that we are better prepared to effectively address post-conflict scenarios in countries that are important to our Nation's security interests. The hope is that, by preorganizing and training qualified civilian personnel, any future reconstruction and stabilization operations can be better coordinated and  more effective in order to free up our Armed Forces to better focus on strategic military and security objectives. 
   It is important to note that the text before us provides these authorities in a limited, careful manner, subject to greater congressional oversight. In contrast with the original text and other proposed drafts, there are several things that today's suspension text does not do: It does not mandate specific funding levels, and limits funding authorities to a 3-year trial period, from fiscal year 2008 through 2010; it does not create additional budget draw-down authority for emergency peacekeeping assistance; it does not mandate a minimum number of Civilian Reserve Corps personnel; and it does not include special personnel authorities such as waivers to allow dual compensation of Federal retirees or an increase in the premium pay cap. 
   Although we are attempting to create a system that is better equipped to intervene more effectively in foreign crises, we are not intending to lower the threshold for U.S. involvement in such situations. This is not an invitation to ``nation building.'' For this reason, the amended text requires a Presidential national security interest determination and advance congressional notification before any deployment of the corps to a country in crisis.     
   We also intend that these activities be conducted in a transparent and fiscally responsible manner. Toward that end, the text includes an annual worldwide cap of $100 million on all reconstruction and stabilization assistance provided under the act. 
   In order to mitigate the potential domestic impact, the text we are considering today mandates that the Civilian Reserve Corps be staffed in a way that does not diminish the capacity of State or local governments from which the volunteers may be drawn. It also charges the Office of the Coordinator to avoid duplication with other U.S. foreign assistance activities. Finally, it requires enhanced reporting to Congress on the structure, operation and cost of core operations, their relations to other U.S. foreign assistance efforts, and any impact on U.S. domestic readiness and capabilities. 
   I am gratified that we are able to reach this compromise, and look forward to working together in the future to ensure the success of this and other U.S. foreign assistance programs. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 3121. This bill, the Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act, takes important steps towards bolstering the protection provided to homeowners in disaster-prone  areas who face a constant threat of flood and windstorm damage. 
   Nearly all of my constituents and my fellow Floridians fall into this category. In Florida, especially, H.R. 3121 will help to ease the homeowners' insurance crisis that grows worse everyday. 
   Expanding the federal flood-insurance program to include wind damage simply makes sense. Those who have their homes flooded are often in the path of destructive storms that wield powerful winds. 
   Common sense would dictate that if we are seeking to help protect homeowners from the liability that comes from destructive natural disasters like hurricanes, we would consider all of the forces of nature associated with these storms. 
   Instead of arguing today why we should include wind damage into this program, the discussion should rather be about why we have gone for so long without it. 
   While I understand the costs associated with this bill are an issue with some of my colleagues, the cost of doing nothing is much greater. 
   Many of the homeowners in my District, in the State of Florida, and in disaster-prone areas throughout the United States spend each day staring down the barrel of a gun--waiting for the storm to hit that will put them and their families on a path to financial ruin. 
   We have a chance to do something about this today. 
   It is this body's responsibility to act in the interest and welfare of the American people. Vote YES on H.R. 3121, and vote yes to protect millions of homeowners and their families.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 1029, which congratulates and recognizes Mr. Juan Antonio ``Chi-Chi'' Rodriguez for his success on the golf course, for his devotion to charity and for his dedication to the intellectual and moral development of low-income and disadvantaged youth throughout our Nation. 
   Mr. Rodriguez' knack for golf began at a young age. He learned to play golf with makeshift golf clubs fashioned from guava tree limbs and from tin cans hammered into golf balls. He shot a remarkable 67 at age 12. By the end of his professional career, he had won 22 Senior PGA tour events and the hearts of many Americans with his trademark toreador dance. 
   Part of what makes Mr. Rodriguez such a remarkable individual is that he took his own professional accomplishments and channeled them into the Chi-Chi Rodriguez Youth Foundation, which supports the Chi-Chi Rodriguez Academy, which is in my congressional district. Starting in 1979 and with just 17 students, the mission of the academy is to assist at-risk children by improving their self-esteem, character, work ethic, social adjustment, and academic performance by using the golf course as a classroom. 
   The academy encompasses a public-private partnership school that fosters  students' achievements through interactive experiences in various real-world business environments: The First Tee of Clearwater, incorporating life skills with golf skills; the After School Enrichment program, reinforcing and furthering academic studies; and the Community Service program, designed to help students fulfill their graduation and scholarship volunteer service hour requirements. 
   Madam Speaker, my kids have had the honor of meeting Mr. Rodriguez, and I have had the pleasure of seeing firsthand his good work in my district. Mr. Rodriguez, after meeting with Mother Teresa, embraced her lesson of living to help other people, and he has served as an inspiration to thousands of young men and women over the past three decades. His unique idea to teach the important life skills of self-control, responsibility and respect for others to at-risk youth while maintaining an atmosphere that builds confidence and positive educational experiences through golf is truly commendable. 
   It is with great admiration that I rise today to honor the accomplishments of Mr. Chi-Chi Rodriguez by supporting this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. BILIRAKIS. (GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY -- (House of Representatives - March 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, today I proudly rise to celebrate a remarkable anniversary, that which marks a day of Greek independence which took place 186 years ago on March 25. It is also a celebration which recognizes the strong ties that bind together the United States of America and Greece. 
   What a blessing to be able to straddle two brilliant cultures that have been the beacon of liberty and justice for humankind. Nothing makes me prouder than to call myself American, for it was the United States that welcomed my grandparents and allowed them to bring their morals, their values, their faith, their rich ethnic traditions and work ethic to this great land of opportunity and freedom. 
   God, indeed, shed his grace on America, as he has on Greece, the prototype for the democratic republic that became the United States. Imagine, what a curious notion it may have seemed thousands of years ago when the ancient Greeks put forth the idea, a man being able to engage in self-rule. The originality of ideas articulated by Plato, Socrates, and all the great thinkers of ancient Greece served as an inspiration to America's colonial leaders like Jefferson, Washington, Madison, and Hamilton. 
   It is the American revolution in turn that likely served as an inspiration for the Greeks that were suffocating under the Ottoman rule. 186 years ago the people began a journey that would mark the symbolic rebirth of democracy in the land where those principles to human decency were first espoused. 
   March 25, 1821, is a historic day for all people who treasure freedom. Greece rose up in arms, fought brilliantly and finally overthrew the Ottoman rule, showing the world their deep and abiding commitment to democracy. The flag of revolt was raised by Bishop Germanos of Patras. Cries of Zito I Ellas, ``Long Live Greece,'' and Elefteria I Thanatos, ``Liberty or Death,'' could be heard from the mountains of Suli to the shores of Crete. 
   In fact, the bravery of the Suliotes demonstrated that acts of courage were not limited to the men of Greece. The fierce patriotic villagers of Suli fought the Ottomans in several battles. News of their victories spread to nearby villages and inspired others to revolt. When the women, who were left alone, learned the Ottoman troops were approaching their village, they began dancing the Syrtos, which we still do today, a patriotic Greek dance. One by one with the children in arms, the Suliote women sacrificed themselves for the cause of liberty. They chose death rather than oppression. 
   Stories of sacrifice like that of the Suliotes are plentiful. These actions, as  well as the exploits and victories of the Greek Navy under Miaoulis, Kanaris, Bubulina, and Kolokotronis inspired the people of Europe, who finally brought pressure upon their governments to intervene in the fighting and compel the Sultan to recognize Greek independence, which finally secured the Treaty of Adrianople in 1829. 
   We commemorate Independence Day each year for the same reasons we celebrate our 4th of July. It proved that a united people through sheer will and perseverance can prevail against tyranny. Both of our nations share an illustrious history in defense of this cherished ideal. Both countries have shared a common commitment to the principles of equality and freedom. In many ways, the American experiment might not have been possible without the Greek experience. 
   Indeed, as Thomas Jefferson noted: ``To the ancient Greeks we are all indebted for the light which led ourselves, American colonists, out of the Gothic darkness.'' Democracy and freedom are the guiding beliefs that give hope to millions around the world. 
   Remembering the sacrifice of the brave Greeks who gave their lives for the cause of liberty helps us all realize how important it is to be an active participant in our own democracy. 
   As Plato noted: ``The penalty good men pay for indifference to public affairs is to be ruled by evil men.'' Greeks, like Americans, have never been indifferent to the welfare of mankind. We share a belief that citizens must be engaged in governmental affairs and must work to promote liberty and justice throughout the world. That is why we honor those who secured independence for Greece nearly two centuries ago. Let us always remember their commitment to freedom. God bless America and Zito I Ellas.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and thank you, Representative Berkley, for those kind words on my grandparents' country. I am so proud of my Greek heritage. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today with great pride and in strong support of House Resolution 1024, recognizing the 187th anniversary of Greek independence and celebrating Greek and American democracy. 
   Like the American revolutionaries who fought for independence and established this great Republic we call the land of the free and the home of the brave, Greek freedom fighters began an arduous struggle to win independence for Greece and its people 187 years ago. When the Greeks began this glorious revolution after four centuries of Ottoman oppression, they faced what appeared to be insurmountable odds. It was David versus Goliath. 
   On March 25, 1821, Archbishop Germanos of Patras raised the flag of freedom and was the first to declare Greece free. This day of rebellion was not chosen by chance. This holy day was dedicated to the Mother of God. To the Greeks of 1821, Theotokos was their champion, their savior, their protector. The revolution of 1821 brought independence to Greece and emboldened those who still sought freedom across the world. It was proved to the world that a united people through sheer will and perseverance can prevail against tyranny. 
   The lessons the Greeks taught us then continue to provide strength to victims of persecution around the world today. By honoring the Greek struggle for independence, we reaffirm the values and ideas that make our Nation great. We also remember why freedom is so important. 
   In the history of the Greek war for independence, there were many acts of heroism. From Theodoros Kolokotronis, the leader of the Klephts, who refused to submit to Ottoman domination, to the fiercely patriotic women of Suli, who, left alone, learned that Turkish troops were fast approaching their village, they began to dance the Syrtos, a patriotic Greek dance. One by one, they committed suicide by throwing themselves and their children off a mountain top. They chose to die rather than surrender and face slavery. 
   There was also Athanasios Diakos, a legendary hero, a priest, a patriot, and a soldier. In full knowledge of their fatal fate, he led 500 of his men in a notable stand against 8,000 Ottoman soldiers. Diakos' men were wiped out and he fell into the enemy's hands, where he was tortured before his death. He is the image of a Greek that gave all for love of faith and homeland. Long live his memory. 
   Although many Greeks died, they were undeterred from their ultimate goal. ``Eleftheria I Thanatos,'' liberty or death, became their battle cry. 
   These legends underscore Greece's absolute commitment to independence. As we all know, the price of liberty can be very high, hundreds of thousands of lives. Socrates, Plato, Pericles and many other great minds throughout history warned that we maintain democracy only at a great cost. 
   Our Greek brothers earned their liberty with blood, as did our American forefathers. The freedom we enjoy today is due to the sacrifices made by men and women in the past. I take great pride in both, as I said, my Greek and American heritage. Each time I perform my constitutional duties, I am doing so in the legacy of the ancient Greeks and our American forefathers. 
   As Thomas Jefferson once said, ``To the ancient Greeks we are all indebted for the light which led ourselves, American colonists, out of gothic darkness.'' 
   We celebrate Greek independence to reaffirm the common democratic heritage we share. And as Americans, we must continue to pursue this spirit of freedom and liberty that characterizes both of these great nations.

   Mr. BILIRAKIS. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise in opposition to a bill that is more about politics than children's health insurance. The so-called CHAMP Act represents a missed opportunity to expand SCHIP in a focused manner to help provide health care to our Nation's neediest kids. 
   I'm extremely disappointed that this bill raises taxes and cuts Medicare to expand the program well beyond its original intent. This bill would cut Medicare benefits to more than 45,000 of my constituents who rely on their Medicare Advantage plans for services  and benefits they otherwise could not afford. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge our colleagues to, instead, support the motion to recommit, which will extend the SCHIP program and stop scheduled Medicare physician payment cuts without raising taxes or cutting Medicare. 
   I will oppose this bill if the motion to recommit fails because I oppose politicizing an issue that should be above the partisan differences that too often divide us.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, under current law, military pay rates must be reasonably comparable to those in the private sector with similar skills, education, and experience. 
   Unfortunately, due to budgetary constraints over the years, the military pay increase has not always met this criteria and a ``pay gap'' was created. This gap is not only unfair to our brave men and women in uniform. It also has raised retention and readiness concerns. 
   For this reason, I have introduced H.R. 2027, the Military Pay Improvement Act, which would give them a minimum 3.5 percent pay raise. 
   Our Nation's brave men and women in uniform have fought gallantly to ensure the continued safety, security, and prosperity of this great Nation. I believe it is unacceptable that we task these men and women with extraordinary responsibilities especially, during wartime, and cannot compensate them accordingly. The debt we owe them for their sacrifices can never be repaid. However, my bill will take a small step in the right direction to show our appreciation for their valor. 
   I urge all my colleagues to cosponsor the bill.

   I stand to join my colleague, my good friend from American Samoa, today to express my sincere sympathy and support for those who have suffered as a result of the recent torrential storms in southern Mexico. The damage has been devastating. It is reported that as many as 1 million people have been affected by the flooding, with the homes of an estimated 500,000 people being destroyed or damaged. The Governor of the State of Tabasco has stated that 100 percent of the State's crops have been lost and 80 percent of his state is underwater. What a shame. 
   Sadly, with more than 300,000 people reported trapped inside their homes or on rooftops and additional downpour predicted, it is still too early to quantify the total destruction wrought by these unrelenting rains. Just over 2 months ago, Mexico was ravaged by Hurricanes Dean and Henriette. Now what President Calderon has characterized, and I quote, one of the worst natural disasters in the history of Mexico has followed. 
   I am awed by the perseverance of our friends in Mexico and commend the courage they continue to demonstrate in their efforts to overcome the damage of these storms. Furthermore, I admire the contributions made by relief organizations and private citizens from around the world to assist in the aftermath. My prayers are with the families and friends of those harmed by the perils of this storm. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3320, a measure to provide support for the Museum of the History of Polish Jews, which was introduced by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), my good friend. This bill would authorize funding to assist in the development of the permanent collection of the Museum of the History of Polish Jews. 
   As we all know, the knowledge of history is tremendously important, both to understand our heritage and to our efforts to ensure that mistakes made in the past are avoided now and in the future. The Jewish people have a long and rich history in Poland. In fact, at the beginning of World War II, Poland had the largest Jewish population in Europe. Tragically, almost all of that population in Poland was murdered in the Holocaust. 
   The Polish Government has donated land and has also agreed to provide  millions of dollars for construction of the museum. I ask my colleagues to support this bill, which would go on to assist in the development of the museum's collection. The tremendously rich 1,000-year history of the Jewish people in Poland should not be forgotten, Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to pass this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BILIRAKIS. (CONDEMNING THE NOVEMBER 6, 2007, TERRORIST BOMBING IN AFGHANISTAN -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bipartisan resolution before us condemning the cowardly suicide bombings in Baghlan, Afghanistan, recently which killed at least six members of the Afghan Parliament and dozens of innocent men and women and children. Countless others were wounded. 
   Those who oppose the emergence of a free, democratic and stable Afghanistan mistakenly believe that through such nefarious acts they can deter the Afghan people from realizing their goal of a viable and independent Afghanistan that is secure and free from terrorism. This cowardly act will not deter us, nor will it deter the people of  Afghanistan from achieving those vital goals. It only strengthens the will of the Afghan people to not revert back to the days of totalitarian rule by the Taliban and its radical allies. 
   Last month, the committee met with the Speaker of the Afghan Parliament here in Washington and we discussed the challenges and common goals we all face and share in Afghanistan. I am confident that he and his colleagues, both men and women democratically elected by the people, will carry on, despite the loss of their colleagues in this brutal attack. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that President Karzai of Afghanistan spoke for all of us when he condemned the attacks and noted it was against Islam and said, ``It is the work of the enemies of peace and security in Afghanistan.'' 
   This brutal attack is a solemn reminder that Afghanistan continues to be subjected to a campaign of unrelenting violence by the Taliban, Hizb-I Islami, and other terrorist organizations. The security climate has the potential to further compromise reconstruction and relief efforts by the United States, our allies and the international community. 
   In particular, the poppy cultivation and opium production, which directly supports local warlords and sustains and finances insurgents, militias and terrorist organizations behind these attacks, continues to increase at a staggering rate. In response, this critical resolution demonstrates the continued commitment from the United States and the international community to support the people of Afghanistan in their time of need. 
   I want to thank Congressman Price and Congressman Dreier for their leadership in ensuring that this resolution was considered by the House in a unified, expeditious manner. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BILIRAKIS. (COMPACTS OF FREE ASSOCIATION AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2705, the Compacts of Free Association Amendments Act of 2007. 
   The United States shares a uniquely close history and friendship with the Pacific Island nations of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau. 
   In the aftermath of World War II, the United States administered those islands as Trust Territories until they became independent, sovereign nations in the 1980s and the 1990s. Our relations with those countries are governed by compacts of free association which guarantees certain forms of U.S. assistance and cooperation in exchange for defense rights and obligations that are unique in the world. 
   Those Pacific nations remain stalwart friends of the United States and dependable partisans in the United Nations General Assembly. Some of their citizens continue to serve with great distinction and personal sacrifice in the United States Armed Forces, including Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   The 108th Congress extended and significantly restructured the compacts of free association with Micronesia and the Marshall Islands in the Compact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2003. This bill makes technical corrections, updates, and minor changes to that act, as well as to the Palau Compact. Most importantly, it improves the disaster assistance agreements required by section 105 of the act, which were subsequently negotiated between the parties and presented to Congress. 
   I want to thank the author, the gentlelady from the U.S. Virgin Islands (Mrs. Christensen) for providing us this opportunity to reaffirm our friendship with the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau. 
   The measure before us today has also been modified to include the text of H.R. 3912, the Naval Vessel Transfer Act of 2007, which was requested by the Department of Defense and introduced by the gentleman from California, our great chairman, Tom Lantos. 
   According to the Secretary of the Navy, authority to transfer surplus vessels is an important aspect of our ship disposition strategy. It enables the Navy to manage its inventory while strengthening the ties with our allies by transferring the ships that enhance their defense capabilities. 
   This bill authorizes the transfer of eight decommissioned naval vessels to certain friends and allies of the United States, specifically Lithuania and Turkey and Taiwan. Five ships will be transferred on a grant basis, as excess defense articles, and three will be transferred through foreign military sales under section 21 of the Arms Export Control Act. 
   Importantly, the legislation also requires that any expense incurred by the United States in connection with a transfer authorized by this bill shall be charged to the recipient. Likewise, it states that, to the maximum extent feasible, repair and refurbishment of these vessels shall take place in U.S. shipyards. 
   I urge support of this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to cosponsor H.R. 1912, the Medicare Hearing Enhancement and Auditory Rehabilitation, HEAR, Act. 
   H.R. 1912 will provide for Medicare coverage of hearing aids and auditory rehabilitation services. Medicare is currently specifically prohibited from paying for hearing aids. The HEAR Act repeals this prohibition and directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to determine the most appropriate manner for Medicare to provide this benefit. 
   Hearing problems can make it difficult to understand and follow a doctor's advice, respond to warnings and hear doorbells and alarms. Hearing problems can also make it hard to enjoy talking with friends and family. All of this can be frustrating, embarrassing and even dangerous. It makes good sense to help these people better afford devices, treatments and other services that will improve their quality of life and increase their safety. 
   I urge my colleagues to cosponsor H.R. 1912.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1727, the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act. Millions of Americans suffer from paralysis and mobility impairment. They struggle each and every day to perform even the most basic of tasks that most of us take for granted. The impact this impairment has on the lives and the lives of those who love them and care for them is staggering. As one who has struggled with hearing and vision problems nearly my entire life, I know how difficult any physical impairment can be, both physically and emotionally; but I cannot imagine what people with severe paralysis go through and their constant struggle to maintain hope that they one day will walk or move again. 
   Madam Speaker, I am very proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill, which will encourage collaborative research in paralysis and hasten the discovery of treatments and potential cures to improve the lives of people with paralysis. I am especially pleased that this bill is modeled after legislation I introduced at the beginning of this Congress. My bill, the language of which this bill includes, also has provisions to utilize VA facilities to improve paralysis research and better track the work that is being done in this area within the world's largest system of hospitals. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin for sponsoring this bill, and also Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell and Ranking Member Joe Barton for moving it through their committee. I also want to give special thanks to my father, former Congressman Mike Bilirakis, who first introduced this bill several years ago after meeting the extraordinary men and women for whom this bill was named. His persistence and determination helped build the necessary support to get us where we are today. 
   Although I never had the honor of meeting Christopher or Dana Reeve personally, my father has shared with me their strength, dignity, and courage in dealing with what only people similarly situated can fully understand. They pushed to the national forefront the issue of the need for better research into paralysis and greater emphasis on rehabilitation. I wish they were here to share this moment with us today, though I am sure they are both smiling down on our efforts here today. 
   Madam Speaker, I believe we can and must do more for those suffering from paralysis and mobility impairment. I urge all my colleagues to help take a significant step forward in this area by supporting this bill today.

<DOCNO>Mr. BILIRAKIS. (RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF AMERICA'S WATERWAY WATCH PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 549, a resolution that I have introduced to recognize the importance of increased maritime domain awareness and support the goals of America's Waterway Watch program. It has become clear in the years since 9/11 that all Americans have a shared responsibility for our country's security. That is why I am pleased to highlight the importance of a program that encourages citizens to do their part to strengthen our homeland defenses. 
   The Department of Homeland Security has begun to focus greater attention on potential security threats from individuals aboard small vessels and the importance of increasing maritime domain awareness. Many of us who represent coastal States already know and understand how vitally important it is to take reasonable and appropriate security precautions to secure our maritime borders from such threats. 
   The Coast Guard currently conducts a maritime homeland security public awareness program called America's Waterway Watch. This program, which is the maritime equivalent of a Neighborhood Watch program, encourages boaters and others who live, work or engage in recreational activities around America's waterways to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and report suspicious and unusual activities. 
   This voluntary public outreach program educates America's 70 million boaters about the types of suspicious activities they should be looking for and encourages them to report any such abnormalities to the Coast Guard's National Response Center, which is manned 24 hours a day at 877-24-WATCH. Calls to the center are immediately evaluated and, if necessary, acted upon by local Coast Guard sector assets and other law enforcement authorities. 
   This program, which the Coast Guard promotes by distributing educational materials and other information to recreational boaters, marine dealers, marinas and other businesses located near waterways, acts as a force multiplier for the Coast Guard and local law enforcement to help increase maritime domain awareness and strengthen maritime security. 
   There is no question that we need to improve waterway security and bolster our maritime defenses. However, it is critically important that we do so in a reasonable and responsible manner with the input and advice of America's recreational boaters and manufacturers. 
   I am pleased that the Department of Homeland Security conducted a National Small Vessel Security Summit in June to educate small vessel operators and other stakeholders on current security risks and initiate a dialogue about possible solutions to close whatever gaps exist in our maritime security. 
   Summit participants highlighted America's Waterway Watch and its contributions to increasing maritime domain awareness and urge greater support for it. I agree that America's Waterway Watch program is a sensible and reasonable step toward bolstering our maritime defenses without imposing costly and confusing new regulations on recreational boaters who play an important economic role in my district. I look forward to a continuing and productive dialogue between them and Federal Homeland Security officials before any rules or mandates are proposed. 
   Before I finish, I want to thank Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman JAMES OBERSTAR and Chairman Cummings and Mr.  LaTourette from Ohio and particularly also my Florida colleague, Ranking Member JOHN MICA, for moving this resolution through their committee and allowing it to come on the floor today. I also want to thank my colleagues from Florida who have shown their bipartisan support for this resolution, which is indicative of how important the issue of marine security is for our State. I would like to thank all of our colleagues who have cosponsored this particular resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe it is necessary to emphasize the importance of increasing maritime domain awareness and encourage recreational boaters and others to report suspicious and unusual activities, which is what America's Waterway Watch program does. I urge all of my colleagues to embrace the goals of this program and our shared responsibility for homeland security by supporting House Resolution 549.

<DOCNO>Mr. BILIRAKIS. (RECOGNIZING THE 186TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF GREECE AND CELEBRATING GREEK AND AMERICAN DEMOCRACY -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my deep pride and respect to the Hellenic Republic as it prepares to celebrate the anniversary of Greek Independence Day, which took place on March 25, 1821. 
   I am almost certain that Thomas Jefferson cast an eye across the Atlantic towards Greece when he uttered these words in 1821, ``The flames kindled on the 4th of July, 1776, have not spread over much of the globe to be extinguished by the feeble engines of despotism ..... On the contrary, they will consume these engines and all who work them.'' 
   It is God's handiwork that I am blessed to straddle two cultures that have been beacons of liberty for all of civilization. The place of my birth, the land of the free and the home of the brave, the United States of America, and the land of my ancestors, the birthplace of democracy, the Hellenic Republic, Greece. I honor those brave and resilient Greeks who refused to be assimilated or converted into the Ottoman Empire. They endured centuries of torture and persecution to hang on to their precious heritage and faith. Bishop Germanos of Patras raised the emblem of freedom for Hellenes, the flag bearing a white cross and nine blue and white stripes representing the nine letters, eleftheria, freedom. 
   This was an act of defiance against the Ottoman Empire, marking the beginning of Greece's war of independence on March 25, 1821.     
   Cries of Zito I Ellas, long live Greece; Eleftheria I Thanatos, live free or die, could be heard from the Ionian to the Aegean, from the Peloponeseus to the Dodocanese where my grandparents are from. 
   It took 8 hard-fought years, until 1829, for the Sultan Mahmud to capitulate and surrender. Greek independence  was guaranteed with the Treaty of Adrianople. 
   Greeks were the first Ottoman subjects to secure recognition as an independent and sovereign nation. It was a fierce fight that drew support from Philhellenes the world over. None other than the United States, England, Lord Byron was wonderful in this cause. 
   Undoubtedly, these Philhellenes were indebted to Greece, the world's first advanced civilization, for providing a cultural heritage that has influenced the world with firsts in philosophy, politics, mathematics, science, art and sport with the Olympics, just to name a few. 
   I honor my ancestors for their deep abiding conviction in all that is good and true about mankind. I celebrate their bravery and commitment to freedom and justice. I praise their perseverance and patience in the face of unspeakable hardships. I commend their sacrifices to posterity so that, should there ever be another who seeks to oppress freedom-loving people, we will be able to look upon history and summon up the same courage that those unyielding Hellenes exhibited nearly two centuries ago. 
   Just as our great Founding Fathers studied the model of democracy the ancient Greeks put forth, it is likely our revolution for independence in the late 18th century served as a blueprint for the early 19th-century Greeks to try their hand at freedom and sovereignty. It is a beautiful, symbolic symbiotic relationship that the United States and Greece have shared since, and it continues to enjoy. 
   As George Washington proclaimed at the onset of the American Revolution: ``Our cause is noble. It is the cause of mankind.'' So it was in 1776 America and in 1821 Greece, and so it will always remain. 
   Zito I Ellas, and God bless America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 295, which I introduced. I would like to thank Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter for allowing this resolution to come to the floor. I also want to thank Mr. Courtney and, of course, Mr. Rogers. 
   Among the many things that make our Nation so great is our strong and valiant military. The strength, courage, and dedication of the men and women in uniform keep us safe at home from threats abroad. While Congress rightfully has and continues to recognize these men and women, so too should we honor their family members who serve as constant pillars of strength for them. 
   Behind each and every one of the more than 2 million individuals serving in the United States Armed Forces is a multitude of family members, be it mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, spouses, aunts, uncles, extended family, offering encouragement and providing the emotional and physical support our defenders need to successfully protect our Nation. These family members make daily sacrifices as they forgo time with their loved ones and face increased worry and uncertainty as members of the Armed Forces serve extended tours abroad and engage in more frequent training missions. 
   Even under the most difficult circumstances, when one of our soldiers is wounded in action, these families willingly take on the role of caregiver. They selflessly postpone their personal goals and rearrange their lives to meet the physical and emotional needs of their loved ones as they transition back to civilian life. 
   Our members of the Armed Forces are able to exhibit the level of strength and devotion that is their trademark, in part because of the network of support that they know they have at home. That is why I have introduced H. Con. Res. 295, which recognizes the integral role the families of our servicemembers play in defense of our Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor and privilege that I rise today to express my deepest appreciation to the immediate and extended families of the members of the Armed Forces for their unwavering support that they provide to our Nation's heroes. I urge all my colleagues to do the same by supporting this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. BILIRAKIS. (RECOGNIZING AND HONORING THE EMPLOYEES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of House Resolution 134, which honors and recognizes the contributions the employees of the Department of Homeland Security make to our country's safety and security. 
   I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this resolution with my Homeland Security colleague, CHRISTOPHER CARNEY, who chairs the Management, Investigations and Oversight Subcommittee. I also want to acknowledge other original cosponsors, including my subcommittee ranking member, MIKE ROGERS, full committee chairman BENNIE THOMPSON, and full committee ranking member PETER KING, a man who has worked on Homeland Security issues, and I greatly admire his work. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to help bring this resolution to the floor today because I think that DHS employees are too often overlooked and underappreciated, and unfairly criticized in most cases despite their most dedicated and earnest efforts to do their job, which they do very well. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that they have been tasked with an almost impossible job, I think you will agree, and am confident that DHS employees are doing the very best they can under some extraordinary, difficult circumstances. 
   I was, however, particularly disappointed to learn, as the recent survey shows, that the morale of the department is low, and that DHS employees have less job satisfaction than any other group of Federal employees. That is not good to see. I have heard that the department's employees are concerned that they do not have the resources to do their jobs effectively, that they are not promoted based on merit, that creativity and innovation are not properly rewarded, and, perhaps most troubling, most of them do not believe that they have access to adequate information about what is happening in their department. 
   This needs to change, as far as I am concerned. I am heartened that department secretary, Michael Jackson, has told DHS employees, ``Starting at the top, the leadership team across DHS is committed to address the underlying reason for DHS employee dissatisfaction and suggestions for improvement.'' 
   I also commend DHS Secretary, Michael Chertoff, in comments before our committee last week for acknowledging the problem and promising to fix it. I believe it is imperative to the security of our homeland that the dedicated men and women who carry out the directives and policies that Congress puts forward feel good about themselves and the jobs that they are doing so they can best achieve the very noble goals toward which they are working. 
   It should be proud of the work the more than 200,000 employees at DHS work tirelessly to help prevent and respond to acts of terrorism, natural disasters and other emergencies. I think Secretary Chertoff's directive to the Homeland Security Advisory Council to establish a culture task force to respond on ways to empower, energize,  and create a more mission-focused culture within DHS and among its Federal, State and local partners was a good first step. 
   I would say, however, that the answers lie not in creating more bureaucracy but in streamlining and better defining the mission of DHS headquarters and allowing its component organizations to use their particular talents and expertise to accomplish their individual mission in as efficient, creative, and innovative manner as possible. 
   I also believe we must acknowledge the role that Congress has played and will continue to play in the ultimate success or failure of the department in accomplishing its mission of defending America and saving lives. We in this body must be sensitive to the demands and mandates that we place on DHS employees in the conduct of the war. 
   I think we can all agree that an overwhelming majority of DHS employees are hardworking, as I said. They are dedicated and hardworking individuals who are personally committed to keeping us, our families, our country secure from terrorist attacks and other disasters that could befall this great Nation. 
   We must remember, however, that decentralized congressional jurisdiction over Homeland Security issues and the desire to provide proper oversight often makes it difficult for them to do their job. I hope that, especially as members of the Homeland Security Committee, we do not unintentionally make their jobs more difficult in our desire to do our jobs. 
   I want to thank full committee chairman BENNIE THOMPSON, ranking member PETER KING, subcommittee chairman CHRIS CARNEY, and subcommittee ranking member MIKE ROGERS for bringing this resolution to the floor today. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution and recognize the contributions DHS employees make to protect and secure our Nation. They should know that we understand the daily challenges they face and appreciate the dedication and hard work, the professionalism which they embody, and they conduct themselves in a fine manner. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BILIRAKIS. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1401, RAIL AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this rule but in support of H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act, which will improve the security of our Nation's rail, subway, and bus systems. 
   I am very disappointed that this rule does not allow any Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee to offer amendments, of which there were several. Two of my committee colleagues, Congressman Daniel E. Lungren and Congresswoman Ginny Brown-Waite, have critically important amendments that would significantly improve this bill. 
   However, I am pleased to support this bill, which my Homeland Security Committee approved unanimously. I support this bill because it will provide much-needed protections and security improvements for the millions of Americans that travel on our Nation's buses, our subway system, and our train system. 
   The Rail and Public Transportation Security Act will require Federal officials and transportation providers to assess our vulnerability to terrorist attacks against these public transportation systems and determine ways to improve their security. 
   I am especially pleased that the bill we are considering today includes two proposals that I made during committee consideration of this measure that I believe will strengthen our security against terrorist attacks on rail and mass transportation systems. 
   First, the committee adopted an amendment I offered that requires DHS to conduct physical testing of railcars to determine the most likely successful means of attack against them. This is important because no real-world vulnerability testing has been done on the safety of tank cars carrying dangerous toxic-by-inhalation hazardous materials. My amendment remedies that by requiring such tests so that we can properly assess their current vulnerabilities and protect them to the most practical extent possible. 
   My proposal also requires real-world plume modeling analysis for such attacks to help fill the current gaps in our understanding of these vulnerabilities so that we can better protect our constituents and first responders from attacks on tank cars carrying dangerous materials and mitigate their consequences. 
   Second, this bill incorporates the text of an amendment that I filed during the committee's consideration of H.R. 1401 that requires the security coordinator positions required under section 103 of the bill to be filled by U.S. citizens, a requirement which I think makes sense for several reasons. U.S. citizenship is required for individuals seeking security clearances for access to classified information and materials. I very strongly believe that individuals who will be responsible for coordinating and implementing security plans for our Nation's rail and public transportation systems should be able to access, when appropriate, information to help them do their jobs as effectively as possible. 
   I think it just makes sense to put American citizens in charge of the security for our country. As we saw during the Dubai Ports debacle, many of our constituents demanded that Americans be in charge of America's security, a position with which I hope we can all agree. 
   I want to thank full committee Chairman BENNIE THOMPSON, Ranking Member PETER KING, Transportation Security and Infrastructure Protection Subcommittee Chairwoman SHEILA JACKSON-LEE, and subcommittee Ranking Member DAN LUNGREN for their hard work and open-mindedness in crafting this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have rightly focused much of our time, attention, and resources on securing our Nation's aviation system in the years since 9/11. I believe it is time that we focus on securing our country's public transportation systems, which so many of our constituents use each day.     
   This bill is a significant step in that direction. I urge our colleagues to support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I rise to offer an amendment to the Coast Guard Authorization Act that will strengthen maritime security. My amendment would replace section 708 of the bill which incorporates language from a stand-alone bill I have introduced with tougher language that would codify and expand a Coast Guard pilot program to collect biometric information on aliens interdicted at sea. 
   My amendment requires the Coast Guard to move forward on this program within 1 year, and provide a cost  analysis to Congress on expanding these capabilities in other Coast Guard and Department of Homeland Security vessels and units. 
   As part of this analysis, my amendment would encourage DHS to give priority to expanding mobile biometric collection capabilities to assets and areas that are most likely to encounter illegal border crossings in the maritime environment.     
   The efforts of the Coast Guard in this area show great promise. Since the collection of limited biometrics on individuals interdicted at sea began, the Coast Guard has collected biometric data from 1,513 migrants resulting in nearly 300 matches against databases of wanted criminals, immigration violators, and others who have previously encountered government authorities. Instead of being released to repeat their dangerous and illegal behavior, these individuals are now detained and prosecuted.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Chairman, in the early morning hours of August 29, 2005, a catastrophe obliterated New Orleans. The ocean had breached the city's levees and our Nation looked on while tens of thousands clung to rooftops. Hundreds of thousands of Americans were suddenly homeless and scattered across the country. Many coastal States have been in crisis ever since, including my home State of Florida. 
   Upon arriving in Congress this year, I introduced two bills to help with this crisis. One bill would strongly encourage homeowners to hurricane-proof their homes by providing a tax credit for the cost of specific home modifications. The second bill I introduced would authorize Gulf Coast States to enter into an interstate compact to pool their resources and spread the risk of disaster. 
   Today, I am pleased to have an opportunity to vote on H.R. 3355, the Homeowners' Defense Act. This important legislation authorizes loans to States that will have to be repaid to the Treasury. This is a fiscally sound approach to disaster planning. Further, Chairman Frank, with my colleague, Ms. Brown-Waite, who has been working on this issue for 4 years, and the sponsors of this bill, and as a result of genuine bipartisanship, the manager's amendment will implement a critically needed Federal catastrophe fund. 
   I thank the sponsors of this legislation, and I thank the chairman and Ms. Brown-Waite for their efforts in bringing this bill to the floor. I strongly encourage my colleagues to vote for this bill and the manager's amendment and protect Americans from the devastating effects of natural disasters.

<DOCNO>Mr. BILIRAKIS. (CONDEMNING MIDEAST TV PROGRAMMING THAT INCITES VIOLENCE -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. I want to thank the gentleman from Texas for the time. 
   I rise in support of House Resolution 1069, and I urge swift passage. 
   Along with Mr. Crowley's original resolution, I introduced House Resolution 1308, condemning the broadcasting of incitement of violence against Americans and the United States in Middle Eastern-based media. 
   I am pleased to have worked with Mr. Crowley in combining our two resolutions to come up with the product we have today. I am grateful that my colleagues on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, led by Chairman Berman and Ranking Member ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN, in a display of bipartisanship, unanimously voted for my amendment in the nature of a substitute to House Resolution 1069. 
   Anti-American incitement of violence is escalating in quality and quantity, fueled by the rapid growth of satellite television throughout the Arab world. In 2008, al-Manar TV broadcast over two dozen video clips of insurgent bombings against U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq, while one of its correspondents implicitly threatened the USS Cole with attack. Further, Iranian state-controlled TV channels repeatedly broadcast calls for ``Death to America,'' and, we have already heard al-Aqsa TV broadcast a puppet show depicting an Arab child stabbing the President of the United States. 
   Instead of denouncing and addressing such incitement, many countries in the region effectively provide financial, material, or technological support to purveyors of incitement. Al-Manar and al-Aqsa, among others, are transmitting on the satellite providers Nile-Sat, controlled by the Egyptian government, and Arabsat, controlled by the Arab League. Given the dangers such incitement poses to American service and civilian personnel in the region, it is long past time for the U.S. and other responsible nations to stop this growing threat. Support of House Resolution 1069 is, therefore, critical. 
   Among other things, this resolution condemns the broadcast of anti-American incitement to violence and hatred against the Americans, Israelis, and the West by Middle East-based media. It urges Middle Eastern governments, U.S. allies, and other responsible nations to officially and publicly repudiate purveyors of such incitement to violence against Americans and Israelis. It calls on the President to designate al-Aqsa as a specially designated global terrorist entity, and to designate those satellite providers that contract with purveyors of incitement to violence as such. It demands that Hamas recognize Israel's right to exist, renounce violence and terrorism, and accept all past peace agreements with Israel. Most importantly, it takes into consideration state sponsorship of anti-American incitement to violence when determining our aid to and relations with regional governments. 
   We must stop Middle East-based media from inciting violence against us. 
   Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank Mr. Crowley. I thank you for the time. This is an important resolution that will enhance our security and protect our soldiers and citizens overseas. I urge its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. BILIRAKIS. (TO AWARD POSTHUMOUSLY A CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL TO CONSTANTINO BRUMIDI -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Thank you very much. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great pride in support of Senate bill 254 to posthumously award Constantino Brumidi the Congressional Gold Medal. We have just heard from the previous speakers the life and times of this inspired artist with whom I'm very proud to share the same Greek heritage. 
   Many walk through the halls of Congress, but do not know much about the man who dedicated most of his professional life to beautifying it. 
   Constantino Brumidi, a Greek and Italian immigrant, came to America in search of freedom and opportunity. What he accomplished rivals most any immigrant success story. Constantino Brumidi's life and work exemplify the lives of millions of immigrants who came to pursue the American dream.     
   Soon after becoming an American citizen, Brumidi was commissioned to decorate the structure which houses the greatest democratic institution in world history. This feat is a testament both to Brumidi's resolve, and our great Nation's willingness to embrace those who want to share in the American dream. 
   I would also love this award to be accompanied with a statue that would adorn the Capitol Visitors Center. That's why I have introduced H.R. 1313. A statue of Brumidi, along with a Congressional Gold Medal, will serve as a shining example of American ideals and inspire people everywhere who wish to embrace freedom. 
   While it has taken over 130 years, it is never too late for the installment of this Gold Medal in recognition of the contributions of Constantino Brumidi to the Nation. Congratulations, and I urge all my colleagues to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. BILIRAKIS. (ECUMENICAL PATRIARCHATE -- (House of Representatives - May 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my profound concern with the continued violations of religious and human rights that the Republic of Turkey has perpetrated against the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the Holy See for over 300 million Orthodox faithful. 
   While I understand and appreciate the role Turkey must fulfill as a strategic ally in our global war on terror, I am immensely disappointed in the demonstrated lack of progress Turkey has made in support of religious tolerance. 
   As cochair of the Congressional Caucus on Hellenic Affairs and as a member of the House committees on Foreign Affairs and Homeland Security, I am extremely sensitive to nurturing the growing relationship between the United States and Turkey. The key factors in this relationship are ensuring Turkey's growth as a secular, constitutional democracy. 
   Americans know the conditions that characterize secular democracies must, by necessity, include provisions for freedom of religion. While Turkey has made strides in other areas of modernization, it still fails to meet the standards of a civilized world in granting its citizens religious freedom. 
   We seek no extraordinary demands on Turkey, simply to allow its citizens and institutions to be free of harassment based on religion. It's as simple as that. 
   Like his predecessors before him, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, worldwide leader of Orthodox Christians, has made extraordinary efforts to bridge the gap between Christianity and Islam. The Patriarch, whom the Orthodox Church considers the first among equals, has been an ambassador of goodwill for the Ecumenical Patriarchate. 
   In fact, the Ecumenical Patriarch has been proactive in assisting Turkey's cause on the world stage. His excellency, Bartholomew, has stated that Turkey's admission into the European Union would `` ..... provide a concrete example and a powerful symbol of mutually beneficial cooperation between the Western and Islamic worlds and put an end to the talk of the death of civilizations. 
   ``This in turn would be a true strengthening of Europe and the European ideals that converge with the values of the `pilgrims of the book' spoken by the current Prime Minister of Turkey.'' 
   The Ecumenical Patriarchate has a record of reaching out and working for peace and reconciliation amongst all faiths and has fostered dialogue among Christians, Jews and Muslims. What the Greek Orthodox community and all watchdogs of religious freedom throughout the world are asking for in return is simply that Turkey abides by the tenets of its constitution, which secures religious rights for all of its citizens. 
   In accordance with the administration's ambitious agenda over the next 2 years to further develop a U.S.-Turkey strategic relationship, I urge my fellow Members to support House Resolution 373, of which I am an original cosponsor, so that we may impress upon Turkey the need to grant the Ecumenical Patriarchate ecclesiastic succession; the right to train clergy of all nationalities; and respect for human rights and property rights of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. 
   By encouraging Turkey to continue the achievements that democratization has yielded thus far for its society, we will be working to promote and safeguard religious human rights for the Ecumenical Patriarchate. For this, we and nearly 300 million Orthodox Christians would be eternally grateful.

<DOCNO>Mr. BILIRAKIS. (MICHAEL BILIRAKIS DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS SPINAL CORD INJURY CENTER -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4264 to name the Department of Veterans Affairs Spinal Cord Injury Center at the James Haley VA Medical Center in Tampa, Florida, after my father, former Congressman Michael Bilirakis. 
   I would like to thank Mr. Miller for introducing this legislation, my colleagues from Florida for their support, and you, Mr. Speaker, as well as Chairman Filner and Ranking Member Buyer for their leadership. I appreciate all of their hard work in recognizing my father's dedication to providing our veterans suffering from spinal cord injuries with a much needed state-of-the-art facility. 
   As a veteran himself, my father came to Washington in 1982 to be a strong advocate for our Nation's veterans in the halls of Congress. He served as a member of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs during all of his 12 terms in office. During the last 6 years of his career, he served as vice-chairman of the full committee. He also founded the Military Veterans Caucus in the 108th Congress. 
   Through his work on the committee, my father sought to recognize the great contributions of our Nation's veterans and the sacrifices made by their families. He consistently fought to ensure that veterans received the benefits and services that they earned through their military service. In fact, he often said that veterans' benefits were our one true ``entitlement'' because individuals had to earn their benefits by wearing our Nation's military uniform. It took 12 years to secure the funding, but the construction of the new Tampa SCI Center was one of my father's most important achievements in Congress. 
   There are over 3,000 veterans suffering from spinal cord injury disabilities living within the Tampa VA spinal cord injury service area, as well as another 3,000 to 4,000 veterans with spinal cord dysfunctions living in the region. Before the construction of this facility, the Tampa SCI Unit occupied space originally designed for psychiatric patients and was not well suited for the unique needs of SCI patients. My father made getting this spinal cord treatment center one of his top priorities while in Congress. As a matter of fact, he has dedicated his life to veterans; he is still working for veterans. 
   In total, he secured $44 million for the construction of this facility, which serves as a much needed addition to the James Haley VA Medical Center. Since opening in February of 2002, it has provided essential services to local veterans suffering from these debilitating injuries. 
   My father will be so proud--and I appreciate all of you, my colleagues--and honored; he would be honored to have his name attached to the Spinal Cord Injury Center that he worked so hard to establish while in Congress. His leadership and his advocacy on behalf of veterans' issues continues today, as I said, and this bill brings the deserved recognition for one of his great accomplishments and his devoted mission to support our Nation's brave men and women.

<DOCNO>Mr. BILIRAKIS. (AUTHORIZING COAST GUARD MOBILE BIOMETRIC IDENTIFICATION PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of legislation I have introduced, H.R. 2490, which would codify and expand a Coast Guard pilot program to collect biometric information on aliens interdicted at sea. I want to thank Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson for his willingness to move this bill through our committee and to the floor for consideration today. I also want to thank Peter King, our ranking member, for his support of this measure and his determined effort to strengthen our homeland security, first as chairman of our committee and now as ranking member. I am honored to serve with both of these great men. 
   The House unanimously adopted H.R. 2490 as an amendment to the Coast Guard Authorization Act several months ago. However, I believe it is important for this body to act on H.R. 2490 independently, given the uncertain prospect for enactment of the Coast Guard bill in this Congress. 
   My bill requires the Coast Guard to move forward on its biometrics at sea effort within 1 year and provide a cost analysis to Congress on expanding these capabilities to other Coast Guard and Department of Homeland Security vessels and units. As part of this analysis, my bill also encourages DHS to give priority to expanding mobile biometric collection capability to assets and areas that are most likely to encounter illegal border crossings in the maritime environment. 
   The efforts of the Coast Guard in this area show great promise. Since the collection of limited biometrics on individuals interdicted at sea began, the Coast Guard has collected biometric data from 1,530 migrants, resulting in nearly 30 matches against databases of wanted criminals, immigration violators and others who have previously encountered government authorities. Instead of being released to repeat their dangerous and illegal behavior, these individuals are now detained and prosecuted. The U.S. Attorney's Office in San Juan, Puerto Rico, has prosecuted more than 118 individuals for violations of U.S. immigration laws and other offenses based substantially  on information obtained through the biometrics program. 
   The Coast Guard reports that illegal migration in the Mono Pass, an area between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, has been reduced by 50 percent in just the past year as a result of the biometrics program. By leveraging its relationships with DHS, the Coast Guard now has access to millions of fingerprint files it can use to positively identify individuals encountered at sea, those who are without identification and are suspected of attempting to illegally enter the United States. 
   Now that the Coast Guard has determined the most effective way to collect biometrics at sea, the Department of Homeland Security needs to determine the most appropriate way to move forward and expand this effort as cost effectively as possible, which is what my bill requires. Given the success of existing efforts on biometrics by the Coast Guard, I believe that it is imperative that we move forward on this bill so that these efforts are cost effective and will do the most good. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is clear that the collection of biometrics at sea by the Coast Guard is already helping greatly deter illegal migration and prevent the capture and release of dangerous individuals so we are not releasing them anymore, and that is very important. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to help further that effort by voting for this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, before I yield back the balance of my time, I urge this House to consider both the authorization and appropriations bills this year, the Homeland Security authorization and appropriations bills. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   I rise today in support of H.R. 3815, the Homeland Security Open Source Information Enhancement Act, sponsored by my committee colleague, Representative ED PERLMUTTER, who is a great Member, by the way. 
   H.R. 3815 will require the Secretary to establish an open source collection analysis and dissemination program within the Department of Homeland Security. This program would help facilitate information-sharing between the Federal Government and State, local and private sector officials to take advantage of the vast amount of information that is publicly available through open sources. 
   Importantly, the bill would require the Secretary to protect the privacy rights of individuals, including by conducting a private impact statement on the Department's open source program. 
   H.R. 3815 also requires the Inspector General to audit the use and dissemination of open source information to evaluate the effectiveness of the Department's activities in this area and its consistency with the open source policies of the Director of National Intelligence. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe the Department of Homeland Security should take full advantage of open source information and ensure its proper dissemination to appropriate entities to maximize our homeland security. I encourage our colleagues to help move the Department closer toward that goal by supporting H.R. 3815.

   I rise today in support of H.R. 5983, the Homeland Security Network Defense and Accountability Act, sponsored by my committee colleague Congressman James Langevin. 
   H.R. 5983 includes several provisions designated to enhance the information security of the Department of Homeland Security and improve oversight of contractors that provide network services to the Department. 
   Specifically, the bill requires the Chief Information Officer at the Department to have 5 years of executive leadership and information technology experience. The bill also mandates that all contractors and service providers for the Department have compatible information security policies and programs. 
   Additionally, the bill directs the Department's Inspector General to develop appropriate security protocols for the Department and to annually test various aspects of the Department against these protocols as well as Federal Information Security Management Act requirements. The bill requires procurement officers to review contractors' security postures prior to awarding a contract and directs the Inspector General to conduct both performance and programmatic reviews of the Department's computer network. The bill does not exempt the Department from Federal Information Security Management Act requirements but directs DHS to focus its efforts on elements that will improve its overall security posture. 
   DHS has expressed some concerns about the potential impact of the added responsibilities under the bill, particularly on the Department's ability to recruit and retain qualified individuals to fill these important positions. I hope that we can address these concerns as the legislative process moves forward. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support passage of H.R. 5983 to strengthen the security of information at the Department.

   I rise today in support of H.R. 6193, the Improving Public Access to Documents Act, sponsored by Homeland Security Committee colleague, Representative Jane Harman, who does such great work. 
   H.R. 6193 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop and administer policies, procedures, and programs to implement the President's controlled unclassified information framework to standardize the many sensitive but unclassified categories of information. The bill requires the Secretary to coordinate with the Archivist of the United States and consult with representatives of State and local governments, privacy and civil rights advocacy groups, and the private sector in this effort. 
   This bill codifies many of the policies and procedures included in a May 7, 2008 executive memorandum, which directs executive department heads to begin consolidating the over 100 known sensitive but unclassified designations. 
   Information designated as sensitive but unclassified doesn't merit a security classification under Executive Order 12958 regarding classified national security information but is still sensitive that general disclosure is not in the public's best interest. Information that is law enforcement sensitive or designated for official use only are two examples of information that will now be marked as controlled unclassified information under this new construct. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am confident that H.R. 6193 is a helpful first step in standardizing the many types of sensitive but unclassified information so as to improve homeland security information sharing. I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6098, the Personnel Reimbursement for Intelligence Cooperation and Enhancement of Homeland Security Act, sponsored by a great Member, again, another great Member that I am fortunate to serve with on the Homeland Security Committee, Congressman DAVE REICHERT. 
   This bill, which I have cosponsored, would clarify that grant recipients under the State Homeland Security Grant Program, and the Urban Area Security Initiative, can use grant funding to help pay for analysts at State and local fusion centers. 
   This clarification is critically important because some of these fusion centers have had to limit their operations and some may have to cease operations altogether because of unnecessary restrictions on Federal funding, despite the intent of the 9/11 bill that became law last year. 
   Congressman Reichert's bill wisely updates current law to make clear that UASI and SHSGP funding can be used to hire and retain these intelligence analysts without a limitation on how long grants can be used for this purpose. 
   This bill also would allow grant recipients to use up to 50 percent of their annual grant award for personnel and operational costs, including overtime. 
   Mr. Speaker, state and local fusion centers play an important role in filling gaps in information sharing with the Federal Government and facilitating the dissemination of critical information to States and localities. 
   I encourage all of our colleagues to help these centers maximize our ability to detect, prevent and respond to criminal and terrorist activity by supporting H.R. 6098.

   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of H.R. 5170, the Department of Homeland Security Component Privacy Officer Act, sponsored by my committee colleague, Chris Carney. 
   H.R. 5170 would direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to designate a full-time privacy official within components of the Department. These components include the Transportation Security Administration, Citizenship and Immigration Services, Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, FEMA, the Coast Guard, the Science and Technology Directorate, the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, and NPPD. 
   The bill provides that each component privacy official will report directly to the Department's Chief Privacy Officer. Each component privacy officer shall have primary responsibility for implementing the Department's privacy policy within its component. 
   The bill provides for a dual direct report relationship to both the privacy official's component head and the Department's Chief Privacy Officer in carrying out his or her duties. 
   I think we all can agree that protecting the privacy of our Nation's citizens is of great importance, and that privacy considerations should be integrated into the decision-making process at all DHS components.     
   I am pleased that the Department has already recognized the importance of privacy protection. In November, 2007, Secretary Chertoff signed a DHS memorandum entitled Designation of Component Level Privacy Officers. This memorandum calls for the designation of full-time component privacy officers at CBP, ICE, FEMA, the Bureau of Citizen and Immigration Services, the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, and the Science and Technology Directorate. Both TSA, US-VISIT, and the Bureau of Citizen and Immigration Services had their own privacy officials for some time. 
   H.R. 5170 takes the additional step of statutorily mandating component privacy officials. The approach this bill takes certainly has much merit, though I hope that we can address some of the Department's concerns about the impacts the bill's mandates may have on the ability of the next Secretary to manage the administration of the Department as the legislative process moves on. 
   Mr. Speaker, having said that, I intend to support H.R. 5170 and encourage all our colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I rise today in support of H.R. 5531, the Next Generation Screening Act, sponsored by my Homeland Security Committee ranking member, Peter King. Since 2003, the Department of Homeland Security has deployed radiation detectors at our Nation's ports of entry. The Department has also engaged in an aggressive research and development program to test, evaluate, and deploy the next generation of radiation detection technology to detect and identify radioactive material. 
   This technology, known as the Advanced Spectroscopic Portals, has the potential to provide improved detection capabilities, while reducing the number of nuisance alarms caused by the legitimate transport of non-threat-related radioactive material, such as cat litter and fertilizer. 
   H.R. 5531 requires the Director of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office and Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection to enter into an agreement regarding the minimum standards of operational functionality in order to deploy ASP systems. This legislation also clarifies what is meant by previously passed statute. 
   Last year's omnibus appropriations bill stated the Secretary shall submit separate and distinct certifications prior to the procurement of Advanced Spectroscopic Portal monitors for primary and secondary deployment that address the unique requirements for operational effectiveness for each type of deployment. H.R. 5531 requires the Secretary to develop a quantitative definition of significant increase in operational effectiveness and develop appropriate metrics for measuring this effectiveness. 
   In addition to authorizing the ASP program, this bill also authorizes the Securing the Cities Initiative, a pilot program to prevent the illicit transport of radiological material in the New York City metropolitan area. The Securing the Cities Initiative has fostered unprecedented collaboration and coordination among its Federal, State, and local partners, and has advanced the security of the New York metropolitan region. 
   The bill authorizes $40 million for the initiative, the same amount that was appropriated in fiscal year 2008 to ensure its continuation in fiscal year 2009.

   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 901, congratulating and recognizing Tim Tebow for his many athletic accomplishments, including winning the 2007 Heisman Trophy and his humanitarian and academic achievements. 
   Before enrolling at my alma mater, the University of Florida, Tim spent three summers in the Philippines engaging in missionary work. He spent time at an orphanage listening to the stories of daily struggles that these children face and giving him the opportunity to be a guiding and positive influence in their lives. His example inspired UF football coach Urban Meyer to take a mission trip to the Dominican Republic earlier this month. 
   His leadership on the football field began when he played quarterback at Nease High School in Ponte Verde and led the Nease Panthers to a State title in 2006. Tim joined the University of Florida Fighting Gator football team in 2006. He helped the Gators win the 2006 SEC championship as well as the BCS national championship that same season. 
   During the 2007 season, Tim had an astounding total of 51 touchdowns, setting the SEC record. He became the first sophomore to ever win the Heisman Trophy last December. What makes his story even more incredible is that he did it all while maintaining a 3.77 grade point average, majoring in family, youth, and community sciences. Incredible. 
   Madam Speaker, this young man has served as a great role model for students both at the University of Florida and throughout the Nation due to his exemplary character, his academic achievement, and his unparalleled achievements on the football field. He has said himself that his priorities, in order, are faith, family, academics, and football. 
   It is with admiration that I rise today to honor his achievements by supporting this resolution.

This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security to continue its current practice of producing unclassified versions of the majority of its classified products. 
   For example, just last month when the Department produced its classified periodic review of border security issues facing the United States, it produced an unclassified version as well. The bill specified that law enforcement agencies, emergency first responders, and private sector customers should benefit from these products, thus reinforcing the Department's commitment to State and local entities. Hopefully, this will encourage the widest possible dissemination of these unclassified products to better inform our frontline agencies. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4806 will further strengthen ongoing efforts to prevent the over-classification of homeland security information, and I look forward to its passage.

Mr. Speaker, even though the tragic events of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus took place so long ago, the pain and suffering of this tragic occasion still ripples throughout the Greek and Cypriot communities. 
   This anniversary is a time for America to solemnly remember the Turkish military invasion of the Island of Cyprus, to mourn those who lost their lives, and to condemn the continued occupation. 
   On July 20, 1974, in blatant violation of international law, Turkey violently invaded Cyprus and captured the northern part of the island. As a result of the invasion, approximately 5,000 Cypriots were killed and more than 1,400 Greek Cypriots, including four Americans of Cypriot descent, are still missing. 
   Since the invasion, Turkey has established a heavily armed military occupation that continues to control nearly 40 percent of Cyprus. Forced expulsions of Greek Cypriots on the occupied land have left more than 160,000 displaced persons. 
   Another tragic result of this 33-year occupation is the division of the Greek and Turkish Cypriots who since have forcibly left their homes. This cracking of the Cypriot Nation is a crime against society and the people of Cyprus that can only be resolved by ending this occupation. 
   Since the invasion, international governing bodies and human rights groups have condemned Turkey's flagrant abuse of international law and violation of Cyprus's national sovereignty. 
   Mr. Speaker, 33 years is just too long. The international community has helped shepherd a peace process and settlement that will unite the island, its people, institutions and economy. The United Nations Security Council, the European Union and the United States have all played key roles in trying to bring a practical and fair resolution of this 33-year nightmare. 
   On the occasion of this anniversary, America needs to take a long and hard look at its own commitment toward helping the Turkish Cypriot crisis reach a lasting and enduring peace, free from occupation, division and oppression. 
   As a new member of the European Union, the Republic of Cyprus has proven a committed and influential partner in Europe. Despite having a large portion of its land illegally occupied, Cyprus's successful social and economic integration into the European Community is a testament to its  focus and dedication to democratic values and regional cooperation. 
   The Republic of Cyprus has also worked alongside its European neighbors to bring about a stronger integration of Turkish and Greek Cypriot interests for the good of the island. This has included a partial lifting on restriction of movement across the ceasefire line that continues to forcibly divide Cyprus. As a result, since April of 2003, more than 13 million Greek and Turkish Cypriots have crossed without incident. Incredible. Additionally, the per capita income of Turkish Cypriots has nearly tripled in the last 3 years because of an aggressive integration policy by the Republic of Cyprus and its European neighbors. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that because of this continued integration between Turkish and Greek Cypriots, and the economic and political successes that the Republic of Cyprus so readily wants to share with its neighbors, it is possible to bring closure to this 33-year occupation. 
   Indeed, on July 8, 2006, the President of the Republic of Cyprus, Tassos Papadopoulos, and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat agreed to formally begin consultations with the ultimate aim of a peaceful reunification and an end to Turkey's military occupation. 
   Despite the early successes of what has since been known as the ``July 8th Agreement'' and the best efforts of the Cyprus government, the Turkish Cypriots have not followed through on their commitment to continue this dialogue and a path to peace. 
   Let's resolve this issue, Mr. Speaker. Thirty-three years is too long.  
   In fact, Mr. Speaker, only last week, President Papadopoulos attempted to jumpstart the Island's reunification efforts and resume the July 8 Agreement process. Though he initially accepted this gesture, Turkish Cypriot leader Talat ended up cancelling the proposed meeting. 
   Mr. Speaker, the United States, and this Congress, should demonstrate its commitment and support for the July 8 Agreement as a way toward ending the Turkish-Cypriot divide on the Island of Cyprus. I have introduced legislation, H. Res. 405, which expresses strong support for the implementation of the July 8 Agreement. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to act and help this body put our own stamp of support on the July 8 process by supporting this resolution. 
   Cyprus has long been a strong and faithful ally of the United States. It continues to work with us in the Global War on Terrorism and has supported our efforts in both Afghanistan and Iraq. 
   Aside from providing overflight rights and port access, the government of Cyprus has joined only a handful of nations who have acted on their commitment to cancel Iraq's outstanding debt. 
   Mr. Speaker, 33 years is long enough. It is not impossible to conceive one-day having a Cyprus that is unified under bizonal, bi-communal federation with a single sovereignty, single international personality and single citizenship with respect for human rights. and fundamental freedoms for all Cypriots. 
   America, a friend of the Cypriot people, owes it to them to do everything in their power to support peace and an end to this illegal occupation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for H.R. 3546, which authorizes the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program at fiscal year 2006 levels through 2012. 
   Earlier this year I was disappointed to learn of the administration's draconian reduction in funding which would have limited the ability of our law enforcement officers to obtain the necessary manpower, equipment, and other tools to reduce criminal activity, putting them in a reactive rather than proactive mode. 
   The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program allows States and local governments to improve their criminal justice system by supporting activities that help prevent and control crime. 
   H.R. 3546 authorizes $1.095 billion annually through FY2012 for the grant program. It is critically important that States and local law enforcement agencies have access to these much-needed resources, which help fight crime and drug proliferation in our communities. 
   Madam Speaker, we must properly fund our local law enforcement officers, who put their lives on the line daily to keep the rest of us safe. Therefore, I encourage my colleagues to join me in voting for this very important legislation to keep our neighborhoods safe!

<DOCNO>Mr. BILIRAKIS. (A QUARTERLY REPORT CARD -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Like all of us, I came to this body seeking to make a difference for my constituents and all Americans alike. We have chosen a life in public service and promised to fight for what we believe in. That is what we are doing. We promised to fight to give future generations the opportunity we have. We promised to fight to continue the prosperity of this great Nation. 
   Unfortunately, as I reflect back on the first quarter of the 110th Congress, I do believe that the Democrat leadership has broken their promise to the American people. Supporting our courageous men and women in the military and addressing the gulf States homeowners' insurance crisis are two of the most important issues my constituents raised to me. 
   Despite many Members' requests to address these vital matters in a timely, bipartisan manner, our pleas have fallen on deaf ears. It is with great disappointment that I go back to my district with the expectations of the American people so far unfulfilled. 
   Regardless of the individual opinions regarding the war in Iraq, every American supports our brave men and women who serve this country with great honor and distinction. 
   Just as we are forever indebted to yesterday's servicemembers who wore this country's uniform, we will never be able to fully repay today's gallant heroes. I am so very proud to serve on the veterans committee. 
   We task the members of our Armed Forces with extraordinary responsibilities. The very least we can do is provide them with the necessary tools and resources to accomplish their mission. Nearly a month has gone by since the House approved its version of the Iraq emergency supplemental appropriations bill, a bill so bad that USA Today editorialized against it and said: ``It is hard to say which is worse, leaders offering peanuts for a vote of this magnitude, or Members allowing their votes to be bought for peanuts.'' 
   It is bad enough that the bill contained pork projects intended to secure Members' votes. It is equally as troubling that we have been delayed in going to conference with the Senate to work out a bipartisan compromise worthy of our men and women in uniform. The American Legion and the VFW have urged this Congress to pass a clean supplemental funding bill, which will get our troops the resources they need as quickly as possible. I am so proud of the American Legion and VFW for stepping up. They continue to be our heroes. Every day we fail to act is another day we dishonor our troops' sacrifices and valor. 
   The other vital issue to many Americans, particularly in my district and in the State of Florida, the Gulf Coast States, is the skyrocketing cost of homeowners' insurance. Many of our States are plagued by natural disasters that cost millions, if not billions, of dollars in damage. It is a terrible situation.     
   As a result, homeowners' insurance rates have simply become unaffordable in many areas of our country. In my State, in far too many instances these rates have tripled forcing many to leave the areas they call home. For others in the gulf coast region, this has become the most financially crippling problem we have faced in years. 
   My constituents have entrusted me to bring this issue into the national debate and come up with a solution. Yet as we approach the beginning of another hurricane season, this body has failed to act. 
   Earlier this month, it was predicted we would have a very active hurricane season. Many of us who represent coastal States have tried to bring this issue to the forefront, both Democrats and Republicans, but our attempts seem to have been in vain so far. As the result of an apathetic Democratic leadership, my constituents have been abandoned by the very people they have entrusted to protect them, and what a shame that is. 
   Along with the numerous bills introduced in the House which would help alleviate this crisis, I introduced H.R. 913, the Hurricane and Tornado Mitigation Investment Act. My bill would provide tax incentives for individuals to better protect their property against these deadly storms. As a result of strengthening their homes and businesses to better withstand these disasters, homeowners' insurance would drop and many constituents would continue raising their families in the place they call home. 
   I can't tell you how many times I have talked to my constituents, people who have lived in Florida for over 20-25 years and wanted to raise their kids in Florida or retire in the State of Florida, and they are forced to leave the State. And I know there are other States in that position as well. I implore this Congress to consider my and other insurance-related bills to help these Americans in their time of need. 
   When the Democrat leadership took the House gavel and control of Congress in January, they accepted it in partnership not partisanship. It is my sincere hope that we soon will debate serious topics that address the needs of this country in a bipartisan manner rather than political posturing. 
   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue the prosperity of this great Nation. 
   May God bless our troops. We owe them so much, and may He continue to watch over the United States of America.

<DOCNO>Mr. BILIRAKIS. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL HURRICANE PREPAREDNESS WEEK -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Melancon) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mario Diaz-Balart) for sponsoring this resolution, which I strongly support. It is a very important resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this resolution supporting the goals and ideals of National Hurricane Preparedness Week. 
   As we approach what is expected to be yet another very active hurricane season, it is imperative that we help raise awareness on the importance of being the best prepared for the worst-case scenario. 
   How can any of us ever forget the horrific scenes etched into our minds after witnessing the devastation caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita? Nearly 2 years later, the gulf coast region and those affected by these storms are still suffering. 
   I was alarmed when FEMA Director David Paulison testified before the Homeland Security Committee last week and informed us that FEMA's revised national response plan will not be completed until sometime in June.  
   Given that we have already had a named storm before the official beginning of hurricane season, I hope FEMA is working expeditiously to get this plan finalized.     
   Mr. Speaker, we all agree that the response of the State, local and Federal Governments were inadequate, and there is much work to be done. However, disaster readiness should not solely lie on the shoulders of government. I hope that individuals will use this week as a reminder that they, too, must prepare themselves, as Mr. Diaz-Balart said. 
   I have urged my constituents to develop family disaster plans and create supply kits. It is also important that they follow local weather forecasts and heed any emergency hurricane warnings they receive. These and other simple steps can help save lives. 
   Mr. Speaker, while I'm pleased that we are here today to debate this vitally important issue, I also must express some frustration. Most of our States are plagued with some form of natural disaster. In my State, these menaces have caused the most financially crippling crisis we have been confronted with in years, namely, the unaffordable costs of homeowners' insurance. 
   Due to the onslaught of hurricanes and tornados in recent years, these rates have doubled or even tripled. This has caused many of my constituents throughout Florida, of course, to leave their homes or risk everything by opting not to get coverage. 
   While there are no overnight solutions to help solve this crisis, I believe that this body can take steps to help encourage citizens in disaster-prone areas to better mitigate their property from their storms. I have introduced H.R. 913, the Hurricane Tornado and Mitigation Investment Act, which would accomplish that goal. I'm proud my good friend from Florida is an original cosponsor. 
   Mr. Speaker, some Members have raised concerns that this is only a Florida or a coastal State issue. However, I will conclude my remarks with this statistic. For every dollar spent by FEMA for mitigating disasters, about $4 is saved on what would have eventually been spent fixing damage from a storm. That's significant. 
   Taxpayers from every State have contributed billions of dollars spent recovering from the aftermaths of hurricanes such as Katrina and Rita. Encouraging our citizens to safeguard their property will save Americans in every State billions of dollars. 
   Furthermore, it would reduce the skyrocketing costs of homeowners' insurance and allow my constituents and constituents all over the country, your constituents, Mr. Speaker, to raise their children in the State that they want to and retire in the State that they want to retire. 
   I'm seeing some big problems in my State, Mr. Speaker. As I said, people are leaving the State, and it's a real shame. It's a real shame. They can't afford the homeowners' insurance. 
   I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor H.R. 913 and pray that this hurricane season is not as active as predicted.

<DOCNO>Mr. BILIRAKIS. (WOUNDED WARRIOR ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Like all of my colleagues, I was greatly disturbed by the conditions at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center which were depicted in The Washington Post. Last week, I introduced H.R. 1580, the Wounded Warriors Joint Health Care Ombudsman Act. My legislation is intended to create a single point of reference for recovering servicemembers and their families to ensure they are receiving prompt responses and information to their questions. 
   The amendment that I am offering today is a modified version of my legislation, and it creates a Department of Defense-wide ombudsman office within the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The functions of the office are to provide policy guidance and oversight to each military department. Specifically, the office would develop policy guidance with respect to providing assistance to and answering questions from recovering servicemembers and their families on a variety of important issues. 
   The policy guidance developed by the ombudsman office should allow recovering servicemembers to get information on administrative processes, financial assistance, the transition to care from the Department of Veterans Affairs and the support services available upon the member's return home. Very important. 
   The office would also establish accountability standards for the military departments. These standards would cover issues such as creating and maintaining case files for specific questions received, as well as tracking the response for all such questions. The office would also set timeliness standards for responses. 
   Under my amendment, the office can also require each military department to submit status reports of actions taken to address individual concerns raised by the recovering servicemembers and their families. 
   In closing, Mr. Chairman, everyone agrees that our military servicemembers should receive the highest quality of care and services possible. As they recover from their injuries, our wounded warriors should not have to battle bureaucracy to get the care and benefits they have earned. It is important that the ombudsman office be an advocate for servicemembers during every phase of treatment and the evaluation process as well. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment. I would also like to thank Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Duncan Hunter for their assistance.

<DOCNO>Mr. BILIRAKIS. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1684, the Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act, a good bill which could be much better. I say that because the manager's amendment, if adopted, would strip out many bipartisan provisions that would have helped prevent terrorism and strengthen immigration enforcement, including one that I authored. 
   H.R. 1684 currently includes an amendment I sponsored that was adopted during the committee's consideration of this bill which would improve maritime immigration enforcement. As a representative from Florida, I know how critically important it is to secure our maritime borders, as do many of our coastal colleagues. 
   Coast Guard RADM David Pekoske testified before our Border, Maritime, and Global Counterterrorism Subcommittee in February about the challenges of coastal security. During his testimony, he highlighted an ongoing partnership with US-VISIT to deploy mobile biometrics collection equipment on Coast Guard cutters operating in the Mona Pass between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, where almost half of our maritime migrant apprehensions take place. I was intrigued by the possibility of this effort and the promise it may hold for strengthening our maritime defenses. 
   My amendment, which the manager's amendment removes from this bill, would expand this effort into a formal pilot program and require DHS to evaluate the results to determine the feasibility and appropriateness of expanding such capability to all DHS maritime vessels. This capability is critically important since we currently do not have the ability to verify the identity of apprehended migrants, previous immigration violators, criminals, and possible terrorists in the maritime environment. This deficiency allows those who seek to break our Nation's immigration laws and those who may wish to commit terrorist acts to remain undetected and be repatriated without consequence so that they are free to continue their illegal and dangerous behavior. 
   The biometric identification of interdicted aliens in the maritime environment has the potential to greatly improve the security of America's coastal borders. Unfortunately, since the majority has decided to remove this provision from this bill, we will not realize that promise. 
   I am extremely disappointed and frustrated at this process. Many of the provisions that the manager's amendment strips from this bill were supported by every member of the Homeland Security Committee, including our chairman, whom I greatly admire and respect. However, I cannot understand why we would allow those who do not serve on our committee to dictate to us how we should or should not do our jobs. We simply should not put political expediency above homeland security. 
   Mr. Chairman, I believe that this bill represents a missed opportunity to enhance our country's immigration enforcement, help stop terrorism, and improve our ability to respond should the unthinkable happen again. 
   Though I plan to support its final passage here, I implore my friends on the other side of the aisle to work with us to move forward on the many bipartisan provisions which would have made this bill much better.

   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Chair, I rise in support of the Castor amendment to H.R. 1684. This amendment directs the Department of Homeland Security to work with my State of Florida to resolve differences between its ports access control credential and its Federal counterpart, the Transportation Worker Identification Credential, or the TWIC card. 
   Florida has been a national leader in developing its own credential, entering into an agreement with TSA in 2003 to implement this TWIC prototype. Florida's card is largely interchangeable with the TWIC. However, there are questions about the ability to integrate Federal requirements with Florida's standards. 
   I cannot stress enough the importance of resolving this issue so that maritime workers in my State do not have to obtain multiple cards and separate card readers for the same purposes. 
   I met with TWIC program officials on this matter and, during a hearing of my Transportation Security and Infrastructure Protection Subcommittee last month, asked them to delay implementation of the TWIC card in Florida until this issue can be satisfactorily resolved. 
   Although I am optimistic that we are moving in the right direction toward a resolution on this matter, I commend the gentlewoman from Florida for offering this amendment which will reinforce our State's bipartisan resolve to fix this problem. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the conference report to H.R. 1. I want to commend Homeland Security Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member King and others for their good work on the bill. I support the conference report because I believe it will improve America's security. 
   I sought a seat on the Homeland Security Committee so I could continue the bipartisan efforts to further strengthen our Nation's homeland defenses. I was disappointed, extremely disappointed, that this bill bypassed our committee earlier this year and was brought to the floor without the opportunity for amendment and time for meaningful debate that these serious subjects deserve. 
   The conference report is, however, an improvement over the House bill. Although I don't have time to cover all of the provisions, I am pleased that Ranking Member King's commonsense proposal to provide civil immunity to good Samaritans who report suspicious activity is now included in this measure. 
   I am heartened that the conference report includes two proposals that I made that were included in the rail and public transportation security bill the House passed earlier this year. The first will require the security coordinators who are developing and implementing rail security plans to be American citizens, which makes sense since U.S. citizenship is required for individuals seeking security clearances for access to classified information and materials. 
   The second will require the physical testing of rail tank cars used to carry toxic-inhalation hazardous materials to determine how best to secure them from attack, and more accurately, a modeling analysis to better understand the real-world consequences and most effective manner to mitigate the release of such dangerous materials. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe this is a good bill that could have been better if we had followed regular order and given Members of the House and the Homeland Security Committee our rightful opportunity to fully review and revise its contents. I hope the majority gives us that opportunity in the future. 
   I think this bill is a step in the right direction. Therefore, I urge adoption by this body and enactment by the President.

<DOCNO>Mr. BILIRAKIS. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, failure in Iraq is not an option. We enjoy our freedom today only because we have been willing to fight for it in the past. We must win the war on terror that has been thrust upon us. 
   Before going any further, let me first clearly state that I do not believe we should have an open-ended commitment in Iraq. I believe a new strategy is needed. America has a proud history of promoting and fighting for democracy around the globe. I don't believe now is the time to abandon that commitment. 
   While a new strategy is needed, the resolution that we are debating does not present us with any new policy options. Instead, we are voting on a nonbinding status quo resolution which will not do anything to change the situation in Iraq. It smacks of political posturing. Americans expect more of the world's greatest legislative body. 
   Let us not debase the honor and tradition of the great men and women who have served before us. We are duty bound to serve the public and engage in serious lawmaking, not political pandering. This resolution does nothing. Worse, it endorses the status quo of the violence and bloodshed. Maintaining the status quo is what ultimately resulted in the situation we find ourselves in today. 
   The debate before is more consequential than the question of should we engage in a troop surge or not. None of us want to see Americans unnecessarily be put in harm's way. The debate before us is about the global threats facing the United States and how we choose to respond to them. Failure to forcibly respond to previous acts of terrorism has undermined America's credibility around the world and projected us as weak to our enemies. 
   Some examples of these attacks include: the World Trade Center in 1993; U.S. troops in the barracks in Saudi Arabia; sailors on the USS Cole; and  the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Unfortunately, Americans were too quick to forget these terrible acts.     
   Like many Members of Congress, I believe there should be strategic benchmarks that are designed to hold both the administration and the Iraqi Government accountable for success in Iraq. These benchmarks should measure whether sufficient progress is being made. Unfortunately, under the restrictive rules imposed upon this debate, we will not have an opportunity to vote on other proposals which would institute benchmarks for success. 
   I am compelled to vote against this status quo resolution. Americans deserve a real debate with multiple options for success in Iraq, not closed proceedings that are intended to be a political ploy. 
   I would rather America fight the terrorists on the streets of Baghdad, instead of allowing the terrorists to attack our homeland. 
   I am concerned that the resolution we are debating this week is a precursor to cutting off funds for our troops. The Democrats have even called it a first step. I have heard it several times tonight. Our troops must have all the resources they need to accomplish their mission. I support our troops in the field. Therefore, I will vote ``no'' on this resolution. 
   General Petraeus has indicated that reinforcements will hasten the end of the Iraq battle, allowing us to direct our efforts elsewhere in this greater war on radical Islamic terrorists. 
   The national commander of the VFW, the Nation's largest organizations of combat veterans, issued a statement earlier this week which says, ``We need to send a message to our troops that America wants them to succeed in Iraq by giving the buildup a chance to succeed.'' 
   As a Member of Congress, I will always do whatever possible to support our brave men and women in uniform. As such, I will actively oppose efforts to cut off funding to our troops. 
   I cannot support this resolution, but I am committed to working with the President and my colleagues in Congress to ensure that the actions taken in the war accomplish the following: Moves Iraq closer to a peaceful and stable democracy; improves America's security; ensures the utmost safety and best equipment for our soldiers; and provides the shortest feasible time frame for their return to their families. 
   Failure in Iraq will lead to Iraq becoming a training and staging ground for terrorist groups intent on destabilizing the entire Middle East and destroying the United States and our allies. 
   In closing, I thank and offer my prayers for all our troops, including those brave men and women in the Ninth Congressional District and throughout the State of Florida who have answered their Nation's call to duty. 
   God bless our troops, and keep them safe.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to welcome a good friend and inspired leader from Tampa Bay, Father James Rousakis of Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church in Clearwater, Florida. 
   I have known Father James for nearly 20 years and have become a big admirer of him, as well as his wonderful wife, Presvytera Vasiliki, an incredible woman who is just as much a leader at Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church as Father James. 
   When I asked Father James what compelled him to a life in the church when he was on a completely different career path at age 23, he said he was attending Holy Thursday church services during Easter and a compelling voice said over his left shoulder, ``You need to be here every day!'' Listening to that voice, Father James became ordained as a priest in 1971, and the rest is history. 
   He has served the Orthodox faithful in Rochester, New York; Atlanta, Georgia; Portland, Maine; Indianapolis; and now Clearwater Florida. As Vicar of the Tampa Bay Greek Orthodox Church for the Metropolis of Atlanta, Father James Rousakis will begin his 18th year of pastorship in my district. With his boundless energy, Father James has helped to foster incredible growth in the membership and ministries at Holy Trinity. 
   Madam Speaker, I wish Father James many more years of compassionate and enlightened service in the Tampa Bay area, and am glad that he didn't ignore that profound voice 45 years ago. 
   Welcome, Father James.
