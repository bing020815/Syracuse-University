   Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, today, July 24th, I had an unexpected emergency that required me to return to my Congressional District and I regretfully missed the last two rollcall votes of the day. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall vote No. 532 on agreeing to the resolution H. Res. 1368--Relating to the House procedures contained in section 803 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. Had I been present I would have also voted ``yea'' on rollcall vote No. 533 On Motion to Suspend the Rules and Agree, as Amended to H. Res. 1296--National Child Awareness Month.

<DOCNO>Mr. PASCRELL. (CONGRATULATING ALBANIA AND CROATIA ON BEING INVITED TO BEGIN ACCESSION TALKS WITH THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 1266, a resolution congratulating Albania and Croatia on being invited to begin accession talks with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. I support this continuing enlargement of the alliance. 
   These nations have been preparing for NATO for 8 years and are undergoing a historic process. They have made important improvements in the areas of ethnic diversity, human rights, free market economic principles and the promotion of good neighborly relations. Their unique geo-strategic position will be an asset to NATO. I commend the governments of these deserving nations for this historic achievement. 
   However, it bears mentioning there were three nations being considered for NATO membership this year, Croatia, Albania, and Macedonia. Unfortunately, Macedonia's bid for NATO accession was blocked due to an ongoing dispute with another NATO member. 
   It is a shame that Macedonia, our steadfast ally who just this year committed to doubling its troop level in Iraq and has military serving in Afghanistan, was treated in this manner. I remember Macedonia took over 35,000 refugees, I was there at the time, as Milosevic tried to wipe out Kosovo. 
   Macedonia's strong and sincere commitment to transforming their country into one dedicated to the principles of free market economics, pluralistic democracy and the rule of law cannot be denied. The exclusion of Macedonia from NATO will only serve to diminish regional stability, which I think is what we want, and will discourage other developing democracies from making needed political, economic and military reforms. 
   Its omission was purely political. As a Member with both Macedonian and Greek constituents in my district, the 8th District of New Jersey, I have been involved in this dispute for a long time. I strongly belief we should be bringing nations together, not keeping them apart. 
   We are talking about objecting because of what Macedonia calls itself. Thomas Friedman has written about this time and time again. This is the 21st century. What are we doing to ourselves? This nation has responded every time the United States has asked, and yet we have accepted the denial. And the State Department agrees with my position. 
   Madam Speaker, I offer my sincere congratulations to Albania and Croatia on their achievement. 
   And I will tell you how far this went, Madam Speaker: The denial on the floor of the Senate, holding up the U.S. Ambassador to Macedonia, Philip Reeker, apparently because he was not talking enough ``pro-Greece.'' 
   I am pro-Greece. I am pro-Macedonia. We cannot afford to have this happen, because we stand for the little guy, remember, the United States of America. Macedonia is a very small country, less than 2.5 million people. It doesn't have a great standing army. 
   I ask us not only to congratulate Croatia and Albania, but do everything in our power to make sure Macedonia sits at the table.

<DOCNO>Mr. PASCRELL. (RECOGNIZING COMMENCEMENT OF RAMADAN AND COMMENDING MUSLIMS FOR THEIR FAITH -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 635, which recognizes the commencement of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting and spiritual renewal, and commending Muslims in the United States and throughout the world for their faith. 
   I'm proud to be a cosponsor of this bill, and I want to congratulate the sponsor, Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson. This is the first time in history that the United States Congress will commemorate and recognize the month of Ramadan, a month which Muslims have been observing for more than 1,300 years. 
   In this month, I know that Muslims will fast from sunrise to sunset, but the month of Ramadan is about so much more than the act of abstaining from food. 
   During the month of Ramadan, Muslims will strive to become stronger in their faith and in their character. This means striving to be better members of our families and within our communities, striving to perform acts of charity for those who are less fortunate, striving to set a better example to those around us. In truth, it is a striving to become a more complete human being. 
   But this month should not just be important for Muslims. It should also be imperative for all of us non-Muslims to learn about this faith, which too often has been misunderstood and mischaracterized. 
   Muslims share a great deal of commonality with other faiths. For example, the practice of fasting is not just done by Muslims but is also observed by Christians, Jews, Buddhists, and Hindus, among others. These United States of America, this is a Nation of God and all religions. 
   Indeed, the book of Exodus tells us that Moses fasted for 40 days and 40 nights while he was on the mountain with God, and the accounts of Matthew and Luke tell us that Jesus fasted for 40 days and 40 nights while in the desert prior to the three temptations. 
   I've always been extremely fortunate to represent probably one of the most diverse districts in the entire country, the Eighth District of New Jersey. It has been through the many good works of my Muslim constituents that it has become clear to me that the true faith of Islam is one of peace and mutual understanding. 
   Despite what others may say, we should have no qualms about electing a Muslim to any elected office in the United States, for our Nation was founded on the principle that there can be no religious test for holding office, only a test of that individual's character. 
   We are all part of the beautiful tapestry that comprises our Nation, and Muslim Americans are starting to move to the forefront where they belong. 
   I wish all Muslims in our Nation a happy and a blessed month of Ramadan.

<DOCNO>Mr. PASCRELL. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Chairman, the legislation we have before us today is not a debate between the interests of big business versus the interests of unions; this legislation is instead intended to serve the interests of the American worker. The Employee Free Choice Act is a bipartisan agreement that America's workers are not being served by our current system. We already know that workers who are able to unionize enjoy a higher standard of living than their nonunion counterparts and that those higher standards contribute to a stronger middle class. In fact, union workers' median weekly earnings are 30 percent higher than nonunion workers' and a full 80 percent of union workers have employer-provided health insurance while only 49 percent of nonunion workers do. 
   Those facts are clear and so is the fact that the current NLRB election process is broken. The current system does not allow workers the ability to fairly judge for themselves if they want to join a union, instead it allows their employers to unfairly place pressure upon them to reject unionization. This is demonstrated by the fact that 75 percent of employers hire unionbusting consultants to help fight union organizing drives. It's not surprising then to learn  that 25 percent of employers in organizing drives fire at least one worker for union activity and a striking 51 percent of employers threaten to close the business if the union wins the election. Under the current broken system these employers are allowed to threaten, harass and fire employees without any real consequence. The Employee Free Choice Act fixes this broken system and puts the onus back on employers to provide the American workers the rights they have so truly earned.

   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, 90 million Americans, nearly one-third of our Nation's population, had no health insurance for some or all of the past 2 years. Please let it sink in. 
   It is shameful that roughly 10 million of these uninsured are children. Ninety percent of those kids live in working households and a majority in two-parent families who simply cannot afford health coverage. Six million children are in imminent danger of losing their  coverage if Congress fails to reauthorize SCHIP now. 
   We've heard many things this evening and that is, you've stooped to conquer. You accuse the Republicans and Democrats who support this legislation of wanting to do this for illegals. Then you accuse the Republicans and Democrats who support this legislation of supporting socialized medicine. And that wasn't bad enough. You went to the next thing. You accused Democrats and Republicans of encouraging smoking, and then you said that we want to aid the rich and comfort the rich. 
   Read the legislation. This is good legislation for America. Help the children for a change. Let's come together and vote for this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5749. The CBO, or the Congressional Budget Office, recently found that extending unemployment benefits is one of the most cost-effective, fastest acting forms of economic stimulus. As a matter of fact, it's estimated that every dollar spent on unemployment insurance boasts the economy by $1.64. 
   My friends, this is a systemic problem. This is not a footnote; this is not an ad lib; this is not something as an addendum. We need to face this problem head on. Forty percent of unemployed workers in 11 States have already exhausted their unemployment insurance. In New Jersey, it's projected that nearly 153,000 workers will deplete their regular unemployment benefits between now and the next several months. There are the unemployed. There are those that are underemployed, who have sought work, have found no work, they find themselves relegated to no States whatsoever. How dare anyone question this legislation while people are unemployed!

<DOCNO>Mr. PASCRELL. (PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 is a great piece of legislation. I want to commend Chairman Oberstar and Chairwoman Corrine Brown. I know how hard you worked on this the last several years, both of you, and of course, Ranking Member Mica and Mr. Shuster from Pennsylvania. 
   The need for a strong, national passenger railroad system grows daily. The price of oil has reached $140 per barrel. 
   On the ground, congestion on our interstates mounts with increases of commuters and the movement of goods. In the air, many of our Nation's airlines are cutting back the number of planes and, therefore, the capacity by 10 to 20 percent. The American people need and deserve an alternative to driving their automobiles and traveling by airplane. 
   This legislation would bolster the fortunes of our intercity passenger rail system and put Amtrak on the path to success. 
   In addition to procuring new rolling stock and meeting its labor commitments, under this bill Amtrak would be able to make needed improvements to the heavily trafficked Northeast Corridor, NEC. 
   My home State of New Jersey and Amtrak have had an interesting, symbiotic relationship. The Northeast Corridor rail operations are important for New Jersey's economic growth and our competitiveness, as the NEC is the spine for New Jersey Transit's commuter rail system. Both Mr. Oberstar and Mr. Mica have come, seen. They understand what the situation is in terms of our relationship to economic growth. Eighty percent of all New Jersey Transit riders use the Northeast Corridor, nearly 200,000 daily trips. 
   New Jersey Transit is the major operator on the NEC, operating 385 trains per day to Newark, New York, and the 30th Street Philadelphia Station, as compared to Amtrak's 110 daily trains.

   Mr. PASCRELL. Accordingly, the State of New Jersey has invested more than $1.8 billion in the NEC for Amtrak stations like the Newark Airport Station, as well as for capital investments that benefit both Amtrak and New Jersey. 
   This is a great relationship. New Jersey's putting up its money, and the Federal Government now is leveraging that money. This is what it is all about, if we could get States to partner in what we're trying to do. That's why I commend the leadership on both sides. 
   New Jersey has a major interest in the success of the corridor. This stake will increase going forward as we work with Amtrak, the FTA, the FRA to build this critical infrastructure. The new tunnel that we're going to invest in through the Hudson River is just another way. 
   I want to thank both sides for this great legislation. I wish you both well.

   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court, the judicial branch of our government, has ruled that the President of the United States is not above the law, even during time of war. 
   The Attorney General's office within the executive branch of government is undermining the entire judicial system. Over 400 U.S. attorneys have been  confirmed over the last 20 years. Three have been fired for political partisanship during that time. 
   However, in the last 9 months, nine have been fired because they didn't bow to the partisan pressures of the executive branch of government. The Attorney General has allowed these nine U.S. attorneys names to be trashed in the public. 
   This is worse than Watergate. There is reason to believe that a cover-up occurred, and that will be worse than the dirty deed. How did each of these get on the list in the first place? And out of the original 30, how did you get off the list? What did you have to do to be removed from that list, Mr. Attorney General? 
   This is not the moral high ground. No one is above the law.

He is one of 3,214 more troops that have died since supposedly major operations would cease. 
   The President made the Iraqi people believe that a new day of democracy was dawning and that brighter times lay ahead. Even the reconstruction of Iraq has gone awry. Even the reconstruction has been bought by the filthy hands of contractors who are concerned only for profit. 
   The President made the American people believe that the war was over, that the thousands of sailors who stood on the deck of that aircraft carrier that day were coming home soon. They did not.

<DOCNO>Mr. PASCRELL. (WATER QUALITY FINANCING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Chairman, I am proud to rise in support of the Water Quality Financing Act, H.R. 720, and I commend Chairman OBERSTAR for working so hard to bring it to the floor today. 
   This bill reauthorizes the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, a necessary program providing low-interest loans to communities for construction of wastewater treatment facilities and other water projects. 
   H.R. 720 authorizes $14 billion over the next 4 years for the fund, which will go a long way toward helping America's cities and towns fix their wastewater infrastructure. 
   This is a critical program. Since it was created in 1987, the fund has partnered with local and State governments to drastically improve America's water quality. 
   As a result of dramatic improvements in wastewater infrastructure due in part to this fund, discharges of waste into the environment have decreased by one-half since the early 1970's. 
   In my home State of New Jersey, the fund has been enormously helpful. New Jersey was granted almost $2 billion during fiscal years 1987 through 2005, almost all of which was used for wastewater treatment projects. This much-needed funding has been instrumental in helping my State keep its water clean and its citizens safe and healthy. 
   The fact is: This bill is long overdue. 
   We know all too well that progress cannot be achieved on the cheap. If we want clean water for ourselves and future generations, we must invest in it. 
   The longer we wait, the more degraded our systems get. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote. ``yes'' on this bill today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, this legislation, H.R. 6, begins the process of weaning off of corporate welfare. This is the beginning of it, so you had better get used to it. 
   I am very shocked to hear what the opponents are saying to this legislation. Ensuring that oil companies actually pay their fair share in royalties is reasonable and prudent. 
   Why isn't this welfare looked at as our tax money that we provide for these corporations? 
   They don't need it. You know it, and I know it. 
   This bill will ultimately repeal approximately $14 billion in oil subsidies given to big oil companies and, most importantly, invest those funds, because the question has been asked on the other side, will this wind up in a slush fund. They cavalierly talk about that. 
   Specifically, if you read the bill, these funds will go to clean renewable energy and energy-efficient programs. This is critical. The bill creates the Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve, which will help accelerate the use of clean, domestic renewable energy resources, thereby reducing our dependence on foreign oil. And the case has been made over and over and over again this afternoon. 
   This is the beginning of real security for our country, Mr. Speaker.

<DOCNO>Mr. PASCRELL. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, traumatic brain injury is one of the signature wounds of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and there is much to be accomplished. For the estimated 320,000 soldiers who have sustained a brain injury, the war will not end when the last shots are fired. For this reason, I applaud the committee for its work to make progress in treating veterans with TBI. 
   As co-chair of the Congressional Brain Injury Task Force, I am proud to say that we have accomplished a lot over the past year in honoring our commitment to soldiers and veterans with brain injuries. The Defense Center of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury opened its doors in November. The FY 2008 Defense Authorization established new TBI programs for rehabilitation, reintegration, research, and civilian-military cooperation. We reauthorized the Traumatic Brain Injury Act in April, establishing new connections between HHS, the Department of Defense, and the VA. And now this month, all soldiers will begin to receive pre-deployment cognitive assessments establishing individual baselines against which each soldier can be properly screened for a brain injury so that they may receive the care that they need and deserve. 
   In this bill, the committee has recognized the need to improve care for veterans with TBI by fostering cooperation between DOD and VA through joint programs, by improving the ability to track patients diagnosed with TBI, and by encouraging systemic TBI screening for veterans. New research is, however, showing that there is considerable overlap in the occurrence of brain injury and mental health conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder. In fact, the Rand Corp. recently estimated that as many as 27 percent of soldiers with PTSD and depression have also sustained a brain injury. 
   In light of these disturbing figures, Mr. Chairman, would you be willing to work in the Conference with the Senate on language to recognize the relationship between and co-occurrence of TBI and PTSD among our armed services? 
   I want to thank the gentleman from Texas and his staff for working so hard on this legislation and making a commitment to our injured veterans. Our soldiers have fulfilled their duties bravely and honorably, and they deserve nothing less than treatment and care that is commensurate with the heroic deeds they have undertaken.

   We rejected that. The Congress of the United States, Mr. Speaker, rejected that and said no. The exercise of the authority granted in the resolution, read the resolution, is conditioned on the President certifying that war in Iraq would not harm the war on terrorism. We will make a point of that over the next 3 days. 
   Iran has an oppressive economy. We must understand Iranian culture in order not to make the same mistakes we made in Iraq. Ethnically, Iranians are of Indo-European descent and have no kinship to their neighbors in the Middle East. Their language is Indo-European, with grammar and structure similar to classical Latin. They do not identify with Arabs.

   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to reiterate the words of the gentleman from New York. This bill is a significant reminder of why we are here. Beyond the acrimony of the last few weeks, this bill goes to the center of what we should be all about. I commend the gentleman from New York. 
   With this bill, we take up a tax measure that is not geared towards increasing the fortunes of the already fortunate, but instead we provide a measure of relief for those brave men and women serving in the military and as first responders. 
   I am glad to see that this bill excludes from income certain reimbursable expenses incurred in the line of duty by volunteer firefighters. And I commend my friend, JOHN LARSON, who has worked on this issue for some time now. I am truly heartened that we are permanently extending combat pay in the calculations of the earned income tax credit. 
   Recent law allowed members of the Armed Forces to include combat pay, which is generally nontaxable for purposes of computing their earned income credit. But this will only last through the 2006 tax year. Many of us have worked for some time to make this proposal permanent. I am tremendously pleased that this provision has been made. 
   There is no reason a member of the Armed Forces should lose their earned income tax credit when they are mobilized to serve this country. This is unacceptable. I want to thank Chairman Rangel for all his work and diligence on this critical issue. And I want to say, Mr. Speaker, I hope we have many more bills like this between now and the time we take off, because it is important to indicate to the American people that we can cross party lines.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, this is a great day. Tomorrow will be a great day, also. I have finally found a trade agreement I could agree with. And the reason why, for the first time, Members from both sides of the aisle have had a say in what that is. Article I, section 8 is alive and well. 
   I want to tell my friend from Texas, I'm sorry he left the floor, this is the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act. This is not the United States-Peru free trade. See, that got us into trouble. I want to just correct him that we have the right title because free trade is what got us into trouble. We need fair trade. That's what this legislation is all about. 
   So I rise in strong support of H.R. 3688. This is a bipartisan bill. This is a carefully crafted measure that deserves broad support. 
   There is not a single group that I have dealt with recently who hasn't said, and I have sat with all of them, at the very least that real progress has been made in the Peru deal. Even the most vociferous opponents, who may be in this room right now, of this trade deal state clearly that noticeable achievements have, indeed, occurred. 
   The new provisions on workers rights and the environment represents significant accomplishments in crucial areas. And for that, Mr. Rangel and Mr. Levin, Democratic leadership should be commended, and I salute you both.  
   You don't protect good-paying American jobs by freezing trade. You don't do it that way. You don't correct the imbalances in trade by stopping trade. For the first time in a trade agreement, we finally have fully enforceable obligations that require both FTA parties to adopt and effectively enforce core labor rights as stated in the 1998 ILO declaration. 
   By the way, my friends who oppose this legislation, take a look and put this in context. Since 1934, both parties have gone back and forth as to who believes in free trade more. Both parties. Neither party is privy to virtue on this issue of trade. Let's get that straight. 
   If you look back into the 1960s and 1970s, the same situation. Democrats were on this floor pointing fingers at the opposition saying: We need free trade. We need trade that is unbridled. 
   Check the record. Check the record. 
   And then we had just the opposite happen after Jimmy Carter became President. I believe that trade can yield broad benefits to many if done right. My belief is that trade agreements have been ill-conceived and crafted clearly not with the best interests of working families. I have voted against all of them. But this is a good one. 
   This trade agreement marks a significant step forward. The enemy of the good is the perfect. And while this trade agreement may not be perfect, and by the way no one on this floor is, no bill is. This is a good piece of legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I salute you. Mr. Ranking Member, I salute you. You've done a great job.

   Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, if we had approved the legislation on Monday, we would not have been able to pass the tax extenders package, which includes business and energy tax extenders. The AMT patch, we all worked hard on that across the aisle, whether you wanted to pay for it or not was the debate, and the additional disaster assistance as well as mental health parity. I think these are important. 
   Alexander Hamilton, my idol, was very clear that there are immutable principles of moral obligation. Monday I voted ``no,'' and I know that the enemy of the good is the perfect. But since Monday we have improved certain parts of the bill. And there is some junk in this bill. There are no two ways about it. But that is not unique on this bill. 
   So to help the American people, I am now supporting today's financial package. And it's really the McCrery-Rangel team that got me to this point. 
   You guys have worked closely together. You are a good model and example for what we should be doing. 
   I pray that I'm doing the right thing. I believe so in my heart. God bless this country. We will prevail.  
   Madam Speaker, the legislation we have before us today arises at a vital time when Americans are suffering under a rapidly failing financial market and collapsing housing market. 
   My ``no'' vote on Monday was among one of the most difficult votes I have had to cast in my 12 years as a Member of Congress. 
   My goal in Congress has always been to fight for the best interest of ordinary Americans--to fight for the American worker, the American small business owner, the people who make up the heart and soul of our nation. 
   I thought of them when I voted ``no'' on Monday because that bill fell short of helping those people who are suffering the most from this financial crisis. 
   Today, I stand before you far from assured that this legislation is a s good as it can be but understanding that we cannot stand back and allow our financial markets, credit markets, housing market, pension plans, and small businesses to collapse under the weight of the errors made by Wall Street. 
   Lead by Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Frank we have taken an inadequate 2 1/2 page proposal and developed a more substantial bipartisan piece of legislation which we present today. 
   I support the addition of the increase to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FDIC. It is exactly the type of bottomup, community approach we need to put liquidity back in to Wall Street. 
   Furthermore, if we had approved the bill on Monday we would not have been able to pass this tax extenders package that includes business and energy tax extenders, an AMT patch, additional disaster assistance as well as mental health parity. 
   I am certainly disappointed that these provisions are not paid for but it would be unconscionable to allow the American people to suffer without this tax relief. 
   Today's bill is not perfect but we have done what we needed to do for the American people. In truth if you gave every Member of Congress a chance to draft a proposal to address this crisis we would have 435 bills in front of us today--the enemy of the good is the perfect. 
   Since Monday we have improved this bill to help the American people and therefore I am supporting today's financial rescue package. I urge all my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' on Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.

As a member of the Jersey legislature, I worked for parity legislation that finally came to fruition in 1999. Like the 1996 Federal parity law, the coverage was not complete. Advocates in Jersey continue the fight to ensure real and complete coverage parity. 
   Today, at long last, this House will take one step closer to making that a reality by passing H.R. 1424, the Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act. Thank you, both of you. 
   For the first time, this legislation will eliminate inequitable treatment limits and end the imposition of financial requirements on mental health benefits which are not similarly imposed on comparable physical ailments. These two policies are considered to be essential steps toward ending coverage discrimination against individuals with mental illness. 
   To be clear, this legislation does not mandate insurers or group health plans to provide any mental health coverage at all. This legislation will ensure coverage of the same mental illnesses and addiction disorders available to Members of Congress and 8.5 million other Federal employees. Isn't that a breakthrough. 
   While opponents of this insist that parity will bankrupt the health care system, research has shown that there's no significant cost increase whatsoever. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated a minuscule impact on premiums for the mental health parity bill, just two-tenths of 1 percent. 
   This must be passed, both sides of the aisle, and America will benefit.

<DOCNO>Mr. PASCRELL. (HIGHWAY TRUST FUND RESTORATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I rise to speak on an issue on which our Nation is united, an issue that has had an impact on millions of Americans, and that is the issue of restoring the highway trust fund. 
   I stand today as a proud cosponsor of H.R. 6532, and I wish to thank my distinguished colleagues, Chairman Rangel, Chairman Oberstar, and Ranking Member Mica for bringing it to the floor for our consideration. 
   H.R. 6532 put $8 billion into the highway account for the highway trust fund. It is critical to address the projected shortfall in the highway trust fund that would endanger nearly 380,000 jobs. The solvency of the trust fund is necessary to preserve highway investment and provide predictable, long-term Federal funding on which highway projects and State transportation budgets depend.     
   This funding enables States to continue to finance highway projects that improve safety, ensure mobility, accessibility, increase the movement of people and goods, and promote a sound economy. Our Federal-State highway partnership is essential to the success of our Nation's surface transportation system, and those States must be assured the transportation funding pledged to them under Federal law, we hope, that will be available. 
   Coming from the State of New Jersey, which has the highest per capita population in the Nation and is dealing with an aging infrastructure, I know that this projected shortfall would have been devastating not only for the transportation projects but especially for job creation at this difficult time. In New Jersey alone, we have seen the loss of over $305 million in Federal highway funds, which would have been compounded by the loss of over 10,000 jobs. That is why it is so imperative that we come together in a bipartisan fashion, to ensure that this shortfall is addressed properly. 
   I am glad to see that the Bush administration finally acknowledged the crisis with the highway trust fund, despite the President's earlier veto threat. 
   Looking ahead, we know that families are using less gasoline, hybrid cars are increasing mileage rates, and car pooling is taking more cars off the roads.

   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in favor of H.R. 2199, the Traumatic Brain Injury Health Enhancement and Long-Term Support Act. 
   As cochair of the 8-year-old Congressional Brain Injury Task Force of over 110 members, I commend the committee under Chairman Filner's leadership. You've never, ever acted, through the Speaker, to do favors for veterans. You've always handled it in terms of your own responsibility. I salute you for that. 
   For his ongoing endeavors to explore and thoughtfully legislate for the benefit of our Nation's many veterans suffering from TBI, I want to thank Jack Murtha, Congressman Murtha, for all his work over the last 5 years on this issue when it wasn't popular to talk about. 
   The Veterans Administration has shown tremendous effort in addressing the needs of our returning vets, our returning troops on its own; however, I believe the large volume of returning TBI victims, the need for timely treatment and the immediate need for rehab, expertise and capacity require additional resources. Flexibility for the VA to form partnerships to ensure top-notch care for our service personnel is essential. 2199 is an excellent first step to ensuring our Nation's veterans the care they need and deserve. 
   The bill establishes five new Veterans Administration research centers for TBI, which, without a doubt, produce new and exciting prevention and treatment techniques. A comprehensive TBI treatment program within the VA is long overdue. 
   I want to commend the TBI screening program for veterans. We recommended it. Football teams throughout the United States screen students before they put on football equipment. I think that's important that we do that with our vets. I worked to establish it in the civilian realm. We should have it in the military. 
   On behalf of the task force, I look forward to working with the Veterans Committee on this and other TBI issues in the future. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 2199.

   You stoop to conquer. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Every time you get in the corner, you've got to bring up illegal aliens. It says it in the law.

   We know that the dramatically accelerated pace of globalization is one of the more major phenomena of this era. We accept this. But we also believe that we must help shape globalization and mitigate its negative side effects so that American workers are no longer left behind. Dislocated workers put out of their jobs as a result of trade decisions must be protected. We need to first stop the hemorrhaging of the jobs. Just this morning, we had a 39-0 vote.

   Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, today we will vote on H.R. 1700, which calls for putting 50,000 additional police officers on the street over the next 6 years, authorizing $600 million a year for the COPS program, and it also authorizes $350 million a year for the COPS technology grants, and $200 million a year for hiring community prosecutors. 
   It is fitting today because today is the 26th annual National Peace Officers Memorial Service. Of all the cuts to needed domestic programs the Bush administration has devised over the years, the decimation of funds to our law enforcement personnel has to be among the most ill-considered and reckless. How he could ever stand next to any cop and do what he has done in the last 5 years is reprehensible. 
   The COPS program is a proven winner, cutting crime and making neighborhoods safer across the Nation. More police on the streets means less violent crimes and greater vigilance. It just makes sense. According to the GAO study, between 1998 and 2000, the COPS grants are responsible for reducing crimes by 225,000.

   There is nothing like the presence of a police officer. It is not only a deterrent to crime, but it is at the very heart of homeland security. That is why the British are way ahead of us. They have a bottom-up philosophy of looking at what is going wrong in the community. We cannot have a top-down. 
   So 117,000 police officers later, to our rear right now is going the National Peace Officers Memorial Service, and we know who is there. But we know who is here. This is critical. We pray for these police officers on the streets every day. I agree with the gentleman from Ohio, the technology is just as significant as the number of personnel we put on the street. 
   This administration tried to cut the FIRE Program, and they tried desperately to cut the COPS Program. It is a new day, and we started it in the sunshine.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
   Mr. Chairman, in the reauthorization act of 2008, this amendment provides that the National Fire Academy training program could train fire service personnel in response tactics and strategies for dealing with natural catastrophes, including terrorist-caused national catastrophes and incidents that involve weapons of mass destruction. 
   I want to thank the cosponsor of the underlying bill, Representative Harry Mitchell from Arizona, for presenting a very strong piece of legislation that will reauthorize the United States Fire Administration for another 5 years. 
   I also want to thank the chairman of the Science Committee, Congressman Gordon, for his leadership in considering all of the necessary elements of this legislation with the end result being a strong, comprehensive bill. 
   The underlying bill would authorize $293 million through fiscal year 2012 for the U.S. Fire Administration, which is a vital agency charged with reducing debt and economic losses because of fire emergencies. I want to make clear that this is a small price to pay when considering the thousands of lives we lose each year to fire emergencies and the billions of dollars we spend to fight them. 
   Throughout my years in Congress, I have always been passionate for funding our Nation's fire departments and firefighters, the Fire and Safety grants that this Congress has provided in the funds supplied through this reauthorization. I feel especially strong about this reauthorization because it also includes provisions that help guide the fire academy on how to best train our Nation's firefighters for the added and the increased challenges they face every day. My amendment addresses this issue by simply updating the training program at the National Fire Academy to include national catastrophes related to terrorism. 
   We saw on 9/11 our Nation's heroic firefighters were among the first responders on the scene trying desperately to rescue as many people as possible in that horrific act of terror. Clearly, we all understand that the responsibilities of our Nation's firefighters became greater on that day as they now have to train for emergency response to catastrophic terrorist attacks, including the foreboding threats of incidents involving weapons of mass destruction. Many of these types of courses already exist at the fire academy, but the future of these critical courses for these firefighters should never be put in doubt and need to be codified. 
   My amendment simply puts these practices into law and sends a message to the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Fire Administration that this issue continues to be important to the Congress and the protection of our constituents. 
   I thank the sponsor, Mr. Mitchell, the chairman, Mr. Gordon, once again for all of their work. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

I applaud this amendment for encouraging the installation of fire sprinklers in all commercial buildings and supporting educational programs about installing them in residential buildings. A very critical issue here. 
   We must take every opportunity to promote the use of fire sprinklers, as the gentleman from Georgia just pointed out, which is why we introduced the Campus Fire Safety Legislation to require mandatory responses. Every university now, every college, every community college, whether it is a college building or a dormitory, any building connected to that university or institution has an obligation to tell the parents and the students what is their record on fire safety. No students should be sent to any university, any university or any college, unless their parents and they themselves know what the record is, if there are sprinklers installed, if there are smoke detectors installed. We lost three who were killed in the Seton Hall fire in New Jersey, 58 were injured. Since 2000, 108 people have died in campus fires. There are 20 campus-related fire deaths in the last 2 years. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to bring the attention to everyone on this as part of the educational process. I want to thank the gentleman from Rhode Island for introducing this amendment. It makes sense, and I hope everybody will support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I rise to speak on an issue that has an impact on millions of Americans, and that is the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008. 
   I wish to thank my colleague, Chairman Rangel, for his leadership. 
   The Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act is a vital piece of legislation. The tax incentives are the best way to bring renewable energy into the American home. 
   The bill will extend $42 billion of expiring temporary tax provisions for 2 years through 2009. These are bread-and-butter tax cuts that millions of Americans count on. Jobs could be lost if Congress fails to renew these tax incentives. 
   These are bread-and-butter tax cuts, and we believe, on this side of the aisle, that if you're going to cut taxes, you find money to do it so that you don't run the government like Enron. That's why we are in the position we are in on Wall Street. And you're trying to make this Wall Street. 
   These extenders not only impact the businesses that claim them, but also their customers, suppliers and others. 
   The restaurant industry is projected to spend $70 billion over the next 10 years for building construction and renovation. Every dollar spent in the construction industry creates more than 28 jobs in the overall economy, for every dollar. 
   Failure to renew the research tax credit would also encourage businesses to move their work out of the United States. The United States used to have an attractive research tax credit. Other countries have recently taken the lead. Countries like China now have more attractive research tax incentives, luring research jobs away from the United States. Inaction in this area would hurt our middle class.  
   Madam Speaker, the basic question is, should we pay for what we're doing, or should we kick the can down the street and put the burden on our children and our grandchildren? The answer is no.

   Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment to provide an additional $1,274,000 for programs making up the Traumatic Brain Injury Act, a modest increase for a vital public health program. 
   Traumatic brain injury is the signature injury of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Congressional Brain Injury Task Force is extremely grateful for the increased funding for both the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs to address these needs of our injured servicemembers. 
   TBI is a civilian epidemic as well. 5.3 million Americans currently living with a long-term disability as a result of TBI and the 1.4 million new TBI cases occurring each year at an annual cost of $60 billion clearly illustrate Congress' responsibility to provide adequate funding for the TBI Act. 
   The TBI Act is the only Federal law that specifically addresses this major public health problem, provides a foundation for State health departments and Federal agencies to combat the Nation's leading cause of disability for children and adults. Without adequate funding, the program and the progress made to date will be jeopardized, thereby diminishing the Federal investment during the last 10 years and severely limiting the Nation's ability to address the complex needs of individuals with traumatic brain injury. 
   This funding for the Traumatic Brain Injury Act will help strengthen and improve State systems, preserve and strengthen families, foster community living, and assist States in preventing traumatic brain injury.

   I must say, though, that the gentlewoman from Tennessee and the gentleman from Idaho had better get their economics straight. In their logic, we should reduce the minimum wage so we will produce more jobs. If that makes any sense, you are really off the reservation. 
   My friends, this is an opportunity for us to put aside politics and get to the heart of the issue. At $5.15 an hour, a full-time minimum wage worker brings home $10,712. How could anyone live on that sum in this day and age? We all know that, since 2000, the costs of health insurance and gasoline and home heating and attending college have skyrocketed to the tune of almost $5,000 annually. Clearly an untenable situation for American workers. And just this week Northeastern University put out this report, an increase of productivity for the American worker of 17 percent and an increase in wages of 1 percent. 
   The little guy is going to get help from this Congress, and you had better get that straight, to all of the folks on both sides of the aisle. The little guy is not going to be forgotten any longer. 
   This is an important piece of legislation. Raising the minimum wage today will provide an additional $4,400 a year for a family of three, equaling 15 months of groceries. That is good enough for me.

   What I also hear on the other side is that, perhaps, why are we waiting till students get out of school, why don't we do something about the tuition in school? We believe, most of us, on both sides of the aisle, in the free market. You certainly aren't suggesting that we inject ourselves in what colleges charge as tuition. I don't think that is what you mean. But I don't know what you mean. 
   What I do know is what I have heard on the other side of the aisle from too many that defend the lenders and not college students. 
   I am the first member of my family to have the opportunity to go to college. I am a strong believer in the importance of higher education, like many in this room today. Our success in educating today's generation of students will have a striking and lasting impact on the Nation's success. 
   According to the Department of Education, financial concerns will prevent 4.4 million high school graduates from attending a 4-year college. That is not acceptable to anybody here. It will prevent another 2 million high school graduates from attending college at all at any time. That is not acceptable either. 
   As tuition and fees at 4-year public colleges and universities have risen 41 percent, after inflation, since 2001, the typical student now graduates with an enormous $17,500 in total Federal debt. Besides what we are doing on interest rates, we will be working in the future, down the road, consolidating these debts, providing some loan flexibility within this program and loan forgiveness for many public service employees who give their lives and put their lives on the line today.     
   In my home State of New Jersey, the College Student Relief Act will save students an average of $2,370 on interest payments over the life of their loan if the student starts school this September. And if the student starts school in 2011, he or she will save $4,600 over the life of the loan. This is not theory, this is not empty. This is substantial.

This legislation represents a very personal decision that needs to be made by each and every Member of this body about the future of our Nation. The fact is, and I address, if I may through the Chair, my respected brothers and sisters in the opposition. 
   The fact is that this bill was not necessitated by the acts of Congress. No, no. This supplemental is necessary because our Nation faces an emergency due to the multitude of failures from this administration. Why are you carrying their water? 
   Funding will be provided to make certain that the disgrace of Walter Reed will not be repeated. This supplemental makes certain that our troops are not redeployed in and out of Iraq without proper rest, without proper preparation. We all support that, don't we? And our support in Iraq will be brought to an end responsibly.

   Tax changes, if done wrong, can exacerbate existing inequalities, hurt our moral fabric, and slow the economy; so I am glad today with this bill we will take up a tax measure that is not geared towards increasing the fortunes of the already fortunate, but instead we will provide a measure of relief for those brave men and women serving in the military and as first responders. 
   In particular, I am glad to see that this bill excludes from income certain reimbursable expenses incurred in the line of duty by volunteer firefighters; and I commend my friend, Congressman Larson from Connecticut, who has worked on this issue for some time. 
   I am truly heartened we are permanently extending combat pay in the calculations of the earned income tax credit. Recent law allowed members of the Armed Forces to exclude combat pay, which is generally nontaxable, for purposes of computing the earned income credit. But this will only last through the 2006 tax year. Many of us have worked for some time to make this proposal permanent. I am tremendously pleased that this provision has made it into the broader package that we are discussing today. There is no reason a member of the Armed Forces should lose their earned income tax credit when they are mobilized serving their country.

   Our bill will provide $62 billion in AMT relief to more than 25 million families nationwide. 
   In my district alone, almost 80,000 people are on track to endure the significant tax increase of the AMT this year if we do not act now. That's up from 20,000 people in 2005. 
   Many of the people affected would be firefighters, cops and teachers--a far cry from the original intent of the AMT. Indeed, the middle class is being more and more affected--your constituents and mine. And it's only getting worse. 
   Unfortunately there are those on the other side of the aisle who will not vote today for the best interests of their constituents. 
   Instead, they will choose to cast their vote for the Kings of Wall Street who are already the richest people in the history of our Nation. 
   We pay for this bill, in part, by simply requiring that investment fund managers are taxed at the same income rates as every other American. After all, why should the very richest among us be taxed at 15 percent when a doctor or lawyer pays 35 percent? Or when a teacher or plumber, et cetera, is taxed at 25? 
   Yet because of this provision, many Republicans will be unable to vote for real tax relief for their constituents. I find this as inexplicable as I do sad. 
   This legislation is wise and it is fair. It will give tax relief to 25 million hard-working Americans while ensuring fairness in the tax code. So try to explain to the firefighters and cops in your district that you wanted to take care of investment fund managers instead.

   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support all the efforts to encourage responsible research in this area. Indeed, I think it is a moral imperative for the Congress to pursue all prudent policies for the benefit of our people. 
   I want to commend both the manager and all of the other managers on both sides of the aisle, because they have not shrunk from addressing the moral issues here, which are very, very important to the whole issue. 
   I am not afraid of those issues, I want you to know, Mr. Speaker, at all. Even as a Christian, I say this: The principle of double effect is in play here. More good will come out of this, the saving of many lives. I think this is critical. If we are afraid to face the moral issues, then we should not have presented this bill in the first place. That is why I want to commend the sponsors. 
   This is not inherently wrong. It is not intended to be wrong. The good effort and result may not be a direct casual result. Finally, the good result must be proportionate to the bad result. 
   Prudence and reflection are critical here, and I want to address this, and the debate should be on a moral plane. There is nothing wrong with that, that we debate this issue. But the moral correctness of this thing isn't all on one side, I want everybody to understand that. Thomas Aquinas laid out the principles of double effect. It is absolutely inherent in this particular issue. 
   I say support H.R. 3, and, again, I commend the moral fortitude of all the sponsors of this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. PASCRELL. (PUBLIC HOUSING ASSET MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3521, the Public Housing Asset Management Improvement Act of 2007. 
   I commend Chairman Frank and co mmend Chairwoman Waters and my colleague from New Jersey, Congressman Albio Sires, for bringing to the floor this very important legislation. This is the most significant administrative transformation, Mr. Chairman, in 30 years dealing with all of the public housing authorities throughout the United States. 
   This bill, developed with the input of public housing agencies, administrators and tenants, is a commonsense measure that provides flexibility to the Nation's public housing authorities as they transition to asset management. 
   I must say to my friend from Illinois, the points that you bring up are salient, but it doesn't work here, and I will tell you why. H.R. 3521 was included as part of H.R. 2764, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, which the President signed on December 26, 2007. It's already law. 
   Specifically, the Consolidated Appropriations Act included the provision to allow flexible funding between the capital and operating funds. It also expanded the exemption from im plementing asset management from public housing authorities with less than 250 units to public housing authorities with less than 400 units. This legislation that is before us today increases that threshold to 500 units. So what we are taking is something already in the law and expanding it. 
   H.R. 3521 would also be permanent whereas the Consolidated Appropriations Act would only put provisions in place for the year 2008. I ask that that be considered, and I think it is a very important part of what we a re debating today. 
   Asset management is an efficient administrative style that allows public housing authorities to manage each individual housing development on a project-level basis as opposed to managing developments on an agency-wide basis. 
   While most stakeholders support the idea of asset management, they believe that HUD has implemented its inflexibility. For example, HUD has mandated that public housing authorities  demonstrate compliance. So this is not a willy-nilly situation here. Thi s is something you have to comply to the law. New rules will be established by 2011, which the PHAs believe is too soon. You have to get these public housing authorities that have been operating, many of them for 30 years, the flexibility for compliance. And HUD is overseeing them. You act as if there is no one who is auditing the books. 
   We need time to issue timely and complete guidance on these new regulations causing some PHAs to lose funding and staff. I don't think any of us want that. 
   During t his time of declining resources for public housing, when is the last time we built public housing? When is the last time we built public housing for seniors at a time when we know what is going on out there with people losing homes? When is the last time we have provided public housing? 
   So during this time of declining resources for public housing, it is imperative that we provide them with the flexibility they need to use their funds as they see fit. This legislation requires new negotiated rulemaking to begin in 2009 to ensure that housing authorities are funded according to an accurate funding formula and allows the public housing authorities the flexibility to move small amounts of funding from capital to operating funds. 
   Also, this legislation exempts small public housing authorities from asset management, as they generally will see no economic or efficiency improvements from its implementation and ensure that the PHAs involve tenants in every decision. 
   Mr. Chairman, this bill makes real prac tical changes that will truly benefit our public housing agencies as they implement asset management. I urge my colleagues to support its passage, and I commend the sponsors of this legislation.

   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, you can't have it both ways. You can't say that this is an emergency and we've got to get something done, and then in the other breath say let's go through the technical procedures. They're contradictory. 
   This bill was vetted. And housing inventories in our communities continue to increase and home prices continue to decline. We need to incentivize Americans to reenter the housing market. It affects so much of our economy. I think this amendment, this bill takes giant leaps towards accomplishing this goal. I applaud Mr. Rangel for his efforts and the 12 Members from the distinguished opposition who joined. 
   There is an array of good work here, but in particular I'm heartened that included within is a tax benefit for most first-time homebuyers. This is a truly meaningful incentive, and one that will pull out a large swath of people from the sidelines and back into the market, having a ripple effect throughout the rest of the economy. After all, without bold action to spur housing market activity, inventories across the country may continue to grow, placing downward pressure on home prices and wiping out equity that so many Americans have worked so hard to build.     
   We don't want more homes to be in that situation. We prove nothing. There is a place for the Federal Government, therefore, in this terrible situation that has occurred and developed over the last year. 
   This bill, when passed, will allow middle class families to receive a tax benefit that is equivalent to an interest-free loan of $7,000 towards the purchase of their first home. It will also allow existing homeowners who claim the standard deduction to an additional standard deduction for property taxes, up to $700 for a married couple filing jointly. 
   When we first addressed this issue in the Ways and Means Committee, the National Association of Realtors found that our legislation would generate about 1 million sales----

   Mr. PASCRELL. The National Association of Realtors found that our legislation would generate about 1 million sales to first-time homebuyers and stimulate nearly $130 billion in increased economic activity. You tell me that that's not worth it in this economy. 
   Studies have shown that this will help reduce housing inventory by 900,000 homes, which will, in turn, stabilize prices. 
   This is a wise and necessary course to take. Because of this we also salute Chairman Rangel's leadership. I hope all my colleagues will enthusiastically support this proposal. It's good for America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, we need a history lesson right here. 
   Article II, the executive powers shall be vested in the powers of the President of the United States. He shall hold  his office for a term of 4 years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same term. 
   The Vice President has a problem of figuring out which branch of government he belongs to. But in Federalist Paper No. 68, Alexander Hamilton was very, very clear about this. The appointment of an extraordinary person as Vice President has been objected to as superfluous. Take the Senator of any State from his seat as a Senator to place him in the President of the Senate would be totally ridiculous, would be to exchange a regard to the State from which he came a constant for a contingent vote. 
   The other consideration is that as the Vice President may occasionally become a substitute for the President, in the supreme executive magistracy, all the reasons which recommend the mode of elections prescribed for the one apply for the great, if not with equal force, to the manner of appointing the other. It is remarkable that this, as in most other instances, with the objection which is made, would be against the Constitution of this State. 
   Mr. Vice President, go back to the Constitution and learn where you belong.

   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, we could certainly slow the aging process down if it had to work its way through Congress. 
   This year, 6 million children will have access to quality affordable health insurance because of the program we know as the SCHIP. These children are in working families with parents who either can't afford insurance or hold jobs that lack health care benefits. We have an opportunity today. 
   In New Jersey, we have over 100,000 of eligible kids who aren't enrolled in New Jersey alone. Are we going to do the same thing on health care that we did to those kids in Head Start? So many eligible, not enough resources, wrongheaded priorities? 
   Contrary to what my friends on the other side said, the Ways and Means Committee has also worked to protect the integrity and solvency of Medicare and to approve the benefits for all beneficiaries within this bill.  
   The fully paid for CHAMP Act protects Medicare from privatization, promotes fiscal responsibility, you have got to read the bill, by reducing overpayments to private plans. I see nothing wrong with that. Adding 3 years to the Medicare trust fund solvency, I think that is a home run. Limiting premium increases, two home runs, and improving access and benefits for all Medicare participants. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill needs everyone's support in here. It should be and will be bipartisan.

<DOCNO>Mr. PASCRELL. (TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION AND MANUFACTURING STIMULATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1868, the Technology Innovation and Manufacturing Stimulation Act of 2007, and I wish to congratulate the sponsor of this fine legislation, the chairman of Subcommittee on Technology Innovation, Congressman DAVID WU, and his ranking member, who understandably is not here today, Mr. Gingrey. 
   I especially am supportive of the provisions of the bill that reauthorize and strengthen the Manufacturing Extension Program. This is very critical. I hope people were listening to Mr. Ehlers, who very cogently spoke and defined what this legislation is all about.  
   Madam Chair, I represent a district with a long and proud history of manufacturing that goes all the way back to Alexander Hamilton and the birth of the American industry in Paterson, New Jersey. Sadly, we have seen the steady decline of our manufacturing base in America as the state of our competitiveness has fallen behind foreign nations. 
   The MEP program, the Manufacturing Extension Program, is one of the most successful programs funded by the Federal Government today, and it has provided hope to our Nation's manufacturers. It is a nationwide network of not-for-profit centers in nearly 350 locations, serving all 50 States and Puerto Rico, whose sole purpose is to provide small- and medium-sized manufacturers with the services they need for success. 
   The president of the New Jersey Manufacturing Extension Program, Bob Loderstedt, captures this program best when he said, ``We have a public sector mission accomplished with a private sector mind-set.'' 
   I am proud to say that this legislation today will increase funding by 8 percent per year and double the funding over 10 years, so that more small manufacturers will be able to better compete in the global marketplace. 
   The MEP is certainly no Federal handout. Indeed, it is a public-private partnership for strong manufacturing growth, and these statistics bear this out: In fiscal year 2004 alone, MEP activities directly resulted in almost $2 billion in new sales and more than 12,000 jobs. MEP's ability to analyze the weaknesses of each manufacturer resulted in $721 million in cost savings. It also led to $941 million worth of investment and modernization to meet the future needs of manufacturers. 
   I have seen firsthand the benefits of the New Jersey MEP as provided for manufacturers, and similar throughout the entire Nation. I believe that this is a very wise investment for us, and we can secure our Nation's manufacturing base. I urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to vote in favor of this vital legislation. 
   In conclusion, Madam Chair, let me say this. I think this is the beginning of finally having a manufacturing policy in this country. That is why we have seen the demise of manufacturing. Alexander Hamilton was right, we have a multifaceted economy; and we must understand, that won the battle and the debate with Thomas Jefferson. We cannot be one economy here. This is a multifaceted economy, and this is good for manufacturing, this is good for America, this is good for our small businesses.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. President Bush says that he is going forward with his plan for a troop surge in Iraq regardless of what the Congress does and what the American people want. But Senator Specter was right when he said yesterday that the President is not the sole decider, that the future of this war is a joint and shared responsibility with this Congress. It is time the President realizes that Congress will no longer be asleep at the wheel while this war rages on. 
   You need only to read the Constitution to know that Congress has the power to decide the direction of this war. The Constitution gives Congress an array of war powers, including the power to declare war, to raise and support armies and make rules concerning captures on land and water. The Framers knew what they were doing in checks and balances. They intended that, by giving Congress the power to declare war, they had the authority to make decisions about the war's scope and duration. 
   Now is not the time for a troop surge. Now is the time for a real plan in Iraq. The Murtha Plan, which I support, stipulates a diplomatic surge instead of a troop surge. It is time for President Bush to realize that we all support our brave troops, but America does not support the war.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, this is a very important piece of legislation because we not only recognize the Constitution of the United States, but we do what President Clinton said just a few weeks ago in Denver, and that is, that we will be known by the power of our example, rather than the example of our power. This is what makes America the greatest country in the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate both the signing of the Constitution and the fundamental principles of the document that each of us pledge to uphold and defend when we take our oath of office. 
   And I am proud to wear this every day by my heart, as with our great patriarch in the Senate, Senator Byrd. 
   Alexander Hamilton once said, ``The sacred rights of mankind are not to be rummaged for among old parchments or musty records. They are written, as with a sunbeam, in the whole volume of human nature, by the hand of the divinity itself; and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power.'' 
   The Constitution upholds our rights. We are given these rights by our Maker. That's what makes us all equal at birth, regardless of our religious background, our ethnicity or anything. 
   Hamilton understood that the rights our founders enshrined in the construction come not from men but from God. That's what makes us all equal, not the Constitution. 
   Today, 221 years after its signing, public school students across the country will be studying the history of the Constitution. They will learn about James Madison, the father of the Constitution and his vision for the Federal Government. They will learn about the separation of powers into a legislative branch, and executive and judiciary branches, and they will learn about the checks and balances designed to keep one of those departments, one of those areas, those branches from growing too powerful. 
   Hear me, Mr. Speaker. These are the enduring principles that have stood the test of time. They've become the inspiration and the basis for the governments of countless countries around the globe. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if, on this day when we celebrate this Constitution, I did not discuss the willful disregard for the fundamental principles of our Republic that we have seen over the last 8 years. 
   Today we have an executive that has disregarded the checks and balances enshrined in the Constitution that have sustained our government for the past two centuries. They have shown complete contempt for article I, section 8, which defines the powers of the Congress in their management of the war and of our economy. I am sad to say that we all have allowed this power to be ceded, both sides of the aisle. Neither party has been a sentinel of our precious Constitution.     
   We have seen nothing but obstruction in our attempts to perform meaningful oversight of our Federal Government. 
   The administration's secrecy and unwillingness to cooperate with the Congress' constitutionally mandated oversight powers have reached the point of  ridiculousness. We have actually had to sue the Federal Government--hear this--the Congress had to sue the Federal Government because they refused to comply with duly authorized subpoenas. This is not a respect of the Constitution. This is a disregard. 
   The fourth amendment bans ``cruel and unusual punishment'' and the fourteenth guarantees ``due process under the law.'' Sadly, America is now seen as a country that will hold detainees indefinitely and torture them without bringing charges. 
   The Constitution prohibits ``unreasonable searches and seizures,'' yet we do know that this administration established a program to secretly wiretap on Americans who did no harm to their country, who love their country. 
   Today, the Congress honors the Constitution. Over the past 8 years, it seems like the Executive has forgotten even its existence. This is not hyperbole. This is documented. The redactive administration has corrupted the ideals of our forefathers. They fondled fear to cover up their addiction to secrecy and will be held accountable soon.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman from California and the gentleman from Louisiana, and I want to commend Congressman Camp from Michigan for being a stalwart in this area. It has taken us a long time, a few years. We have had bipartisan support in the past, Mr. Chairman, but we aim to put closure on this at this time. 
   Mr. Chairman, the EPA estimates that the Nation's wastewater infrastructure will face a funding shortfall of between 300 and $400 billion over the next 20 years. That should give us pause because of all the work and help from both sides of the aisle in protecting our waterways.     
   I am very proud to rise today in strong support of this bill, the Water Quality Investment Act, H.R. 569. I want to thank Mr. Oberstar, chairman of the Transportation Committee, and, of course, Ranking Member Mica and Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking Member Baker for helping to get this bill on the floor. 
   Congressman Camp and I have pursued this issue for many years, as I have said, in order to authorize the wastewater infrastructure funding that our cities and towns so badly need; and, Mr. Chairman, I might add, there are 30 mayors in the House. We need a little bit of that mayor persuasion and touch to deal with a lot of problems that we face on this floor, both domestically and internationally. The mayors know every day what they face on 24/7 and in the community, every community, be it large or small. Because you cannot see something, people forget about how significant it is. 
   I also want to thank Congressman Capuano and others in this worthy endeavor. 
   H.R. 569 has garnered co-sponsorship from both sides and was unanimously  voted out of committee and was even reported out of committee during the past two Congresses for the simple reason that combined sewer overflows and sanitary soil overflows affect millions of people in each and every State in the Union. We are talking about affecting the lives of over 40 million people here in what we are doing to today. 
   The United States' antiquated wastewater infrastructure is deteriorating. State and local governments are often unable to stop sewage and untreated waste from flowing into the streets, into basements, into rivers and into lakes. So all the work that we have done on making our water clean is being undone if we do not attack these two major problems. 
   Combined sewer systems found mainly in older cities are one source of these overflows. A total of 772 municipalities throughout America would serve these 40 million which I just spoke of. 
   My home State of New Jersey has 31 combined sewer systems, water, sanitation coming together at over 200 discharge points throughout the State. Many of those discharges, including several in my own town of Paterson, New Jersey, flow into the Passaic River, a heavily polluted waterway in the heart of my district. 
   Sanitary sewer systems often overflow as well, releasing untreated waste into our environment, closing our beaches, we have been famous for that, too, New Jersey, and contaminating highways, waterways and drinking water supplies. In 2003, New Jersey closed over 30,000 acres of classified shellfish growing areas due to a large sanitary sewer overflow. 
   Upgrading these sewer systems is extremely expensive. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that the total cost of repairing the combined sewer systems in America will be about $51 billion. The price tag for fixing the U.S. sanitary sewer systems hovers around $89 billion. We are talking about $140 billion. 
   As a former mayor, I know that wet weather issues are one of the most pressing issues facing urban America. Cities are doing their best to increase capacity and upgrade facilities with the resources they have, but they need our help. 
   Most communities with combined sewer overflow problems have fewer than 10,000 people. They cannot afford to impose more fees and taxes upon struggling residents who have borne the vast majority of costs associated with sewer overflows. If we impose a Federal mandate demanding clean water, we must follow up with the Federal ability to pay. 
   As the spring rains loom on the horizon, we cannot let small communities throughout this country shoulder this tremendous burden alone. 
   This bill authorizes $1.8 billion for Federal grants from the EPA over a 5-year period. Although it is only a drop in the bucket compared to what we really need, it should provide some relief to our municipalities; and it sends a signal that we really mean business this year and that we are doing that business on a bipartisan basis and that that is the only business we should be about on the important problems facing Americans. 
   I want to wholeheartedly thank the Speaker and the majority leader and the rest of the House leadership for addressing legislation this week that will provide immeasurable benefit to communities throughout this country to help have clean, safe water for their residents. 
   I applaud Chairman Oberstar for his leadership and wish to express my constituents' sincere gratitude for his action on this important issue. This truly has been bipartisan legislation. This is what we talk about and so infrequently implement. 
   So I thank the minority side, the majority side, wherever that line is, who knows, and I say this is a good piece of legislation.

   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would ask the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price), respectfully, to withdraw this amendment. And if I may just take a few moments. 
   The pay-as-you-go rule, which was adopted by the House of Representatives, presents consideration of bills that affect direct or mandatory spending as we know it, or revenues, unless the measures also contain offsets, as I am sure my friend from Georgia knows. 
   Direct spending includes funds for entitlement programs, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the Federal Employee Retirement and Unemployment Compensation and other programs that you and I, I think, would consider mandatory. All other spending in the budget is referred to as the discretionary spending, which is provided in and controlled by the annual appropriations process and is not subject to PAYGO. That is why the Congressional Budget Office has stated that this legislation does not trigger the PAYGO rule. CBO says, this is not direct spending, so it is not applicable in this legislation. 
   Now, I think your point is that maybe we ought to put everything under the same umbrella, but then you are going to have to change every authorizing program in the Congress. 
   This is a reauthorization. We are authorizing a program that already exists. The original authorization was signed into law in fiscal year 2001 in the omnibus appropriations bill. We are going to offset each and every reauthorization we consider in the House? I don't know if that is the direction you want to go in. 
   This majority, the Democratic majority, and we are talking about a bipartisan bill here, voted out unanimously in conference, this majority has instituted strong PAYGO rules, pay as you go. We are taking fiscal responsibility very seriously. 
   Nonetheless, neither this bill nor any other reauthorization bill falls under House PAYGO rules; and I wanted to make that clear. 
   The fact is that this is too critical a program, and I don't sense the sense of urgency here. This is too sensitive an issue, too urgent an issue to jeopardize with attempts to score a political point, as the gentleman from Georgia is attempting to do, I believe, if he considers to move forward. Failing to prevent sewer overflows will result in more sewage, more toxins, more debris making the way into our waterways and drinking water. 
   We have worked on both sides of the aisle for so many years to clean this mess up. What legacy do we leave to our children if we don't do this? 
   It is our duty to prevent beach closures, shellfish bed closures, contamination of drinking water and other environmental and public health concerns that result from sewer overflows before it is too late. 
   I would ask my friend from Georgia if he would consider not asking for a vote on this amendment.

   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5351, and now we are trying to shift from fear to new policy. That's what this is all about. Chairman Rangel deserves ample commendation for crafting this wise bill. I can't totally disagree with the gentleman from Pennsylvania that just spoke. So we should want to turn to the next chapter. We should all feel proud that this Congress is, again, showing that we understand the urgency of the situation. 
   New Jersey gas prices have risen 119 percent since 2001. You cannot tell me that now is not the time to get serious about investing in clean energy, renewable energy, and energy efficiency. You cannot tell me that ending unnecessary subsidies to big oil companies who make record profits is an unfair course of action. No one suggested on this floor that we are going to move from fossil fuel to alternative, and nobody suggested that here. You would think that, though. And when I listen to those arguments, indeed it is long past time we wean ourselves off of foreign energy addiction. 
   This is a homeland security issue, pure and simple. This bill will help provide for alternative measures for the American consumer at a time when families across our land are hurting. 
   Put simply, H.R. 5351 reinvests taxpayer subsidies to oil companies already earning record profits into clean renewable energy, creating jobs, making America less dependent on foreign oil, strengthening our national security, and helping to lower energy prices in the long term. 
   This bill contains incentives to expand production of homegrown fuels including the creation of a new production tax credit for cellulosic ethanol produced in America. It extends tax credits for biodiesel and renewable diesel. Likewise, it provides tax incentives to help homeowners and businesses reduce their energy costs by investing in energy-efficient property. I know businesses throughout my State in New Jersey are eager to lower their energy bills, but the costs at the front end are sometimes too much of a burden. These tax incentives ease that burden. 
   And I have to make a choice, Mr. Speaker, between the incentives that are provided to the oil companies and the incentives that are provided to those companies who want to produce alternative energy sources.

<DOCNO>Mr. PASCRELL. (SCHIP OVERRIDE -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. It's time, Mr. Speaker, for truth in advertising to correct some of the misinformation being used to justify President Bush's inexplicable veto of the children's health care bill. 
   The bipartisan Children's Health Care Program reauthorization does not expand the Children's Health Insurance Program; it maintains current law. The agreement is targeted towards State needs. Responsible spending to cover low-income children is incentivized in the bill. 
   The belief that SCHIP will lead to socialized medicine is nothing more than a red herring. The fact is that the bipartisan compromise combines the best of public and private approaches to provide health coverage for children. 
   Now for the biggest lie: Those siding with President Bush's claim that the agreement provides health coverage to illegal immigrant children are also wrong. Undocumented immigrants, illegal immigrants, have never been eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP. Read the bill. Read the law. 
   The bipartisan agreement requires proof of citizenship before enrollment in SCHIP, similar to requirements for the Medicare program. Get it right, tell the truth to the American people, and get on with it.

<DOCNO>Mr. PASCRELL. (TAX COLLECTION RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, this is a cooked-up survey that was just referred to. In the words of the former IRS Commissioner, Mark Iverson, appointed by President Bush, he testified that the IRS can collect Federal taxes more cheaply, more efficiently than private companies. I rest my case. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 3056. This legislation is designed to protect taxpayers by repealing the authorization for the IRS to use private contractors to collect Federal income taxes. 
   Few would disagree that the collection of Federal taxes is an inherent government function. We have seen, through multiple hearings in Ways and Means, that privatizing and outsourcing this fundamental role has been a mistake on many levels. We've learned of numerous cases of harassment, not overexaggeration, on the record, abusive calling, violations of the rights of taxpayers. We've discovered that some taxpayers, many of whom were elderly, have had to endure literally hundreds of phone calls from private collectors. We listened to those phone calls. We had them on tape. Tapes are a terrible thing, you know. They don't lie. 
   Other cases involve people in nursing homes, those who have served in Iraq, and low-income taxpayers facing economic hardships. And as if taxpayer harassment was not enough, we have also seen that the program is inefficient. So far, privatizing tax collection has actually cost us money. Currently, we are $50 million in the hole. The IRS has spent $71 million to collect a net of $20 million. This is just like the postal department with the privatizing of providing mail throughout the United States. Now they're backing off, finally. It has been a disaster. 
   After paying $5.5 million in commissions to the private debt collectors, they make a commission of $5.5 million, and they can't do the job. This just doesn't make sense. 
   Mr. Speaker, if $70 million was spent on IRS employees instead of private contractors, statistics project that they would have collected over $1.4 billion. That's quite a difference, indeed. And taxpayers deserve more. They expect to deal with their government when they have a tax problem. 
   Private debt collection must end, and today we do that. I thank Chairman Rangel and JOHN LEWIS, chairman of the Ways and Means Oversight. I thank Congressman Rothman from the State of New Jersey for his persistence. I implore all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. PASCRELL. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4137, HIGHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. I rise today in strong support for the rule for the conference report on the Higher Education Opportunity Act, and I thank Chairwoman Slaughter and Congresswoman Matsui for bringing this rule to the floor. I want to offer my sincere congratulations to Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon on this great achievement. 
   H.R. 4137 is a comprehensive bipartisan bill that will reauthorize the Higher Education Act while addressing concerns about the cost of education, restoring integrity and accountability to student loan programs, and expanding college access and support for low-income and minority students. 
   I greatly appreciate that H.R. 4137 includes a version of legislation which we've worked and I've worked on for about 6 years, the Campus Fire Safety Right To Know Act. I became involved in this issue of campus fire safety after experiencing the horrible aftermath of a catastrophic fire at Seton Hall University in South Orange, New Jersey, in 2000. That fire killed three young freshman and wounded 58 other students in a dorm on campus. 
   The campus fire safety reporting requirement in H.R. 4137 mandates that colleges and universities provide prospective and current students and parents with a report on the school's campus safety policies and records. 
   Educating students about fire safety during their time in school will have a strong impact on the choices they make in the future. If we can influence what they learn, we can create a more fire-safe generation for tomorrow and potentially save thousands of lives. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to once again state my strong support for the rule and urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4131. As the first member of my family to attend college, I applaud the chairman and the ranking member for their dedication to making the dream of a college education a reality for so many Americans who otherwise would not have had that chance.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I'm glad we had that last exchange because that's the heart of the issue. It's disingenuous. It's almost bordering on hypocritical because from 2008 to 2017 the administration, the same administration that got us into this mess, assumes the revenue that we will be accepting from AMT every year. This is disingenuous. Tell the American people what the whole story is, not just half the story. 
   What we want to do, Democrats, we want to prevent millions of working families, 100,000 in my own district, from seeing their taxes increase substantially. We're talking $3,000, $4,000. We're not talking chicken feed here. It pays for the lost revenue by stopping hedge fund managers and corporate CEOs from escaping income taxes by using offshore tax havens. 
   I can only conclude from what I have heard this evening that the minority wants to protect tax evaders. That's what you want to do. Tell the American people straight up what you want to do. You don't want to protect the fireman, the police officer, the doctor, the lawyer. You want to protect that small group of people, you heard the Speaker talk about it, 5,000 to 10,000 people. That's what this protection scheme of yours is all about. 
   Most Americans think what we're trying to do is fair and decent and reasonable because it is. But in the warped reality of Washington, there are Members of Congress who believe otherwise. There are actually Members who would rather see working families bear the burden of tax hikes than even a minor adjustment in the Tax Code to ensure that the richest among us pay their fair share. This is what this is all about. Fairness. You kicked the can down the street further. It's our children and our grandchildren that will have the burden. 
   Speak up tonight in one voice. You have an opportunity. The barometer is not Wall Street; it's Main Street.

<DOCNO>Mr. PASCRELL. (RECOGNIZING SEPTEMBER 11 AS A DAY OF REMEMBRANCE -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow will mark six years to a day of inconceivable terror and grief brought upon our nation by the very worst acts of humankind. It was also a day where we witnessed the very best of America. We saw first responders entering buildings to save their fellow citizens knowing full well that their lives were in danger, yet doing so without reservation. We saw concerned Americans standing in lines to donate blood for their fallen neighbors. We saw our nation come together with one voice and one spirit, in that day of terror we saw our Nation more united than any point in our history. 
   Our hearts go out to the families of all the victims of that terrible day. We will forever remain saddened by the tragic loss of human life. What happened to our Nation six years ago was an unspeakable act of war on the very foundation of what makes us American. What happened on that day was an assault on thousands of innocent people who were enjoying the very freedom we hold so dear. 
   Truly, we mourn the victims of September 11th, but today, six years after those attacks we can also celebrate the lives of those who were lost to us on that fateful day. They were truly representative of the diversity and richness of character in our Nation. The victims of September 11th hailed from almost every state in our union, they came from countries throughout the globe, emblematic of the rich tapestry that is the hallmark of our people. On that day, those victims and indeed all of us, were not divided along racial or religious lines, on that day more than any other, we were Americans united by our common values of life, liberty and justice. 
   Six years ago tomorrow our first responders struck the first blow in the War on Terror. By refusing to consider their lives before others,  they drew a stark contrast to the terrorists of September 11th who refused to even value their own lives before taking the lives of so many innocent human beings. Those first responders refused to bow to the fear that the terrorists hoped to instill in our minds on that day. They refused to despair in the face of the greatest attack upon our Nation, instead they charged forward. They not only saved lives on that day, but their selfless acts inspired the psyche of every American, their acts of heroism inspired our nation to action. 
   Now six years later from September 11th, I fear we have lost much of the unity that came to define that day. Truly the heroism of September 11th continues today, with more than 3,800 Americans who have given their lives fighting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But at home we have allowed politics to come between us, we have allowed ourselves to be divided in the face of a continuing War on Terror. But I remain hopeful that the spirit we saw on September 11th is still present in all of us. We must rekindle the firm resolve we had on that day, it was a resolve not simply founded by the attacks upon our nation by a group of terrorists, but built by our collective belief in the greatness of our nation and its ideals. We must remain a beacon for freedom and integrity throughout the world, but all efforts must start at home. Six years ago we suffered the worst day of our collective lives, but I hope that today we have turned the pain of September 11th into a new calling for our Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2467, which would designate the Post Office facility located at 69 Montgomery Street in Jersey City, NJ, as the ``Frank J. Guarini Post Office Building.'' 
   Former Congressman Frank J. Guarini represented the 14th Congressional District of New Jersey for 14 years, from 1979 to 1993. He did so in an exemplary fashion, serving his constituents, and all Americans, in a way in which we should strive to attain. 
   Because of his intellect and work ethic he became a rising star early in his career. He was the first Representative to be appointed to the Ways and Means Committee during his first term in Congress in over 200 years. 
   While on this vital committee, Mr. Guarini worked to modernize our trade and tariff laws with heads of state to assure that other countries open their markets to the United States. 
   In recognition of this work, he received the award ``for outstanding contributions to the administration of justice in International Trade Law'' from the U.S. Court of International Trade. 
   He also served with Chairman Charles Rangel and Ben Gilman on the Select Committee on Narcotic Abuse, developing expertise on drug issues and bringing about vital legislation and strategies to fight the war against drugs both here and abroad. 
   In addition, Mr. Guarini was a senior member of the Budget Committee, where he chaired the Task Force on Urgent Fiscal Issues. Throughout his distinguished career, Mr. Guarini was an outspoken advocate for fiscal responsibility and fought to provide education and job opportunities for our Nation's young while also reducing wasteful government spending. 
   Since his retirement from Government service, Congressman Guarini has proudly served as the National Italian-American Foundation's chairman emeritus. 
   As co-chair of the Italian-American Congressional Delegation, Frank and I often work together to promote Italian-American culture and traditions in the United States Congress. Just like his congressional career, he does an extraordinary job on this front. 
   I am proud to be the first New Jersey Member of Congress to serve on the Ways and Means Committee since Mr. Guarini's retirement in 1993. 
   Mr. Guarini was a great Member of this body and I am honored to call him my friend. 
   I would like to thank my New Jersey colleague Albio Sires for introducing this resolution and honoring Mr. Guarini, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I rise to speak on an issue on which our Nation is united and the House is united, an issue upon which people from different political parties, people from all races and religious faiths agree upon, and that is the issue of Darfur. It should be a lesson for the rest of the day, what Ms. Lee and what Mr. Smith are doing here. 
   So I stand today as a proud cosponsor of this legislation, the Darfur Partners for Peace for 2007. And I wish to thank both Congresswoman Lee and Congressman Smith, and all the rest who had anything to do with this, my good friend, Congressman Payne, your personal experiences are heart wrenching, and America is listening. 
   America and much of the world stands united on the fact that more needs to be done to end the ongoing genocide in Darfur and finally address the dire humanitarian situation in the region. I have never seen an issue affect young Americans more than this issue on Darfur. We need to tap that. They are engaged. 
   A few nations, including China, have stood in the way of applying real pressure to the Sudanese Government to allow a real U.N. peacekeeping force so that the people of Darfur can finally have a sense of security, like every human being desires. 
   Among those who arguably have not done enough to end this horrendous genocide are the nations of the Arab League. I ask the Arab League to hear our voices, not only in Darfur, but also in the northern part of the continent, also in the Middle East. They must come forward and have the courage and the guts to speak up and do something. 
   The bill before us today would call upon that league to recognize the conflict in Darfur as genocide, the past resolution supporting and accepting a robust hybrid United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force, and to work with all the parties involved in the region. 
   There can be no excuse for inaction. By most estimates, over 400,000 people in Darfur have died, and an astounding 2.5 million people have been made into refugees, creating a humanitarian crisis of shocking proportions. 
   Terror comes in many forms, none of which are convenient. Many worry that the relative inaction of the Arab League to this crisis is subject to fuel the following falsehoods: 
   The fact is that this conflict is not about Muslims versus non-Muslims because the people of Darfur are predominantly Muslim. This conflict is not about Arabs versus non-Arabs because the Arabs of Darfur have stood against the Sudanese Government's war. 
   Quite simply, this conflict is about the Sudanese Government's attempt to subjugate and brutalize the innocent people of Darfur. President Bashir is not in denial. He is allowing the genocide.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   I rise today in strong support of House Concurrent Resolution 68, a resolution honoring the life and accomplishments of Gian Carlo Menotti, who passed away earlier this year at the age of 95. 
   As cochair of the congressional Italian American delegation, I am especially proud to be here today to honor Gian Carlo Menotti. This award-winning composer and champion of artists was one of the most significant composers to emerge after World War II. 
   A native of Italy, he was the sixth of ten children. He began writing songs when he was 7 years of age. If you can flash back to when we were 7 years of age, I know that maybe the Speaker was writing songs, but I wasn't. He wrote both the libretto and music for his first opera, ``The Death of Pierrot.'' He was an immigrant. So we are not only talking about his life, we are talking about all of those immigrants who came here with nothing and made something that everybody was affected by in his life. 
   He came to this country in 1928. And his first full-length opera was ``The Consul,'' which premiered in 1950. He won the Pulitzer Prize for Music and in 1954 the New York Drama Circle Critics' Award for Musical Play of the Year. The piece was translated into 12 languages and performed in no fewer than 20 countries. 
   In 1951 he wrote the Christmas opera ``Amahl and the Night Visitors,'' the first opera ever written for television in the United States. It first aired on Christmas Eve in 1951, and it remains the most popular work to this day. 
   In 1958 he founded the Festival dei Due Mondi, which is the Festival of the Two Worlds, in Spoleto, Italy, as a forum for young American artists who were in Europe. This was a place for them to go to really bevel their skills so that they can communicate to the rest of the world the beauty of music. 
   When the organizers of the Festival of Two Worlds searched for a city, they went to Charleston, a great city which Congressman Wilson spoke of, and I think that is where he was born. So they gave us not only Congressman Wilson, but they also gave us great music. It is a beautiful city, and they saw what was in Spoleto, Italy, and they tried to replicate that. 
   Mr. Menotti founded the Spoleto Festival USA in Charleston in 1977, and it has since maintained the tradition, and you heard the speaker previously speak about how many people go to that festival. 
   I am proud to lend my voice today to the chorus of those in support of this resolution. 
   True, Mr. Speaker, there was no TV series or reality TV reflecting the genius of this man. Thank God. His music spoke for itself and sounded for itself. And when we talk about television and what goes on the tube and what passes for reality and the series that we see and are exposed to that are supposed to reflect to us the ethnicity of certain groups, it is shameful that we do not give presence to this beautiful immigrant who gave his life, as the individual we honored last year, who painted the inside of this Capitol and wound up with nothing in his pocket at the end of it. These are the people that made America. Not the people that get whacked on series. And thank God it is going to be over pretty soon. 
   So we celebrate the accomplishments of Gian Carlo Menotti not just for Italians, not just for Italian Americans, but for all of us. We are all immigrants. We are all immigrants. And so we say that word respectfully as we move towards the discussion and the debate about what our immigration policy will be later on in this year. And hopefully we will come to salient solutions which reflect the best of our immigrant population, every group, regardless of which continent you came here from. 
   So thank you, Madam Congresswoman, and thank you, Mr. Wilson from South Carolina.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentlelady from Wisconsin (Ms. Baldwin), who is a model of sensitivity to the needs of all of our children. 
   I want to thank Congressman Fossella, who's been at the forefront of this. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today regarding an issue that has long been near to my heart. I've been listening to these other bills that have been put forth in bipartisan fashion. This is a good example of what we can do together when it comes to our children, their health care and their education. This is critical. This is important. So anybody who says we can't do it is not listening today. 
   I also want to thank Chairman Dingell, Chairman Pallone for their thoughtful consideration and support for preventive vision care for children. Many a kid has been put in the back of the class or sent out of the room because it was misinterpreted, misunderstood, and many times, that child had a problem with vision, with seeing and was too embarrassed to say so, or couldn't recognize it within himself. So preventive vision care is critically important to avoid vision loss and blindness in our Nation's children. 
   Untreated vision problems can affect a child's physical, educational, and emotional development. That is why for many years, as my good friend from Staten Island has pointed out, we have fought for legislation to set up a grant program to provide comprehensive eye exams and the necessary follow-up care for children whose families do not have the resources or access to such care. 
   The Center for Disease Control states that approximately 1.8 million children under the age of 18 are blind or have some form of visual impairment. Fortunately, vision loss can be avoided with early diagnosis and treatment. That is not so revealing, is it? On any such disease, early vision, early problems affecting vision, early problems affecting hearing, early problems of detection of teeth, et cetera, et cetera, many of these visual deficits are caught only after they have impaired the child's early and most critical education. That's the rub. 
   Eye health has a direct impact on learning and achievement. That's the core of the fight that we have waged. It is a national disgrace, Madam Speaker, that only one in three children receive preventive vision care before they are enrolled in elementary school. That's not acceptable. 
   So I'm pleased to introduce this, along with Congressman Gene Green, and there are many others that we need to salute here who have fought this fight with us, and that is Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Representative John Boozman. Senator Kit Bond on the other side of the building has waged that fight over there. A truly bipartisan effort. 
   It's so easy. I know it's difficult for us as Congressmen to understand that, including myself. But it's so easy that we can come together when the problem is defined and we can work together, together on a solution. 
   Here's a perfect example. The seven bills, the eight bills that we just have gone through, Commerce, these affect people's lives. They're not esoteric. They're not up in the sky someplace. These affect people. 
   H.R. 507 will establish a Federal grant program to provide for timely diagnostic examination, treatment and follow-up vision care for children. 
   This legislation will complement existing State programs and allow eye exams for a vulnerable pediatric population that does not qualify for Medicaid and does not qualify for SCHIP and do not have access to private health insurance. Critical that we understand this. Very important here. Very significant for those families. 
   Better eye care will significantly mitigate the effects of visual impairment. So it's important to act now, Madam Speaker. The prevention is more than half the battle. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Vision Care for Kids Act. Kids out there are waiting for us in all 50 States to act on this. 
   Thank you, Mr. Fossella. Thank you to my good friend, the gentlelady from Wisconsin. And I think that we've hit a home run here for the last hour and a half, thanks to you both.

   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I have a great deal of affection and I have a great deal of respect for the ranking member on the other side, but you are dead wrong on this. 
   First of all, you talk about this side of the aisle not being able to pass AMT. We did pass legislation, and your side sunk it. The alternative minimum tax would be gone, it would be abolished, there would be nada there, but you decided, for whatever reason, that you didn't want to pay for it. That's the problem. 
   Now, my friends on the other side of the aisle are determined not to support this legislation. It should be noted that entities such as Goldman Sachs--I mean, these are not, most of the time, our friends--Bank of America, Caterpillar, Ford, Deere, and Prudential disagree with you, and they publicly support the legislation. 
   Connect the dots here. After all, a number of important provisions, such as the critical research and development credit, the election to deduct State and local general sales tax, the 15-year straight-line cost recovery for qualified leasehold improvements, and the election to expense brownfields environmental remediation costs have already expired. These provisions are so important to American businesses and consumers, and the time to renew them is now. 
   There are a wide array of important provisions here, from renewable energy incentives to middle class tax cuts. I want to add how grateful we should all be to Chairman Rangel for his decision to include a 1-year extension on the active financing rules critical to global competitiveness of U.S. financial services and companies. Those companies in this country that export are at a tremendous disadvantage. We are not playing on a level playing field. Active financing rules provide American companies with the level playing field necessary to compete in the global marketplace. Most other countries don't try to extract any taxes on its companies' foreign-based operations.

<DOCNO>Mr. PASCRELL. (PATERSON GREAT FALLS NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today in strong support of the passage of the Paterson Great Falls National Park Act, H.R. 189. I want to extend my deepest gratitude to the Speaker, Chairman Rahall and Chairman Grijalva for their tireless work in bringing this worthy legislation to the floor. I want to thank all the members of the New Jersey delegation, Democrats and Republicans. All of them endorsed this legislation. 
   As a lifelong Paterson resident, as the city's former mayor, I fought for many years to bring recognition to this site that has played such a seminal role in American history. The National Historic Park is the only way to properly showcase the significant cultural and historic landmarks and natural beauty that the Great Falls Historic Park District has to offer. This legislation ensures that it will get the recognition and support that it richly deserves. 
   Mr. Speaker, 15 miles west of New York City, the Great Falls was the second largest waterfall in Colonial America. At the Great Falls, Alexander  Hamilton conceived a plan to harness the force of water to power the new industries that would secure our economic independence. He told the Congress of the United States and the American people that at the Great Falls he would begin to implement his ambitious strategy to transform an agricultural society, dependent upon slavery, into a modern economy based on freedom. 
   How dare anyone imply that this is not significant. It was the power of the Great Falls. True to Hamilton's vision, Paterson became a great manufacturing city. It produced the Colt Revolver; the first submarine, John Holland, 1878; the aircraft engine for the first transatlantic flight; more locomotives than any city in the United States; more silk than any city in the world. This is not significant, Mr. Speaker? Cotton sails for the U.S. Navy early in the 19th century. 
   Mr. Speaker, scholars have concluded that Pierre L'Enfant's innovative water power system in Paterson and many factories built later constitute the finest remaining collection of engineering and architectural structures representing each stage of America's progress from a weak agrarian society to the leader in the global economy. 
   The Great Falls Historic District is the only national historic district that includes both a national natural resource and a national landmark, the only one in the entire Nation. 
   In a special bicentennial speech in Paterson, with the spectacular national beauty of the falls behind it, the President of the United States, the late Gerald Ford, in 1976, and I had the honor as a Democrat to introduce him that day, Mr. Speaker, said this: ``We can see the Great Falls as a symbol of the industrial might which helps to make America the most powerful Nation in the world.'' Now, so many years later, we are that much closer to making the dream of a national park in Paterson a reality. 
   I do not see facts and figures here, Mr. Speaker. I see the faces of hardworking people from all over the world, who came to Paterson, came to the falls and worked in those factories. We are talking about human beings. We are talking about people who came here and made this country the greatest country in the world, who asked nothing, who didn't get a real living wage until years later. I am talking about those people who are not faceless, who do have names, who worked hard to give their children a better opportunity, a better place. 
   That was Alexander Hamilton's dream, to bring economic superiority to the United States, so that we would not pretend to be an agrarian society for the rest of our history. He introduced the Industrial Revolution; and then, secondly, to give equal opportunity to each person regardless of where he came from, what he looked like, how he cooked his food, how he spoke. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation enjoys bipartisan and widespread support. It is cosponsored by every member of the New Jersey congressional delegation. National conservation and historic organizations, our Nation's most renowned Hamiltonian scholars and distinguished professors throughout America have documented that this historic district is worthy of National Historic Park designation. When the park service says it is not worthy because we have other places, they were even against Lowell, Massachusetts. They didn't support Lowell, Massachusetts either. 
   This has to do with urban parks. This has to do with how we became the country we are today. Editorial boards, Federal, State, local officials and community groups have also endorsed the campaign to create a National Park Service unit. Today, on page 3, U.S. News, a full page on the Paterson Falls and two other places in the United States, where that historic district, where the park service was able to in partnership with the locality, with the State, to bring economic opportunity. 
   It is important to note, Mr. Speaker, that this park will be run as a partnership between the State of New Jersey and the Federal Government, as they already have a State park designated at the site. The National Park Service has a long history of Federal and State cooperation, from the Lowell National Historic Park to the Redwood National State Parks in California. It is park service policy to foster State and Federal partnerships to fund and manage parks. Great Falls will be no different. 
   Mr. Speaker, if the Great Falls District were added to the park system, Federal resources could be leveraged to revitalize the falls, the entire city, the entire area. Through this Federal partnership, the Great Falls will be transformed into an attraction for visitors and Patersonians alike that can lead to the economic revitalization of this entire area, be a living reminder of our Nation's rich industrial history with so many of our star places where we put purple ropes around them, ``don't touch.'' That is not what we are talking about here. We are talking about living history. 
   Congress must act now to pass this vital piece of legislation, so that we may fully recognize these cultural and historic landmarks that have played such a decisive role in America's history. Today, Mr. Speaker, we have that opportunity. I hope we will all come together and support that opportunity.

<DOCNO>Mr. PASCRELL. (PATERSON GREAT FALLS NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. I want to address some of the cogent points that have been presented by the other side. 
   We are not talking about hundreds of square miles here. We are talking about 110 acres of land. We are talking about in the middle of that property the second largest falls in the East. We are talking about what Alexander Hamilton said in 1774, before the establishment of the Society of Useful Manufacturers, before America decided that it was going to go that industrial route so that we would have a multifaceted economy, he discerned that at that falls that water power would bring tremendous job growth and tremendous facilitation to economic growth and industrial growth. 
   He was right. He was absolutely right. No other industrial city, no other city that brought the technology and science from England and from other parts of Europe had the success that Paterson had. There were seven or eight major areas, and I pointed them out and I am not going to do it again. I am going to tell you, there is no other area, and all powered by the falls. 
   Today, when we talk about alternative energy sources, and both sides of the aisle have been talking about it, and talking and talking and talking and talking, it was really at the falls that we had the beginnings of hydroelectric power.     
   I think the significance is not to be simply caught up in how beautiful the place is. We are not talking about aesthetics; we are talking about what the meaning of this place is, where all races and all creeds and all nationalities worked during what we call the Industrial Revolution. 
   This is a national landmark and a national natural landmark, and there is no other place in the United States that meets that criteria. Isn't that interesting. So while the park system opposed Lowell and opposed a lot of things, it is the Congress that will determine in the Constitution, the Congress will determine what is a park system and what is not. That is our authority; that is our responsibility. And today I hope, with your good sense, we will have bipartisan support of this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. PASCRELL. (HONORING THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION ON ITS 35TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Thank you for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the men and women of the Drug Enforcement Administration on the occasion of their 35th anniversary. We must take every opportunity to honor our brave law enforcement officers, but we often forget the critical importance of the DEA and the terrible dangers that their officers face in order to keep our streets safe from drugs. When you look at the list of those who have given their lives, Mr. Speaker, we know how serious this is. And we have this issue occur on our streets every day. 
   I want to congratulate the DEA acting administrator, Michele M. Leonhart, for leading this commendable agency through its 35th year. I want to give great thanks to Gerald McAleer, Special Agent in charge of the DEA New Jersey division, for all of the tremendous work he's done to team with local law enforcement in order to provide the most effective level of security against drugs in our neighborhoods. 
   Just 3 days ago, the DEA in New Jersey teamed with Passaic County Prosecutor James F. Avigliano to arrest six individuals affiliated with the Trey 9 set of the Bloods street gang who were peddling large quantities of drugs in Newark, Parsippany, and in my town of Paterson, New Jersey. These arrests were executed as part of New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine's Crime Initiative to target criminal gangs, drugs, and guns. 
   This particular 35-day investigation was initiated by the prosecutor's office of gang/narcotics task force, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the United States Postal Office, and the Clifton Police Department, proving once again that our greatest level of homeland security can only come from Federal, State, and local enforcement agencies working in this partnership. 
   In regards to the DEA's efforts in this high-profile drug bust, I can provide no greater testament to the urgency of the work than by quoting Prosecutor James Avigliano who stated this: ``Without the outstanding cooperation with the DEA Newark office, we would have been unable to arrest six major gang leaders and confiscate a substantial quantity of narcotics. The assistance provided by the DEA is key to our continued success in taking high level dealers and large quantities of drugs off the street.'' 
   It is due to the critical nature of their work that I am very thankful that we saw fit to approve much-needed funding of the DEA in last year's Consolidated Appropriations Act that put 200 more agents on the street after having to endure a long hiring freeze in previous years. No justification for that whatsoever, Mr. Speaker.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. We must overturn the President's veto, Madam Speaker. This time the President has gone too far. He is jeopardizing the health of over 44 million seniors. 
   This legislation is in the best interest of Medicare patients, physicians, pharmacies, and other care providers. Rolling back this administration's efforts to privatize Medicare is a critical first step in extending the program's long-term solvency. 
   In overturning the President's veto of this legislation, Congress has the unique opportunity to upend the years of this administration's destructive attempts to privatize Medicare. And if we don't, the risk of not implementing these modest but necessary Medicare changes is incalculable. 
   Low-income families stand to become further removed from basic medical care, services and drugs. Physicians stand to be forced out of practice. Pharmacies, overburdened by financial stress, will have to consider closing their doors or laying off workers, actions that will only further depress regional economic activity. 
   As the number of uninsured Americans climbs to new record highs and the economy continues to struggle, this is called for. We must come together, both sides of the aisle, and veto what the President has done.

<DOCNO>Mr. PASCRELL. (TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the distinguished gentlewoman from Wisconsin. I would like to also thank Chairman Dingell and Chairman Pallone for their thoughtful consideration and support for millions of TBI survivors and their families. But I personally want to thank my friend from Pennsylvania, Congressman Todd Platts, for his leadership on this important issue. He has shown true sensitivity, and as cochair of the Congressional Brain Injury Task Force, families all through America could not have a better friend than Todd Platts. 
   I have witnessed firsthand, Madam Speaker, how these programs make a difference in people's lives. Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability in young Americans, as well as being the signature injury of our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   Every 21 seconds, one person in the United States sustains a traumatic brain injury. That adds up to 1.4 million TBIs each year. About half of these cases result in at least short-term disability, and about 50,000 people die as a result of these injuries. Eighty thousand people sustain severe brain injuries leading to long-term disability. 
   The Centers for Disease Control estimates there are 5.3 million Americans who are living with long-term severe disability as a result of brain injury. The national cost is estimated at $60 billion annually. 
   The statistics involving brain injury are increasing even more now that reports show that traumatic brain injuries account for 14 to 20 percent of the casualties for those who survive combat in Iraq. As of 3 months ago, Madam Speaker, 30,327 servicemembers have been wounded in Iraq. Two-thirds of those, approximately 20,000, have had injuries during this war affecting the brain. 
   We are in truly a very important time in history. The brain is the last frontier of science. Many returning servicemembers suffering from TBI will receive excellent care and rehabilitation services within the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs. But others suffering TBI that are initially undiagnosed or misdiagnosed will later look to the civilian community and local resources for information and services, especially those who serve in the National Guard and Reserves. 
   That is why it is essential that we continue to foster collaboration between the civilian and the military, like the Department of Defense Center of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury. My good friend Colonel Sutton has done a fantastic job there to build a system that ensures returning troops receive what they need to put their lives back together again. 
   Unfortunately, TBI remains a silent epidemic in the United States of America. That is why the legislation today, Madam Speaker, is so important. The TBI Act is the only legislation that specifically allocates Federal funds for programs supporting individuals with brain injury. 
   Originally passed in 1996 and reauthorized in 2000, the TBI Act represents a foundation for coordinated and balanced public policy in prevention, education and research and community living for people living with TBI and their circles of support, many times forgotten as well. It has produced results. For 10 years, the Traumatic Brain Injury Act was successfully providing direction and legal authority for the vast brain injury community in the United States. The act was not designed to provide direct care to persons with TBI, but rather to inform. 
   The Health Resources and Services Administration grants within the TBI Act have helped States to improve access to health and other services for persons with TBI. Prior to the 1996 law, they did not have the tools to even access their own needs. Thanks to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we now have a record of incidence, including details and prevalence, plans for prevention, and, finally, access to treatment. We have also begun to educate the public and provide much-needed scientific data for our scientists, our health care providers and policymakers. 
   Madam Speaker, I cannot tell you how crucial this is to those who have TBI folks within their family. This is serious business. They have to live with it as well.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007. This is critical legislation designed to focus on a long-time vulnerability that exists within our Nation. 
   This bill is a real product of bipartisan cooperation. So I want to commend our leader, Chairman Bennie Thompson, as well as Ranking Member Peter King, both of whom I enjoyed working with and continue to work with, even though I am not officially on the committee. You have performed a tremendous service to this country, and we are indebted to you. Your sagacity is seconded by no one. 
   We know that rail and public transportation represent a very tempting target for those who wish to do us harm. London and Madrid are just two recent examples of the mass transit systems that are plagued by terrorism. Last year, in fact, the committee went to Madrid, to Rome, and to London, and we saw the evil deeds of terrorists, and we learned much, and they learned much from us. Thankfully, H.R. 1401 will make needed and long-overdue investments in America's public transportation to ensure that we are safer and more secure. 
   The bill provides for comprehensive, mandatory training for front-line workers. That is so critical for us to understand. These are folks that are on the job every day. Transit employees must know how to identify risks and respond in case of a threat or attack. 
   And you know, Mr. Chairman, I felt very strongly about this, discussed it with both of you, that we need to get more retired law enforcement into these positions of security. They know how to detect the threats that are on the line. 
   The bill also enhances whistleblower protections so that workers can be free to report security concerns. This is critical, Mr. Chairman. This has been so critical in exposing the security gaps at airports throughout the United States of America. If people are not free to tell us what they see day to day and are fearful that there will be reaction against them, that is not good. 
   Most importantly, this bill provides $7.3 billion to public transit agencies, Amtrak, bus operators, and other providers of rail and public transportation. We want people to feel as safe on the trains as they are in the air. 
   We know full well that rail and mass transit have been negligently underfunded in terms of security since 9/11, and it is long past time that we do this.     
   Today we do that. I applaud the chairman and I applaud the entire committee for their hard work.

   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, Hurricane Katrina was more than a natural catastrophe. The painful images of folks suffering, dying, and calling desperately for help will forever be seared in our collective conscience. I rise today in strong support of the Katrina Housing Relief Act, critical legislation designed to respond to the needs of hurricane victims by getting affordable housing in the gulf coast region expeditiously built. 
   I want to commend Chairman Rangel for the steady hand he has displayed in crafting this legislation and also for the collegial spirit he has fostered on the Ways and Means Committee thus far. This is the second noteworthy tax package that has come to the floor in recent weeks, and I am heartened at the bipartisanship that has been displayed. And when it comes to helping those who suffered from Katrina, bipartisanship is the only way to operate.  
   Unfortunately, the immediate response from Washington was handled poorly, insufficiently, and only exacerbated the suffering. Today, we take a step in the right direction. We need to get help to people and get them back in their homes, and this bill does that. 
   H.R. 1562 strengthens existing tax incentives to builders of affordable rental housing by extending the current deadline within which those units must be inhabited by an extra 2 years, to 2010. The bill makes it easier for a greater number of homeowners to benefit from tax-exempt bonds issued by local governments for substantial renovations and to refinance existing residential mortgage loans. 
   These are prudent, practical measures that will do a great deal of good for those in need. I implore my colleagues to support this bill. I again commend the leadership for bringing this to the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in strong support of H.R. 2830, the Coast Guard Authorization Act, as this is a necessary piece of legislation that is vital to our Nation's homeland security strategy. 
   The President and indeed many in this body often talk about the need not to fall back into a pre-9/11 mindset when it comes to homeland security and I could not agree more. 
   This is why I want to start by thanking Homeland Security Committee Chairman BENNIE THOMPSON for all his work to strengthen the crucial port security aspects of this bill. 
   Ever since 9/11 we have faced the fact that our Nation is vulnerable to possible terrorist attack by air, land and sea. In response our Nation's entire security apparatus has had to work harder and stretch their resources farther in order to be more responsive to these increased threats and few agencies have exemplified this more than the Coast Guard. 
   This legislation finally provides the resources necessary to ensure that the Coast Guard can successfully execute all its missions by authorizing the increase of their end-strength by 1,500 members to 47,000 and increasing funding to the Coast Guard to $8.4 billion, a full $200 million over the President's budget. 
   However, this President and many of this body have objected to Section 720 of this bill which would strengthen security around liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminals and tanker ships. 
   These terminals represent a critical piece of our energy infrastructure that could be attractive targets for attack, especially if we allow them to be built without any regard for our ability to secure them. 
   Without Section 720, we would certainly be guilty of maintaining a pre-9/11 mindset that says it's acceptable to maintain soft spots in our homeland security strategy and that is simply unacceptable. 
   I hope we would all learn the lessons of 9/11 and support this legislation in full instead of trying to weaken our comprehensive homeland security strategy.

   Mr. PASCRELL. I want to commend, in the beginning, Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member King for the work of your staff, everybody chipped in; and I really want to commend the work that you have all done. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is about time. Three years ago, the commission put forward a comprehensive evaluation of our Nation's vulnerabilities and listed key recommendations toward making our Nation safer, more secure. We finally passed landmark legislation to close many of the dangerous security gaps, and we are going to do that today. We will address the weaknesses that continue to leave this Nation at risk, and I say it is about time. 
   More than a year ago, Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita reminded us all again how unprepared we still are to deal with catastrophes, whether caused by nature or a terrorist attack. That is the politics. That is the charade. And that charade has been a deadly charade. The Congress will not wait another day to make the necessary improvements to our Homeland Security. This landmark legislation includes many long overdue steps. 
   Our ports and our critical infrastructure will be better protected. Our borders will be harder to enter. Terrorists will confront greater difficulty in obtaining nuclear materials, and our aviation will be better defended, just to name a few. 
   I am particularly pleased with two major provisions. First, this bill would substantially increase the share of homeland security grants that are provided to States based on risk. I fought for this, the chairman has fought for this, I think you fought for this, Mr. Ranking Member. We want 100 percent risk on these grants. 
   It is crucial that we ensure that Federal money designed to better equip and train our first responders actually reaches down to where it is needed most. 
   I have long said that the current system of distributing grant funding to local levels is fundamentally broken. In an era when information can be sent instantaneously any way, any place in the world, it is utterly nonsensical that our Nation's police, fire and EMS personnel cannot consistently communicate with each other. Not another day should pass without us addressing that. Anybody who says that we have addressed it, look at how the administration tried to zero out the interoperability part of the legislation. Tell the truth.

<DOCNO>Mr. PASCRELL. (BROWNFIELDS REDEVELOPMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 644. As a former mayor of the third largest city in New Jersey, Paterson, the first planned industrial city in the Nation and home to some of the country's oldest brownfield sites, I know this bill will be beneficial to our Nation's communities. 
   H.R. 644 authorizes HUD to offer much-needed grants for the environmental cleanup and economic development of brownfield sites, places we drive by every day of our lives. We want to rehabilitate those sites, including inactive factories, gas stations, salvage yards, abandoned warehouses. 
   This bill also makes brownfield-related environmental cleanup and economic development activities eligible for Community Development Block Grants assistance. These sites drive down property values, provide little or no tax revenue, and contribute to community blight. 
   Since the inception of brownfield programs, Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government has allocated over $800 million in brownfield assessment and cleanup funds. In addition, this investment has leveraged over $8 billion in cleanup and redevelopment dollars, a better than 10 to 1 return on investment. It has resulted in the assessment of more than 8,000 properties and helped create over 37,000 jobs. It is a winner. 
   This is because the EPA and HUD grants work in conjunction with funds that come from both the State and local governments, and of course private sources, to address cleanup of brownfield sites. If we don't do this, those sites will remain abandoned and barren for years ahead of us. 
   This is an exciting time in the brownfields marketplace. Federal brownfields programs have provided the foundation on which State initiatives have flourished. Throughout the country, there are thousands of abandoned structures that were once thriving businesses, often part of large industrial centers. Economic development matched with environmental cleanup has resulted in the rebirth of many industrial and commercial properties and surrounding neighborhoods. 
   Anyone who cares about our Nation's cities celebrates these successes. HUD's particular expertise in incorporating brownfields remediation into a larger strategy for economic development and community revitalization is essential to the success we have had and will continue to have in the future. This is a stimulant to the economy, a real stimulant. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this very worthwhile legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. I thank the chairman and ranking member. I really commend the work that you have done, both Mr. Thompson and Mr. King, in this area of reaching across the aisle and not just speaking about it, but doing something about it. 
   This is a very important piece of legislation, H.R. 884. It has been a product of bipartisan effort and collegial dedication by a lot of people on both sides of the aisle, the staffs of both sides of the aisle, and I am heartened at the process by which the bill has moved forward. 
   The commitment of Mr. Thompson and Mr. King to this vitally important legislation has been unwavering, and the collaboration offered epitomizes the very best of what the homeland security can and should be. I was honored to serve on that committee for 4 years, and this is a tremendous achievement to see this proposal move forward. 
   This legislation will help to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security works with our allies in the war on terror to develop and share the best homeland security technologies possible, and we will all be better off because of it. 
   In fact, it was not that long ago that several of us went to Europe, to various capitals of Europe, to see what they were doing in terms of homeland security. That proved to be a very productive trip, and we learned from the Brits and from the Spanish and from the Italians, and they learned from us. This is a true collaboration here. 
   Specifically, H.R. 884 will establish what we call the Science and Technology Homeland Security International Cooperative Programs Office. Its objective will be to facilitate international cooperative activities throughout the Directorate of Science and Technology within the Department of Homeland Security. 
   These international cooperative activities will be supported through grants and cooperative agreements, contracts with the U.S. governmental organizations, businesses, federally-funded research and developmental centers, institutions of higher education, and foreign public and private entities. 
   This bill seeks to strengthen ongoing partnerships, as well as encourage new ones. As has been mentioned by both the chairman and the ranking member, the global war on terrorism is one we have joined with with Israel and the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Singapore and many other countries. 
   To be sure, the United States could greatly benefit from joint international homeland security development programs between the U.S. and our allies in this war on terror. 
   The fact is this: Many of our allies have substantial experience dealing with terror, and by necessity, they have become op-eds for counterterrorism research. 
   The bill would authorize $25 million for international cooperative activities for each of the fiscal years of 2008 to 2011. Now, that is not a lot of money when we consider the vast array of benefits that such cooperative agreements can produce. 
   Forming these partnerships, Mr. Speaker, and working together in a way that will ultimately help secure America is the main objective of the bill, and it should always be the main objective of this whole body. Passage of this legislation today shows that the House takes this austere responsibility seriously. 
   A final point, Mr. Speaker, if I may, the point of global strategy was at the center of the 9/11 Commission Report, Chapter 12. The Commission made recommendations about global strategy. The kind of partnership and cooperation at the heart of our port security, for instance, is determined by how well the other country where goods and services are coming from will cooperate with us. We can't check every ship that comes into our ports, but we certainly could get the cooperation of other countries with state-of-the-art science and technology to do that. 
   Once again, I commend, and I do not speak empty or hollow of the work that both Mr. Thompson and Mr. King did.

   Mr. PASCRELL. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to thank Mr. Rangel and Mr. McCrery for the great work they have done and the great work of ROB ANDREWS from New Jersey, the exhaustive efforts in this regard, to help people avoid foreclosure, to stay in their homes. 
   There is a little doubt that the current tax effect on the struggling homeowners is not fair or prudent. Requiring any discharge of indebtedness to be included in taxable income further exacerbates and endangers the financial health of those already in distress. 
   Think about it: A bank forgives some amount of indebtedness for a homeowner in trouble, either to avoid foreclosure or to forgive a debt to a homeowner in the foreclosure process. Right now the amount of forgiven indebtedness is treated by the IRS as income, which is then taxable. That's pretty incredible, I think. 
   For families across America, this dubious income and the resulting tax burden can cause an even greater level of anguish that they should not have to absorb in the time of need. 
   This legislation would provide a permanent exclusion of gross income of discharged homeowner indebtedness. It is the wise and decent thing to do. 
   And I might add there is danger ahead. Right now between January and September of this year $263 billion of debt that was opened up, people were losing their homes, and in 18 months that is going to go to $700 billion of loans in the pipeline that are going to open up to higher rates. This is what we have to look forward to. This is a serious, serious problem that's not going to go away next week. 
   So I thank both the chairman and the ranking member. With the abundance of acute problems in the mortgage finance system, this legislation can help stabilize families, their neighborhoods and communities, as well as our national economy.

   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to stand in strong support of S. 254, or H.R. 1609 in the House, to award this posthumous Congressional Gold Medal to Constantino Brumidi which would be displayed in the Capitol Visitor's Center. This American immigrant was the creator of some of the most beautiful works of art in the United States Capitol Building. 
   As the sponsor of the House version of this bill and as cochair of the Congressional Italian American delegation, this is an issue very close to me, Mr. Speaker. 
   Now, these things don't happen in a vacuum. I want to express my sincere gratitude to Senator Enzi and Senator Clinton, to Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, to Congressman John Mica, to Congressman Zack Space and Gus Bilirakis, and my very close friend Gary Ackerman, John Sarbanes, Michael Burgess, and Rick Renzi for their tireless work in garnering support for this worthy initiative. 
   If it were not for the diligent advocacy efforts of the Constantino Brumidi Society, the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association, and the National Italian American Foundation, we would not be standing here today. It's as simple as that. 
   Born in Rome of Italian and Greek heritage in 1805, Constantino Brumidi trained in drawing, painting and sculpture at Rome's prestigious Accademia di San Luca. 
   In 1840, this rigorous artistic training was put on display when Brumidi and several other artists were commissioned to restore the richly decorated frescos in the Vatican Palace. 
   He immigrated to the United States in 1852, with nothing in his pocket, and when he died, he had nothing in his pocket. His only objective was to come here and become an American citizen, and he did that in 5 years. He gave it all, as you walk through this beautiful edifice of freedom that everyone knows all over the world. 
   In 25 years, from 1854 to 1879, he decorated the Capitol with murals and frescos. His frescos in this Capitol were probably the first true frescos to be painted in the United States of America. 
   Brumidi believed that the classical architecture of the Capitol Building required real fresco, like the palaces of Augustus and Nero, and the baths of Titus and Livia at Rome, and the admired relics of the painting at Herculaneium and Pompei. 
   His art drew heavily on his training and experience in Rome, incorporating the history and symbols of the United States into his classical repertoire. His most significant influences included ancient Greek and Roman wall paintings and Raphael's classical decoration in the Vatican. 
   Although he's often called the Michelangelo of the Capitol, this immigrant who came here and gave everything to this country, Brumidi perhaps should be called the Raphael of the Capitol, since it was Raphael who was his greatest inspiration. 
   Brumidi's creations in the Capitol Building include his masterpiece, the allegorical fresco, ``The Apotheosis of Washington,'' in the 4,664-square foot canopy over the eye of the dome, 180 feet above the floor of the Rotunda. He also painted the extensive frescos in the Brumidi corridors throughout this Capitol. 
   His last years were spent painting the historic scenes in the Rotunda frieze, even carrying out his own historic research for his work. 
   Outside of his work in this Capitol, he also was well-connected in the Catholic church. His commissions included altar pieces and murals in important cathedrals in Mexico City, New York City, Washington, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. 
   The consummate American, Brumidi is reported to have remarked: ``My one ambition and my daily prayer is that I may live long enough to make beautiful the Capitol of the one country on Earth which there is liberty.'' 
   Sadly, at the time of his death in 1880, as I said, he was penniless. Following his death, his work was roundly criticized by the artistic establishment of his day. However, the 1970s, not that far long ago, brought a renewed appreciation for Victorian architecture and decoration and the growth of the historic preservation, and work was done to restore Brumidi's art to its former glory. Today's scholars are able to fully comprehend the full extent of his talent. 
   Even though he is long gone, it is imperative that we fully recognize the transcendental beauty, the intricate grace he brought to the building that we stand in and that we work in every day. 
   There is widespread bipartisan support for this initiative. You heard how many cosponsors in the Senate, as my  good friend from West Virginia pointed out how many, 307, right here in the House of Representatives. What great testimony. 
   I urge my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, to support this legislation and to remember the background of this individual, his Italian and his Greek heritage, and think of all the immigrants when we think of Brumidi and his contributions.

<DOCNO>Mr. PASCRELL. (FEDERAL PRICE GOUGING PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to rise in support of H.R. 6346, the Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act. And I want to commend the gentleman from Michigan not only for this legislation but other legislation he's put forward debunking the theory that this is simply a supply-and-demand problem. It is not. It is not. 
   The New York Mercantile Exchange laid it out very clearly. The speculators have increased their share of oil futures, oil future contracts to 71 percent this year from 37 percent in 2000.  At the same time, the contracts held by traditional oil users have fallen to less than 30 percent from more than 60 percent. So while this piece of legislation talks about gouging at the pump, there is gouging going on Wall Street; and if you don't want to recognize it, that's your problem. The American people want answers. 
   In these tough economic times, price gouging is a very real problem for Americans struggling to get to work. How about that for openers. As prices climb, so does the potential for consumers to be gouged at the pump. Now, it's $4.07 a gallon; when the President took office in January of 2001, $1.36. That's a 270 percent increase. The food becomes more expensive, millions of Americans lose their jobs. 
   It is shameful that unscrupulous vendors try to make a quick buck by artificially inflating the price. Just last week, officials in my home State of New Jersey issued 350 citations for price gouging-related offenses after surveying 1,000 gas stations. 350 citations. Where is the urgency? If you don't understand the urgency, then we ought to go back to 101. 
   H.R. 6346 will ensure that those who engage in this practice are not only investigated and found guilty, thoroughly punished, just like what we should do to those on Wall Street who gouge those prices who have speculated and speculated and got us to believe at a time when consumption and supply is just about the same as last year. That's ridiculous. 
   This bill directs penalties from price gougers to the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program to help families with their heating and their air-conditioning bills. Twenty-eight States, Mr. Speaker, have anti-price gouging laws on the books. And it's time for the Federal Government to do exactly the same thing. 
   I urge my colleagues to support Mr. Stupak in his efforts and to support the Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act. 
   And I don't sit until I say, Mr. Stupak, the American people say thank you to you.

In the same area, in the same area that I've just heard we should move people out of, you want to lift up. That's what hope is all about. That's what HOPE VI is all about. 
   So I can testify to the success. Come to Paterson, New Jersey, and see how HOPE VI operates. And we want to provide other areas of buildings that are falling down. Why should tenants have to live in those other buildings in that same situation? We want to give hope to those people as well, to provide better housing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, one of President Bush's most used justification for the war in Iraq has been that it is central to winning the war on terror, but the National Intelligence Estimate tells a completely different story. 
   Al Qaeda has only gained strength since the United States invasion of Iraq in March of 2003, and al Qaeda has regenerated in Pakistan along its border with Afghanistan, a reality that may have something to do with the fact that the great majority of our troops and resources are fighting an ill-conceived war in Iraq instead of finishing the job we started in Afghanistan. 
   The sad truth is that when our Nation undertook Operation Enduring Freedom after the horrific attacks of 9/11, we had al Qaeda on the run. We had them on the verge of being dismantled. 
   President Bush decided to alter our mission at a critical time and send our brave men and women to Iraq that had nothing to do with 9/11, to fight a war that has been a detriment to the war on terror. 
   President Bush had al Qaeda on the ropes. He threw them a life preserver. They were weak, and today they're stronger, according to the report. 
   So to President Bush, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who want to stay the course, I simply ask why? Why would we want to continue a war that the American people want to end?

<DOCNO>Mr. PASCRELL. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3773, RESTORE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Florida, and I rise this morning to speak in favor of the rule on the RESTORE Act, H.R. 3773. I believe this is an appropriate rule given the large number of amendments that were considered in both the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees. 
   I want to highlight some of the most important provisions in the bill provided through this rule and steps that I believe can be taken to strengthen the intent of the legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, section 5 of the current legislation requires quarterly audits by the Justice Department Inspector General on communications collected under this legislation, which would then be provided to the FISA Court and to Congress. In the end, the issue is that without outside oversight, such as the FISA Court, you put a huge amount of authority in the hands of a very small number of people and leave an awful lot to their individual judgment in dealing with very sensitive issues of personal privacy. 
   I hope that under this section the Justice Department Inspector General would also be inclined to include statistical information, as is possible, relating to the sex, race, ethnicity, religion and age of U.S. persons identified in intelligence reports obtained pursuant to the legislation. This data will help our intelligence agencies, the FISA Court and the Congress to gain a clear overview of intelligence collection on Americans swept up through these types of investigations and would create the necessary oversight to judge whether a pattern of profiling is occurring. 
   I want to draw attention to the Schakowsky amendment which was approved by the Intelligence Committee. This would require that the FISA Court approve guidelines to ensure that an individual FISA court order is sought when the significant purpose of an acquisition is to acquire the communications of a specific U.S. person reasonably believed to be located in the United States.     
   This is a vital provision to the bill that makes clear that no American can be the target of surveillance under this bill unless an individual warrant is obtained from the FISA Court. 
   Under this provision, I hope we will also make clear the sensitivity surrounding communications between Americans and family members who may live abroad. We need to make certain that no American, regardless of their foreign family connections, can be the target of surveillance without an individual warrant being obtained from the FISA Court. 
   We're not trying to protect foreigners. We're trying to protect Americans and safeguarding the Constitution. 
   I thank the Speaker for the time. I want to thank you, and I hope that the Members will approve the appropriate rule on the RESTORE Act. I thank my friend.

<DOCNO>Mr. PASCRELL. (CONGRATULATING THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE CHAMPION NEW YORK GIANTS FOR WINNING SUPER BOWL XLII -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate the football Giants on their improbable and inspirational Super Bowl victory. House Resolution 960, I'm sure, will get tremendous support here. 
   On any list of the most memorable moments in sports history, the word ``underdog'' often makes an appearance. We always seem to remember the team that overcame adversity, and we always remember the team that overcame doubt to steal victory from the grasp of a supposedly superior opponent in the last second, against all odds, and against all predictions. 
   In some ways, we can all see ourselves as underdogs. Sometimes, no matter what you do, how hard you try, it can feel like the whole world is rooting for the other team and the other guy. There are lessons here of perseverance. Whether you are a candidate, whether you are a Congressman, whether you are a truck driver is immaterial. 
   Maybe this is why the Giants' upset over the heavily favored New England Patriots resonates so strongly with the American people and is sure to be remembered as one of the greatest victories in the history of the National Football League. 
   At the start of the playoffs, no one believed the Giants would defeat the Dallas Cowboys, their flashy division rivals who had beaten them twice during the regular season, but they did. 
   No one believed that the Giants would defeat the great Green Bay Packers; but on the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field, and against a living legend, they prevailed. 
   And no one believed the Giants could compete with New England. The Patriots were the team of destiny. Man, we've heard that on this floor about a lot of things. They had the perfect team, the perfect season to complete. 
   Only God is perfect, Mr. Speaker. Only God. 
   No one but the Big Blue faithful believed the Giants had a chance to win that night. 
   But history is known to repeat itself, and the history of sports is full of great upsets, victorious underdogs, from the miracle on the ice, to Buster Douglas, to Joe Namath. And now, in the same breath, we can say the 2007 football Giants. 
   Who will ever be able to forget the almost supernatural catch made by Wayne, New Jersey, resident David Tyree? Born in Montclair, went to schools there. Indeed, it was this graduate from New Jersey's Montclair High who caught a not-to-be-believed 32-yard pass from Eli Manning that kept the winning drive alive with only 59 seconds left. 
   As the final seconds ticked off the game clock, the emotions and excitement were immeasurable. But it was a bittersweet moment for me. I wished my friend and fellow Fordham alumnus, Wellington Mara, the Giants late owner, was alive to witness it.  
   I congratulate the owners, the coaches and players of the Giants on an incredible season and a historic championship. I wish them the best of luck defending their title next year.

<DOCNO>Mr. PASCRELL. (TEMPORARY TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I want to associate my words with the gentleman, my good friend from Wisconsin, also. You say ``tomato,'' he says ``tomato.'' You call it tax relief; you call it tax cut. You make the choice. You think that the Bush administration and their congressional allies would be in support of this measure. Instead, Republicans are hysterically crying because this bill asks private equity managers to pay the same rate in taxes as most folks in this room. Why should the richest of all Americans pay only 15 percent in taxes when a doctor or lawyer pays 35 percent? Why should the kings of Wall Street only pay 15 percent on their contingency fees when most teachers and police officers pay 25 and 30 percent? 
   I have heard repeatedly in this debate that private equity managers are involved in a risky business so they should be rewarded with the lowest tax rates around. But the risk they carry is on other peoples' money, not their own. When you want to talk about risk, how about the firefighter that rushes into a burning building? Are Republican priorities so skewed that they will spend all their time and effort ensuring that financiers pay less in taxes than first responders? No way.  
   It is another day, and another example of prudent, sound, fiscally responsible legislation from the Democratic majority. Unfortunately, it's also another day of cheap rhetoric and skewed facts from the Republican side of the aisle. Indeed, the debate today says a great deal about the misplaced priorities and values of the other side. 
   Democrats are bringing to the floor a bill that will prevent the Alternative Minimum Tax from hitting 23 million taxpayers this year while also upholding our commitment to fiscal responsibility by complying with Pay-Go rules. You'd think that the Bush Administration and their congressional allies would be in support of such a measure. But no. Instead, Republicans are hysterically crying because this bill asks private equity managers to pay the same rate in taxes as everyone else. 
   Why should the richest of all Americans pay only 15 percent in taxes when a doctor or lawyer pays 35 percent? Why should the Kings of Wall Street only pay 15 percent on their contingency fees when most teachers and police officers pay 25 to 30 percent? 
   I've heard repeatedly in this debate that private equity managers are involved in a risky business, so they should be rewarded with the lowest tax rates around. But the risk they carry is on other people's money--not their own. 
   And you want to talk about risk? How about the firefighter that rushes into a burning building? Are Republican priorities so skewed that they'll spend all their time and effort ensuring that financiers pay less in taxes than first responders? 
   This legislation is wise and it is fair. It will give tax relief to 23 million hard working Americans while ensuring fairness in the tax code. And if it wasn't for the campaign contributions from Wall Street this bill would pass unanimously.

   Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, rather than pulling out the tired old talking points of ``tax and spend,'' I wish my colleagues and my good friends on the other side of the aisle would actually read the Democratic budget resolution. Really, it makes for pretty good reading. 
   If they did, they would see that nowhere in the budget do we call for any increase in taxes; nowhere. 
   In fact, if the Republicans read our budget, they would see that it actually directs the Ways and Means Committee, of which I am a member, to come up with immediate relief for middle-income families who would otherwise be subject to the alternative minimum tax. Unless we reform that tax, 19 million families will have to pay higher taxes in 2007. 
   The President played games with this tax, coming up with only a 1-year fix.  You hear it in your own districts. Democrats are committed to coming up with a permanent solution. 
   Our budget allows the Ways and Means Committee to extend other middle-income tax relief, including the child tax credit and marriage penalty relief, while remaining true to the PAYGO principle. 
   Madam Speaker, this is a good budget that provides tax relief to middle-income families, and at the same time, finds balance within the next 5 years. I suggest we take a look at it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I want to congratulate the chairman for a great job and his counterpart, ranking member. There's a lot of work that goes into this, a lot of work. 
   But just 1 year ago today we were still debating the following: We were debating Federal agencies which still tended to spend needless energy fighting one another over turf and money issues. And it's always been unclear as to who is in charge. 
   The basic issues underlined by the 9/11 Commission and other committees remain unresolved until now. With this piece of legislation, 1684, we are going to really jump into the middle and the center of the storm. We still have inability of police and fire departments to communicate with one another. We still have senseless rivalries among our agencies under our jurisdiction, and, three, there's still incompatibility in computer systems impeding data sharing. 
   The institutions that we have oversight over must understand that they are the three major areas that they must do something about in a positive sense. This legislation before us, 1684, will strengthen the Department through better management and increased oversight. This finely crafted proposal is important to the security of the United States of America. 
   So I commend you both. I commend the chairman for his valiant efforts to improve national security. As a former member of the committee, I've worked closely with him over the years, and can state firmly that no one works harder or smarter on issues that affect America's safety than the gentleman from Mississippi. 
   I also know that working the legislative maze that is Capitol Hill is never an easy task, particularly when it comes to the wide array of turf battles between the various entities. 
   I think the bill we vote on today, which will pass, is a prudent course charted to overcome those obstacles.     
   Indeed, this bipartisan proposal includes many significant provisions aimed at strengthening and streamlining management, organizational personnel and procurement issues at the Department to facilitate execution of our mission. 
   This bill authorizes $39.8 billion in appropriations, $2.1 billion needed over the request of the President of the United States. This side of the aisle, joined by that side of the aisle, will no longer shortchange Homeland Security in the resources and apparatus needed to do the job. 
   This critical funding will help establish important offices, such as the Directorate for Policy, the Office of Health Affairs, and the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications. Areas that are crucial in homeland security but often are ignored. With this bill we no longer ignore the issues that have the potential to cause us severe harm if left unattended. 
   The security of our homeland is as important as it gets. This bill takes this austere responsibility seriously. So I applaud the chairman. I applaud the committee and its fantastic staff for crafting sound legislation. And I implore the support of all my colleagues.

   Volunteers come forward all the time. They come through for us every time. They come through. Three thousand of them came through after 9/11. Thousands and thousands came through after Hurricane Katrina. As we go to the very heart and soul of this great Nation, let us serve these volunteers. Let us serve. 
   I have spoken with these volunteers not only in New Jersey but throughout this great Nation. They always respond after these tragedies, and I said ``thank you.'' We are saying thank you, and we mean it. We are willing to put it in a law, a law of this Nation. 
   I am honored to co-sponsor this and join with Rob Andrews, who has been a tremendous leader in public safety issues throughout the United States, and Carol Shea-Porter and Mr. Castle, real friends of the fire service. 
   How we respond to catastrophes shows the character of our Nation. How we treat our emergency responders shows who we are as people. We take them for granted. Let's be honest. Congress must do everything in its power to help those who help others. 
   We have heard about the 14 days a year as they carry out their duties. But, simply put, volunteers should not be penalized when they are off protecting lives of their fellow citizens. No volunteer should be terminated or demoted or discriminated against in their regular job when they are dealing with emergencies and providing vital assistance to the American family.  
   This amendment ensures that the major contributions of volunteers can and will continue. It ensures that those who have the calling to help will not have to worry about the ramifications of their nobility. It is a wise amendment. It is a bipartisan amendment. I ask for the full support of everyone on this floor

<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am astonished today. It is only government interference when the little guy gets some help from the government. It is not government interference when corporations get subsidies and royalties from taxpayers. That is a different story. Well, it is a different story after November 7. 
   This legislation will require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate lower drug prices on behalf of those who enroll in the Medicare prescription drug plans. The current Medicare prescription drug law explicitly prohibits the Secretary from using the market power. The former Secretary wished he had it, under the Bush administration, this power for the 43 million beneficiaries. This power is splintered now among numerous private plans, and we have headed down the slippery slope of privatization of what were guaranteed benefits at one time. 
   The prices charged by Medicare plans are rising more than twice the rate of overall inflation, and many beneficiaries are seeing substantial premium increases, some as much as six-fold. 
   During the first 6 months of the program, the price for brand-name drugs rose 6.3 percent. For an average senior who relies on four drugs a day, this translates into an increase of 30 percent in prescription drug therapy for 1 year. 
   The simple fact is that part D is doing nothing to truly control the high cost of prescription drugs. In the past year, the average price of 20 top-selling prescription drugs rose 3.8 percent. Following suit, the average private plan price increased 3.7 percent. That means even with part D, Medicare beneficiaries still foot the entire bill for escalating drug prices.

I think that this is truly visionary with regard to the cost, restoring integrity and accountability, and expanding college access. 
   I am the first member of my family to have the opportunity to go to college. I deeply appreciate what the committee has done. There is one part of the bill I want to provide emphasis to and that is the fire safety part. I have worked on this issue for over 7 years. I was deeply involved in the issue after the horrific fire at Seton Hall University in South Orange in 2000. We lost three students. Fifty-eight other students were injured severely. 
   This horrible tragedy made it clear that something needed to be done to educate students, their families, the faculty and the staff about the dangers of fires on campuses; and that is why I introduced the Campus Fire Safety Right to Know Act. Parents and students have a right to know about the school's campus fire safety policies and records. 
   I ask full support of this legislation, and I thank the committee members again for the great work they did.  
   I rise today in strong support for the College Opportunity and Affordability Act, H.R. 4137, and I commend Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon for bringing this worthy measure to the floor. 
   This comprehensive, bipartisan bill will reauthorize the Higher Education Act through FY 2012 while addressing concerns about the cost of education, restoring integrity and accountability to student loan programs, expanding college access and support for low income and minority students, and strengthening our workforce and competitiveness. 
   In addition, H.R. 4137 addresses an issue that I have made a priority for over 8 years, which is vital to the safety and security of American college students--fire safety on our college campuses. 
   The statistics relating to fire safety on college campuses are startling. Each year, thousands of fires rage through the campuses and off-campus housing of our colleges and universities. 
   I became deeply involved in the issue of campus fire safety after experiencing the terrible aftermath of a catastrophic fire at Seton Hall University in South Orange, New Jersey, in 2000. That fire killed three young freshmen and wounded 58 other students in a dorm on campus. 
    This horrible tragedy made it clear that something needed to be done to educate students, their families, faculty, and staff about the danger of fires on the campuses of our colleges and universities. 
   As such, I introduced the ``Campus Fire Safety Right to Know Act,'' a version of which is included in the bill we are considering today. 
   The campus fire safety reporting requirement in H.R. 4137 mandates that colleges and universities provide prospective and current students and parents with a report of the school's campus fire safety policies and records. 
   Educating students about fire safety during their time in school will have a strong impact on the choices they make in the future. If we can influence what they learn, we can create a more fire-safe generation for tomorrow and potentially save thousands of lives. 
   I want to once again state my strong support for this legislation. As the first member of my family to attend college, I applaud the Chairman and Ranking Member for their dedication to making the dream of a college education a reality for so many Americans who otherwise would not have had that chance.

   Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I'm honored to rise in support of H.R. 1851. I commend Chairman Frank and Chairwoman Waters for bringing this worthy legislation to the floor today. 
   This bipartisan bill will increase efficiency in our section 8 housing voucher  program and expand rental assistance opportunities, authorizing 20,000 new section 8 vouchers in each of the next 5 years, with a total of 100,000 new vouchers. 
   Section 8 rental assistance is a critical and widely used program, with approximately 2 million vouchers being distributed by more than 2,500 local public housing authorities. 
   I would like to draw attention to one specific provision of this legislation which will have widespread benefits, if we did nothing else today, and I think is the most meaningful thing we're doing today, by the way, if I may express my opinion, will have widespread benefits for housing authorities throughout this Nation, including those in my district. 
   In 2004, a new formula was instituted to fund public housing authorities that administer the section 8 program. The formula was based on a snapshot of PHA activity for May, June, and July of 2004. As a result, whatever a housing authority's needs were during that short period, they have been stuck with that number ever since. It is simply irrational to fund a program today based on what its needs were 3 years ago. 
   Some housing authorities were continually overfunded, some were underfunded. This provision left some housing authorities scrambling for funds and others with extra funding they couldn't access. 
   The bill we are considering today fixes this inefficient and outdated formula, requiring HUD to use data from the most recent 12 months to determine section 8 voucher funding. It's going to help a lot of people, a lot of people. Now funding will be guaranteed for all vouchers in use. 
   Even this administration has admitted that this flawed formula should be revised. I applaud the Financial Services Committee for including a fix in this legislation. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 1851.

   Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, in case anyone was still under the impression that the President was serious about changing the dynamics on the ground in Iraq, they should put all those hopes aside. If the administration gets its way, this President will leave 8,000 more troops in Iraq when he leaves office than were there before the surge last year. 
   In 2006, before the President's troop escalation plan, there were 132,000 American troops in Iraq. This summer after five combat brigades come home, there still will be 140,000 troops on the ground. 
   There is not going to be a change. Last year the President moved ahead with this troop escalation plan, promising that it would give the Iraq Government the stability to make some of the tough political decisions. As the troop escalation comes to an end, the Iraq Government has failed to bring about any real political progress, and repeated deployments are severely straining our military readiness. 
   Madam Speaker, the status quo is not working. We will continue to fight to end this war and head our country in a new direction.

<DOCNO>Mr. PASCRELL. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, the Wall Street Journal accused us of trying to micromanage this war. Well, this President has not listened to the generals. He hasn't listened to the American people. And he hasn't listened to the Iraqi people. He has micromanaged this failure. 
   Four and a half years ago, Madam Speaker, on this floor I stood in this Chamber, along with 295 of my colleagues, to support the resolution authorizing the President to attack Iraq. I regret that vote deeply. And I told my constituents in my district 1 1/2 years ago that I made a mistake. Down the street they make no mistakes. They are infallible. 
   I did so because the premise on which we authorized this war was false, the military plan for victory has been weak, and more than 5 years later, this war has made our Nation less safe. 
   We stand ready to vote on a different resolution that could take a significant step towards remedying the historic mistake we made in October of 2002. The troop escalation advocated by President Bush will only widen our involvement in this conflict and put more brave American troops in the middle of a vicious civil war. Voting in favor of the President's escalation plan is an historic error, and I stress the historic nature of this debate because I am a firm believer that history is telling of the future. 
   The history of this war shows that this President cannot form the right policy for victory. He should have sent additional troops in 2003 when the generals asked him to do that, when it was possible to restore order in Baghdad, instead of now in 2007 when violence reigns supreme. 
   The history of Iraq shows it has been wracked by sectarian and ethnic division long before it was even a state, a fact conveniently ignored by this President and his supporters on their march to Baghdad. 
   Remember, Iran and Syria and others are possibly fighting a proxy war by  supplying insurgents against an unpopular foreign occupier, the same role that we played in helping the Afghans to fight the Soviets 20 years ago; and we know how that conflict turned out. 
   In history I see the lessons, Madam Speaker. As I speak today, in 280 B.C. when King Pyrrhus of Greece defeated the Romans during the Pyrrhic War, his army suffered irreplaceable casualties in battle. And when he was congratulated on his victory, he replied: ``Another such victory like that over the Romans and we are undone.'' 
   We have heard the word ``success'' and we have heard the word ``victory'' so many times that they are now as pyrrhic, empty, fleeting, hollow.     
   The lesson is clear. The President's escalation plan offers an illusion, when only the real hope is that it offers a Pyrrhic victory at best. 
   Our Armed Forces have been used, abused, refused and accused. They have been overstretched. They were ill-equipped from the very beginning. Don't tell us we don't support the troops, when you did not give what they deserved in the field of battle. Our military readiness to fight the ongoing war on terror is now in serious doubt because of this war. Don't question our patriotism. Don't question our support or the American people's. Listen. 
   By the way, Madam Speaker, have we asked the Iraqis what they feel? Well, 80 percent of them want us out. Don't they count? Can't we ask and listen to at least the very people whose country we occupy, this sovereign nation? This is unbelievable. It is illusionary at best. And what will we say to these Iraqi people? I want to hear the answer from the other side. What is your answer for them when they say, Don't stay here, and certainly don't escalate. I ask the loyal opposition to our resolution to tell the American people how much do the intentions of the Iraqi people really matter to you? 
   The epicenter of our fight against terror is on the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Many of us have been there. Many of us have gone there. You have forgotten that part of the world, which many did not even know on September 11, 2001, where Afghanistan was in the first place. 
   The clear message we send to the Iraqi people and the American people is that we will bring freedom to Iraq, even if it takes the blood of every Iraqi and the lives of more American soldiers. That is not good enough. That is not acceptable. 
   You have heard the statistics from speaker after speaker. Previous escalations in this war have not worked. Why will this one work? Our ill-fated presence in Iraq is being used as a propaganda tool for the enemy, al Agenda, and other terrorists worldwide. 
   In the years since 9/11, more terrorists have been created through this President's policies than were captured or killed. There weren't any terrorists in Iraq in 2003, but there are now. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. PASCRELL. (HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Thank you for yielding. 
   This legislation could not come at a better time. In the State of New Jersey, foreclosure filings increased 5 percent in June compared to a year ago, but even that paled in comparison to the 53 percent increase that occurred throughout the United States of America. 
   I am particularly pleased that H.R. 3221 contains a tax benefit for first-time home buyers. This is a truly meaningful incentive and one that will pull out a large swath of people from the sidelines and into the market. This is what we need. 
   Studies have shown that this will help reduce housing inventory by some 900,000 homes, which will, in turn, stabilize prices. This is wise and necessary at this time. 
   It is in this climate we need bipartisanship. When it comes to helping families keep their homes, working to solve the housing market crisis, there are no Democrats or Republicans, only Americans. We want to reassure the private market. 
   It is in this spirit that I applaud Secretary Paulson for working with congressional leadership to include financial support and regulatory measures for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal home loan bank system in this bill so that they can provide our Nation's families with affordable housing, and for his work in encouraging the President to drop his veto threat of this worthy piece of legislation. Frankly, this is the kind of cooperation from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue which has been long overdue. 
   Congressional changes to help Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae operate are critical to reining in these institutions. Regulation is in order to primarily protect our citizens. 
   I also want to thank the chairmen, Chairman Frank and Chairman Rangel, and all the others and all the other authors of this legislation which will offer real relief to families facing foreclosure and will help other families avoid foreclosure in the future.

<DOCNO>Mr. PASCRELL. (ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, the legislation we have before us today arises at a time when our American workers are suffering under a failing housing market and struggling financial market. I want to commend Mr. Neal and Mr. Reynolds for being advocates for this, not just yesterday, but through the past many years. This is an injustice on the middle class in America. We know it very clearly. 
   I want to commend you, Mr. Neal, for trying to get this done on a permanent basis and paying for it. The sin of this administration is trying to provide tax relief for folks and not finding a way to pay for it. Now we see what situation we are in. Kudos to you. You stuck to your guns. 
   The economic burden on the American worker is enormous, and it should compel us to take a bold and affirmative stand on serving their best interests today. As a proud cosponsor of H.R. 7005, the AMT Tax Relief Act of 2008, I want to also thank our distinguished colleague, Chairman Rangel, for bringing it to the floor. 
   We must remind ourselves that the impact on the AMT as it currently stands will continue to harm the wrong taxpayer. The AMT no longer targets just wealthy taxpayers engaged in tax avoidance. Instead, it targets the unintended taxpayer, the middle class family. 
   The AMT is not adjusted for inflation. In the absence of an indexing provision, it is largely responsible for the rising numbers of middle class taxpayers subject to the AMT. 
   Filers in high-tax States are more likely to face the AMT to a surprising degree. In my State, the State of New Jersey, one of the three highest ranking States in terms of AMT filers, in my home State of New Jersey, $800 million in AMT taxes were paid last year. The three States of New Jersey, New York and California account for 40 percent of the country's 3.15 million AMT returns, just those three States. You tell me about justice in the tax system.  
   Texas, a State with 200 percent larger population than New Jersey, has roughly half the number of AMT filers.

   Mr. PASCRELL. Texas, mind you, with a 200 percent larger population than the State of New Jersey, has roughly half the number of folks who file for the AMT. This is simply not an equitable tax system. It is very clear to all of us on Ways and Means, it is clear to the American people. More and more become eligible, and they have to be informed by those people who do their taxes, ``oh, by the way, you are susceptible to the AMT.'' ``What are you talking about?'' 
   This administration has consistently ignored the tough issues. We could have dealt with the AMT permanently if this administration had taken tax reform seriously. But they refused to sit down with this Congress to have these important discussions. Now we need to take a stand and make these significant changes. In a week we will have to take many stands, because we allowed things to get worse. 
   I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' on the extension of the AMT relief for 2008.

   Mr. PASCRELL. The problem is back in 1998 there were just a few people that were eligible. It didn't make it less onerous, but there were many less people that were subject to the AMT tax. That was the difference. You know what the situation is today, my friend from California.
