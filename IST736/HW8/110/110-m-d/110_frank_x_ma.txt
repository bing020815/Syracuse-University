   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. You have heard about the merits; let me talk about the personal politics. 
   I just ran over here from a hearing that I called at the request of the Republicans on the Financial Services Committee because I was trying to accommodate them. 
   To have this brought up attacking our district as an ambush with no notice, with no discussion when we are trying to do business, when I spent all week trying to work with this administration, and I know all the people on that side didn't like it. I am about to go to conference on the flood insurance bill, and a number of Members on both sides of the aisle have come to me and said we have this issue and that issue. I have promised to give every consideration. 
   To have this kind of a political attack on an important issue to our district with no notice in the midst of our trying to conduct other business is not worthy of the traditions of this House. And I would be glad to discuss this at other times. 
   But I would just advise that if this is the precedent that we are setting, that we no longer decide that a Member knows best what is in his or her district, I will be glad to learn that today.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, what's in this stimulus package is, A, good; B, not enough. But I believe it is important to move it. I say ``not enough'' because the Committee on Financial Services has been dealing particularly with the subprime crisis and the troubles that's generated. 
   We have in this stimulus package, by agreement between both sides here and the administration, some things that would be very helpful. There are further things that are important that are not in this package. No one should think that because they're not in this  package we are not going to go and deal with them. 
   As soon as this is done today, the staff of the Committee on Financial Services will be working closely, we've been in consultation with the Senate and others, on a broader set of measures that will both diminish the economic problems that the subprime crisis causes and also try to deal with the distress that results. 
   But let me talk today about what we do. We increase in this bill loan limits for the FHA and for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We made a mistake at some point in public policy by setting as a limit for those three agencies, which deal with housing finance and facilitate housing finance, one flat nationwide dollar limit. In fact, nothing in our economy varies in the pricing area as much as house prices, because houses are immobile. Automobile prices, clothing prices, food prices, there are some regional variations; but they tend to be closer. 
   House prices have a very great variation, for obvious reasons; and, in fact, the limits that have been set which were intended to prevent luxury housing from benefiting from these public or public/private programs in much of the country excludes not just luxury housing but housing for people of moderate and middle incomes. 
   Now, that's always been a problem to many of us, but recently it's become part of an economic problem. The mortgage market, we understand, has been suffering at the lower end, at the subprime end, because people with weaker credit were charged too much with, we should always note, a racial and ethnic discriminatory factor; but, in general, there was a problem there. 
   What we now face, and have for some time, is a problem at the higher end. Because of the uncertainty in the mortgage market, people are unwilling to invest. People are unwilling to buy the mortgages. We have come to be dependent, unhealthily so it seems to me, on the secondary market in which the originators have to sell their loans. 
   People will not now invest in buying loans that are above the levels at which the FHA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac can provide assurance. Those levels are too low. 
   So what we do in this stimulus bill is to raise the levels of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the FHA, not uniformly but sensibly, as a percentage of median income with a cap. And that's a very important piece in trying to unlock the mortgage market and getting money flowing again. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, the argument has been made that this is just a short-term fix, and that is what we hope it will be. We have both a short-term and a long-term problem. 
   A recession is, by definition, a specific incident in the cycle, and what we are trying to do now is to respond to what we believe and hope to be a specific, more short-term weakness. That's why we are able to come together in a bipartisan way. 
   And partisanship is, I believe, a much unfairly maligned concept. Partisanship is essential to a healthy democracy. There has never been a self-governing polity in the history of the world, I believe, of any size where political parties did not emerge, because large numbers of people trying to govern themselves need an organizing principle other than the authority of the leadership. 
   In America today, a division between the two parties reflects serious, thoughtful differences on how the public and private sectors should interact. We're a capitalist Nation and we're all capitalists, but we differ. On the Republican side there is, I think, an unjustified belief in the essential self-sufficiency of the capitalist system. 
   We believe, following many who have done work on the technical ``doctrine of market failure,'' market failure in the economic sense, that the free market is a great generator of wealth, but that to achieve the quality of life we want, there must also be a vigorous public sector that interacts with it. That's partly in expenditures, because there are public goods that all of us want that the private sector does not have the capacity to produce, public safety and transportation, and including some compassion for those among us who will not live minimally decent lives unless the rest of us show some of that compassion. 
   There is also the need for regulation. And the biggest single problem we face today, I believe, is the consequence of too little regulation. It is possible to overregulate, but it is possible to regulate inadequately. 
   Innovation is very important, and innovation does not survive and grow if it doesn't meet a real need in the economy. One of the innovations of recent times was securitization made possible by large pools of money, by great liquidity that came from various places, not from depository funds, because funds that are in depository institutions are regulated. But a lot of money was generated now, not by bank deposits, but in other ways. And we've also got the ability, technically and in other ways, to sell off those loans. 
   The lender-borrower relationship that was at the core 30 years ago of many transactions has been essentially diluted. And it turns out that those who thought they had a way to substitute for that missing lender-borrower relationship were deluded. The relationship was diluted, but they were deluded in thinking that they had these techniques that would allow them to deal with it. 
   We are in a difficult situation today because the innovation and securitization, which has many advantages, was allowed to go forward without adequate regulation, without people knowing, literally, what they were doing and what they were buying and what they were selling, and keeping things off their balance sheets, and not being reserve requirements and not being careful about what loans they bought. We have differences between the parties as to how to deal with those, and we will continue to work on those. 
   We, however, have a short-term, we hope, shortfall that needs to be addressed. And let me talk for a minute for those who say, Well, what makes you think people are going to go out and spend more because of this? The purpose of a short-term stimulus like this is not to get people to spend more; it is to help them not to spend less. We're not talking about the need for a surge over the norm in consumer spending. We are talking about a fiscal crunch that faces many Americans, in response to which they will have to cut back spending. And people are saying, Oh, they're going to buy flat screen TVs, they're going to do this and that. We have, thanks to the leadership of Speaker Pelosi, a bill before us that will send most of the individual money to people who don't have the option of saying, Well, I think I'll buy another flat screen TV, but who need the money. Helping them avoid pain in their lives and damage to the economy is the justification for this very narrow, short-term stimulus.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, this is a continuation of a program that the Congress adopted in one of the previous Congresses to provide insurance in case of a terrorist attack. We had, obviously, the terrible murderous attack on America in 2001. 
   Substantial damage was done. Obviously, the overwhelming cost of that was in the human lives caused by these murderers, but we also had property damage. And I believe that it is unrealistic to think, and in fact inappropriate to urge, that the private insurance market, which functions very well in this country and serves us well, that that ought to be used in response to terrorism. We bring a bill forward that would provide both for life and property insurance from the Federal Government worked out in various ways. 
   There are two arguments for continuing this on an ongoing basis. Everybody agrees that it needs to be extended for a while. Some have said phase it out, let the private market ultimately take it over. I believe there are two reasons why that is not a good idea. 
   First, virtually no entities that are in the private insurance market believe that the private market could handle this well. Not only do the insurers believe that, but the customers of the insurance believe it. And primarily, by the way, the customers here are commercial real estate developers. People who are going to build large commercial buildings with tens, hundreds of millions of dollars in construction costs cannot build without a bank loan, and the banks will not lend and would not be allowed to lend by the regulators without fully insuring against all risks, including the risks of the terrorism that we wish were not around but clearly still is. 
   We do not believe, based on extensive conversations with virtually everyone in the marketplace, that this will work. In fact, I submit for printing in the Record a letter from the head of Goldman Sachs in 2005, that very important financial institution, clearly an entity that knows a great deal about the market. And in 2005, only 2 years ago, after we had TRIA for a while and the question was coming up about whether or not to continue it, he wrote to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Baker), then Chair of the Capital Market Subcommittee, that: 
   ``Current data suggests that reinsurance, and consequently insurance, participation in the terrorism insurance market will decline if the Federal backstop is left to expire. 
   ``Some have suggested that private markets for terrorism can successfully utilize risk transfer mechanisms such as catastrophe bonds. 
   ``There is no evidence to suggest that the rating agencies or capital markets investors will be able to quantify the risk.'' 
   And what he says is that he does not believe the market can do this.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself first 30 seconds to note that I was impressed when the gentleman said he was going to vote against this bill because of this new amendment. But he voted against the bill the last time, so apparently my friend from Alabama intends to vote against this bill twice, because he voted against it in committee. So no one should think that the effort to deal with PAYGO is the reason he's voting against it. 
   Secondly, no one is asking anybody to accept any blank checks, and that is a misrepresentation of the legislative process. Changes will be made, I hope, in an open way. There will be an open conference, in total contrast to the way in which his party operated. I guarantee Members, as chairman of this committee, that we will have a conference committee, it will be a legitimate conference committee, and everything will be done openly, and votes will be taken. So no one is asking anybody to do anything in secret. 
   And again, the gentleman, having already voted against the bill, there are only so many bases you can claim on which you vote against the bill. He says he's not going to vote for the bill. We never thought he would. He voted against it the last time. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Ackerman).

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I agree with the gentlewoman on both points. First, there is nothing in this language, and I should say that this issue of preventing unfair denials of life insurance, she was the one who brought it up. She brought it up in the prior Congress. And now that we are in the majority, we are able to accommodate it. 
   I appreciate the fact that the gentlewoman worked with us as we worked with the life insurance companies. I believe we have an acceptable set of principles. She is right that this language does need a little bit more, I think, refinement on conflict. I think there's a conceptual agreement. I agree with her as to the need for definition. 
   As a preemption, that is very simple. I am a strong believer we should not be preempting unless we say so explicitly. There has been an excess of subtle preemption. By itself, this bill does not do that. Insurance has been primarily a State issue. This is a Federal statement, but it is not at all meant to be preemptive.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Before I yield to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch), I would just point out that when we voted on this in committee before we had the PAYGO glitch, the vote on the Republican side was 19 opposed, 14 in favor, so it was hardly a one-sided partisan bill. It partly reflects the work that the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kanjorski) did in accommodating a lot of the concerns.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. If the gentleman would yield, he has pointed to a very important issue. We did try to make some accommodation with the small insurers, but I don't think we have finally done that. But I would say, you know, the notion that a bill that comes to the floor is not graven in stone shouldn't come as a surprise to people. We have a Senate. We have a genuine conference. It will be an open conference. 
   I should say I understand why some of my colleagues on the Republican side were somewhat puzzled at the notion that we might go to conference and, in an open way in conference, further amend the bill. They didn't believe in that. They didn't have any. So for them, that was all done in secret. 
   We will have an open conference to address these. And this is one of the issues. I do believe that it is legitimate. We will be meeting with, and the staffs will be meeting with, the smaller private insurers. To the extent possible consistent with the purpose of the bill, we will seek to improve on the accommodation.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I recognize myself for 1 minute. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is an agreed-upon set of amendments. As I said, it was a bipartisan process, to some extent, in drafting. This makes technical revisions and requires Treasury to promulgate rules to clarify the nuclear, biological, chemical and radiation certification process. It provides that there be indexing, which is, I think, in accordance, there are some copayments, et cetera, and these will be indexed. It applies the reset mechanism to the deductible for nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological, and it makes technical and conforming changes. I believe, as I said, this represents a consensus. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member. We were able to work out a number of these things. I would just want to return to a couple of broader points. I want to make two points. One, I don't think the market will work and neither does any participant in the market either as an insurer, or any significant number, or as the insured. But even if it could, it does not seem to me that it should. If you did this purely in the private market, you would give to the vicious attackers of America the power to decide that it would be more  expensive to do business in some parts of our country than others. You could have another video from the despicable Osama Bin Laden in which he could threaten that he would take action against this area or that area, these facilities or those facilities, and their insurance premiums would go up. 
   Yes, the private market should govern all those things which it deals with, with fire and with other forms of casualty and even with natural disasters. But to put in the hands of America's enemies this economic power is a grave error. Should the taxpayers pay for it? Yes, because it is a matter of national defense. It is a matter of homeland security. We are not talking about insuring people against the risk if they built a commercial building of liability to injury, of fire, of theft, of improper or inadequate construction. We are saying that, no, if you are in business in America, you should not have to insure against an attack on this country based on hatred of us. 
   So that is why I believe that we should do this as a public policy matter. 
   Mr. Chairman, at this point, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina, a member of the committee who is one of our most thoughtful Members to discuss the general principle of the bill.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I join the gentleman in opposition, and I want to address this charge that we heard from one of the Members that this is a typical liberal Democratic big-spending program. 
   I will include for the Record a strong endorsement of H.R. 2761 from the Coalition to Insure Against Terrorism. It is composed of such traditional liberal groups as the American Bankers Association, the National Apartment Association, the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Retail Federation, the National Restaurant Association and the National Association of Industrial and Office Property. Virtually every business involved in this, the Financial Services Roundtable, led by that radical, our former colleague, Mr. Bartlett of Texas, every business group from the insuring and insured part says this is not for the market. 
   I would add also a letter from the National League of Cities strongly urging on behalf of the cities of America passage of this bill as it was reported out of committee. 
   Finally, from the American Insurance Association, a strong argument. In particular, it thanks us for including nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological. 
   Those who said the market can do it, it says two separate government studies have concluded what insurers already knew, that outside of State mandates, there is virtually no private insurance market capacity for NBCR. ``For this and other reasons,'' they like the whole bill, ``the American Insurance Association and its more than 350 property casualty insurance companies strongly endorse H.R. 2761 as it was reported out of the committee.'' They have got some concern about the reset, and we will talk about that and we agree with them. But here is this strong endorsement. 
   Yes, it is true that this is something that some liberal Democrats support. And here is the signer on behalf of the American Insurance Association, Governor Marc Racicot, I believe a former chairman of the Republican National Committee. I want to congratulate my Democratic colleagues. To have insinuated a liberal Democrat into the chairmanship of the Republican National Committee is a degree of flexibility I didn't know we have. 
   So this notion that this is some liberal invention and that the market can do it is repudiated by everyone who knows anything about the market. I hope the amendment is defeated and the bill is passed. 
   Vote ``Yes'' on H.R. 2761 
   The undersigned members of the Coalition to Insure Against Terrorism (CIAT), a broad based coalition of business insurance policyholders representing a significant segment of the nation's GDP, strongly urge you to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2761 Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2007 (TRIREA).

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I would say yes, the taxpayers do pay. It is a matter of national defense. Where people are building and incurring risks, they should pay for it themselves. I accept that point. We are talking about how we respond to Osama bin Laden or other murderers who would attack this country. 
   I think it is appropriate that the country as a whole respond, and not allow the terrorists to pick and choose which Americans will have to suffer disproportionately.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. First of all, of course it says ``promptly.'' Members make a choice. The purpose of this is terrorism risk insurance expires the end of this year. We are on a reasonable timetable but not one that has a lot of water in it. 
   Yesterday, on an important bill that goes before the Committee on Financial Services, they said ``promptly.'' So the notion is that they can make the Committee on Financial Services a revolving door and then complain when we can't get the work done when we will have to do it two and three times. 
   Secondly, Members on the other side, and I don't know where the gentleman from California was on this, but in Committee, before the PAYGO problem arose, while we got substantial Republican support, 14, 19 Republicans, including the ranking member, voted ``no.'' So the Republicans had taken an opposing position in the majority. The administration is in the majority against it. 
   And what are they telling us? That a bill that the Republicans on the whole are against doesn't do enough for the people who want the bill. This is people intervening on behalf of people who don't want their intervention. 
   It is true that there is some ambiguity that I hope will be resolved; but the American Insurance Association, and that is the group that, despite the Republican's argument that this can be done by the market, says no, the market can't handle it. And, in a letter signed by a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, Governor Marc Racicot, president of the AIA, they say please go ahead with the bill. And they say: We have concerns about this fix. We hope we can go forward and work on it as opposed to delaying it further. 
   We got a letter today from the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, the Bankers, the League of Cities, being aware of the problem and of the first cut at fixing it, that say please go forward. 
   Now, if the people who were expecting to be the participants in this program said, wait a minute, this can't go forward, they would be, I think, entitled to be listened to. When people who have on the whole been opposed to the whole program and who voted against it before this arose now appear to say, oh, my goodness, this poor program, you are not doing enough justice, when they want to kill it, I don't think have a lot of credibility. 
   So, yes, this does need some work. There are a variety of suggestions that have been made. We do have a Senate to go forward and we have a conference process. 
   And I will say to the Republicans, I understand their skepticism about a conference process, because when they were in the power, they didn't have any. They did a lot of backroom, okay, we will do this. 
   We will have a conference. I am chairman of this committee. I can promise, and I have talked to the leadership, we will have an open conference and there will be debates and discussions. 
   I am explaining it because the Republicans, some of them, the newer ones don't know what one is. It will be the  House and the Senate, and we will talk about it. And so we will address this particular issue. 
   And, again, all of those who are in favor of this program as it was drafted, all of them want us to go forward as we continue to make this final fix. Most of those who are saying, oh, no, you can't go forward, it is not perfect, didn't like it in any case.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I thank the gentleman, but I take back my time. He will vote in favor of the legislation after it is sent back to committee, after it is wide open again to an amendment process, after members of the committee on his side of the aisle will offer a whole lot of new amendments. And so weeks could go by before we are able to get floor time again and do it. There are a lot of things on the floor, and they are complaining that we didn't pass other things. 
   So the gentleman will vote for it in the sweet by-and-by if we send it back. There is an alternative: We go through the regular process. The Senate votes on this, aware of the CBO. We go to an open conference. We debate it, and we bring that to the floor.

   The fact is that I understand turf makes some people jittery. And I will certainly advocate that the Rules Committee be included in the conference report. 
   Again, the Republicans have forgotten how conferences work. Conferences can have more than one committee, so the Rules Committee can get representation on the conference. 
   Again, everybody who is for this bill in the House and the private sector, people on the whole and the cities, the representatives of the public affected, want us to go forward and say, in good faith work, this out. 
   People who have been on the whole opposed to it, not entirely but on the whole opposed to it, have found this hook to try and hold it up. I don't think they are trying to hold it up to make it better when a majority of them wanted to kill it in the first place.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2761, TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, there are several aspects of this. One is, of course, whether or not we should go forward with a renewal of terrorism risk insurance. 
   There are, in our midst, people who believe in the free market so firmly that they believe in it the way other people believe in unicorns. They believe in it even when it does not exist. There are people who oppose terrorism risk insurance from the outset and continue to because they say it should be up to the market. No one involved in the market thinks that makes sense. Indeed, we received a letter from the head of Goldman Sachs in 2005 saying there is no evidence that this can become a market item. His name was Henry Paulson, and he quite clearly said at the time the market wouldn't do it. We then proceeded with a bill that took that into account. 
   By the way, if the market could do it, it shouldn't because here is what the market would do, and we are talking about the insurance market: If you left this to the market or if you try to phase this out so the market would take it over, the principle of insurance says it should be more expensive to do business in those parts of the country which are likeliest to be hit by terrorists than not because that's the insurance principle. If there is a higher risk, you charge people more. We should not allow murderous fanatics who seek to damage this country to dictate what the cost of doing business is in different regions. That's not a market decision; that's a national security decision. I don't want it to be more expensive because of the murderers who would try to undermine this country to do business here or there. 
   It is also the case that one of the principles of insurance is that you give it and you give incentives to the insured to reduce the risk and you price in a way that gives those incentives. People can't avoid the risk. There is nothing you can do to stop the terrorists as private citizens from attacking you. 
   So we were going ahead with the bill. Now, we had a set of markups in subcommittee and committee in which there were some disagreements but some agreements. A number of amendments offered by Republican Members were adopted and the bill had a very large vote coming out of committee. 
   We then ran into a surprising obstacle. The Congressional Budget Office issued what seems to me an intellectually quite weak opinion. They said this is going to cost $10 billion over the next 5 years. Now, a $10 billion terrorism attack is not within our contemplation. I could see their saying it is not going to cost anything for this period or that it is going to cost hundreds of billions. Apparently they calculated the probability of a terrorist attack and imputed that cost. There will, in fact, be no costs until there is an attack. 
   My own view, frankly, was that this would have justified an emergency waiver under PAYGO. If being attacked by terrorists, if September 11, 2001, was not an emergency, then I don't understand what the word means. 
   We have been forced now to try to deal with this in other ways, and I understand that. It has been forced on us by CBO. The notion that we can say something now and leave it to future Congresses, the gentleman from Texas said it was unconstitutional. I am aware of no Supreme Court decision that would invalidate what we have  proposed here. And it couldn't be binding. Nothing is binding of one on a future one. I think that would be a very high degree of probability. 
   So we do have this approach which came up suddenly. It came up suddenly. It wasn't debated in our committee because the issue of the CBO estimate hadn't come before us in the committee. So we now have Members on the other side complaining that the rule was too restrictive. 
   Mr. Speaker, when I hear Members of the Republican Party who ran this House in the most blatantly undemocrat fashion for so many years now complain about a lack of democracy, I feel like I am in a motion picture theater and I'm watching an Ingmar Bergman dark movie which features the Three Stooges. The incongruity of these masters of authoritarian legislative procedure now complaining because there isn't enough democracy is one of the great conversions of all time. And I would have to say to my born-again believers in an open process that in this case at the committee level, we had a hearing, we had a subcommittee markup and a committee markup, and we dealt very much with those issues. 
   My own preference would have been to allow a few more amendments, but the fundamental issues have been debated, and the key issue is, unfortunately, the one that has troubled them, is how do you deal with the CBO. Now, either you do a waiver of PAYGO or you make cuts now of $10 billion in programs on the possibility of there being a terrorist attack. It seems to me that is a great favor to terrorists. Let them cut programs now by just threatening to blow us up. Or you try to come up with some set of procedures that say we really intend to do this but we can't make it absolutely binding. 
   I do not think the set of procedures we have here will be the final say. It was a difficult situation that we found with that, I thought, CBO estimate. And the CBO estimate basically says here is what we say but it's probably not going to be this way. And I hope, as we go forward, there will be meetings with industry. And, by the way, industry is not just the insurance industry. It's the commercial building industry. They are the ones who are at risk here. The insurance industry can walk away, but if they walk away, we won't get commercial buildings built, particularly in our big cities, which is why the mayors of the big cities are so concerned and others are concerned about economic development. 
   So we need further work to see how we can deal with this CBO issue, and I think we have a reasonable first cut. It is one where, it is true, we did not deal with it in our committee. What we dealt with in the committee in great detail with a number of amendments and a lot of compromise were all the other factors. And we now get this new issue. This is a good-faith effort to deal with the new issue but not in a way that is final. So I hope we can go forward.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. A former President once unfairly characterized a leader of this House as someone who couldn't walk and chew gum at the same time. The gentlewoman from West Virginia extends, frankly, that insult to the whole House. She suggests we can't do two bills in one night. She says we should work to try to help avoid foreclosure. I agree. That's the next bill which we will get to after all of this useless temper tantrum is over, we will get to it at 3 o'clock in the morning, but we will get to it. 
   That bill will help avoid foreclosure. I know the gentlewoman agrees. She voted for that bill in committee although a majority of her colleagues were against it. 
   But I do not understand how anybody could argue that doing this bill now interferes with that bill later. They are totally not in conflict. 
   So the notion that this bill doesn't keep people out of foreclosure is true. It doesn't combat global warming. It doesn't get troops out of Iraq. It won't help me lose weight. There are a lot of things this bill won't do that I very much want to do. None of them are a reason to vote against a bill that doesn't do what it doesn't say it's going to do but does what it does. 
   What it does is to go to the aid of cities that have been victimized by the deregulation run rampant, perpetrated by this administration, which has led to the subprime crisis. We have vacant property everywhere in these areas. 
   Now the argument that this is going to award speculators and be an incentive to do foreclosures is also flatly wrong. This is $15 billion. People will tell you it's a lot of money, and it is. Do you know how much money this is? This is half of the money that this administration made available to buy up the debts of Bear Stearns. Now, I think they had to do that. I think they were forced to do it. But I think we have to do this as well. 
   I do think that the whole country, under this administration's calculation, ought to get at least half of what Bear Stearns got. That's all that this does. 
   Now, unfortunately, it's not nearly enough to buy up the property that's foreclosed. So anyone who says, I'm going to foreclose today because I want to get in on this, would be nuts because there is already property ahead of them. And even when this bill becomes law, if it does, there's a 60-day wait, and I hope it will be part of the stimulus. 
   Property that was once paying taxes because of this subprime crisis now eats taxes. It bites neighborhoods. And, yes, some of the people who foreclose may benefit here. But we are telling the cities and the States to be careful with this money. They have to buy it for affordable housing. That will put limits on what they will pay. 
   And you can say, well, why don't the cities do it on their own? Because the very cities that need help here have lost revenue because of this foreclosure. These properties are fire traps; they attract people who break the law; they attract sanitary nuisances. They lead to water hazards.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I always feel good when people make arguments against legislation that won't really deal with the legislation. The notion that the problem with this bill is that it doesn't help avoid foreclosure, when it was not the bill intended to avoid foreclosure, shows well, there's a dearth of arguments against it. 
   The argument that it's going to reward the speculators, this will go to  cities dealing with property that is causing them problems. Do we not trust the cities and States of this country to take this money and use it judiciously and wisely to prevent neighborhood decay? 
   I don't understand the animus that motivates so many of my Republican colleagues that say, Oh, no, let's not have government intervention here. Well, we heard that a while ago, and people on the other side successfully blocked government intervention in regulating subprime mortgage origination outside of the banks. It was this religion of never intervening that brought us here. A limited intervention to undo the negative consequences is what this bill calls for.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Of all of the unfair accusations, the one that blames the Community Reinvestment Act for this is the strongest. 
   The Community Reinvestment Act was passed in 1977. This subprime crisis, of course, did not appear until nearly 30 years later; but more important, the subprime loans that caused problems were overwhelmingly made by institutions not covered by the Community Reinvestment Act. It covers depository institutions: banks and thrifts and credit unions. Credit unions aren't covered. Banks and thrifts. 
   If only those institutions, deposit-taking, regulated institutions covered by CRA had made these loans, we wouldn't have had the crisis. The loans were made by institutions not covered by CRA 30 years, 28 years after CRA was passed.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I will take back my time. 
   First of all, I thought I heard the gentleman talk about the Community Reinvestment Act. It's been late. I keep hearing, ``I move to adjourn.'' Maybe my ears got a little curdled. 
   I thought the gentleman said, and we'll check the record later. If he didn't mention the Community Reinvestment Act, I will apologize. 
   But no. I for one have been saying that we should not be pushing people into homeownership when they can't handle it, and part of the problem here was killing affordable rental housing. 
   But let's have the record clear. There is no rational way to blame the Community Reinvestment Act passed in 1977 and not cover the nondepository institutions for this crisis caused by the nondepository institutions.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I will respond at great length later, but I would say this. 
   I said I did not oppose, myself, what they did. I was talking primarily about the Bush administration. 
   Now the ranking member said 17 Republicans out of almost 200 signed this letter. I don't think that's the majority of Republicans. They didn't oppose it. They raised questions about it. 
   But it was the two highest ranking economic officials appointed by the Bush administration, Chairman Bernanke and Secretary Paulson, who did this; and it's the Bush administration that seems to me to be totally inconsistent here. So yes, I did point to an inconsistency between the Bush administration doing the bailout and their opposing this. I'm setting a precedent. I hope the citizens will think we are setting the precedent of coming to their aid from time to time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I did note, and I welcome the gentleman from Michigan's affirmation, that this is not simply for banks, investment houses, pirates, lechers and other ill of sordid folk. He is seeking to give preference to veterans, members of the Armed Forces on active duty, members of the National Guard or Armed Forces Reserve, school teachers and emergency responders. 
   I agree with these priorities. It is, of course, an affirmation that this bill will benefit these people, unless we are to assume that they will be given a preference which is of no benefit to them. But if this bill is of no benefit to anybody but speculators, lenders and riffraff, then why give preference to these people? I agree with the amendment to that extent, and so I would just say that this underlines the point that there are very worthy beneficiaries. 
   But now I also want to return to the matter of the Bear Stearns issue. I will acknowledge, I did receive a letter from 17 Republicans, which is, by my math, not a huge percentage of 199 or 200 or whatever the declining number of Republican Members of the House is these days, but it is still not a very large number. And even in that letter, while it was not thrilled by the Chairman Bernanke-Secretary Paulson collaboration, it does not have one word in strict opposition to it. Nor does the letter that 24 Republicans--a slightly larger number, but still not even 15 percent--sent to Mr. Bernanke again raising questions. 
   So, yes, 24 Republicans have raised questions, Members of the House, about this bill. I will repeat that my accusation of inconsistency goes to the Bush administration primarily. They are the ones who engineered the $29 billion. They are the ones who are vehemently opposed to this. 
   Now some Republican Members did raise a question that said we should look into it and we're skeptical of it. I agreed with that. As I said in the letter, I think we should study it. I did think we should study it a little later for two reasons; first of all, I do believe  the subprime crisis is a crisis, some Members on the other side do not. There are, among the signers of this letter, some of those who, from their very conservative ideology, oppose any action by this Congress regarding the subprime. I mean that quite literally, they oppose any action to deal with this. That's their right. But I would put dealing with the subprime crisis ahead of a backward look, as important as that ultimately will be, at what happened with Bear Stearns. 
   Secondly, I want to look at what the Fed did there in the context of how can we make it less likely that it will happen again? I wasn't happy that it happened. I think there was a necessity in those circumstances. So what I said in the letter that I sent back to the authors was, yes, we should look at this in the context of the broader question: What powers do we need to give either the Federal Reserve or somebody else to make it less likely that this happens again? 
   So, yes, I should, we should, look into it, but I think we should look into it not simply from a kind of retroactive bawling them out, but how do we prevent it or diminish the likelihood of it happening? But the inconsistency remains. Twenty-four Republicans said they had questions. On the whole, I haven't heard any Republican opposition to it. I haven't seen any resolution opposing it. 
   It was the Bush administration, and this is my point: I thought it was unfortunately necessary. The Bush Administration, this is Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke, they were the ones who did this. And I think they have been responsible in trying to deal with this crisis. But for the President who appointed those people to now denounce this because it's going to help, among others--and by the way, let's be clear, if this amendment passes, as I hope it will, we will be giving preference under this bill to veterans, members of the Armed Forces on active duty, members of the National Guard or Armed Forces Reserve, school teachers and emergency responders. So we have a Republican affirmation that these are among the beneficiaries. 
   And when you talk about bailing out investors and speculators, yes, that's what happened in the Bear Stearns situation. These were precisely the people who had done business with Bear Stearns. Now I believe that years of inadequate supervision of the economy, flawed legislation adopted when we repealed Glass-Stiegel and didn't put in regulations to deal with it at the time, that was supported by the Clinton administration and I voted against it. But when that happened, we invited the kind of problems that the leaders of the economic policy of the Bush administration had to implement. And it is that administration which is therefore being totally inconsistent in this regard. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I want to address both the procedural and substantive objections. 
   First, procedurally, I understand there are some legitimate concerns about the second rule that we will deal with. But as to this rule, I will say categorically I was the ranking member on the Committee on Financial Services for 4 years. The rule today gives more scope to the minority's amendments than any rule under this committee's jurisdiction when they were in the majority. 
   The gentleman complained about an amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ginny Brown-Waite). There is an amendment on the subject of illegal immigrants and their benefits in this bill. There were four such amendments. One was made in order. Putting in order duplicative amendments serves no purpose. 
   But when the Republicans were in power, we had situations where motions adopted in committee were changed by the Rules Committee, and we were not given an opportunity to vote an amendment and discuss that on the floor. That was on the GSE bill. There was never a time when, under the Republican rule, we had as much ability to offer ours.  
   There are three substantive amendments offered here. Five were already adopted in committee. 
   Now as to the substance. The notion that this helps lenders is bizarre. This is one that is strongly urged for mayors, Governors, police chiefs and municipal officials. Property already foreclosed used to pay taxes. It now absorbs taxes. There are fire hazards, there are nuisances, there are threats in terms of sanitation. 
   The problem is that many of the cities that have this problem of foreclosed property don't have the financial wherewithal to buy up the property precisely because they have lost tax revenues. They are in a vicious cycle. We are offering this money, and it is a need-based formula. The money goes to where there is the most foreclosed property. 
   Now it is true that it is $15 billion for the entire United States. We are in a terrible crisis, and this bill would provide $15 billion to elected local and State officials to buy up property. That's an awful lot of money. It is half what this administration offered to the counterparties of Bear Stearns. 
   Now I thought that the $30 billion offer to the counterparties of Bear Stearns was an unfortunately necessary request. But how, Mr. Speaker, do people in an administration that gave $30 billion of taxpayers' money, put that at risk for the counterparties of Bear Stearns, object when half of that is made available to all of America to abate fire high hazards and to preserve neighborhoods from serious problems? 
   The lenders don't benefit from this. In fact, we have a later bill in which we are going to be accused of not doing enough to put you into foreclosures. This bill says that when the property has already been foreclosed for at least 60 days, the cities and States may work with profit or nonprofit groups to make it available for affordable housing, to make it available for local employees. I guess when you don't have a serious argument, you just make things up. This one is totally unconnected to reality. We have been asked by local officials and worked with them. There is a great deal of property that has been foreclosed upon. 
   By the way, to anyone who says this is an incentive to foreclose property, there isn't enough money in this bill to begin to buy up all that's already been foreclosed. No one who hasn't yet done it is going to get any benefit from this, but let's get back to the basics. 
   Thirty billion dollars of public money has been made available for the counterparties of Bear Stearns, I think, of necessity, to avoid greater danger. But how, having done that, do you denounce half that amount of money for the whole country to cities and States to buy up foreclosed property that is blighting neighborhoods? 
   Then the gentleman from Washington said, well, why should the rural areas be forced to deal with this when it's a city problem because there is foreclosed property in many places? But that kind of rhetoric that sets one against the other, I don't think is very productive. 
   I guess I would say this: Why should the people of Detroit and Cleveland pay subsidies to farmers who make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year? We are going to pass an agricultural bill that's going to ask people in the cities to pay for agricultural subsidies. I don't think it is very sensible to start this kind of thing. We are going to bring forward housing dealing with rural housing. 
   America is in a terrible financial situation brought about by irresponsible economic activity unchecked by reasonable regulation. This is one small piece of dealing with it, and it is far less expensive than other pieces these people have supported.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, first, let me say that I think this is a very reasonable motion to instruct, and I urge all Members to vote for it. 
   I do want to take a moment, since we are talking about the Native American housing benefit, to explain to people what the major issue is. It's not the subject of a matter of discussion. It wasn't that controversial in our committee, and it has to do with the action of the Cherokee Tribe. 
   The Cherokee Tribe was one of several tribes that owned slaves in the 19th century and fought on the side of the South in the Civil War. When the Civil War was concluded, treaties were signed, not just with the Confederacy.  There was a treaty. Treaties were signed with these Indian tribes that were independent in which they agreed to incorporate into the tribe from that day forward the former slaves, known as the Freedmen, and their descendants. 
   To my great disappointment, the Cherokee Tribe has decided that they don't want to continue that arrangement. I think it is a violation of their tribal obligations, their treaty obligations. The Bureau of Indian Affairs agreed. They're a fairly small number of people. The question is not what blood people have but this treaty obligation that the Cherokees undertook. 
   Our committee voted to exclude the Cherokees from the housing benefit as long as they are out of compliance here. Now, it's interesting, some defenders of the Cherokees have said, well, let's let it go to the courts. But I've read the Cherokee's brief on this subject. It's been in a court case, and they say to the court, stay out of this, it's up to Congress. Well, I agree with the brief, and that's an important part of this bill. And that's one reason why we have asked for the appointment of conferees, and the conferees are people who strongly believe it's a fairly small number of people to talk about, that the Cherokee Tribe should not be allowed to expel them. 
   Now, as to the energy piece, we very much agree with this. I think it's probably the case that we have more to learn from the Native Americans about energy use and conservation than they from us, and it is, therefore, entirely appropriate that we say that the funding that is available be available for them to use in this way. As I said, I don't think this is a group that we have to force this on, but I think it's a useful one. 
   Indeed, it's a principle that we think very important, and in fact, later this month, the Committee on Financial Services will be voting on a bill. The gentleman from Colorado is the prime author. The gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Hodes) has worked with the gentleman, Mr. Perlmutter, on it, and we very much agree with this principle, and indeed, we want to incorporate it in Federal housing policy in general. 
   Essentially our view is that where the Federal Government is funding housing in a fairly direct way, then we ought to require energy efficiency, and where the Federal Government is not funding it but helping enable it, we ought to encourage it. Of course, as we know, if you do energy efficiency into the building of the housing, you may have an increase in immediate cost and a long-term saving, not just in energy efficiency but in funding. 
   So I'm going to be yielding time to the gentleman from Colorado because we agree that this is a very useful, broad principle, and we agree with the approach of the gentleman from Illinois which is, since this instruction itself isn't controversial, we'll all use it to talk about other things that we want to talk about. That's perfectly reasonable. We have nothing else to do this morning. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, Special Orders, such as I am now entered into, are a time when Members can fairly freely say things without fear of contradiction because generally no one is here. And as you listen to many of the Special Orders, there is a very good reason why no one is here: No one ought to want to pay any attention to them. And we have a certain amount of tolerance when it comes to Special Orders, but sometimes the stupidity level, it seems to me, is exceeded. 
   In a Special Order yesterday, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King) said the following. He was denouncing the notion of financing public transportation from the gasoline tax. It does  seem to me that having public transportation available is one of the good ways to reduce the use of oil. High prices have driven more people to use public transportation, but that's a legitimate subject for debate. What is not a legitimate subject is to make things up. 
   The gentleman said yesterday, and I quote from the Record, ``And if you go to Barney Frank's district and you jump on--I don't know what they call it, the subway, the ``Big Dig,'' the major multibillion dollar boondoggle--and you buy a ticket to ride along on that thing, you get a cheap ticket because it's subsidized by H5321.'' Well, you can't buy a ticket to ride on the Big Dig, but if you could, it should be cheap because there's nothing to ride on. 
   In fact, quite contrary to what the gentleman from Iowa made up yesterday, the Big Dig is not a subway, the Big Dig is a highway. Now, it did cost a lot of money, but it was money that was spent on a highway. So when the gentleman says, ``I don't know what they call it, the subway, the Big Dig, the major multibillion dollar boondoggle''--and by the way, it's not in my district. But that is such a small error compared to the major errors the gentleman made that I mention it only in passing. But I am baffled by why the gentleman would get up and purport to talk about something in Massachusetts and so mis-describe it. 
   So let me be very clear: The Big Dig is a highway, it is not a subway. A subway is a mass transit conveyor that goes underground. A highway is something on which cars go. So you can't buy a ticket on the Big Dig, and it is not a subway. 
   He said further, by the way, that you get a cheap ticket because it's subsidized by H5321. I don't know what H5321 is. There is a bill, H.R. 5321, which has absolutely nothing to do with public transportation, but accuracy does not appear to have been the governing principle in that conversation. 
   I do note that the gentleman from Iowa singled out three districts to discuss: San Francisco, represented by the Speaker, New York City--and he imputed all New York City to the gentleman from New York, Mr. Rangel--and myself. Why we three districts were singled out--myself, San Francisco, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Rangel--I don't know what emotions the gentleman from Iowa was seeking to evoke by, out of all of the public transportation districts, picking the three of us. Again, that's something he is entitled to do, but he is really not entitled to call a highway a subway and denounce us for that. 
   So, as I said, I understand that when you are here under Special Orders, you can generally get away with a great deal because there is no one to point things out. And I actually felt sufficiently concerned about the accuracy of what's said in the House that I waited around for a while. And I learned many interesting things about NASA, more than I had planned to, but that was an educational experience. But I would hope that Members in the future, when they want to go and attack things, would put a little effort into trying to know what they are talking about. It might elevate the debate.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I thank the gentleman. 
   Madam Speaker, no, it is not a fully open rule. It is a far more open rule than any that the majority allowed in the previous Congress on major legislation from the Financial Services Committee. I tell you that as a fact. 
   First, the argument was made that people didn't have enough time to file amendments. This bill was voted out of committee on March 7. It is true that the actual report was delayed. It was delayed partly because staff on both sides held up the actual writing on the language, and we had a CBO scoring issue, and we were waiting for CBO. But the text of the bill was put forward publicly on March 7. 
   In fact, there are a number of amendments offered here; most of them are from members of the committee, some are from nonmembers of the committee. 
   So the notion that people didn't know until Friday what to put in the amendments on Monday is false. The fact is that this bill on March 7 was voted out of committee. In fact, the text of the bill was set on March 6. What we did on March 7 was come back and complete roll call. But as of noon on March 7, people knew what would be in this bill. It was not a secret that we were marking it up; it was not a secret that it would be coming up today. 
   So anybody who waited until Friday, who made the mistake, they have themselves to blame. In fact, we made a couple of accommodations. The gentleman from Georgia had an amendment which he filed which was misfiled, and his amendment as filed went to a section different than he wanted to affect.     
   Whether you realize that, we urged the Rules committee to allow him, after the deadline, to make an appropriate substitution. That was done so that his appropriate amendment is in order. To the extent that there was that technical glitch, we said, that's not right; let's allow the gentleman from Georgia's amendment to go forward, the one substantive to the bill. 
   The gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Baker) had an important amendment that was adopted in committee. CBO raised issues with it. We then asked the Rules Committee, after the deadline, to accommodate a change for Mr. Baker's amendment because we were accommodating the CBO scoring. So we did make two agreements after the deadline to accommodate these particular changes. 
   But I want to stress again, Members knew on March 7 what was going to be in this bill. So I don't know why anybody would have waited until Friday to do the amendments. It was a fairly public controversial process that we had. We had a number of rollcalls in the committee. 
   And I will say this: my view, I would have had a rule that was even more accommodating. But what this does is allow every amendment that the Parliamentarian's Office found to be germane to the bill and the substance of this program to be in order. There is some debate over one amendment from the gentleman from Georgia involving a kind of generic language about offsets. And that was not allowed. I would have voted to allow it; but it was not allowed. We considered it in committee. It was voted on, debated, defeated. 
   But every amendment that was offered and, again, the deadline for amendments was Monday. The bill had been voted out of committee on Wednesday, March 7. There was plenty of time for that bill to be looked at and for people to offer amendments. When I saw the amendments on Monday, I urged the Rules Committee to put in order everything that was germane. They have put in order a number of germane amendments with a lot of debate time. 
   Now, I understand that there are Members who would like it to have included a few more things. But every single one of them voted for rules far  more restrictive. So this bill, you know, I have always thought the question is, Is this a good rule? I have always thought the fount of all wisdom that we should be guided by was expounded by a philosopher named Henny Youngman, whom you, Madam Speaker, along with I certainly remember. And the wisdom was, asked, How is your wife, the answer was, Compared to what? And is this a good rule? Compared to what? Compared to every rule that affected the Committee on Financial Services during Republican leadership, it is a rule of great openness. Compared to an ideal of complete openness, not quite. 
   So it is a far better rule than any Republicans ever brought forward with regard to openness. It is not as good as I would like, but it does allow into debate every amendment germane to the substance of this bill, particularly to this bill, in terms of these programs, a number of amendments that change it one way or the other: some that would expand it, some that would retract it. And I believe the House will have a chance to work its will on this issue. 
   The only other thing I would say is this when we are talking about time: For people who haven't been remembering exactly, I do want to remind people, despite what you might think, it is not November of 2005. We are now here in March of 2007. I say that because people who saw the devastation of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in Mississippi and in Louisiana, to some extent in Texas, and who expected the Federal Government to respond, and looked at the things we are doing, which are called for by that dilemma that was created by the hurricanes, they would have assumed that their Federal Government would have done that within a couple of months after the hurricanes. 
   Unfortunately, about an 18-month freeze elapsed because the now-minority, then-majority, did not have the energy to deal with it. So we are doing a bill today that is 18 months overdue.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Yes, I do agree, but it was changed as of Friday, and so people could have looked at that on Friday and gotten it right. And I appreciate that. So, yeah, the section changed and as somebody even picked it up as of Friday, in the case of the gentleman from Louisiana, it was a different thing. We didn't get the CBO's scoring until too late, and then we had to work it out. The scoring came in. Part of the problem was CBO is very busy, and we passed the bill on March 7 and we didn't get their scoring until that Friday, and that was one of the reasons for the delay. 
   I thank the gentleman from the Rules Committee.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Well, first, the Parliamentarian ruled that the gentlewoman from Illinois' amendment which we debated in committee was not germane because it went far beyond the hurricane. So that was the reason for that. 
   The second thing is I want to concede one point to the gentleman. He has chided us because we have set ourselves too low a standard. We have set ourselves the standard of simply being better than they were last year. I acknowledge that is too low a bar. I think we have met it with ease, but I am inclined to do better. So I promise him, as far as I am concerned, I will try to have a higher standard.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, I rise to correct myself. 
   The gentleman from Georgia asked me to acknowledge that his amendment was originally misfiled because of a change in the section that occurred last Friday. I acknowledged that, but incorrectly. In fact, the change happened during the markup. The section was renumbered during the markup. And the gentleman, of course, being a member of the committee, could have done that. 
   I want to stress again no change was made in the text of that bill from March 7 until today; so anybody who wanted to offer amendments knew that on March 7. 
   Secondly, as to the gentlewoman from Illinois, as I said, I guess I am coming here, Madam Speaker, confessing all day. I mean, I confess that I have not reached as high enough a standard as I should in parliamentary terms because I have taken simply being better than the Republicans as my standard, and I pledge to do better. 
   Similarly, I guess I should be scolded for being lax on the rules. The gentlewoman from Illinois offered her amendment in committee. We did not raise a point of order against it in committee. Now, I do want to point out the parliamentarian for our committee is the parliamentarian that was the parliamentarian under my predecessor. That is one of the first things I did after the election was to call the parliamentarian, Mr. Duncan, a former member of the Parliamentarian's Office, who had been hired by my predecessor, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Oxley), and asked him to stay on. I believe it should be totally nonpartisan, and I believe it has been. It was the Parliamentarian's Office that told the Rules Committee that the gentlewoman from Illinois' amendment was not germane. 
   Now, I acknowledge my excessive tolerance. I have learned I am more tolerant of a lot of things than a lot of people here, and I accept that. I perhaps should have been more strict with regard to the committee. We had that debated, and the rule is generally that you do not take something that is narrowly applied and make it broader. There is language in this bill that applies to how vouchers are allocated where there was a hurricane. The gentlewoman wanted to change something that had been in the CR. She said it shouldn't have been in the CR. And I will say this: We will in our committee be revisiting that. We will have a voucher bill. That will come before our committee going forward. But I do want to make it clear in defense of the Rules Committee that where I allowed the amendment without getting a ruling on it, the Rules Committee, when they restricted the gentlewoman's amendment from being offered, were following the ruling of the parliamentarian that it was not germane. 
   I will yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time, I acknowledge that I did not raise a point of order. I acknowledge that I was very tolerant and did not make a point of order that apparently would have been sustained by the parliamentarian. But it was the parliamentarian who said that. 
   I am sorry the woman spent over an hour in the Rules Committee. Sometimes that is fun; sometimes it is not, but that is part of the job. But the fact is that the decision to exclude her particular amendment was made on the ruling of the parliamentarian that it was not germane.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I begin by yielding myself 1 minute, and then yield to the main author of this bill, the gentlewoman from California. 
   This is a bill which comes to this House about 18 months late. It is in response to the problems of the hurricane in the gulf. It is the result of very diligent work. 
   One week after the committee was organized, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters), who is the Chair of the Housing Subcommittee, and I began to work on this. We had a very long all-day hearing in Washington. 
   During the February break, the gentlewoman from California took her subcommittee to Louisiana and Mississippi and had very extensive hearings. As a result of these very extensive hearings and consultations, we have brought forward a bill of which she is the primary author, which we believe does as much as can be done to respond to the needs of the people in that area that have sadly been, in some ways, neglected since the hurricane. 
   I am very pleased to be able to yield to the gentlewoman from California, who is the moving spirit behind this bill, as much time as she consumes as we describe our very belated, but still very necessary efforts to respond to these human needs.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, first for 1 minute I would like to recognize myself to acknowledge the spirit in which this happened. I think this bill is a very good blend of partisanship and bipartisanship, and they are equally important. Partisanship, there has never been a democracy in the history of the world where you did not have political parties. People who are on trying to govern themselves cannot do that as a kind of a random mass. And there are general philosophical differences. The key is not to allow those legitimate differences of ideology and partisanship to poison the ability to work together. I think this bill shows that. 
   And I am very grateful to the gentlewoman from Illinois, the gentleman from Texas, the gentleman from Alabama. We worked together on this. There were some strong disagreements. We had a number of rollcall votes. Some of them were close; some of them weren't. We have managed to reproduce through the rule most of those, not all I acknowledge, but most of those substantive disagreements about this bill, they are in here in the rule to the extent that people wanted to redebate them. And that is important. 
   But I acknowledge the fact that while we had some differences, that did not prevent us from coming together on some commonality. There was never in this bill any effort to delay or divert. We managed to talk seriously. And, yes, there are differences between the parties. There is on our side, I believe, a greater willingness to provide some funding for some of these things. Those will be legitimately debated. 
   Mr. Chairman, let me now yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar), who is the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, who has been very helpful, because the lives of FEMA and HUD are deeply intertwined, and trying to legislate here requires treading this. And the gentleman from Minnesota is an example to others not to allow turf consciousness and jurisdictional hypersensitivity to get in the way of good  public policy. So I thank the gentleman. I yield him such time as he will consume.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds. 
   We agree on all the things the gentleman from Alabama said we should do. Nothing in this bill stops them from doing it. 
   All we say is this: please don't tear down the houses that people now live in before you replace them. We are not in any way opposed to that; but if you don't think the housing the people live in now is great, and neither do I, understand that they are only there because they can't get anything better, and that is the only point of difference. We are saying do not displace them before that nice, new stuff is ready. 
   And as for one-for-one, we aren't saying it has to be one-for-one right on-site. If you get a one-for-one replacement that is in mixed housing, that will be fine; but just don't displace people. 
   Mr. Chairman, I now yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. In my experience the gentlewoman, someone who is not on the committee and not from the district, has really made herself an expert and an advocate. I would say this: If as this goes forward there are delays in the legislative process, yes, of course, it would be sensible to deal with the deadlines. That is, we should think of the deadlines almost conceptually as based on a certain timeline of legislation. If the basic decisions by the government slip, then the deadline should be adjusted accordingly.

Well, I would say this, if the gentlewoman would yield to me: It is our hope, and the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Baker) was very active in this, and we listened to the others, the two gentlemen from Louisiana, Mr. Melancon and Mr. Jefferson, we believe we have responded to some of the issues. There was, for instance, a debate between FEMA. FEMA didn't like some aspects of the Road Home regarding whether or not you got a penalty for not staying in the State and whether or not elderly people were done. That was pulled. We have in this bill said to FEMA, please, leave that one alone. So we hope we have sped it up. No one I know of thinks that the rate of spendout of the Road Home has been sufficient to date. We hope this bill makes it better, but I don't have all the details.

In the committee we adopted an amendment offered by the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Baker) which went in the other direction and nullified one set of offsets when the gentleman from Louisiana mentioned that we had a scoring problem with CBO. There was an offset procedure for certain tax things, and frankly we felt that was not only somewhat unfair, but it was also one thing that held up the speed because we tried to offset that on the other hand.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Illinois is absolutely irrelevant to whether or not people ought to be occupying existing units. That is not what is involved here. 
   First of all, let me say the gentleman from Alabama and others said they have these plans to build these great new places. Who is stopping them? The hurricane was in September of 2005. It is now March of 2007. Have they started this? Have I stopped them? Have the tenants stopped them? Has the gentlewoman from California stopped them? Nobody has stopped them. 
   And the New Orleans Housing Authority, by the way, is HUD in drag. So nobody here has prevented them. 
   Here is what we are saying. What is amended is this: if you plan to tear down units that are now habitable, you cannot do that until you have met with the tenants, talked about this and replaced them. 
   This is an issue not about whether you live in the existing units. This isn't about rehabbing existing units. This is as to what is the obligation to replace the units. 
   The fact is that, according to HUD's own figures, more than half of the rental units in New Orleans were destroyed by the hurricane. People talk about job problems. That is because they have nowhere to live. 
   The gentlewoman's amendment would reduce by 2,000 the number of units they would be obligated to build before tearing down things that now exist. And you know, it is very nice. We have been doing this for years. We have promised the poor people all kinds of things, and those promises don't always materialize. 
   All we are saying is do whatever destruction you want after you have found places to live. And let me make it clear: we are talking about people who don't live here, who live in Texas and elsewhere and they want to come back. And it is not simply former residents of public housing. There were a lot of people who were displaced from New Orleans. We don't think we are in danger of running out of people who want to come back.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. That is simply not the case. Here is the problem with the gentleman's view. They have this view that you can only build new units for poor people after you have torn down what they had. No one has enjoined them from building new units, except the budget that the people on the other side have voted for. We have got to get this clear. Nobody has prevented, there have been no plans by HUD, also known as the Housing Authority of New Orleans, to build new units. Nobody has stopped them except, yes, people have said you can't tear down what we have as the pre-condition for building. But if HUD had wanted to go forward and build, no one would have prevented that. The wonderful housing that the gentleman from Alabama talked about, the mixed-use housing, what has stopped them from building it? I will tell what you has stopped them from building it, the budgets that have been voted for by my friends on the other side that didn't have any money for new housing construction.     
   I will tell you what we are going to do. We are going to pass the GSE bill that is going to have the housing affordability fund so they can build these things. 
   So we are simply saying do not destruct before you replace and do the poor people the favor of tearing down the bad housing they live in so they have nothing left at all.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I appreciate the kind remarks of the gentleman from Alabama. He is right, we accepted a number of amendments, and there is a great deal that joins us together. But there are some differences,  and I think in the spirit of democracy, we should debate these differences. 
   In the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) and this amendment as we debate it, there seems to be this view, as my friend from North Carolina said, that these are people who need to be jolted out of this welfare way of life. The gentleman from Texas wanted to subject these people to a 20-hour work requirement where no work needed to be done. 
   Here we are objecting to these people staying on section 8 because we want, as my other friend from Texas said, we are going to have some tough love. 
   Let's remember who we are talking about. These are people who were working overwhelmingly. They were working at lousy jobs for low pay. These were people who were doing work in the service industry. They were living in not great circumstances, and their homes and their jobs were washed away. They were driven out of their homes to strange places. Some of those places have been very welcoming, and I was pleased to see the Kennedy family give the mayor of Houston a Profile in Courage Award for the generosity that he has shown in welcoming people. But that is who we are talking about. 
   People had said, well, we want to improve the quality of their life. Do Members think, Mr. Chairman, that poor people are so dumb that they are voluntarily living in worse places than would otherwise be available to them? They are not living in great circumstances, but they are the best they can find and afford. When you displace them from what they have without providing them alternatives, you are likely to make them worse off. 
   Now, I understand there is a problem that some people might not fully deserve what they get, but overwhelmingly here is what we are talking about: people who had jobs and homes in New Orleans and maybe some other parts of Louisiana whose homes and jobs were washed away. And they are now living in emergency conditions provided by FEMA, and they haven't yet been able to fix it. 
   People ask, Why don't they go back to New Orleans? Well, we have a chicken-and-an-egg problem. We have a problem where there are no jobs because there is no place for the people to live. 
   In Mississippi along the gulf, the Oreck vacuum cleaner company opened up a plant after the hurricane and then closed it because they couldn't get workers because there wasn't housing. We are trying to build housing. 
   Vouchers in New Orleans is the problem. According to HUD's own figures, more than half of the rental housing units in New Orleans were destroyed by the storm. How do you expect these people to go back? 
   Now we have a bill that I am very proud of. The gentlewoman from California has worked very hard on this. We got organized on January 30. A week later we had our first hearing. A month later we had our markup. We are now on the floor. This has been a very high priority for us, to try to break this cycle of no job and no housing and no way to get back and no way to live and no decent life. And, yes, we are trying to build housing and we hope that the housing brings jobs. 
   Will there be some problems? Yes. But I have to say, if we are going to err, can we not err on the side of people who are poor in many cases to begin with and whose hard jobs, and in some cases meager homes were destroyed, and they were driven out of those homes by a force of nature and they are living in Texas and they are living in Atlanta, and they are being told tough love. We don't think the quality of your life is good enough. 
   We don't think you are trying hard enough. Is that what Members think? 
   These are among the toughest people around that they are still integrated and they are still with their families given what they have been through, the physical and emotional horrors of that hurricane and the lack of any action afterwards. Can we not resolve together to say to these people, look, we are going to work to try to help rebuild New Orleans. Until then, we will assure you can live in these places. 
   These vouchers people will get are what we call disappearing vouchers. They are not permanent additions to the voucher stock. They are for the people who were displaced from New Orleans, and as the gentleman from Texas pointed out, as long as they are economically eligible. 
   I don't think they all want to stay there and live in these temporary quarters. As they do find alternative ways to live, the voucher will disappear. So that is what we are talking about: thousands of our fellow human beings who were subjected to physical terrors and emotional troubles far greater than most of us, fortunately for us, will ever have to go through. Their homes and their jobs were destroyed. Their children were uprooted from schools. They were driven away from where they used to live. And they have then been put under the tender mercies of FEMA. And as my friend from Texas said, every so often they were told, you know what, there hasn't been enough trauma in your life, the flood, the deaths, all that, that's not enough. Now we are going to threaten you with eviction. Now you won't know where you're going to live. 
   What we are saying is let's say to these remaining people, while we are trying to rebuild New Orleans, we give you assurance that you will be able to live in the circumstances in which you are now living as long as you meet the guidelines. I don't understand the opposition to that. I don't understand why that brings Members to say tough love, we are going to improve the quality of their life. 
   Let's let these people at least have what they now have: a home that was something they were able to put together after that great trauma. And the alternative is people say they shouldn't worry, the President will extend it. 
   What do you say to your 8-year-old and 12-year-old when they ask: Where am I going to school next year? Oh, don't worry, the President will extend it. 
   Frankly, there are a lot of people here who wouldn't feel a great comfort in that, let alone an 8-year-old. 
   We are dealing with totally innocent people, hardworking people whose lives were already tough, were destroyed by a hurricane and they were forced physically out of their homes. We are saying instead of them continuing to live under the fear that they may be evicted, that they may have no further support in terms of their basic living, that we as a compassionate Nation will continue to make sure that they at least have a place to live while everything else goes forward. I hope the House will accept the gentleman's amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the Rules Committee's complying with our preference for this rule, which allows any amendments to be offered that are germane. 
   And I just want to touch a little bit on a discussion we had in the Rules Committee yesterday about whether or not it makes any sense to have an open rule. There were a couple Members, one in particular, who said, This is no big deal because, after all, this bill passed last year overwhelmingly and it could have been done on suspension. And the argument that it is an equivalent to pass a bill on a suspension and to give it an open rule if it is likely to pass by an overwhelming majority is deeply flawed and misunderstands the legislative process, and I want to make sure that people have addressed this. 
   The important question on a bill may not be ``yes'' or ``no.'' There is a large number of bills that are going to pass. There are bills that are going to pass because politically they are perceived as impossible to oppose. There are bills  that achieve a purpose that everyone is for. In many cases, and it would appear to be the case with this bill, the important question is not whether or not it passes but in what form. That is, the amending process has a relevance and an importance, whether or not the bill is ultimately going to pass. And when you rely, as it was suggested yesterday that we should, on a suspension, as long as we know the bill is going to pass because, as Members understand, a suspension does not allow for the amendment process, then you are constricting the ability of Members to legislate sensibly. 
   The question is not just ``yes'' or ``no.'' That, as I said, is a denigration of the legislative process. And having an open rule, as opposed to a suspension, means a number of amendments are offered. I am opposing many of the amendments, as are my colleagues on the other side. I am not opposing all of the amendments. Even where an amendment is defeated, remember, our purpose is not simply to stamp out an end result. It is to participate in the democratic process of discussion and debate. The process is diminished when a bill that is important is given only 40 minutes with no amendments because it is noncontroversial. We will talk for more than 40 minutes today. We will have some amendments. 
   So I hope this will stand, this process today, as a repudiation of the notion that it is an equivalent to pass a bill under suspension of the rules, with no amendments and only 40 minutes of debate, and to go through this process of an open rule. Even though I expect this bill to pass overwhelmingly, as it passed last year, this House, this country, this democratic process benefit. And, of course, it is just one bill. 
   As a general rule, I would hope that we would not use the suspension process for bills that are complex where Members might have some difference of view not as to whether or not the bill should pass, but in what form it should pass. This process today, I think, will show the superiority of the choice we are making under the current leadership of the Congress to go ahead with a more open debate than last year when the question was simply can we get the votes to pass, and if so, let's shut down the debate and shut down the amendment process. That is ill-served democracy. Today is a much better way, and I thank the Rules Committee for it.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I want to make clear the flaws in the reasoning we have just heard. 
   Equating a suspension of the rules procedure which allows only 40 minutes of debate and no amendments with an open rule simply because the final bill will get a large vote misunderstands, indeed, denigrates the democratic process. 
   The gentleman says this belongs on the suspension calendar. There are amendments offered, some I will support and will improve the bill; others that will not. But for one thing, why only 20 minutes of debate on each side on an important issue. When the gentleman says noncontroversial bills belong on the suspension calendar, he undervalues the process of debate and amendment. Very often the questions are not whether the bill will pass ultimately or not, but in what form. And let us be very clear, the suspension calendar eliminates amendments. 
   To say because a bill can ultimately pass with a large majority Members should not be given a chance on the floor to alter it or amend it seems to me to denigrate the process.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I am reclaiming my time because the gentleman is evading the point he made. He is the one who said this should be suspension. He is the one who said suspension is where, if it is going to pass by a lot in the end, you don't need an open rule you can have suspension. He said we should put these noncontroversial bills back on the suspension calendar. 
   There are two separate sets of bills. There are bills that are going to be controversial in the end that you have to debate, and there are also bills that are controversial in part. 
   As far as the committee I chair is concerned, unlike the practice under the gentleman's chairmanship of the Rules Committee, we will be bringing out the bills from our committee that are controversial in all aspects open to amendment if I have anything to say about it, and I will fight for that. But that doesn't mean that you go for suspension and no amendments.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Last year the Bush administration made a grave error. A proposal came from the country of Dubai to buy a company that ran our ports. The response from the administration, and there was an intergovernmental committee called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. which Members will hear us abbreviating as CFIUS, should have said to Dubai, you know, we have found you to be a reasonable group of people, but you are in an area of the world where there is great tension, where there are violent, armed people who wish us ill. You will be subjected to great pressures. There will be efforts to infiltrate and there will be assaults on your integrity, and that makes us nervous about your controlling something as sensitive to security as ports. We have been worrying about the possibility of the shipping ports being entry ports for harmful activity. 
   So the people of Dubai should have been told, look, we mean you no ill, but we think it is a mistake for you to buy these ports. There are, I would have thought, many other investments I think they could have made. 
   Instead, incredibly, a series of people from the White House's various offices, from the Departments, did not see this coming; and in consequence, they gave an approval which led to an entirely predictable outcry in the country. 
   Our job, Mr. Chairman, is to prevent this great lapse in judgment by the Bush administration over the Dubai situation from leading to bad public policy that would extend to restricting and discouraging foreign direct investment in general. 
   Members should be very clear when we talk about foreign direct investment. All three words are important. We are not talking about buying equities and we are not talking about foreign countries holding our debt, which can be problematic. We are talking about foreign investors, mostly, in some cases government, but mostly private investors, taking money and investing it in real economic activity in the U.S. That is what direct investment means. 
   And that inevitably, not inevitably, that, in fact, will produce more economic activity here. It is very much in our interest as a Nation to have people investing in real economic activity. That creates jobs and that creates taxation for local governments and that creates the kind of economic activity that we thrive on. 
   The fear again was that others in other parts of the world, seeing the reaction to Dubai would say, you know what, we better not invest there. 
   One of the great assets America has economically is we are about as stable a place as there is in the world to invest your money. This is a problem. It is a problem for Russia. Russia is suffering I believe legitimately because of concern from people that if they invest in Russia their investments will not be as fully protected as they should be. The security legally and in every other way of money invested in the U.S. in direct ways is an asset for us. We do not want the political fallout from the Dubai mistake to discourage this. 
   What we then decided to do together, and while there was an earlier reference to this being a Republican bill, which I regret because this has been a genuinely bipartisan bill and that sort of partisanship doesn't help, the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Maloney) who was then the ranking member on the relevant committee; the gentlewoman from Ohio, who is with us now who was Chair of that subcommittee; the minority whip, then the majority whip; myself; the former chairman of the committee, Mr. Oxley of Ohio, we all worked together to say, look, let us give a set of rules and procedures so that people with money in other countries who want to invest it in the U.S. in ways that will be beneficial to us can get some assurance that they can make that investment and not be buffeted politically. 
   People say, Look what happened to Dubai. First they got approval, and then it was withdrawn. We want to have a good process so that people can invest with assurance. People who are investing money need stability and certainty. 
   They also need a certain amount of privacy before the fact. One of the things that we jointly did was to reject efforts to expose potential investments to wide publicity and the political process at too early a stage. There is no point in scaring these things off. 
   Now it should be noted that entirely independent of this bill authority exists in the President of the United States, delegated as he chooses, to reject investments that would jeopardize our national security. There are also separate statutes that limit investment in particular parts of the economy. Some of those, I think, go too far. None of those are altered. In other words, this bill does not weaken any existing statutory protection against investment that might undermine our security.     
   What it says is that the great bulk of investments not only do not undermine our security, but add to our prosperity by providing more resources here within the country for good, beneficial, economic activity. We will have a process which gives you some assurance that you can go ahead with that investment. That is what this bill does. 
   There are some questions about it. There will be some amendments, but that is the core of the bill. It is in the interest of our economy. It protects national security even more than currently because it does have some procedures to require a kind of inspection that would have prevented, we believe, the Dubai mistake. 
   I should say that this bill is widely supported. We have worked closely with the administration. The Treasury has been very helpful, and they do not like everything in this bill, but on the other hand, I do not like everything in the Treasury. In fact, if you look at the great bulk of it, we are together on this, and this is a bill which the Treasury, I am pleased to say, and you can see in the statement of administration policy, regards this as an advance. They would like some changes, but they clearly regard this bill as an advance. A broad swath of the business community is in favor of it, and all should be in favor of it. 
   While there are controversial aspects of international policy, this is one that should not be controversial. This is one which welcomes foreign investors who want to take money and engage in real, beneficial, safe economic activity in the United States. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute just to say, before I yield back, that there has been a debate about whether or not an open rule was controversial or not. I know in today's Wall Street Journal, there is an editorial grudgingly giving us some credit for moving on this. Essentially they are surprised that, given that we are Congress, we didn't do a lot worse. 
   But I will note that in the Wall Street Journal editorial this morning, there are two negative references to an open rule. It is clear from this that they are among those that did not want an open rule because they said they were afraid that protectionists in the House would ruin the bill. 
   So I do, again, want to note the idea that the open rule was somehow something of no particular consequence. This contradicted the Wall Street Journal in its editorial today, and I urge Members to read it. I am not going to put the whole thing in the Record because it takes some shots at some Members that I think are unfair. But I urge Members who think that this was some sort of a slam dunk to read the Wall Street Journal.  
   I am submitting the following jurisdictional correspondence on H.R. 566:

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, this is a compendium of amendments that came from some of our sister and fellow committees. The Chair and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, the gentleman from Missouri, the gentleman from California, collaborated on some language. They, for instance, have noted that when we say periodic reports, that means not less than every 6 months. It also clarifies that CFIUS will report to any committee having jurisdiction over any aspect of the transaction, not just the named committees. And at the insistence of the gentleman from Missouri, which we agreed with, it says that if there are risk analysis performed by mitigation agreement, they will be performed by CFIUS. 
   The gentleman from Michigan, the Chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, correctly pointed out that the bill had stricken a report from the Inspector General during our markup. He believed, and his committee believed this is important to reinsert, we agree, and it is reinserted. The gentleman from California, the chairman of the IR Foreign Affairs Committee, moved that we make the one-time report on how people deal with the Israel boycott an annual report, and that has been done. So these are seven amendments that we have incorporated, all of them recommended by three other committees of jurisdiction. They are supported on both sides. We believe they enhance the bill. And I hope they are adopted en banc as one amendment.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  
   Mr. Chairman, sometimes people get up in the legislative body and say, Mr. Chairman, I am opposed to this amendment because it is unnecessary. 
   It has been my experience that no one who says that is ever telling the truth. That is, no one opposes an amendment simply because it is unnecessary or superfluous or redundant. 
   Many us are lawyers. We are in the most redundancy-prone profession in the world. We rarely use one word where we can use two, lewd and lascivious, although I do not suggest that this amendment is either. 
   I say that because I do not think this amendment is necessary. I don't think it adds a great deal, and I support it. That is, it does not detract. 
   The reason I say that is I do not think that an administration that was cognizant of these elements would have excluded them. The only reason I rise to say that is this, and I hope we will adopt the amendment, but I wouldn't want us to set a precedent that if a factor was not specifically enumerated, it was not to be taken into account. 
   This enumerates factors that clearly should be taken into account, and I will therefore be supportive. I just want to make clear there is a Latin maxim, and my English does not always translate well over this microphone, so I won't try Latin, but it is when you specify one, you exclude the others. I just want to make clear that this is not a precedent for that. 
   The fact that we are specifically here singling these out, I am sure the gentleman from Iowa agrees, does not, in any way, denigrate the importance of other factors not mentioned.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. And I think what the gentleman from Georgia has offered is very constructive. He called this to my attention. I have discussed this with the ranking member. I certainly believe it improves the bill. He pointed out an instance where he as a Member in whose district an important transaction took place had taken initiative and come up with some information that was directly relevant that should have been shared. I regard Members as useful input sources here. 
   Now, again, let's understand. The way this is drafted and the gentleman agreed to offer it, no one can say that this is the kind of amendment that might jeopardize the investment. Nothing in here would in any way lead to an investment not going forward. This is postapproval. If there is disapproval, then the issue doesn't arise. 
   What this does is, and we have all agreed that it is important to be able to monitor these arrangements, it lets the Member of Congress in whose district a transaction took place join in the monitoring. 
   Frankly, I guess as the chairman of the committee, I get a lot of these reports. I want to tell the Members that the extent to which I am personally going to travel around to these areas and monitor this, I hope no one is relying heavily on that. 
   On the other hand, knowing that the Members in whose districts these are happening are available and then come and talk to me, talk to the ranking member and talk to others, I think that improves what we had in there. So I hope the amendment is adopted.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment and its siblings which are apparently to follow. 
   I gather, I guess, an open rule, we have had so few of them, people can't resist the temptation to take advantage of them, even on matters that are not relevant to the bill. 
   Now, there is a different between relevance and germaneness. You can make a bill germane with a certain amount of ingenuity, or an amendment. But ingenuity does not affect logic. It only affects parliamentary rules. 
   This is a requirement that the administration do a report about taxation as it affects business. It says, to be germane to this bill, that it should see how it affects the foreign businesses. But, in fact, no one thinks that foreign direct investment or foreign-owned businesses are differentially affected than others. This is a call for an annual report on the effective taxation on business. 
   Apparently the gentleman may think that the Council of Economic Advisors annual report doesn't do a very good job. It is the kind of subject that they are supposed to be talking about. It is an effort, I think, to introduce an ideological debate, which is an entirely legitimate one, into a bill that it really does not pertain to. 
   I can say we have worked closely with the administration. The Treasury, on behalf of the administration, is not supporting this. They have, in fact, been saying, please keep this to national security. 
   Now, national security, in the CFIUS context, is meant to be clearly defined. It is possible, of course, to say that everything is national security. Health is a matter of national security. Farm policy, agricultural policy is a matter of national security. But if you try to do everything, you often wind up not doing anything very well. 
   This is a narrowly targeted bill to talk about the extent to which foreign direct investment does or doesn't affect national security in a very specific definition of national security. 
   This amendment, and the following amendments, say, let's require the administration to do general reports on the effect of regulation, taxation, and something else, I don't remember what it was, on the economy. And it sort of bootstraps it into here. 
   It is not useful. It is a diversion. If Members think such a report ought to be done, then there are other fora in which to do it. To burden the CFIUS process with this would be a mistake, and I, therefore, hope that the amendment is defeated.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I would just say to the gentleman from Texas, yes, everything is connected to everything. Everything that rises must converge. But that does not mean that you don't try to deal with it before it has risen and converged. 
   The fact is that if you define everything as national security, you really can't do the piece by piece that you want to. And an inability to make those distinctions gets in the way of good public policy. This grew out the Dubai Ports situation. It grew out of a fear that things that were generally good for us economically might have an element that compromised national security narrowly defined, that they  might lead to physical or other kind of problems, espionage, terrorism. And it is an effort to try and harmonize those. It doesn't mean that taxation and health care and a whole range of other things, elementary and secondary education, aren't ultimately related to national security. It does mean that trying to use this specific bill, in which we try to make sure that what is our national economic interest doesn't impinge on national security, but trying to load everything into that gets in the way of the committee that is charged with it, which is why the Treasury doesn't support it, among others.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   The gentleman said he is unable to differentiate. I agree. He asked why don't I want this information. Mr. Chairman, I want lunch too, but I am  not asking CFIUS to bring it to me. The question is not what I want. An intelligent, mature adult has a whole set of wants but differentiates, to use a word with which the gentleman said he had difficulty, in where and how you get them. 
   Yes, it is important to know what the effect of taxation is on the economy, and the Ways and Means Committee should be doing a lot of work on that. It is important to know about regulation. And our committee deals with regulation. Energy and Commerce deals with regulation. Other committees deal with regulation. The point is not that these things are not at some point useful, but whether a specific governmental entity, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which is being created for a very specific purpose, ought to be given the burden of doing all that. 
   We have a Council of Economic Advisers. It is charged with many of these duties. We have the Federal Reserve system. They, under the Humphrey-Hawkins bill, make a monetary report twice a year. It is not that you don't have the information. 
   Here is, again, the situation. As a result of the Dubai Ports, there was a fear that that reaction would discourage people, foreigners, from investing in the U.S. This has a very specific purpose: to create a system in which people can be reassured that foreign direct investment has no negative effect on national security. In the sense that the gentleman is talking about that, that is not relevant to this bill. No one thinks foreign direct investment unfairly affects the tax system or the regulatory system. The concern is that we might have foreign direct investment that would put foreigners not loyal to this country, perhaps even inimical to this country, in positions where they could do us damage, through espionage, through sabotage, through the planting of bombs. That is what this bill is about. 
   The gentleman said, Isn't taxation important? Of course it is. Climate change is important. Should they report on climate change? Nutrition is important. Education in the sciences is important. There are a whole lot of important issues. Burdening this particular intergovernmental committee, which has a very specific focus, with all of these other problems doesn't make any sense. That is why, as I said, it is not supported by administration. It is opposed by the business community. The business community would share many of the gentleman's views, many of them, on the specifics of taxation and regulation, but they don't want to dilute the mission of this very specific committee. 
   Now, in this particular bill, frankly, even in its own terms I have trouble understanding what the gentleman is getting at. He says we ``shall include a detailed discussion of factors ..... including trend information on the number of jobs'' that affect the filing. Now, unemployment, it is hard for me to understand how that affects the filing. Does the gentleman mean that if unemployment goes too low, foreign investors won't come to America because wage rates may go up? I mean, this is an important datum to have. We have this problem. We have annual reports, monthly reports on jobs. 
   The point we are making is that you should not, for whatever purpose, ideological or whatever else, inject this into this very specific, very important function. We want these people to thoroughly vet whether or not there is a purchase by foreign investors in America that could lead to national security issues in the narrow definition. That doesn't mean that there are not broader factors, such as, as I said, education and the environment and agricultural production, that affect national security. But this is not a bill on national security in general. It is a bill to say that we want very careful vetting of foreign direct investment to make sure that that in itself doesn't do negative things to national security. 
   There is broad agreement within the administration, within the business community, within our committee that that is an important function. The gentleman has broader purposes. I wish the jurisdiction of the committee encompassed that. We don't have jurisdiction over taxation.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I would say this. He is now focused on the issue. This is not about a bill about national security in general, and it is not a bill about anything that might discourage foreign investment. That is precisely the point. We want to focus on the extent to which the fear of the Dubai situation would discourage foreign investment. 
   There are other issues that might affect foreign investment. Currency. The gentleman didn't mention currency exchange rates. There are a whole number of things, environmental policies and other things, that might affect foreign investment. The gentleman has stated this is not a bill about whatever might affect foreign investment. We wouldn't have the jurisdiction and nobody in the administration wants to do that particularly. They want to focus specifically on national security. And what the gentleman would do would be to the move the focus on sabotage, espionage, terrorism, those very specific issues that call that forward.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. There is room for honest disagreement, but to suggest that I in any way said jobs aren't important is simply silly. Of course jobs are important. A lot of things are important. The war in Iraq is important. Global warming is important. They don't all go in the same bill. The gentleman's inability to distinguish between what is important and what you try to accomplish in a specific piece of legislation is disappointing, although it does not quite reach the level of a threat to national security.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, this is fourth effort by the minority to get exactly the same thing voted on. Apparently, this strategy has become if at first you don't succeed, try, try, again and again and again. 
   I am disappointed at the poverty of their ability to obstruct. Now, here is where we are. We have a bill that is strongly supported by the administration and by the business community, their erstwhile allies. 
   We were asked by some on the Republican side and in the business community to get a closed rule, because they were afraid of irresponsible and silly amendments. 
   I rejected that request, and now I see, frankly, some people who asked me to support a closed rule voting for the amendments that came forward because we had an open rule. Apparently the motto of some of my Republican colleagues, when it comes to rules is, stop me before I obstruct again. 
   I don't intend to do that. I don't intend to protect you from your own worst impulses. After all, no one has protected me from mine. 
   We have a bill which says we do not want foreign investment which is good for this country, which is job producing and economically stimulative prevented by fears that unnecessary security interests will be raised. So we set up a policy, we set up a committee to vet proposals for foreign investment to make sure that there is no threat to national security and its very specific definition of terrorism, of espionage, of a transfer of information that might hurt us. This is to undo the damage that might have come from Dubai. 
   Apparently, the minority is dissatisfied because we are not somehow conforming to this stereotype of us. We have brought forward a responsible and balanced bill. We worked with Treasury. We worked with the business community. 
   They have decided now to expand the scope. What they have asked for, frankly, here, is a report from the committee that is charged with dealing with this very specific set of issues. Does a particular foreign direct investment impinge on national security? 
   They want to burden that committee over the objection of the Treasury Department, which does not like this recommit and did not like the amendment before that, the amendment before that, which all said the same thing. 
   They are trying to dilute the work of the committee by doing what? By asking for a report, for example, on hedge funds. Look at page 2. Let's have a report on the stability of the financial markets. 
   So instead of focusing their energies on whether or not a particular investment is a national security threat, this committee is supposed to give us a report on hedge funds and on derivatives, the stability of the financial markets. They are supposed to talk about nondiscriminatory treatment of entrepreneurs and the deleterious effect of burdensome regulation. 
   Of course, that is the right-wing premise that regulation is necessarily burdensome. There might, of course, be a conflict if you are going to talk about the deleterious effect of burdensome legislation, that might be in conflict with your ability to promote the stability to promote financial markets. 
   They don't belong in this bill. It is an effort to bring in right-wing ideological precepts into a bill that plays an important role. Now, I guess I regret their frustration that we haven't given them a better target to shoot at. But this proposal to take the Committee on Foreign Investments in the U.S. and turn it into the Federal Reserve Board and the Council of Economic Advisers, and God knows what else, will detract from the mission of that committee, make it harder for them to focus on national security, and serves no other purpose. 
   I would ask the Members for the fourth time to vote against the same issue. I would say to my Republican friends, I know you are not going to be worried about our time, I know you are not going to be worried about civility and comity, but could you take boredom into account. 
   The next time you are being obstructive, could you be a little creative, could you think of at least a couple of variations and could you not ask for the same vote four times. I have Members asleep over here because they are so bored for what you are doing. 
   I ask Members to rally themselves for one more ``no'' vote for the fourth time. I don't think there is any other means by which you can do it again, and let's then pass this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. (TRIBUTE TO THE LATE CONGRESSWOMAN JULIA CARSON -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I thank my friend from Ohio and the other friends who have gathered to, really, mourn our own loss. 
   I served on the Financial Services Committee with JULIA CARSON. And let's be honest, there are Members of this body who, if you get to see them coming before they see you, you may not have a long conversation. But I sought JULIA's company. She was a dedicated fighter for social justice, but she was also a delightful woman. 
   She had that kind of air she put on of, ``Oh, poor me.'' I feel sorry for anybody who fell for it. She had a brilliant mind, a wonderful sense of strategy, and, as I said, she put all that at the service of caring for poor people. As a member of the Financial Services Committee, she was a constant unyielding advocate for fairness in our society. 
   And I do also want to note, a number of people have mentioned my former colleague, many of us served with him, Andy Jacobs. Andy was the Congressman from that district. He retired. And rarely has any politician fought as hard for another politician as Andy Jacobs did to elect JULIA CARSON. And to the minds of many, JULIA wasn't a natural fit. People thought that she was not conservative enough for the district, not, let's be honest, white enough for the district. And race continues to be the besetting problem of America. We have made some progress in it. We haven't solved it. 
   Andy Jacobs' dedication to helping to elect JULIA, and, obviously, she got there on her own, But Andy's helping run interference as JULIA carried that ball really was one of the great acts of statesmanship, and then JULIA made the most of the opportunity. 
   I had the pleasure of going out to her district a couple of times because there was this sense on the part of some that a woman like JULIA CARSON, with her background and her set of values, couldn't possibly represent Indianapolis. Somehow they thought that something had gone wrong. But the people knew better, and the people stood by her. And they stood by her because she was, as I said, as staunch a fighter for making this the kind of America we all want to live in as I ever saw. 
   I miss her a great deal. I miss coming into the committee and seeing her pretending to look kind or angry and sad, with a twinkle in her eye ready for that comment that was going to put everything in perspective. JULIA CARSON was a wonderful Member of this body. And the dignity with which she bore her last months of pain troubled all of us, but it was a fitting example of the extraordinary quality of a great woman. 
   I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio and others for giving us this chance to express our appreciation for having had the benefit of her colleagueship for a while.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. (EXPLAINING VOTE ON CHRISTMAS RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, there are times when it is important for people to admit when they have made mistakes, and I made one. I voted last week ``present'' on a resolution that it was Christmas. Now, when I read the resolution, I decided to vote ``present'' because it made some controversial statements about the constitutional history of the United States and the role of Christianity in that. 
   I am not a historian. I don't know whether that was an accurate statement or not, and I didn't want to vote on it one way or the other. It also made a number of statements about Christian theology, about which I am even less expert, being Jewish and not being an expert in other religions. So I voted ``present.'' 
   But it was then called to my attention that earlier this year I had voted for a resolution congratulating people for observing Ramadan, so I was in the awkward position of having voted in favor of celebrating Ramadan and having abstained on Christmas, and the mistake was I should have abstained on Ramadan as well. 
   The point is, and this reinforces it to me, it is really none of the business of the Congress of the United States as an official body whether or not people celebrate religious holidays. Our job is to preserve a free society in which people are able to celebrate their religious holidays if they wish to. But picking and choosing among religious holidays, seems to me, is odd. 
   By the way, when you announce you have the power to approve a holiday, I assume that means ordinarily you have the power to disapprove it. Does that mean that we could have said we don't approve of Ramadan or we don't approve of Christmas? Again, these are examples of the intrusiveness. 
   As I said, I find myself in an odd position, where people said, Are you pro-Ramadan and anti-Christmas? Frankly, I observe neither holiday. I wish well those who do, but as an individual, not as a Member of Congress. In fact, I have had obviously, living in this society, much more association with Christmas. But, again, that's as an individual. 
   That was driven home to me when I see a debate, particularly on the Republican side, between candidates as to the nature of the religion of my former Governor. This whole tendency further to entangle religion and politics is harmful to both, in my judgment. So I will acknowledge, and I understood when the Ramadan resolution came forward, in fact it was brought forward, let's be honest, for a broadly political reason. People thought that having us celebrate Ramadan might in some way alleviate an anti-American feeling that has grown out of the Iraq war. That is not what you talk about religion for. 
   So I should have voted ``present'' on both, not out of any disrespect for either religion, but out of respect for a system of democratic governance in which we politicians don't decide what is or isn't good religion. I would hope that that would no longer be part of the Republican Presidential debate. I don't believe Mormon theology has any point there. I will say this: I am no great fan of Governor Romney, nor he of me, but he served for 4 years as Governor of Massachusetts, and I don't remember a day when his religion was relevant. 
   Deciding that will alleviate any anti-American feelings on Ramadan, and then, okay, we will get back and show you that we are going to talk about Christmas. And we're going to talk about the constitutional history of the United States in these terms, and then let's have a debate about religion. It is not negative about religion to say that religion is best served when politicians do not seek to use it, intrude into it. Our job, again, is to preserve a Nation of freedom in which people can practice religion as they wish. No one ought to be looking for my approval as to this or that religious holiday. 
   So I will announce in the future I will not applaud people for Ramadan or for Christmas or for Yom Kippur or for any of the other holidays. I will work very hard to make sure every American and everyone in this country can observe those religious freedoms. But entangling us into religion for political purposes is simply a great mistake and serves no good. 
   Therefore, I do apologize. I erred when I voted for the Ramadan resolution. I should have voted ``present'' on Ramadan. I should have voted ``present'' on Christmas. But, even better, we should simply abstain from bringing into this very political body  of elected people issues about this or that religious holiday. Let's leave religious holidays in peace.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. (SUDAN ACCOUNTABILITY AND DIVESTMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to join in thanking the people that have been thanked, particularly members of the staff, Mr. Tsentas, Mr. McGlinchey and Mr. Segel, because this took a great deal of work. This was one of those issues where there was a great deal of agreement in principle, but where a lot of work had to be done to translate that principle here in the House. And it was a case where the House took the lead, the Senate then acted, and some negotiation took place. 
   There was some resistance, I am sad to say, from the administration. The State Department was busy getting Senators to hold us up for a while. But a good deal of good lobbying took place on a bipartisan basis. And many Republicans in the Senate resisted this effort to hold it up, and as a result we have a bill that does what it should do. And I want to be clear what that is. 
   We are not here compelling anyone to divest. We ran into a situation in which a large number of Americans, revolted by the massive violation of basic human principle that has gone on in Sudan, engaged in by the Government of Sudan, sadly, protected in some ways by the Government of the People's Republic of China, too little resisted by other African nations, too little resisted, in particular, by some in the Arab world who, sadly, it seemed to me, allowed ethnicity to influence them, and for a variety of reasons there has not been the mobilization of international protection for these innocent victims of genocide that there should have been. 
   What we have is a situation where a number of Americans said, I cannot in any way be part of this. And they approached those entities who invest money on their behalf. As we know, much of the investment that goes on in this country is done not by individuals directing their own investments, but through third parties, mutual funds, pension funds, other entities. And they were told, those who wanted to divest, Oh, we can't do that. We can't honor your moral conviction because we have an obligation to make as much money for you as possible. And indeed, there were invocations of potential lawsuits if, in fact, a mutual fund or pension fund were to say, Look, we're not going to divest in this way or stay an investment fund. We didn't think that those were real threats, but we figured we had to act. 
   So, what this bill does is not to compel anybody to do anything. It empowers individuals who want to withdraw their funding from this genocide. It empowers entities that want to withdraw funding to do so without fear of lawsuit. And I think it is a solution that looks at how the marketplace works and uses that set of institutions and the law in a reasonable way. 
   I cannot understand why we ran into the resistance that we did. And I don't think bureaucracy is a bad thing. Bureaucracy is an essential part of civilized governance. But bureaucracy in the bad sense, bureaucratic resistance in the bad sense, slowed this bill up. People have said, It's too late. I agree. It should have happened a long time ago. It certainly should have happened earlier this year. There was resistance that shouldn't have come from the State Department. There was some concern by the Treasury. They were excessive. 
   I am very proud that both Houses have now overwhelmingly said, No, enough is enough. We're going to go forward. And we wish we could do more to stop this mass murder, but we can at least allow Americans to withdraw from any participation. And we hope that the cumulative effect of this and elsewhere would be to force a withdrawal. 
   And there is one very important point. We have sometimes, when the United States Government expressed its revulsion at violations of human rights, people have tried to say, Well, that's just the government. That's not the people. This empowers the American people. When there are withdrawals as a result of this, it will be coming from State and local governments and individual citizens. So no one will be able to deny the concentrated force of this, and we hope that adds to its moral impact. 
   So, I do intend to ask for a recorded vote on this because I hope we will have an overwhelming demonstration, once again, virtual unanimity, if not complete unanimity, that will send a message that will help get the bill signed. And particularly to the Government of Sudan and to those governments, and that includes some in the Arab world, it includes the People's Republic of China, they will understand the extent to which, across party lines, across ideological lines, they have instilled in the American people the feeling of revulsion. And they should understand our determination to do whatever we can to put an end to this terrible set of events. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I appreciate the indulgence of my colleagues. 
   I am glad that we will finally be acting on this. I share the frustration of my friend from New York and, indeed, all of my friends from New York and elsewhere, Connecticut, who wanted a more comprehensive bill. There is a consolation. I think 1 year or so ago there were people who thought even a 7-year extension was much too much and were talking about phasing this out. I am glad that we are moving forward. I want to address those who say, well, this was supposed to be a temporary program until the market could take over. I never believed that. I always wanted this to be a government program. 
   I am a believer in the market; I believe almost all of us are. I understand how the market principle works in insurance. If you have a greater risk, you pay more; your premiums go up. We do that because we want to discourage people from taking certain risks, or at least make them pay the full cost. We also want to give them an incentive to diminish the risk. Those principles don't apply to terrorism. 
   I don't want a situation to exist whereby, if you build a large building, because that is essentially what we are talking about here; people can't build large buildings without bank loans, and they can't get bank loans without insurance. I don't want the cost to go up in any particular part of this country because murderous, vicious thugs want to do this country ill. 
   I don't believe that those who have been the victims of these kinds of terrorism ought to bear that cost. That is  national defense. No more should any one State have to pay to protect itself against an invasion. We should have a national defense system that includes saying, we will hold you harmless against these murderous attacks. And it is, of course, because there is very little you can do to protect yourself against this. What do they do, put anti-aircraft guns on the roof? This is not a case where the market is failing. It is a case where national purpose is what is relevant, not the market. 
   Now, the other point to make is that I do regret the breakdown in the United States Senate of the legislative process. And, in particular, and I believe that the chairman of the banking committee, the Senator from Connecticut, wanted to move on this, but we were told, partly I think they made a mistake by waiting too long, but then they were told it had to be done unanimously. And we were told that the senior Republican on the committee, the Senator from Alabama, simply refused to deal with this. 
   Had this been up in the Senate and had the Senate voted ``no'' to nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological coverage, had the Senate voted ``no'' to group life and the very important provision of our colleague, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), to protect people against discrimination if they wanted to travel to Israel or elsewhere; if the Senate had voted against the reset mechanism, I would have been disappointed, but I would have said, well, that is the way it works. But to have the opposition of the senior Republican mean that no debate or discussion, much less a vote, could take place is a breakdown of the system. 
   We are in a position where something at this point is better than nothing. But I want to say, as chairman of the Committee on Financial Services, we will begin early next year to try to get this back on the Senate agenda, and I will be urging my Senate colleagues not to put themselves in a position where this kind of one-person veto can prevent, not an outcome, none of us have the right to an outcome, but the American people ought to have a right to debate and discussion. 
   Now, there is a problem, Mr. Speaker, that I acknowledge, and it is a problem that those of us who have been frustrated by this, really, I mentioned the Senator from Alabama. I disagree with his obstruction. But let's put the blame where it belongs also, on James Madison. We had an election last year, and we elected a new House and we elected one-third of the Senate, and that is part of the problem. We have a House that responded to the election of 2006. We have at this point a House and a Senate each responding to somewhat different electoral impulses. We are here as a result of the election of 2006, every single one of us. Or subsequent special elections, sadly, in some cases. 
   In the Senate, two-thirds of that Senate was elected in 2002 and 2004. That is the disjunction. And it is not personal in general, it is electoral, and it is a frustration that cannot be overcome easily. But it does make me determined, as I go into the second year of this session, to pay more attention to that need. And we will be doing everything we can again. Again, we cannot guarantee outcome in the Senate or anywhere else, but the American people ought to be able to get the benefit of votes and debate. 
   So this is a recognition that terrorism insurance, in my judgment, should be here as long as terrorism is here. It is not a case of waiting for the market. It is a case of stepping up, as we should, for national defense purposes. And we will work, and I will be following the lead of my colleague from New York (Mr. Ackerman) and others as we try to make this bill an even better bill, reflecting what it was in the House.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. (WHO WILL SAVE ZIMBABWE? -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, we are about to see the world sit by silently, not silently perhaps, but ineffectively, and allow one of the most outrageous abuses of human rights that we have seen in a long time to go forward. 
   The president of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, is engaging in a pattern of oppression and tyranny and thuggery and despicable conduct towards his own people. He lost a preliminary election for the presidency despite every effort he could make to rig the election. Rather than allow the second round to go forward, he has ramped up the terror to the point where the man who got more votes than he in the first round understandably said he wouldn't participate in a run-off election which  would not only be a fraud but which has already led to the murder and abuse of many innocent people. 
   Robert Rotberg, a very distinguished scholar of Africa, wrote an article that was published in yesterday's Boston Globe. The headline is, ``Who will have the courage to save Zimbabwe?'' 
   He starts with a little history. He writes, ``After Idi Amin terrorized and killed his own Ugandans throughout the 1970s, President Julius Nyerere of neighboring Tanzania finally sent his army across the border to end the mayhem and restore stability. Who will now do the same for beleaguered Zimbabwe? Who will remove despotic Robert Mugabe from his besmirched and exposed presidency?'' 
   He is not calling for an army to go in, although there is certainly far stronger justification for an army to go there than a lot of places armies have been sent recently, but he has a program which he believes could be helpful. But as he points out, it has to be African nations that do this. 
   This is a situation given the colonial history where the United States and Britain and France and others would not have the moral authority to act. But Africans should. 
   Madam Speaker, I led a congressional delegation to Africa in April, and I was honored to be in the presence of the current president of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, a man who was one of the leaders in overturning one of the worst oppressions we have seen, apartheid in South Africa. I was honored to be in his presence. I was delighted when he presented a very high honor from South Africa to our colleague, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters). 
   But I have felt terrible disappointment at President Mbeki's passivity in the face of the terrible repudiation of democracy by President Mugabe. I wish that President Mbeki would have understood the right of the people of Zimbabwe to receive the same kind of sympathy and help that many of us tried to extend to the people of South Africa when they were victimized. 
   I will include for the Record the article by Mr. Rotberg making an argument for an African initiative to protect the people of Zimbabwe from the tyrant, the degenerating tyrant who so viciously oppresses them. 
   Mr. Rotberg closes with this: ``Zimbabwe is in shambles. The United States and Britain would doubtless like to act unilaterally, but dare not. Only Africans and the U.N. have unquestioned moral authority.'' And he notes here that the former Secretary General Kofi Annan did a great job when Kenya had troubles and helped to pacify and restore democracy and stability to Kenya. So he says, ``Only Africa and the United Nations have unquestioned moral authority. Which African leaders will now emulate Nyerere's profile of courage in Zimbabwe's dire time of need?'' 
   As one who has strongly supported the rights of the people of Africa to be free from colonialism, one who has strongly supported the need to provide the appropriate economic support so we can seriously diminish poverty, as a great admirer of President Mbeki and his colleagues, I implore them to save the good name of African democracy. And I understand the difficulty, and they certainly aren't the ones perpetrating this. But if the world, if Africa allows Mugabe to continue this terrible reign of terror, it will be a source of shame to us all. 
   Who Will Have the Courage to Save Zimbabwe?  
   After Idi Amin terrorized and killed his own Ugandans throughout the 1970s, President Julius Nyerere of neighboring Tanzania finally sent his army across the border to end the mayhem and restore stability. Who will now do the same for beleaguered Zimbabwe? Who will remove despotic Robert Mugabe from his besmirched and exposed presidency? 
   Presidential contender Morgan Tsvangirai's courageous decision to boycott Zimbabwe's runoff election on Friday--after Mugabe's thugs broke up yet another opposition rally by swinging iron bars and sticks at potential Tsvangirai voters--compels the African Union, the UN Security Council, and major powers finally to act. Tsvangirai said that he and his supporters were facing war, not an election, and they would ``not be part of that war.'' Serious UN sanctions are a first step. 
   Second, since South Africa shows no appetite for an intervention and Tanzania, Botswana, Mozambique, and Zambia--Zimbabwe's neighbors--are unlikely to act militarily without South African agreement an African stained Zimbabwe's tyranny should: demand that Friday's poll be postponed until Africans can patrol the country and oversee a free and fair real election; demand compulsory mediation by former UN secretary general Kofi Annan, who pacified Kenya earlier this year; denounce despotism in Zimbabwe; and ban all Zimbabwean aircraft from flying over neighboring airspaces, thus effectively keeping Mugabe and his henchmen bottled up inside their decaying country. Neighboring countries could also squeeze land-locked Zimbabwe's electricity supplies and slow rail traffic. 
   Time is short. Mugabe is clearly still intent on ratifying his usurpation of power on Friday. Tsvangirai officially led Mugabe in the initial presidential poll in March. In recent weeks Mugabe's military have unleashed a relentless wave of intimidation against Tsvangirai's Movement for a Democratic Change and its supporters, killing 86, maiming at least 10,000, and assaulting thousands more. Tsvangirai was detained seven times before Sunday and his key deputy was imprisoned last week without trial on a bogus treason charge. Yesterday, the house of another key deputy was trashed and his elderly relatives assaulted. 
   Unless Africa and the UN act courageously, Mugabe will get away with his brazen attempt to cling brutally to power and impoverish his own people despite broad global contempt. 
   Mugabe has also refused to summon Parliament, which is dominated by the Movement for Democratic Change and was elected overwhelmingly in March. As a result, many of Mugabe's cabinet ministers and loyalist remain in office, drawing salaries, despite having lost their seats. Several times, Mugabe and close associates have publicly declared that the Movement and Tsvangirai would never be allowed to take office or govern. ``Only God will remove me,'' Mugabe defiantly declared Monday. 
   Conditions in Zimbabwe, where more than 80 percent of adults are unemployed and nearly everyone is hungry; where there are startling shortages of staple corn, wheat and bread, sugar, oil, milk, and gasoline; and where brutality is always around the next corner are even more horrific today than they were in Uganda in 1979, when Nyerere invaded. Famously, Mugabe told a BBC interviewer in 1999 that he was ``no Idi Amin.'' 
   Mugabe's men have also continued to use food as a political weapon, first stopping the supply of grain by international relief agencies and last week physically stealing relief shipments to give to their own supporters. Mugabe's thugs have also harassed British and American diplomats at roadblocks, in one case threatening to burn them alive in their cars. 
   Zimbabwe's inflation now exceeds 160,000 percent a year. One U.S. dollar buys 4 million Zimbabwe dollars at the unofficial street rate. Mugabe and his close associates exploit differences between official and unofficial exchange rates to prosper while ordinary Zimbabweans go hungry or are attacked. 
   Zimbabwe is in shambles. The United States and Britain would doubtless like to act unilaterally, but dare not. Only Africans and the UN have unquestioned moral authority. Which African leaders will now emulate Nyerere's profile of courage in Zimbabwe's dire time of need?

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. (ASSET MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, this is a bill that came to the House earlier under a rule and had proceeded without any significant controversy to the point of a recommital motion. The recommital motion offered was one this bill deals with, the relationship between smaller public housing authorities in particular, and HUD, and tries to give them more flexibility. It's widely supported and requested of us, indeed, by many of the housing authorities that are in our districts. 
   The recommital motion involved the right to own weapons and said that no authority could restrict the right to own weapons beyond what State or city applicable law provided. That was somewhat controversial and led to a decision to withdraw the bill. 
   It was then back in committee, and in committee we adopted the substance--we in fact adopted the recommital motion. There were a couple of refinements that were broadly agreed to, making it clear that nothing would protect anybody who illegally used a weapon. And that was broadly supported. 
   We also made a couple of other small changes. Our colleague from Florida (Mr. Meek) noted that he has a housing authority in his district that is in receivership. He wanted to make it explicit that the rights the tenants have in general do not get lost in receivership. That was unanimously agreed to. 
   We also adopted language that is responsive to the will of the House, making it clear that people who are in this country illegally would not be able to benefit under this program. 
   With that, we are back to where we were originally. The bill had not been controversial, although it had been worked out in committee, and I appreciate the cooperation of my colleague from West Virginia, the gentlewoman, who was the ranking member of the Housing Subcommittee. 
   So we have now a bill that we believe represents the will of the House. There were some members, particularly on our side, who weren't happy with the recommital motion, but it was clear what the will of the body would be. We did not feel we wanted to interfere with an important piece of legislation. 
   Among those who have asked us to do this is the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials, the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities, and the Public Housing Authorities Directors Association. 
   This also, by the way, allows capital funds to be used for operating expenses in the appropriate circumstances, which we took from a previously done appropriations bill. 
   So it is a bill that improves the management of public housing. It incorporates the concerns that have been raised. I hope it is adopted. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, the author of the bill, as the gentlewoman has noted, is our colleague, Mr. Sires from New Jersey, who represents a district in northern New Jersey where public housing is an important part of the makeup of the area. He was, at the time of this, a member of the Financial Services Committee, and a valuable member, and his interest in housing matters obviously continues. So we were very glad to be able to follow his lead.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object, it is important for the membership to understand what we have here, a need for the House to correct sloppy legislation, a use of the legislative process to score political points rather than to achieve public policy goals. 
   This is not a problem caused by the ranking member of the full committee, the gentleman Alabama. If you want to look at this as one big circus, today is the day that the gentleman from Alabama gets to clean up after the elephants. And I mean elephants. 
   What we have here, Members may have read this a week ago, there are people who specialize in writing recommittal motions that are not, in my judgment, constructive contributions to the legislative process but are ``gotchas.'' And what happens is we work in committee, as we did on this bill to provide debt relief to poor countries, the gentleman from Alabama has been a stand-out advocate for debt relief for poor countries when his party was in the majority and now. 
   We worked together and came up with a very good bill. In fact, a large number of the groups that support fair treatment for the poorest in the world are going to celebrate that bill tonight. Fortunately, because we were able to fix this, they have something to celebrate. We almost ruined their celebration. 
   Because what happened was after all of the collaborative efforts in the Committee on Financial Services, as we finished the legislative process, after we adopted several amendments, including a manager's amendment that was predominantly constructed for the Republicans' concern, a Republican amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher), one offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings), we got a recommittal motion. 
   Now the way things have unfortunately worked around here, no one got to see, on our side, the recommittal motion until minutes before we had to debate it, and we have only 10 minutes. It was a policy statement that said no debt relief should go to anyone whose government has business interests with Iran. 
   By the way, Condoleezza Rice just came back from meeting with the Gulf Council, in which she was urging them to give debt relief to Iraq; and they don't want to give debt relief to Iraq apparently for a number of reasons, but one of them, you can read it in today's Washington Post and yesterday's New York Times, is Iraq has too many dealings with Iran. Now they weren't technically covered by our bill, but if you are going to set forward the principle for the United States Congress that you don't give debt relief to people who do business with Iran and other people apply that principle, you won't get debt relief for Iraq because they have those relations given their proximity, the religious commonality, et cetera. 
   But to go back to this request and the need for it, the recommittal motion was so badly drafted that it knocked out many parts of the bill. In fact, the House took three votes last week: Two to adopt the Republican amendments and then one to adopt a Republican recommittal that killed the two Republican amendments. 
   I thought, well, maybe they didn't notice that we had amendments, but as the Parliamentarian had pointed out to us, this amendment was so sloppily drafted in the urge to score political points and not consult with anybody, I think, on either side in terms of committees, that it also killed some parts of the bill. It didn't simply do the amendment. You might say, well, they drafted to the bill and didn't look at the amendments. It killed parts of the bill. 
   I am going to withdraw my reservation, Mr. Speaker, because this is an important bill. But will no one learn from this? Can we not stop this process of ambush and last-minute recommittal motions that are not part of a constructive legislative process but are drafted purely to make political points and drafted badly and drafted not in consultation with any substantive knowledge? 
   So we are here today to undo much of the effects of a recommittal motion. We are here today because of ``gotcha'' politics that the minority leadership played, not the committee leadership, but the minority leadership.     
   And so I would hope that they might have learned from this. And let me be clear, Mr. Speaker, my original intention was not to agree to this because I thought they just killed the Republican amendments. Luckily for them, they were even more incompetent in proposing that than I had thought they were, and they killed vital parts of this bill that we both need. So I am constrained to help them undo their own mistake. 
   And I would express the hope, probably in vain, that instead of continuing to use the recommittal motion in a way that has no constructive legislative purpose, but is truly to try and advance partisan agendas, that we can get a collaborative effort. That doesn't mean the recommittal motion shouldn't really put issues into play, of course they should; that's partly what it's for. There's no need to hold it until the last minute. If we had had an hour's notice, we could have found that error. I found the error, but by the time I found it it was too late, we had already wrote it. So I hope out of this--I don't have a lot of hope, but I do hope--that those who have sort of taken the legislative process hostage by their need to politicize recommittal will learn from this. And I hope this is the last time we have to come here and correct this. 
   And I will just as I close predict again, it wasn't just badly drafted in the technical sense, I will predict that we will hear that if the United States Congress adopts as a principle that no debt relief goes to a country that has business with Iran, it will undercut Secretary Rice's efforts to get the Gulf Cooperation Council to give debt relief to Iraq. And I believe that we will not only have to correct this procedurally, we will have to correct it substantively. 
   Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. (PROTECTING PEOPLE AGAINST DISCRIMINATION BASED ON THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY -- (House of Representatives - October 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, let me do what I think you cannot do under the rules and reassure your constituents in Florida that you have not become a Tennesseean when they weren't looking. I believe the gentleman from Tennessee left the chair, and we do now have the gentleman from Florida in the chair. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to address today a very important issue that is generating an intense discussion among a fairly small segment of people who follow things, and it seems to us it's not healthy and that we ought to have a broader discussion, both of the specific issue, which is a question of how to protect people against discrimination based on their sexual orientation and at some point I would hope their gender and their gender identity, and also how do political parties relate to those in the population who are the most passionate, the most committed and the most legitimately zealous about their feelings, often on one particular issue to the exclusion of a broader set. 
   Before I came to Congress in 1981, former Members, the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Abzug), gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Tsongas) and others, in the House filed legislation to make it illegal to discriminate against people in employment based on their sexual orientation; that is, they would have made it illegal in the same way that the 1964 Civil Rights Act made it illegal based on race, but in a different statute for a variety of reasons, for people to be fired, for people to refuse to hire people, for people to be denied promotions or in other ways discriminated against in the job based on their being gay or lesbian or bisexual. That was, and has been, the number one legislative goal of gay and lesbian, bisexual people for more than 30 years. 
   In many States subsequent to that enactment, that introduction, laws were adopted to do that. Wisconsin was the first in 1982; Massachusetts, the State I represent, the second in 1989. Many States now have it. 
   As we kept that fight up in the face of a good deal of opposition and as we began to educate people as to why the prejudice against people based on our being gay or lesbian or bisexual was, in fact, invalid as a grounds for economic discrimination, movement expanded to cover people who are transgendered, people who were born into one sex physically but who strongly identify with the other sex and who, in fact, choose to live as members of the sex other than the one they were born in, often but not always having surgery to enhance that new life. 
   We are at a differential stage in public understanding of these issues. We've been dealing explicitly and increasingly openly with prejudice based on sexual orientation for almost 40 years, since the Stonewall Riots of 1969 and since then. 
   The millions of people that talk openly and to take on the prejudice against people who are transgendered is newer. It is also the case that prejudice begins with people reacting against those who are different from them in some way. People are rarely prejudiced against their clones. So we have this situation where there is more prejudice in this society today against people who are transgendered than against people who are gay and lesbian, partly because we have been working longer at dealing with the sex orientation prejudice; partly because the greater the difference, the greater the prejudice is to start, the more people fail to identify, the more they are put off by differences, especially when those differences come in matters of the greatest personal intimacy. 
   We should be clear that as we talk about matters of human sexuality or the human sexual characteristics we touch on the most sensitive subjects that human beings will deal with. 
   So where we are today is that earlier this year, after years of our introducing the bill which we call ENDA, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, to ban discrimination in employment based on sexual orientation, we added this year for the first time a provision that would also have banned discrimination based on gender identity as we have designated it, i.e., against people who are transgendered. 
   We began dealing with the transgender issue earlier in the context of the hate crimes legislation, and legislating against hate crimes, it's easier to do than sexual orientation. It is less intrusive, and it is easier to make the argument that assaulting people and destroying their property is wrong than it is to say that refusing to hire them is wrong. I think they're both wrong, but obviously, there is a distinction in this society. One is a serious criminal issue; one becomes civil. 
   We originally encountered difficulty in broadening hate crimes to include people of transgender. I first talked about that in 1999. I remember having to explain to people what we were talking about. 
   Recently, we were successful earlier this, under the leadership of the Speaker of the House, in getting legislation through the House that expanded the hate crime protection, not just based on sexual orientation, but based on people being transgender. The Senate followed suit; although one of the leading senators engaged in that effort noted that whereas, when the Senate voted on that dealing solely with the sexual orientation issue, there were 12 Republican supporters, this year there were only eight. Eight turned out to be just enough to get us 60 votes to break a filibuster, but there was a fourth or one-third of Republican support even on hate crimes which is the easier one. 
   Despite that, we thought we were in a position this year, under the leadership of the Speaker who had committed early to myself and the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Baldwin), my colleague, to bring these issues up, hate crimes first and then employment nondiscrimination, we thought we had the votes to pass it. 
   In fact, on September 5 of this year, when the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Andrews), a great supporter of opposing discrimination for all sorts, had a hearing in his subcommittee on the issue, I personally spoke more about the importance of including people who were transgendered than any other witness. 
   I know, Mr. Speaker, that there are today people who are unhappy with my position because I believe, to get to the central point here, that we have the votes to pass a bill today in the House that would ban discrimination in employment based on sexual orientation, but sadly, we don't yet have it on gender identity. And I differ with some as to what we do about that. 
   But one of the problems we have today, both on this issue, and as I will discuss in a little bit in general, is people in our society, the most deeply committed, who believe that when a politician tells them an unpleasant fact, he or she must somehow be embracing that fact. Because I have been one of those who has felt the obligation to tell my friends in the transgender community that prejudice against them is greater than prejudice against gay men and lesbians for some of the reasons I talked about, I have been asked why I am so opposed to fairness for people of transgender.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I just have got to comment that some of my friends on the other side appear more concerned about enforcing the rules strictly than at other times. I asked several times to get an answer. I don't think the answer is over there. I don't think this is very well considered. It does not appear to me to change existing law. 
   And to say that we are going to tell them that they have to follow existing law, it seems rather odd. If it is so important, you know, if this had been offered as an amendment, we argued successfully all the subsequent amendments would be in order. To the extent that it changes anything, it changes only for New Orleans. So this is only for people whose houses were washed away. 
   Now, I don't know how it makes any change. I will take on faith the gentleman's assertion that it makes changes, even though he couldn't tell me what they were. But I would then say, why would we say only if your house had been washed away would you be subject to some restriction? 
   Mr. Speaker, I will now yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Melancon).

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. The gentleman is probably trying to figure out what the amendment says, and that is a hard job. 
   I will then repeat what he said to me, which is, and read this, this I do know, ``it is for New Orleans only.'' Now, we could not amend it for the whole area. What about Mississippi? I mean, was the gentleman afraid that if he included Mississippi, the gentleman, Mr. Taylor, would challenge him to come to Mississippi? I think the gentleman from Louisiana has already been to Mississippi. He wouldn't have to change his travel plans the way the gentleman from Georgia would have. 
   Why should only people who have suffered this enormous trauma, who live in New Orleans, be subjected to a special set of rules? By the way, we will send the Members long lists of rules already on the books, statutory and regulatory, that prevent public housing authorities from allowing people with criminal records to come in. You have the ``one strike'' situation where they can be easily evicted. 
   So this does not add, as nearly as we can tell, to the restriction on letting people in. To the extent that it imposes a greater work requirement, we are talking about people whose homes were  destroyed, whose jobs may have been washed away, who may be trying to find additional housing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The gentleman from Texas once again referred to an earlier amendment from yesterday, but trying to understand this particular amendment has nothing to do with whether you construct or destruct or replace public housing. What this says is the following: There were people who were living in the gulf area who were receiving some form of assistance under HUD programs. Some of them lived in public housing, some of them were in vouchers, some of them were living in subsidized housing for the elderly and the disabled. The places where they were living were washed away in the most literal, physical sense. 
   We all agree that we have not yet, in the gulf area, replaced that housing. It's true there have been slowdowns, for instance, in Road Home money in New Orleans. But in Mississippi earlier this year, the Oreck Vacuum Company, which to its credit had tried to help the people in the gulf by reopening a factory that the company had in the gulf, shut the factory down because, they explained, the shortage of housing made it impossible for them to recruit  people. There was a physical shortage of housing, and we have people who were once living in the area who have moved to other places. Some of them may still be in the area. 
   We know that employment in the gulf area hasn't yet returned to its prior level, and we have this chicken-and-egg problem of housing and unemployment. We have now about 12,000 people, who were affected by this amendment, who were previously receiving HUD assistance. Because of the hurricane, the form of assistance they were receiving is no longer possible. They are the ones who were on these disaster vouchers. 
   Now, before we brought this bill out, those people were legally going to lose those vouchers as of the end of this fiscal year, September 30, an uncontested part of the bill. I appreciate the minority's acquiescence in that. There is some agreement here between us. An uncontested part of this bill extends into November. 
   The amendment today says that those people who were on HUD assistance before, they have to have been eligible before and still be eligible by various income and other qualifications for HUD assistance, that if as of December 31 of this year they have not been able to find alternative housing, we will not administer what my friend from Texas called ``tough love'' by kicking them out. 
   I do not think these are appropriate candidates for tough love. These are not people who are in some situation through their own lack of character. They are people who were displaced by a great physical disaster. 
   Now, I will acknowledge that the minority side in our committee offered an amendment in particular or raised an issue that we thought was correct. As originally drafted, this particular language would have not only extended the vouchers for those who have been in the disaster situation, but would have continued them, adding to the stock. 
   Now, we did that because the gentleman from Texas correctly said you don't want to put these people ahead of other people who might be necessarily, who might have a need. So we wanted these to be additional vouchers, not to bite into the other section 8. But we incorrectly, in my judgment, drafted this originally so that even after the current recipients, the current recipients of the disaster vouchers, the victims of New Orleans, as they no longer needed the vouchers or were no longer eligible for them the vouchers would continue to be part of the overall number. 
   We offered an amendment, unanimous in the committee, that said, no, they will be what we call disappearing vouchers. That is, there is a fixed number of people who now have these vouchers. 
   As those people die, find other housing, become economically ineligible, as we hope many of them will be as they are able to return to jobs, for whatever reason, as they no longer need the vouchers or are eligible for them, the vouchers will cease to exist.     
   So they are permanent in one sense, but not in another. They are permanent as long as this universe of 12,000 recipients of HUD help before the hurricane still need them. But as the people in that category no longer need them or are ineligible, they will disappear. So they are not permanent in that sense. 
   Now, again, we have acknowledged that there have been slowdowns in trying to rebuild the housing. So the question is, if we cut this off as of December 31, what will happen to those people? How many thousands of them will have no place to live? 
   And then, by the way, they will become competitors with others for section 8. This is a separate category of vouchers for people who were victims of disasters. Some of them live now in other parts of the country. Abolish this separate category as of December 31, and then these people will be competing with other people. 
   And again I want to go back to a point I made yesterday. I don't understand the resistance to reaching out to these people. They were living in their homes, and a hurricane wiped their homes out. They are not wealthy people. They are not middle-income people. They are people who were otherwise eligible for HUD programs. They were people who were complying with the terms of those programs because they hadn't been expelled from them, and their homes were destroyed. 
   And we had hoped that by now we would have done a better job collectively of helping them relocate. We haven't. There is plenty of blame to go around. One place that does not seem to me the blame sticks is with these people, these people who had vouchers, who had public housing residences. 
   And the question now is, do we say to these victims of the hurricane, we are sorry that it has taken us 18 months to get things organized? But you know what? You have only the rest of this year to find a new place to live. 
   There are elderly people here. There are disabled people here. There are others. They came from a place where we know employment hasn't come back. Why the insistence on treating them as people who are somehow looking for something they don't deserve? Why the refusal to say, you know, we haven't done the right thing in terms of overall. We hope we will, but as long as you are in this situation where you were displaced physically by a disaster, and as long as back in your home area there isn't sufficient replacement housing, and you know, in Mississippi and it is true, Mississippi has done better on the CDBG than Louisiana. But you just have to pick up the paper to read about the insurance fights. There hasn't been a massive amount of rebuilding in Mississippi either. 
   You then are telling the people who were the recipients of these vouchers as of December 31 you are on your own. Find the housing, or compete with a number of other people for limited stock. 
   These vouchers go only to people who had previously been on HUD assistance who were physically displaced by the hurricane, and the vouchers are only for them. And as they begin to find other housing, as they die off, as they will, as people get new jobs and aren't eligible, the vouchers will disappear. 
   I very much hope that this amendment is defeated. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Texas has given us a good example of the meaning of true conservatism. 
   He had a speech written on this amendment when the bill was first introduced. We have amended the section he is talking about, but he still likes that speech so much he won't get rid of it. He keeps talking about permanent section 8s. They were permanent when the bill was introduced, I agree. When the bill was introduced, they were not just disaster vouchers for the people who were displaced from their homes by a flood in New Orleans, but even after those people no longer used the vouchers, they would remain on the books. He objected to that and we agreed to that part of his objection. 
   We adopted an amendment that says they disappear when the people disappear. So let me put it this way: These vouchers are permanent only if 12,000 refugees from the New Orleans hurricane are permanent human beings. If they live forever, so does the voucher program. But I do not think that every recipient of elderly housing is going to be permanently with us. I will lament their passing, they are undoubtedly decent people, but they are not permanent. And so the gentleman's politics and theology are both incorrect in this case. They are by no means permanent. 
   He said anybody who had a voucher in New Orleans can go back and get it, but they were people who lived in public housing. They can't have a voucher. Public housing was physically destroyed. There were people who lived in  202 housing for the elderly, and housing for the disabled; that housing has been destroyed. 
   What we are doing here is providing a replacement not just for the vouchers in New Orleans but for physical housing that was destroyed in New Orleans. 
   Finally, the gentleman said they can go to Houston if they are eligible in Houston; but previously he said we don't want them competing. So either they compete with the people of Houston, who have already been very decent, or they get nothing. I hope the amendment is defeated. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Neugebauer). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I am impressed by the sincerity of the gentleman from Washington's advocacy on people who are transgender, and I hope that as we contemplate this strategy today people will fully examine that. 
   I regret the fact that there do not appear to be the votes in this House to include people who are transgender. And I am struck by the eagerness, frankly, of some people to use that group as a weapon with which to defeat the whole bill because these are people who are opposed not only to the inclusion of people who are transgender, but who have historically been opposed to including any protection for people at all. 
   I will yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I take back my time. That's all the gentleman said, but the effect would be to try to undermine the bill. When people who are opposed to the basic bill and opposed to the amendment lament the chance not to vote on an amendment which would undermine the bill, people should understand where we are. 
   I filed the bill that included people who are transgender. And earlier this year, I was very proud when this House passed a hate crimes bill which explicitly included people who are transgender. My recollection is the gentleman from Washington voted against that. 
   We are in the following situation in this country: We have had prejudices of various sorts. Sadly, prejudice increases as difference increases. We have made progress in, I believe, disputing the prejudice against people, like myself, who are gay. We have not, lamentably, made as much progress in people who are transgender. I agree that the argument is there for including everyone. I agree that there was an argument for including legal immigrants in the SCHIP bill. 
   The question we have is this: If we do not have the votes to go forward with as much as we would like to do, do we then abandon any effort? And do we allow those who are opposed to any progress at all in the anti-discrimination fight in this area to use a particular group as a way to prevent progress? 
   Mr. Speaker, I've been voting on anti-discrimination measures for 35 years when I first joined the legislature, and I have voted repeatedly to extend the protection to groups of which I am not a member, based on ethnicity, based on race, based on disability, based on age. I am now a beneficiary of the age one, but I wasn't when I voted for it. And I wish we had the votes in this House to ban discrimination of all sorts. I also wish that I had as much energy today as I did when I voted to ban AIDS discrimination when it wasn't eligible. I wish I could eat more and not gain weight. I wish a lot of things. But I will not act on my wishes irresponsibly. 
   I hope we will go forward today and do as much as we can. I believe that if we are able to muster the votes to tell millions of Americans who are gay and lesbian that they are not bad people, that it is not legitimate to fire them simply because of who they are, the message we send to those people, the message we send to high school students who go to school each day fearing the kind of torment that they will confront, that that will be the most significant advance we have made in fighting prejudice since the Americans with Disabilities Act. I wish we could do more. And if we are able to do this, I will continue my efforts to do more. 
   I am glad to see more recruits now to the effort to protect people who are  transgender. I wish they were there when many of us were fighting many years ago. 
   I will make this prediction, that if we go forward today and adopt legislation that bans discrimination based on sexual orientation but does not ban discrimination based on gender identity, some of us will continue to fight to protect people based on gender identity, and many of those seeking to use that issue today will be our opponents as we go forward trying to do it.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I am grateful for the obscurity of the opposition's argument. 
   I first filed a bill 35 years ago to say that you couldn't fire someone because he was gay or she was a lesbian, and at the time people were very straightforward about their opposition. Times have changed. It is no longer fashionable to say that you ought to be able to discriminate against someone based on his or her sexual orientation, so we now get other arguments. 
   Let me say this: I have heard a number of people raise this argument that the real problem is that it says ``perceived.'' I do not believe that a single one of them would change his or her position if we were to remove that. They are opposed to the notion that gay men and lesbians, people like me, should be allowed to prove themselves in the workplace without discrimination, but that's not a good argument to make. So we get ``perceived'' as the argument, and it is not a serious one. 
   In the first place, it's arguing about having to defend a negative; it's wrong, both legally and factually. The burden of proof is on the complainant. No employer has to prove a negative. It is the complainant who has the hard job of proving the positive. That's why historically statutes like this, every time we try to protect some people against discrimination, we go through two phases. First, beforehand, we get the most absurd exaggerations of the chaotic impact it will have. After the fact, they are rarely, unfortunately, enforced very vigorously. And by the way, if this ``perceived,'' if this were a problem, we would have examples of it. Nineteen States have laws like this on the books, and how many examples have you had of the poor, befuddled employer who is so unable to perceive that he is put on the dock? None. This is a made-up issue made up by people who don't want to confront the real issue. 
   And here is the real issue: there are millions of our fellow citizens, Madam Chair, gay or lesbian, who live in fear that they could be fired because they live in States where there is no such protection. And we have had real examples of that. And what we say today is, no, you can't be fired because of that. 
   Why is ``perceived'' in there? Because otherwise you're opening a big loophole. By the way, this notion of ``perceived,'' it is so unusual that it's in the American Disabilities Act and has been interpreted by several judges, Justice Alito, Judge Mukasey and Poser, three radicals who have enforced this. 
   So, let's not hide behind this semantic. That is not the genuine motivation for opposition to this bill on the part of anyone in this House. What they are saying is, we don't want to protect working men and women from this. 
   Madam Chair, I was accused in the last campaign by a former Member of this body of pursuing a radical homosexual agenda. Well, here it is in the House today, working, getting a job. That's what we are asking for, the right for people to go to work and be judged solely on how they work. Let's get rid of the semantic obscurantism.

Before I begin, I have an inquiry: If I could yield to the gentleman from Virginia, the proponent of the motion, would he consider my making a unanimous consent request to change this to a ``motion of forthwith,'' so the House could simply adopt this ``forthwith'' and go to dinner?

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Well, this is now clear. This is a motion to do this promptly. ``Promptly'' means at the speediest nine calendar days, because it does not, as the Parliamentarian has informed us in writing, waive any of the rules for committee meetings, for Rules Committee, et cetera. So the purpose here, the intent, perhaps not the purpose, but the unmistakable intent would be to put this off until after we are due to adjourn November 16. And for what purpose? For the purpose of restating what has already been stated. 
   It is interesting, Mr. Speaker, and I take some encouragement from this, that opponents of the principle of nondiscrimination don't want to debate it on its merits. We haven't heard any defense of discrimination. We just have a parliamentary maneuver to protect it. 
   This is not about marriage. In fact, this is not a recommit. It is a statement. It says ``nothing in this act may be construed.'' Correct. No one who reads English could think to the contrary. 
   But, just to make sure, the gentleman from California offered a motion, and the minority tried to have it not be roll-called, and you voted for it, Members of the House. It says, ``As used in this act, the terms `married' or `marry' refer to marriage as defined in section 7, title I of the U.S. Code, the Defense of Marriage Act.'' The Members of the House just voted overwhelmingly to reaffirm that definition. 
   So what do we have? A motion now simply to delay by reaffirming the last vote. 
   The gentleman from Indiana thought there was some other language that might lead to a marriage problem, so we adopted that. So this is the third effort to say the same thing. It is not to say the same thing, but to defeat it. 
   I would say this. I would recommend to my friend from California, who has done such a good job on this, once we have concluded this, report this out as a separate bill, this third reiteration, if it gives people some comfort. 
   I asked the gentleman to make it ``forthwith.'' If there was a real need to do this, it would be now part of the law and we would be voting. It is ``promptly'' because it adds nothing to the bill, nothing, literally nothing; it subtracts nothing. It is simply a motion to delay. 
   I now want to address that. I want to address the motion to delay. 
   Mr. Speaker, we say here that we don't take things personally, and usually that is true. Members, Mr. Speaker, will have to forgive me. I take it a little personally. 
   Thirty-five years ago, I filed a bill to try to get rid of discrimination based on sexual orientation. As we sit here today, there are millions of Americans in States where this is not the law. By the way, 19 States have such a law. In no case has it led to that decision. The Massachusetts law passed in 1989, that did not lead to the decision in 2004. Unrelated. 
   But here is the deal. I used to be someone subject to this prejudice, and, through luck, circumstance, I got to be a big shot. I am now above that prejudice. But I feel an obligation to 15-year-olds dreading to go to school because of the torments, to people afraid that they will lose their job in a gas station if someone finds out who they love. I feel an obligation to use the status I have been lucky enough to get to help them. 
   I want to ask my colleagues here, Mr. Speaker, on a personal basis, please, don't fall for this sham. Don't send me out of here having failed to help those people. 
   We have already today twice voted overwhelmingly to repudiate any suggestion that this had anything to do with marriage. What you have is a ploy by people who want to keep discrimination on the books, who want to deny protection to so many vulnerable victims of discrimination, but they at least understand that is not something you can say explicitly. So they give us this sham. 
   I ask, I ask again, would the gentleman allow us to adopt this forthwith? I would yield to the gentleman for that purpose so we can make that forthwith.

   So I will close with this. Yes, this is personal. There are people who are your fellow citizens being discriminated against. We have a simple bill that says you can go to work and be judged on how you work and not be penalized. Please don't turn your back on them.

Now, I don't know why we would want to say that we would vote money to build housing for the disabled but no parking. Have we found a new group of totally mobile disabled? 
   I mean, this amendment would say that if you got funds under the 811 program to build housing for disabled people, you couldn't provide parking for vans, for transportation. I'm really baffled as to the scope, and I do think that telling people that they could not provide parking at a disabled housing facility is a very poor idea. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

   I will not object to the unanimous consent request. It will forestall a 15-minute vote and make it a 2-minute vote. And I appreciate the cooperative spirit from the gentleman of Michigan on this as throughout he has been cooperative. I understand other decisions get made, but I did just ask the indulgence of the House because people shouldn't be voting on something with no explanation. 
   There was implemented in 1998 in legislation, and I think it was part of an appropriations bill then, a requirement that everybody who lives in public housing who is not otherwise fully employed work 8 hours a month in community service. It is not highly regarded by the people who run public housing. It costs money to do this. Understand, when a similar amendment was proposed for the section 8 vouchers, it was defeated, it authorized the Housing Authority to hire someone to administer it. This is not work that is terribly useful. 
   The way the amendment is written, if you were working, and you are fired or your job ends because of trade or other problems as some people in public housing and you are unemployed, you then have to do 8 hours a month of make-work. So it is a make-work requirement does nobody any good, it is based on the assumption that you can't trust those lazy people in public housing across the board, and it costs money to administer. So that is why the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel), who has long been a proponent of it, and myself have offered this amendment. 
   I thank the gentleman for a chance to explain it.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, we have limited time here, and I want to explain to the Members that I will be devoting most of my time to colloquy with Members who have serious concerns about this bill. 
   I believe this bill has a great deal more in it in a number of areas, including in particular avoiding foreclosures, than people have recognized. I at this point will insert into the Record under General Leave a letter from the American Banker, in which Sheila Bair, who is one of the best regulators we have ever had, who has been using her authority over the mortgages she inherited through the IndyMac failure to really provide foreclosure relief, and she says in this: ``The provision would allow the Treasury Department to provide credit guarantees and enhancements on whole loans.'' Ms. Bair said in an interview Thursday, ``They can have so much bigger bang for their buck.'' She asked us to put this in. We put it in. It may be obscure, but it in and of itself will lead to a great deal of help for people with mortgages. 
   What I will be doing, Madam Speaker, during this debate is yielding time for colloquies to Members who are seeking clarification of points in the bill, many of them involving what is very powerful language, although not everything we would have liked, to mitigate foreclosures. I will say that I have spoken to the people at the Department of Treasury, including yesterday morning the Secretary himself, and I will be making commitments today about how we believe this bill will be interpreted, and I will be making no commitments that I have not explained to the Treasury, that the staff of the Financial Services Committee which has done such wonderful work has not discussed with the Treasury. So we will be, as I said, working with Members to clarify some parts of this bill because I do not think it is fully appreciated that it has a good deal more in it for the foreclosure issue and some other issues than has been recognized.  
   Bair: How to Get More Bang for Bailout Buck  
   Washington.--Of all the provisions in the bill designed to stabilize the financial markets, one of its most potent is not getting enough attention, according to Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman Sheila Bair. 
   The provision would allow the Treasury Department to provide credit guarantees and enhancements on whole loans. If it were used, it would allow the government to increase modifications and stabilize home prices at a much smaller cost than buying the loans themselves, Ms. Bair said in an interview Thursday. 
   ``They can have so much bigger bang for their buck,'' she said. ``You don't have an initial cash outlay, you can leave them in the private sector, you can do the servicing in the private sector, and you can condition them on some type of modification protocol, which would get the mortgages restructured faster.'' 
   The provision, a single sentence in the 451-page bill, has attracted little attention from analysts and industry representatives. Instead, they have focused on the crux of the bill, which would allow the Treasury to buy and hold up to $700 billion of troubled assets. 
   The bill would give the Treasury secretary the power to ``use loan guarantees and credit enhancements to facilitate loan modifications to prevent avoidable foreclosures.'' 
   How that would work remains unclear. In theory, the Treasury could guarantee certain types of loans--option adjustable-rate mortgages, for example--and require lenders that want to use the insurance to engage in loan modifications first. If the reworked loan performed, the government would never be involved, but if the loan later defaulted, the government would take a certain amount of the loss. 
   Though she is supportive of the $700 billion buyout facility, Ms. Bair said the provision, added at the behest of the FDIC, could provide a critical alternative. 
   ``It will be another tool they have in their toolkit, and it will be cheaper,'' she said. ``You can provide credit support to $100 billion worth of mortgages with no up-front cash outlay. The exposure would be less than buying those mortgages directly.'' 
   During her two-year tenure, the FDIC has moved from the background to the forefront of the housing crisis. In the past week alone it has handled the largest failure of all time--the $309 billion-asset Washington Mutual Inc.--with no cost to the government. It also invoked the systemic risk exception for the first time in the agency's history to facilitate a deal to sell most of Wachovia Corp. to Citigroup Inc. 
   Ms. Bair said regulators had no choice but to use the exception, which was created in 1991 and required the approval of the Federal Reserve Board and the Treasury. 
   ``We all felt that preventive action was needed,'' she said. ``It was a potential failure, driven primarily by market confidence issues.'' 
   Ms. Bair has also been working to help pass the bailout bill. After the House unexpectedly defeated the legislation Monday, lawmakers scrambled for provisions to bring more Republicans on board. The most notable addition would increase deposit insurance to $250,000 per depositor per institution. 
   That provision would reassure nervous depositors that the banking system is stable, Ms. Bair said, and it gets to the heart of the problem: a lack of confidence among consumers, bankers, and businesses. 
   ``Raising the deposit insurance limit to $250,000 is designed to address that problem  of public confidence,'' she said. ``Expanding that safety net for a period of time, I think, will help with the Main Street depositor and also provide help for banks.'' 
   The coverage hike would take effect immediately and would expire Dec. 31, 2009. The bill explicitly says banks should not face a premium hike as a result. Analysts argue that Congress would have to make the higher limit permanent. Ms. Bair would not take a position, except to say the FDIC should have the power to raise premiums if the increase becomes permanent. 
   ``It's a question for Congress,'' she said. ``It could be destabilizing if they lift it in 2009, but the trade-off would be that banks would have to start paying premiums.'' 
   Overall, she said, she hopes the legislation will help ease fears among financial institutions, some of which have become worried about lending to each other. 
   ``There is a confidence issue,'' Ms. Bair said. ``Originally, liquidity issues were tied to capital adequacy. Now I think liquidity issues are tied to just uncertainty. ..... We are asking Main Street to have confidence in the banking system. Well, I would ask the banks to have confidence in the banking system and lend to each other.'' 
   She said a freeze on credit is only making the situation worse. 
   ``We acknowledge that some individual banks have challenges, but overall they still have strong capital, and they've built up their loan loss reserves,'' she said. ``We shouldn't be freezing up and panicking.'' 
   Though some have argued the bailout bill does not go to the heart of the issue, Ms. Bair was unequivocal in saying she thought the buyout facility would help the situation. 
   ``The reason for the liquidity issue is you have an asset on the balance sheet where the cash flow suggests one valuation, but if you have to sell it, you will be taking a steep loss because the market is seizing up,'' she said. ``So we will be providing a vehicle for moving those assets off balance sheet for a price other than a rock-bottom distressed price. We are capable of letting the government hold the asset for a while before it's sold which will help ease downward pressure on asset valuations. It absolutely should help.'' 
   But she acknowledged some concern that the legislation did not do enough to help struggling borrowers. 
   Ms. Bair was at the forefront last year in warning that lenders and servicers needed to systematically lock in low, starter rates so that borrowers could continue making their mortgage payments on time. More defaults would lead to increased foreclosures, which would cause further deterioration in the housing market. Few took her advice, and the housing market continued to sink. 
   If more lenders had modified loans, she said the situation would still be bad, but not as dramatic. 
   ``We were going to have these problems no matter what, but I do think it would be less of an impact,'' she said. 
   But Ms. Bair said she did not understand why Congress is not doing more to assist borrowers in the bailout legislation. Lawmakers debated forcing more servicers to engage in systematic modifications, but ultimately did not do so. 
   ``I don't understand it,'' she said. ``The borrowers here that are losing their houses have been this politically powerless group. From the get go, politically, for whatever reason, they were put in a category of they got over their head and were an unsympathetic group to deal with. That is not the case with all of them.''

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I can affirm that. As the gentleman knows, the Treasury Department is in agreement with this, and we should be clear, this is one of the things that this House and the Senate added to the bill, the authority to buy equity. It is not simply buying up the assets, it is to buy equity, and to buy equity in a way that the Federal Government will able to benefit if there is an appreciation. 
   I thank the gentleman for this important clarification. He is absolutely right.  
   In implementing the powers provided for in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, it is the intent of Congress that Treasury should use Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) resources to fund capital infusion and asset purchase approaches alone or in conjunction with each other to enable financial institutions to begin providing credit again, and to do so in ways that minimize the burden on taxpayers and have maximum economic recovery impact. Where the legislation speaks of ``assets'', that term is intended to include capital instruments of an institution such as common and preferred stock, subordinated and senior debt, and equity rights. Also, it is the intent of this legislation that TARP resources should be used in coordination with regulatory agencies and their responsibilities under prompt-corrective-action and least-cost resolution statutes.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. If the gentleman would yield back to me briefly, I thank him very much. He has been working hard on this, and has also not just professed this in general, but has made some specific suggestions. 
   Of the four points, two will take separate legislation, and I will work with the gentleman because I am in agreement with him on them, in concept. Two of them, however, are, I believe, able to be accomplished in this bill. I have spoken to the Secretary of the Treasury and, I believe, working together with the gentleman, we can make sure. 
   Let me just say specifically. Asset managers to support loan modifications will be very important for this success. The bill encourages the Treasury to consider the FDIC, which has been superlative in this regard, to play this role. Also, Treasury, under this bill, can buy virtually any mortgage asset, and we direct them to coordinate with the other agencies, like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks, and to maximize modifications through the program we just adopted.

Yes, I very much agree with what he just said.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, preliminarily, I recognize myself for 1 minute just to say that I want to be very clear that I regret the decision not to allow a number of amendments offered by members of the minority to this bill. And I will give them my word that as this legislative process goes forward, I intend to seek out opportunities to give them fair consideration. 
   I must say, Mr. Chairman, I'm never happy when I see my colleagues on the Republican side being a little obstreperous, but when they're being obstreperous with good reason, I really find that hard to tolerate. So I did want to make clear my view and my hope that we can deal with that. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the Chair of the Subcommittee on Housing, from which this bill came forward, who has done a great job all year on this legislation, the gentlewoman from California.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I agree that we should have had an amendment that would have allowed us to debate whether or not to strike the wind addition. I would have vigorously defended it as I will do now. 
   The problem is that we now give the insured and the people who administer insurance an impossible task. It is to evacuate a home on the notice of a hurricane and to return to that home some period of time later after there has been devastation from a hurricane and decide with some degree of certainty what damage was caused by water and what by wind, because the Federal Flood Insurance Program protects against water damage. Wind damage is under the auspices of private companies. In some cases, of course, the same company would be involved, and some of the adjusters would have an interest in whether or not it was water versus wind. The more it was water, the less they would have to pay. But even aside from that conflict of interest, it is inherently difficult, in fact impossible, to decide, if you go back and there is all this devastation, was it the wind that blew the roof off? Was it the flood that did it? Was the window broken by a wind-driven projectile? It is impossible to tell. We give people this impossible decision. 
   Now, the way the wind program works under the bill, in the first place, it is not a complete expansion. You only would be eligible to buy wind insurance if you already have flood insurance. It will lead to no new insureds. That has to be very clear. No one who is not now taking out insurance, not just eligible, but taking out insurance, will be allowed to take this out, because it can only be an adjunct to your water policy. It is aimed at trying to avoid having this impossible arbitration between wind and water damage. 
   Secondly, and CBO scores it this way, it is subject to PAYGO. The mandate in the legislation is that it has to be actuarially sound. And people have said, well, the previous flood insurance program wasn't actuarially sound. True. It wasn't subjected to that statutory mandate. It wasn't subject to PAYGO. 
   We have in here language that mandates that the wind coverage be actuarially sound. CBO has certified, and as Members know, we don't always get from CBO what we think is the right answer, but in this case, CBO has certified that this meets PAYGO and that wind will be there. 
   So what we are saying is that if you already have water and you are in an area where you are likely to have a combination of wind and water, we will allow you to buy wind as an adjunct so that, and you will have to pay the going rate for it, the actuarially sound rate, but then you will avoid this terrible, intractable problem of arbitrating wind versus water. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I must say, Mr. Chairman, the gentlewoman asks for my word, and I am tempted to assume a cultural pose which I haven't always had and simply say, ``Word.'' But I am not sure that is still in vogue. I'm sometimes behind in my fashionableness. 
   I will say this to the gentlewoman; she has been very constructive and we have been able to work together on this and other matters, including on the most recent legislation involving floods. Certainly I will do everything I can to see that this is given very serious consideration. 
   Now I should add, the recommendations may mean a curtailment of the program or an adjustment of the program. If the argument is that FEMA is not well structured, the response might be to try to improve the structure of FEMA. But I take this report very seriously. So she has my word that we will take this very, very seriously. In fact, I would say when we get the report, the first thing we will do will be to have a hearing on it and then go from there.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. It is not in our power to tell them not to take a walk. They are a private sector  entity. So unless there was to be some legislative change, there's simply no power, particularly at the Federal level, because insurance has historically been a State issue; but when the gentleman says we shouldn't let them walk away, I might be inclined to agree with that. 
   There's nothing in the Federal Government now that would allow us to stop them from walking away, and our committee is available if anybody has any proposals to increase the role of the Federal Government, and I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. First of all, I agree. I thought he was talking about the Federal Government when he said ``we.'' And he is right, States have some power; the Federal Government does not. But even there, I believe he overstates the States' powers. And in fact, particularly in the Graham-Leach-Bliley bill, we gave some insurance companies the power to leave States, which we shouldn't have done. But States can be required, if they are going to do something, to do other things. But they can leave altogether, and the State insurance commissioners generally don't have the power to do that.

   Secondly, CBO says he is wrong. The wind part is written, unlike the flood part, to require actuarially sound policy premiums to break even, and CBO certified that it's there. So the notion that this is adding trillions or even billions to our debt is simply wrong, according to CBO.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. The amendment that you are talking about specifically did not encourage anybody to move. It dealt with people who are already there, having moved there previously, found subsequently they were in a flood area. But the general thrust of the bill on flood, strongly supported by environmentalists, is to increase the amount that's charged in many cases and to restrict the building. 
   As to wind, there is no subsidy. It is required to be actuarially soundly financed. So, yes, it's a government program, but one without any subsidy to the homeowner on the wind part.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Virtually every piece of legislation we deal with, because this legislation has two parts, one part which will reduce an existing liability, that is, there is already out there a flood insurance liability. This bill, unanimously agreed to by all in the committee who worked on it, will reduce that in the flood part. 
   With regard to water, this will raise premiums and restrict placement. With regard to the new part, the wind part, it will create no liability, because as I have said several times, the bill strictly says that premiums will have to be actuarially sound. And CBO has certified that that is accurate. So CBO has certified this will, over time, produce no new liability on wind and save money on water.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman, and I regret to say the entertainment value of what was not an exciting subject from the beginning appears to have gone down because the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Culberson) has left the floor. I thought his method of argument, which is the frequent repetition of error at increasing volume, added a certain panache to the proceedings. But since the last time he reiterated those errors, I thought it would be useful to correct them. 
   First of all, this bill and this amendment not only doesn't add to the Federal Government's liability, it diminishes existing liability. The flood program was allowed to get deeply in debt. This bill with respect to flood says that there will be higher premiums and there will be fewer buildings in the floodplain areas. So it clearly reduces. It is supported in that respect by environmentalists and taxpayers. 
   The wind part does add a new program. It adds a new program subject to the PAYGO rules, and it requires that it be strictly actuarially sound. Now, the gentleman from Texas could not seem to understand the basic distinction. He said, ``Well, the flood program was supposed to be actuarially sound and it isn't.'' True. That is why when we did the wind program, we wrote a much more specific and binding set of instructions that it be actuarially sound. 
   The fact is that the flaws that led the water program to be in debt are corrected in this bill. That is not simply the opinion of the author, the gentleman from Mississippi, or this committee. It is CBO, the Congressional Budget Office's certification. So the notion that this adds to liability is simply wrong. It will reduce the outgo with regard to the water program. With regard to the wind program, it is actuarially sound, and in this bill, if it begins to run into deficit, the program cuts off. 
   So an analogy between the wind funding and the water funding is flatly wrong. They are written differently. We have learned from our mistakes. And that is true of this amendment, too. The gentleman has offered an amendment that would increase coverage subject, again, to the very strict rules that say we will be actuarially sound. 
   Now, I have no particular hope that this is going to sink in everywhere, but it does seem to me to be useful to have the fundamental facts out there on the record.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, this is actually a very conciliatory amendment by the gentleman from Mississippi because previously, and I know the gentleman has left the floor, he's been here very diligently, I don't mean anything critical, but the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Kingston) said why don't we try to make the private companies live up to their responsibilities and stop them from walking away. 
   This amendment is the first chance we get to do that, because what this amendment does is not extend Federal coverage, but try to hold those companies which are voluntarily participating with the Federal Government to a reasonable standard with regard to their own coverage. So this is a chance to hold the private companies to their social responsibility.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I just want to thank the gentleman for taking this up. I want to stress what we are doing. 
   People have said, well, you are giving people breaks. No. The amendment that the gentleman from California (Mr. Cardoza) offered earlier and this one deal with people who having lived somewhere, now will find themselves in a floodplain not because they moved, but because the designation is different. 
   This does not exempt them from having to pay the insurance. It does in certain cases, the gentleman from California's case. And this one that has to do with remapping, new maps or updating maps, it allows them to phase in. The result will be more people paying in and more people living in a floodplain who will be having to pay flood insurance. The remapping means there will be more restrictions on future building there. 
   I did want to stress that we did not in this bill and not in any of the amendments give any reductions to people already covered. But we have said, again, where people did not move in but found themselves where they had previously been living now included in the zone, we give people some leeway in the phasing in of the policy charge.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. And the logic is this: we have a proposal that came forward, brought forward by the gentleman from Mississippi to add a program to the National Flood Insurance Program that says that if you have national water insurance, you can, at your option, add wind insurance. Remember, no new insured are eligible here. You have to have water and then you can get wind. 
   The argument that the gentleman from Mississippi has made irrefutably on this House floor is that you simply cannot, days after a storm has damaged, try to sort out what was wind and what was water. 
   Now, unlike the flood program, the gentlewoman from Minnesota is right, the flood program is in deep debt. We inherited, from our Republican colleagues, a flood insurance program that is hurting. They had control of that program, House, Senate and President; and it went into debt. 
   As the gentlewoman says, we have a bill, and we had it last year in the House too, but not in the Senate, that makes it better. Everyone agrees that our bill, everyone who has read it agrees that our bill reduces the financial problems with flood, but it doesn't wipe them out. There's a large problem there. Billions of dollars. 
   Here's the illogic. The gentleman from Mississippi has put forward a proposal for optional wind insurance which will have to be actuarially sound. When the flood insurance program was passed, there was no PAYGO. Flood insurance is hurting. They're supposed to be actuarially sound, but it's very loose. 
   We have written into this bill, with regard to wind, requirements that it be actuarially sound, that it break even for the Federal Government, that the Congressional Budget Office certifies as perfectly good. So there is no argument possible that the wind program will add to the danger. CBO has certified that it is sound. So we have a new wind program that will be actuarially sound; CBO certifies that. And the bill says that if the program starts to run into a deficit, it cuts off. Automatic. 
   We then have the water program, which the Republicans left us as their inheritance, which is deeply in debt. They are saying that the fiscally sound wind program that's in this bill, certified by CBO, cannot go into effect until we've solved the problem they left us in the water program. They are saying that. They don't have anything to say bad about the wind program. They're saying that you can't do the wind program until you've solved the water problem. And the water problem is billions. 
   How would you solve it? 
   Well, you'd substantially raise people's premiums. 
   I should note, Mr. Speaker, that no one on the Republican side has proposed to try to make it actuarially sound. We are trying to get in that direction. But no one on the Republican side thinks it's reasonable to immediately wipe out that huge debt. 
   They don't like the wind program. They don't want to take it on head on, so they have come up with this scheme which says, the fiscally sound, CBO-certified, actuarially-legitimate wind program can't go forward until we clean up the $19 billion problem they left us in the flood program. I do not think that is very logical. 
   The gentleman from Mississippi, as I said, made the case for the wind program. So this becomes a case for the wind program. 
   Here's the deal: you're told to leave your house because a hurricane's coming. You come back a few days later and there's devastation, and you have to figure out what was caused by wind  and what was caused by water because if you have a wind policy from a private company, they will argue, in many cases, that water caused all the damage, and you are very hard pressed to find it out. 
   If you then, instead, have a combined wind and water policy from the Federal Government, you then don't have to go through this metaphysical exercise. You simply get the payment for your damages. 
   Now, that's the logical point that the gentleman from Mississippi put forward. And it is going to be, as CBO said, break even for the Federal Government. 
   So here's the recommit: the Federal Government cannot go to the aid of people facing that dilemma of trying to decide wind versus water, which has been certified as fiscally neutral by CBO, until we solve the problem that we got in the water issue. 
   It really is not a logical thing to do. It is simply a way to try to kill the wind program. A more straightforward way would have been to simply kill the wind program. I'm sorry they didn't get an amendment to do that. But they could have done that straightforwardly in the recommit. 
   So I hope that Members will vote ``no.'' The only issue here is should we initiate a voluntary program whereby people who have Federal water insurance can also get wind insurance in a manner that is certified by CBO to add nothing to the deficit, to do nothing to hurt the Federal flood insurance program, but to be actuarially sound. 
   I hope the motion is defeated.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment, the purpose of which is to let people vote against the bill without voting against the bill. What the amendment says is, we don't need the bill. There are some Members who are apparently reluctant to vote against the bill. There would be no reason to vote for this amendment in the normal course of events. What it says is that we don't need anything else. 
   Again, the effect of this amendment is exactly, exactly the same as voting ``no'' on the bill. But some Members have a problem. There are a lot of examples of excessive compensation in the minds of many. I would note that this Congress will not be making any judgment about what is or isn't excessive.  
   One amendment was offered by a Republican that would have had us differentiate based on some definition of ``excessive.'' I hope that is voted down. I don't think we should be that intrusive. What the amendment says is, we don't need a bill. Well, if you don't need the bill, you vote ``no.'' Why would you vote for an amendment that says you don't need a bill instead of simply voting ``no''? 
   The answer is, you don't want to be accused of voting ``no'' on the bill, so you vote for an amendment which has the same effect as killing the bill but is worded slightly differently. 
   I do note, and I acknowledge my colleagues on the other side agreeing, because someone said, oh, the government shouldn't get involved in this. What this does is celebrate a significant government involvement in the pay practices of corporations. What it says is that the rules issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, dominated by Republicans, run by a former Republican Member of this House as the chairman, that those rules are adequate and complete. In other words, it says, ``Those are a good thing. That's all we need.'' 
   Understand that those rules were a ``mandate,'' to use the word that has been used here, a significant mandate by the Federal Government into private corporations. It says to private corporations, we, the Securities and Exchange Commission, this was done last year, we order you against your will, because if you want to do it, you could have done it voluntarily, we order you as the Federal Government to print on every proxy form the following information in the following form. 
   I am glad they did that. I am glad that my colleagues implicitly repudiate this notion that somehow the Federal Government is not supposed to tell corporations what to do. The SEC did do that. But now the question is, what do you do with the information? 
   It is interesting. I was just shown by one of the members of the staff an article where the corporation, United Health, was asked to allow a vote, then, by the shareholders on this information which the SEC has put forward, and they said, well, that would put us at a competitive disadvantage in America because some companies would do it and some wouldn't. 
   This bill simply eliminates the competitive disadvantage. It says every corporation can do it. 
   I was asked before, why don't you leave this to the market. That's what this bill does. The market consists of the people who own the shares, who buy the shares. This bill empowers them. 
   Finally, I do want to note that my colleagues are giving a different set of arguments, my colleagues on the other side, today apparently, than Wednesday. On Wednesday, there was a lot of patriotism and a lot of talk about, let's not do what other countries do, let's stick with America. There were a lot of references to America's success in the corporate world. The gentleman from Georgia offering this amendment to kill the bill without a vote to kill the bill, says, America is doing so well, why jeopardize it? 
   So I urge Members to study the two alternative approaches. In fact, the gentleman from Georgia today says America is not doing so good, we've got to be careful; we're losing IPOs, we're losing things. The argument that we have been hearing, and he is joined by others in making it, is that we're losing them primarily to England because of the corporate practices in England. That's what the committee appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury said, or inspired by him said. That's what the McKinsey report said: England does this. 
   What we are proposing today is exactly the model that has been followed in England. If you believe what the gentleman from Georgia said, which is that we are losing financial business, I think that has been overstated, but we are losing financial business to others, and the country that we are told we are losing it to does exactly what we are doing. 
   The fact is that letting the people who own the company vote on information that the SEC has required the company to put forward as to whether or not they approve or disapprove that that's what the people they hired should be paid is not at all intrusive. It hasn't caused problems in England. We think it has had a reasonable effect in moderating corporate excesses. That is why I hope that we will vote down this amendment. 
   By the way, if this amendment is voted down, the people who don't want to vote for the bill don't have to vote for the bill. But they ought to be willing to vote ``yes'' or ``no'' on the bill and not defeated by this kind of wording which gives people a chance to vote ``no'' without standing up and doing it.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I apologize, then. I inferred that the Members on the other side were being supportive of what our former colleague, Mr. Cox, did. If, in fact, I have incorrectly assumed that my colleagues were supportive of what the Republican SEC has done, rather than simply taking account of it, I will withdraw that, and I will not impute to you approval of what Mr. Cox has done.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   First, Mr. Chairman, I look forward to the subdebate between the gentleman from Illinois and the gentleman from Georgia on the Republican side. 
   Just to recap, I said I was glad that the gentleman from Georgia, apparently on behalf of the Republicans, agreed with what the SEC did. The gentleman from Illinois took me to task and said, nothing in the amendment was approving. So I said, okay, I withdraw the notion that it was approving. 
   But then the gentleman from Georgia came back and said, it does approve. So I would urge the two of them to work that out. I would be glad to either give them the acknowledgment, as the gentleman from Georgia said, that they support it; or retract that compliment to Mr. Cox, as the gentleman from Illinois prefers. But I am confused now as to their difference. 
   As to the gentleman from Florida's amendment, it does exactly what our amendment is inaccurately accused of doing, it intrudes the Congress into the internal pay decisions of the corporation. 
   We are strictly, scrupulously, completely neutral as to how the corporations pay their CEOs and others. We simply say that the market should work, that these shareholders should decide. And the gentleman said, shareholders have that right now. They do in some places, they do in some States, they do in some corporations; they do not in others. There is no uniform, legally enforceable right for shareholders to do this; and some corporations have refused to do it. United Health Service recently refused a request from a pension fund to do that. There is no uniform right. 
   By the way, it is a matter of State law or Federal law. This notion that we are intruding on the private corporation, as they said on Wednesday, makes no sense. Private corporations are the creation of positive law, and positive law says, here are the rights and here are the duties, et cetera. 
   Indeed, the gentleman from Georgia, who, unlike the gentleman from Illinois, approves of what the SEC did, says Washington shouldn't decide. But on the other hand, he is for what the SEC did. Has the SEC decamped to Wichita when I wasn't looking? I would have thought, as chairman of the committee, if the SEC had moved out of Washington, someone would have told me. Maybe they're not getting my mail. But how can you say that Washington should tell corporations what to do and be so supportive of this SEC intervention? 
   And on the subject of intervention, what the gentleman from Florida would do, would have us say is, you have to have a shareholder vote if you have certain kinds of compensation, but you don't have to have a shareholder vote if you have other kinds of compensation. And what is the majority, and is it nonqualified deferred? It would be a far greater intrusion both substantively and procedurally than what we say. 
   We say, have a vote, let the shareholders vote. Terribly radical. Let those people who own the corporation give their opinion on what the CEO should be paid. 
   The gentleman from Florida says ``no,'' but here is the deal: Some corporations hate that. They don't want these pesky shareholders having a say on how many hundred million dollars a guy ought to get when he gets fired, so we will say ``yes'' in some cases, ``no'' in others. 
   The gentleman said we should kind of give them an incentive. Well, I don't think that is the case. I don't think Congress ought to be picking and choosing as to what is the right kind of corporate compensation and what is not the right kind of corporate compensation. But that is what the amendment does. The amendment does exactly what, as I said, our bill carefully avoids doing: It puts Congress into the decision-making process and says, if you do it the way we, Congress, think is right, you are okay; if you don't do it the way Congress thinks is right, you have a shareholder vote. 
   Now, I don't think a shareholder vote is any problem. But for those who do, if you really do, then you are intruding the Congress into that process in a way that we have sought to avoid. So I hope that the amendment is defeated.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   Let me begin with the gentleman from New Jersey's worrying that the investor might be hurt by what we would do. I guess the motto of investor in this case should be ``Stop me before I vote again.'' 
   How are we going to hurt the investor? We are going to say to those investors, You know the information that is going to be presented to you because the SEC mandated that companies do it? You get to say whether you approve or disapprove of that proposal. 
   That is going to hurt the investor? Are investors so much in need of protection from themselves that they must be prevented from voting on this? 
   This is part of the problem. It is an inversion of capitalism here. The CEOs don't own the company. The boards don't own the company. The shareholders own the company. They are the market. And all this bill does is to empower them. 
   By the way, when the gentleman from Illinois says we are rushing in, he has a very different definition of ``rushing in'' than I do. This takes effect in 2009. We, in fact, were approached by some, the Business Roundtable. They still don't like the bill.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Yes. And reclaiming my time, I will tell him what it is. If all this asks for was for the SEC to study it, I would support the amendment. And section B, ``The commission shall conduct a study,'' I would be glad to support that. Indeed, the commission could do that on its own. What I object to is a point has been made before and it is constitutional, Congress being made to wait for permission from the regulatory agency to do things. 
   So, again, and I appreciate the gentleman, but I do want to go back to the error of the gentleman from Illinois when he said we had to hit the pause button. This does not take effect until 2009. We are not rushing into anything. And we delayed the effective date at the request of the Business Roundtable so there would be no burden in paperwork on the company. 
   Between now and 2009, if the SEC wants to do a study, it can do a study. If you want to mandate that they do it, I would be glad to mandate that, although the SEC has been somewhat overworked. The difference is, and the reason I object is, this says that Congress will not go forward with what most of us on our side, and many on the other side, think is a good idea until the SEC gives us permission. I do not think constitutionally we should await permission from the regulatory agency. 
   By the way, the gentleman from Illinois, I don't understand. He wants to find an inconsistency, and when he can't find one, somehow he manufactures one. I never said the SEC was all wise and all knowing. He is caricaturing things that weren't even said. What I did was to acknowledge that the SEC has moved here and the SEC, I do want to remind my colleagues, is in Washington. All this rhetoric about no mandates from Washington is wholly inconsistent with the affirmation of the SEC's having correctly proposed the information. 
   I would also say to the gentleman from Georgia, I was not struck by the fact that he and the gentleman from Illinois differ. It has been clear to me for some time. I have been on the committee. The gentleman from Georgia and his Republican colleagues often differ, and I will say in the spirit of the French assembly ``vive la difference.'' I encourage people to differ with the gentleman from Georgia. I would hardly chide them for it.     
   What I was responding to is the gentleman from Illinois accusing me of misstating the views of the gentleman from Georgia, and I am glad the gentleman from Georgia cleared that up. 
   But back to the main point. We have until 2009. Yes, the SEC has the right to study this if it wants to. And if this was simply a mandate that the SEC study it, it would be a different story. But saying that the bill is contingent on the SEC's finding seems to me constitutionally unwise. That's why I would not support it as is, but I would support a modified version. 
   Mr. Chairman, I will yield to the gentleman from Illinois.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Let me take back my time. 
   Two points. First of all, I do want to respond to this really terrible argument that this might drive companies to go private. Do Members realize, Mr. Chairman, how viciously that attacks the CEOs? That argument says this: A CEO faced with the possibility of people voting on his or her salary will take that company private. I think that is a terrible thing to say. 
   Secondly, if the SEC makes a recommendation, we are here to listen to it. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the ayes appeared to have it.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, never has the willingness of the minority to abuse the process for purely political ends been truer than today. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill was voted on in committee in a multi-day markup. A number of amendments were offered and debated. One amendment offered by the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays) aimed directly at this point, and the language was accepted by us and is in the bill, and it says that nothing in here shall create a new fiduciary duty; and it was intended to achieve exactly what we are now told this has sought to achieve. If Members genuinely thought it was inadequate, they had the rest of the markup to try to amend it. And we are here under an open rule. If the Members thought that the bill that we had voted on and which they had every chance to amend needed further amendment, the democratic procedure, the procedure that shows respect for the process, would have been to file an amendment. Had this been an amendment, we could have debated it for more than 5 minutes. We could even have read it for more than 2. This was delivered to me about 2 minutes before we started. 
   I am not one of the more modest Members of the body, I concede. But I do not credit myself with being on my own, off the top of my head, not having practiced law ever except for the fact that I am a member of the bar, I am not able to fully analyze this. It might be something very useful. And people who are genuinely interested in adding it to the bill could have offered it in committee; they could have offered it under the open rule; we could have debated it. We have had a large number of roll calls; we just had seven roll calls. 
   Now, we have been told in the past, well, I had to do a recommit, you wouldn't give me any other chance. Members on the other side had every opportunity at the committee and in this open rule fully to debate this and to offer amendments. They chose not to. They chose instead to legislate by ambush. 
   Mr. Speaker, I had underestimated the tenderness of the feelings of the Members opposite. I confess to insensitivity, but I will not confess to the disrespect for our legislative process that Members--

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Of course not. The gentleman asked for a courtesy. Had the gentleman offered this in committee, I would have been glad to have a dialogue with him. Had he seriously wanted this amendment and offered it during the floor, we could have talked about it. But to wait until the last minute when we can't read it, to refuse to take advantage of an open rule, to refuse to offer it in committee, and now ask me to yield to you? Of course not. 
   Now, I want to emphasize again: this may or may not be good. I will guarantee the Members here will look at this. We have a way to go on this bill. It has to go to the Senate. If in fact we need further to tighten the language,  and it was the gentleman from Connecticut, Mr. Shays' amendment that we adopted that sought to do this, if the gentleman from Florida is right and Mr. Shays' was inadequate, if the gentleman from Florida is right and Mr. Shays' amendment doesn't do the job, we will analyze it seriously. But I urge Members, do not on a serious legal issue, when we have had 2 minutes to look at a complex legal principle, vote to put it into a bill when the Members advocating it deliberately refused to subject it to an open democratic process. 
   I hope this is repudiated.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   Mr. Chairman, I agree we should be debating substantively whether or not we have reached perfection in the amount of resources we have put to homeland security, and if Members on the other side think that no additional funding for homeland security is necessary, no additional border guards, no additional funding for immigration, that's their right. 
   If they have so little confidence in Secretary Chertoff and the other appointees of the Bush administration to decide what they need to administer their responsibilities, that's their right. In the Senate, they call it ``a vote of no confidence'' formally. Here the vote of no confidence in Secretary Chertoff will be the constantly repeated phrase, ``those bureaucrats,'' and apparently Members do not have any confidence in the appointees of the Bush administration. That's their right. 
   What they don't have a right to do, it seems to me, is to totally forget history. Now, we are told, and I guess I should express my admiration for so many Republicans who are fighting for the rights of others. In our society, people fight for their own rights, but we genuinely honor people who fight for the rights of others, people who are not themselves victims, but fight to protect others who have been victimized. 
   Well, a number of the Republicans are in that category. They are fighting very hard for the right to vote against earmarks. What's interesting is that many of the Republicans who over these past couple of days have been fighting for the right to vote against earmarks always vote for earmarks, and I don't just mean in overall bills. 
   The gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake) took the floor and acknowledged that he had offered 39 amendments in the last Congress to cut out earmarks and he lost 39 times. The overwhelming majority of Republicans voted 39 times against the gentleman from Arizona. So we have Republicans yesterday, and I will have the Record and we'll have the rollcall, we will have people who said you must give me the right to vote against these earmarks who then never voted against a single earmark. And that is admirable. 
   It is admirable when you, yourself, have no intention of voting against earmarks when, in fact, you are 39 for 39 in voting to keep earmarks in the bill. And by the way, one might think the gentleman from Arizona is irrational. I do not. I voted with him on a number of occasions, not the majority, but I voted with him on some. 
   The gentleman from Arizona is a careful Member. He selected the most, to him, outrageous earmarks, and we have Republicans who voted for all 39 outrageous earmarks, according to the gentleman from Arizona. The great majority of the Republican Party voted overwhelmingly to reject the earmarks that, of course, their appropriations colleagues had put in the bill. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, is that not admirable, Members who got up here and said, How dare you not let us vote against earmarks, when they themselves had no intention of doing that? This is the vegetarians rushing forward to defend the slaughter of beef cattle. This is atheists insisting that people be given a religious day of worship. 
   This is a very, very impressive display of concern for the others. These are people who themselves apparently intend to vote for every earmark that comes down the pike. They never met an earmark they didn't like, because if the gentleman from Arizona has done all of his careful research, and he's presented 39 earmarks that he thinks are particularly egregious and Members have voted against him on every one and have voted to keep all 39 earmarks, they've never met an earmark they didn't like. 
   So their insistence on delaying this bill and repeating arguments. I must say I was here all night last night. I walked in and I don't object to dilatory tactics. I object to excruciatingly boring dilatory tactics. I must say, Mr. Chairman, the Members on the other side are the least imaginative filibusterers I've ever seen. They just repeat themselves and repeat themselves, and stuff that was uninteresting and flat in the first place does not improve with age. 
   But whatever their tactics, understand they are employing them on behalf of the right of the others to vote against earmarks because it is clear that the overwhelming majority of Republicans have no intention of voting against earmarks, at least not based on the record. They not only voted for bills with earmarks, the gentlewoman from North Carolina acknowledged that earmarks had increased from 1,500 to 15,000 under Republicans, but then, of the 15,000 earmarks, when one of our most diligent Members, the gentleman from Arizona, proposes to kill 39 of the earmarks, the overwhelming majority of Republicans voted against him 39 times. 
   So, for that dedication to preserving a right that they themselves have no interest in exercising, I give them credit, for very little else, Mr. Chairman.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, rarely have the Members had so many reasons for wishing we weren't here. 
   First, it's a couple of days into what was supposed to be the time when Members can return to their districts to engage in campaigning. Members had a number of important events scheduled with their constituents, with their families, with others that have already had to be cancelled, and we are into the third day of that. 
   Secondly, Members would rather not be here because this is a tough vote. This is a vote where many of us feel that the national interest requires us to do something which is in many ways unpopular because what we are talking about, to many of us, is the need to act to avoid something worse from happening than is already happening.     
   It is hard to get political credit for avoiding something that hasn't yet happened but you think is going to happen. 
   Most of all, though, we regret being here because we all deeply regret the economic conditions which have made this decision day necessary. No one is happy that we have seen the failures that we have seen in our economic system. We differ as to whether or not those failures, as they have had a cumulative effect, require us to act. I believe it is possible to debate whether or not 2 weeks ago it was necessary to act quickly. I believe that it was. The bad news continues. There has been a lack of confidence in the financial system that is pervasive. Unfortunately, a lack of sensible regulation allowed the financial system to get itself into a position where so many people owe other people so much more money than they have or can reasonably be expected to get, that as confidence ebbs and people are called upon to make good on promises they should never have made, we face a declining cycle of activity. 
   People have said, well, you're bailing out Wall Street. The people in the financial industry who made a lot of money still have it. Their institutions may not have it, but they do. No high executive of a failed institution will be showing up soon at the unemployment office. None of them will be hurting. They will be fine personally. The people who will be hurt, in our judgment, are those who are trying to buy or sell cars, because there won't be credit for the automobile industry. There won't be ability to refinance your house or buy a house because there won't be any money there for any purchase that requires credit of any size, people will get hurt and it will have a cumulative effect. 
   Now you might have argued that the tremendous lack of confidence that is causing this over-leveraging to be a problem would not have had to be addressed a week ago. But let's remember what happened. Ten days ago, on Thursday, not far from here, in the office of the Speaker, the bipartisan congressional leadership and those of us who have leadership roles in the Financial Services and the Banking Committees were asked to meet with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. In our country, under our system, the executive has a lot of the initiative. We have an ability to shape. We have an ability to respond. But in emergency situations--let's be clear--the initiative is inevitably with the executive. And the two leading appointees of President Bush concerned with economic activities, the people the financial community looks to, came to us and said, you need to give us this authority, and if you don't give it to us very quickly, there will be a disaster. 
   We have not given it to them as quickly as they asked because we felt that we needed, even if we agreed with the premise of the need for action, that we had to make some improvements. And we have made many of them, not as many as I would like, but we have made many of them. But we were able to do that, I believe, because we have been able to show progress. 
   At all times from the time they came on Thursday night, this body has been engaged. I have been here 27, 28 years. I have never seen a piece of legislation which was so open to Member participation in which there has been so much discussion. People have said, not enough time is being spent. Well, let me say this. The hours spent on this bill exceed the hours spent on most bills. And the staffs of the committee I chair, of other committees of Members, have done extraordinary work. What we have done is substantially change what they have done, but we have been able to say at all points that we're making progress. 
   Today is decision day. I wish it weren't the case. But I am convinced that if we defeat this bill today, it will be a very bad day for the financial sector of the American economy. And the people who will feel the pain are not the top bankers and the top corporate executives, but average Americans. They don't see it yet. And pain averted is not a basis on which you get a lot of gratitude. But that is what is coming if we do not do something today, in my judgment, positive. If this bill dies, I think we get negative. 
   And again part of the reason is this--and I disagree with Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke on some policy issues. I regard them both as men of high integrity and total commitment to the national interest. And I believe they are absolutely and legitimately convinced about this. And by the way, they cannot, in my judgment, be accused of excessive pessimism. If anything, they can be accused of being too optimistic. Because you will recall that beginning with the Bear Stearns intervention, they have tried a series of interventions much less intrusive than this and they haven't worked. These are not men whose first impulse was to do something this broad. These are men whose experience was that something systemic was required because, again, of the depths of the problem. 
   Let's not forget the cause as we debate the consequence. The cause was too little regulation and the financial market getting itself into serious trouble. And now we have to, through government action, work with them to clean this up. And by the way, we have committed, I think almost everybody in this Chamber, certainly a large majority, that next year we will put in place the kind of regulations that we wish we had had before so this won't recur. So nobody needs to worry that we do this once and we will have to do it again another time and another time. We know how, I believe, to prevent this from recurring. But that doesn't help us as we deal with it today. 
   And the point is this: No matter what you thought about the crisis 10 days ago, when these two internationally respected highest officials of the Bush administration of the greatest economic power in the world come up and say, if you don't do this, we will have a crisis, then even if that hadn't been true before, they have made it more true. And I don't accuse them of doing it for that reason. That is just the reality. 
   If we repudiate George Bush's Secretary of the Treasury and Chairman of the Federal Reserve, joined as they were by previous Secretaries of the Treasury, if we repudiate them and say, nah, calm down, we'll get over it, I believe the consequences will be severe. 
   So I hope that this bill is passed. It is a first step. We have a task next year to do with regulation. We have oversight that must be done about how we got here. But here is the choice: George Bush's two chief economic officials have said to us, if you do not act, there will be terrible, negative consequences for the financial sector, and they will very soon exacerbate an economy that is already troubled, that already has 6 percent unemployment and is on track already to lose more than 1 million private sector jobs in the year. If we add to this weakened economy, and this is the headline, ``The House Repudiates Top Economic Advisers,'' there is nothing, I believe, that will then stand between us and--it's not the end of the world, this is a strong country, people will still get up the next morning and still send their kids to school, but fewer of them will be going to work. And fewer of them will be buying cars. And fewer of them will be able to refinance their homes. And the consequences will be a much more dismal near economic future for the United States. 
   So I hope the bill passes. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Yes, this reaffirms existing law, but we did it explicitly to underline its importance. There is very legitimate concern in this body on both sides of the aisle for the community banks. They are, in many cases, victims of practices from which they, themselves, abstained. 
   There is language in here that tries to give them some relief that they would get from the preferred tax situation with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Other Members have raised the question of increasing the FDIC insurance limit next year, and this one in particular on the accounting, obviously none of us want the legislative accounting. But the gentleman has raised a very important point, and yes, we agree absolutely with how he has framed it.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I think the gentleman makes a very good point. It's not anything obviously that we would legislate. I know he knows better than most, and he's not asking for that. But it is something I will join him in urging on the Federal Reserve. 
   The community banks are the innocent victims overwhelmingly of this. They were regulated. They didn't make subprime loans. By the way, they were  the ones covered by CRA. The bad loans were made by the institutions not covered by the Community Reinvestment Act. 
   But the gentleman is right. These banks play a vital function that will be even more vital as other sources dry up, and I will work with him to try to get that kind of relief.

I thank the gentleman, who comes to us with great authority here because of having chaired the committee for years and had some of this jurisdiction, and having been right when other people were resistant, he speaks with a great deal of credibility. And the answer to his question is, yes, it does require that there be consultation with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, but the Treasury Secretary is empowered to do exactly that. 
   And I would add, as the gentleman knows, in my judgment, one of the major areas of damage we will see if this bill fails is that we will start to see a real contraction in credit for automobiles. So the automobile makers and the people who sell automobiles will all be hurt. And the answer is yes to the gentleman's question.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Madam Speaker, I have mostly appreciated the kind words directed at me. I say ``mostly'' because it has been my experience here that there is often an inverse ratio between the nice things people say about you and their inclination to vote for your bill. I hope we can overcome that in this situation. 
   But I want to talk now--and we've worked on this in a compromise way, and I am proud to have worked with the whip and my ranking member counterpart and others across the ideological spectrum. And meeting a national crisis does not give any of us the luxury of doing everything we want. 
   I hope we will come back here with more votes. And if we have more votes, the next time we negotiate I'll be tougher, but you have got to accept reality. 
   I wish this was a bill that reflected more of my priorities. I wish I could eat more and not gain weight, but I have learned that acting imprudently on my wishes that cannot be realized is not helpful. But I do want to address those who share with me a commitment to dealing with people who are low on the economic spectrum. 
   Madam Speaker, I do my work, and I work on a lot of the general issues. But if there weren't poor people in this world and if we didn't have discrimination, I wouldn't be here. That's why I'm here. 
   What I have tried to do every time we've had a major bill, I'll be honest, is to use the leverage I get as chairman because there are things that everybody needs to put in for the poor people, to put in something for the people who don't otherwise get a fair shake. And sometimes there's a lot of other things in there. But I will tell my colleagues this, particularly my fellow liberals, if we aren't prepared to accept some of the things we don't like, we will not have the power to deliver for the people we care about. We do not unilaterally have the power to impose policies we would like, and therefore, a compromise is required. 
   What do we have in this bill? I've got a letter I'm putting in the Record from every liberal advocacy group--not ACORN, I want to assure my colleagues over there before they have a conniption--but every other group, the Low-Income Housing Coalition, the Legal Aid Society, National Coalition for the Homeless. And it says: ``We are writing to thank you for the inclusion of measures to protect renters.'' 
   People all over this country who rented, who didn't make an imprudent decision to buy a house, found themselves being evicted because somebody didn't pay the mortgage. We try to protect them against this. We try to keep subsidies. I tell you this, the lower-income people, the poor people, they will get nothing if we're not prepared to compromise some. 
   Secondly, we have in here--and I understood what the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich) was saying--very good language on foreclosure. Is it everything I wanted? No. But I'll tell you this, if this bill passes, we will have a Federal Government empowered to do, for the first time, significant reductions in foreclosures. Now, I don't know who's going to win in November, but I will tell you this, this will put in the hands of whoever the President is  the power to do a great deal of good. Please don't throw it out because you're unhappy with some other provisions.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. (EXPANDING AMERICAN HOMEOWNERSHIP ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I thank the gentlewoman, the Chair of the Housing Subcommittee who has worked so hard all year on a number of very important pieces of legislation. And I appreciate the kind words of the ranking member. I congratulate him on the newest addition to his extended family. And he correctly says, there is a lot in this bill that we agree with; there are some things that we disagree. 
   Now, the ranking member of the subcommittee, the gentlewoman from Illinois, the ranking member of the full committee. I should note, the gentlewoman from Illinois is no longer the ranking member of this subcommittee, she was recently moved, but she was during the pendency of this bill. They noted that last year a bill passed the House by 400 to a handful on the FHA, and that is true. And the reason is, that is the difference between us and them. 
   Last year, when they were in the majority, they came out with a bill that had some things in it that we liked, a couple things that we didn't like, so we were reasonable and conciliatory and voted for it. And now we are in the majority. And it is an odd argument to say that the bill that they passed when they were in the majority, having defeated some of our amendments, somehow now, because we were conciliatory last year and supported it, we are obligated to do the same thing. 
   The principle of deja vu all over again is not to be found in Jefferson's Manual. It is not binding. We built on what we agreed to last year and we added some things. Let me talk about where we disagree. 
   Oddly, the administration insists that when we do mortgage insurance for lower income people, we agree, that going forward, and even in fact in helping in the current crisis, FHA mortgage insurance should be available for people with weaker credit who are in the subprime category, now, if they can refinance at a steady rate in the future so they can go there in the first place. 
   But what the administration says is this: If you are a woman making $48,000 a year and your credit isn't great for a variety of reasons and you get mortgage insurance from the FHA, this administration and the approach of my Republican colleagues is to charge her more than any Member of this House would be charged for the same mortgage insurance, because what they say is, we will extend it to people with weaker credit, but we will charge them more, because people with weaker credit are likely to default. It is true people with weaker credit are likelier to default, but should everybody be penalized financially because some people with weaker credit will default? 
   What we say is, if you are in that higher risk category and you go forward and make your payments on time, you should be refunded that money after 5 years automatically, 3 years at the discretion of HUD. 
   So I reject the notion that we should make the person in the lower credit category who conscientiously makes her payments be the one who has to bear the cost of a loan loss rate that is higher for people like her. That is not her fault. 
   Secondly, we have in here tougher restrictions than last year on the ability of HUD to raise FHA rates. Members will note, the FHA has been making a surplus recently, and the administration likes that and they can use that to put into the general budget so Housing and the FHA subsidize the rest of the budget. And a couple of times on a fully bipartisan basis, through the appropriators and through our committee, we have written to HUD saying, no, don't do that. Don't raise FHA fees when you are already making a profit. 
   This bill, in fact, reduces the ability of HUD to raise fees unless they can document that they are going to go in the red, and that is one of the differences. If you vote for a substitute, you will be voting for a weaker set of restrictions on HUD's ability to raise FHA fees. That is why the home builders and the realtors have generally been supportive of the approach that we are taking, because we don't want HUD to have the freedom to raise the fees just to make a surplus for the rest of the government and make homeowners do that initial surplus. 
   In addition, by the way, we take the cap off home equity mortgages, and that is what generates the money. We don't generate the money for the affordable housing fund here by raising fees on mortgage insurance in general; in fact, we restrict HUD's ability to do that. We do take the cap off mortgage insurance. So what we are saying is, there will be more home equity mortgages granted. And, in fact, we put a restriction on the fee that can be charged by those who originate them. Not in the minority's substitute, I believe. And we say that extra money that comes not from raising anybody's fees but increasing the volume is what we can use for affordable housing. We also say that you should raise the limit. 
   Now, the administration had been opposed to it and they are parading it some but I believe not enough. We now have a situation in which the market is telling us that they will not do mortgages if they go above the FHA-GSE limit. And what this bill does is, A, to raise the limit based on the regional variation in house prices, but, in addition, says to the Secretary of HUD: If  the market freezes up as it now does, you have discretion, the discretion of the Secretary of HUD, to do a temporary increase in the limits. And I think that is a reasonable approach. 
   Finally, the Affordable Housing Trust Fund. Be very clear. Look at the bill. Not a penny can go to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund under the legislation before us today until the Secretary of HUD certifies that the FHA fund is fully solvent. That is, there is no way under this bill that a penny can go to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund if it would in any way cause an increase in FHA mortgage insurance or in any way jeopardize the fund. 
   The question is, if there is a surplus generated by the mortgage insurance rates, and remember, we are saying to HUD you can't charge as much as you want to. So at the lower rate we impose and with the increase in the volume of home equity mortgages that generates a surplus, does it go into the Treasury to do as they wish or can we set it aside for an affordable housing program? And for the first time, because you do not have now a lot, there are a lot of HUD programs, but there aren't any now that help build family affordable housing. We have some for the elderly; HUD tries to cut it. We have some for the disabled; HUD tries to cut it. We do not have a general program for helping to build affordable family housing, and that is what this bill would do. But only if by raising revenue. And, by the way, when we increased it, there was an odd statement in which they said don't raise the upper limit, have the program be focused on the lower income people. They are not competitive. 
   In fact, raising the upper limit makes money for the FHA. CBO has told us that when you raise the limit, that is a profit for FHA. In fact, raising the limit at the top is one of the reasons why we can avoid charging the people with weaker credit more, which the FHA wants to do, because we recycle some of that profit that they will make from right in the upper end into helping offset the higher loan loss rate from people at the lower end. 
   So the notion that in any way we are deteriorating our ability to help the moderate people is just nonsense. It is literal nonsense. Because raising the upper limit, all it does is provide more funds which can be used, because the alternative, and again this is in the Bush administration's approach: Yes, we will extend credit to people with weaker credit, but we will charge those individuals more than somebody who is richer even if that individual is making the payment. I don't think that is appropriate for the Federal Government. 
   There has been a lot of bipartisan cooperation on this bill. There were a couple amendments offered. One amendment is jointly offered by myself and the gentleman from California (Mr. Miller). There are amendments offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Tiberi) which we think is a good idea. Mr. Miller has another one dealing with down payment assistance. Mr. Tiberi's deals with the question of counseling. We are supportive of those. There is a great deal of bipartisanship here. 
   The realtors and home builders, two of the private sector groups strongly committed to helping with homeownership and home building, support this bill and support our versions of it. All the consumer groups, the people who advocate for low income housing do. I hope that the bill is adopted. There are some amendments that would kill it. I will say there is an amendment to strike the funds for the Affordable Housing Fund. 
   Members might want to check. A virtually identical amendment was offered during the appropriations bill to prohibit any FHA money from going there. It was defeated by 2-1. It was a very large vote on this side, obviously, but a significant vote on the other side. We have debated all these issues. I hope by the end of the day we will send the FHA bill through. 
   And let me just close by saying I welcome what the administration did. We are moving closer. I hope by the end of today we will have sent this bill to the Senate, along with the GSE bill. And I have spoken to Secretary Paulson and I have spoken with Members of the Senate. If the Senate will then take up the GSE bills and the FHA bills, I know there are differences, we want a signature on both bills. We will have a genuine three-sided conference; ourselves, both parties; the Senate, both parties; the Secretary of Treasury, the Secretary of HUD. And I believe if the Senate will act well before Thanksgiving, we can have a good package in which the GSEs and FHA are made sounder and more solid and better able to serve the people.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman, and I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois. She is absolutely right. If I thought this would in any way impinge on our ability to help middle- and lower-income people, I would be opposed to it. In fact, if this works as we believe it will work, it will be the opposite. Because CBO has consistently scored, we haven't had this particular amendment scored, but prior amendments that have raised the limit at which the FHA can operate have been scored by CBO as generating a surplus, a positive number. That is some of the money that we are going to use. As the gentlewoman knows, while there is some controversy about this thing, we significantly increase in this bill the amount for counseling, because if there had been proper counseling, a lot of people wouldn't have been stuck at pre-prime. The counseling is aimed at people in the lower brackets. This is part of the money for it. 
   I would be willing, when we get to conference, to say, if, in any way, this would appear to be impinging on the ability to do the rest of the mission, we would cut it off. But the way it is going to work, it will, in fact, generate a surplus which we intend to use to help precisely the people whom the gentlewoman refers to.  
   I thank the gentleman. I appreciate his advocacy of this. He has been one of those who, from California, has been most vigorous in reminding us of the need to do it.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Madam Chairman, I did want to ask a question of the gentleman from New York. I have a concern about his amendment, only because it does not seem to me to go far enough. 
   One of the things we have tried very hard to do in our committee is to end what has been a kind of discrimination against manufactured housing, because if we are going to get to more people being able to own homes without getting into a subprime type of situation where people are induced to borrow more than they should, manufactured housing should be part of it. 
   The gentleman's amendment is properly, from his standpoint, addressed to a situation in his own district where fixed-foundation housing is involved. But my question here would be, and I realize it is under the rule not possible to change the amendment now, but I would have this question: If his amendment would be adopted, if as the process went forward some of us were able to work to expand this so it wasn't limited to fixed foundation, would the gentleman from New York have any objection to that? 
   And I will yield to him.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Thank you, Madam Chairman. 
   We have been debating this. It is a legitimate issue. We debated it when the gentleman from Georgia offered a version of it in the appropriations bill. We debated it previously. We debated a similar argument when we had the GSE bill. 
   The gentleman says there are 80 HUD programs and HUD money has gone up. The major reason the HUD funding has gone up, the single biggest one, has been in the section 8 rental program. There is a problem with section 8. Section 8 adds equity. But the current section 8 program provides rental assistance for one year at a time. No one can build affordable housing based on an annual grant. So what section 8 does, while it does provide some equity and I have been supportive of it, it increases the demand for housing without increasing the supply. 
   So in the current formation of Federal policies, the Federal Government puts upward pressure on rentals in the moderate- and low-income areas, because we give people billions of dollars to rent apartments in a way that does not lead to any construction. 
   This tries to make it a more balanced program. This and the GSE bill take money to begin the process of constructing affordable housing, which in the end could save us money, because it will then say that the rental levels which section 8 is driving up will no longer be driven up. 
   The gentleman says it is going to be a tax on the FHA. In fact, I hope the gentleman, given his concern about a tax on the people who get mortgage insurance from the FHA, will vote against the amendment to be offered by the gentlewoman from Illinois, because in this bill, unlike the gentlewoman's amendment, we have very tough restrictions on HUD's ability to raise the FHA fund unless it is necessary for solvency. 
   In a bipartisan basis last year, we wrote to them and we did it in the appropriations bill, because HUD was being told by OMB, not HUD, HUD made it very clear, this was an OMB directive, raise the FHA fees because FHA isn't contributing enough to the budget. 
   We put into our bill's restrictions, we have a restriction in our bill on the amount that can be charged for home equity mortgages by the originators. It is not in the gentlewoman from Illinois's amendment. We put caps on the FHA. So exactly the opposite is the case. And as far as this is concerned, the bill specifically says that no money can go to the Housing Trust Fund until the HUD Secretary has certified that the fund will be totally solvent and this will not endanger it. 
   The money that would go to affordable housing does not come from raising anybody's fee. It comes from an increase in volume. We capped the fees. I want to emphasize this. In the bill that we have, as opposed to the gentlewoman from Illinois's substitute, there are two separate restrictions on FHA's ability to raise fees that she doesn't have. 
   What we do is the law now says FHA can only do 65,000 home equity reverse mortgages a year. We say, no, there is no reason for that limit. We say do as many as the market will bear, with a restriction on what can be charged. 
   That is what generates the money. It is an increase in volume at a lower price to the consumer that generates the money; and if that increased volume and the lower price to the consumer results in there being a surplus that we can spend to build rental housing, as long as HUD certifies that that would not in any way require any increase in the FHA, we say, go ahead.     
   As to affordable housing, there is a severe crisis in rental housing in this country, and you had some of the people pushed into subprime situations because there wasn't enough rental housing. We think the Affordable Housing Trust Fund helps deal with that. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

He is against Federal programs that help build affordable housing; I understand that. By the way, this is not, of course, the old forms of public housing. This is going to be a private corporation. 
   But I would say to my friends on the other side, I don't think that you can argue both that we already have enough programs to do this and that we shouldn't have any at all. In fact, we do not now have programs that help build family affordable housing. We think in cooperation with the private sector, and the gentleman mentions the market, every private market entity, the Realtors, the home builders who are involved in construction in the private market, support the creation of the housing fund.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Madam Chairman, I congratulate the gentleman's dexterity, on his ability to go 180 degrees opposite on his argument mid-amendment. 
   He started out saying we can't do this because it will jeopardize the FHA. We point out that in the bill that couldn't happen. This bill says this money cannot be used if it would in any way jeopardize an FHA situation. So he says okay, let's take the surplus and put it into the regular budget. That is a debate. Do we take surplus and put it into the budget to detract from other spending? I don't think so. I guess the question is this. If you take out an FHA mortgage and get mortgage insurance, and if our bill doesn't pass, this administration will raise that fee to make more money, should that go to the war in Iraq and for contractors in Iraq who are wasting money? Or should it go to build affordable housing in our cities, because that is where the money is going. The money is not going to reduce the deficit; it is going to be wasted elsewhere. 
   What we say is this. We should be building affordable housing. Some Members say don't give money to the States. No, I think that is a very good way to go. I think the States and the localities are best able to respond, and I hope the amendment is defeated.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I would say to my friend from Ohio, and we have worked together on a lot of things, I understand his purpose is a good one, but I share some of the concerns of the gentlewoman from Illinois. 
   I hope the gentleman understands that if this becomes part of the bill, as I believe it will, we haven't had a chance to consult with the FHA. We would like their advice. We could wind up strengthening the urging but allow for some exceptions. I would hope as we went forward the gentleman could work with us on doing that.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. If the gentlewoman would continue to yield, there are some differences that we have of an ideological sort. There are a lot of general areas of agreement. Mr. Montgomery, the head of the FHA, has been, I think, a responsible and thoughtful administrator of the program. We have a common interest in this, and I would look forward to having him in on this conversation with us, and I think we can move in that direction with some of the flexibility that the gentlewoman asked for.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   The gentlewoman, incredibly, says this will jeopardize the solvency of the fund if we put money into affordable housing. I thought reading was one of the basic things we did around here. In the bill it says nothing can go to the Affordable Housing Fund if it would jeopardize solvency. Simply denying plain facts is not an appropriate way to debate. 
   In much of her argument she talks about another piece that represents the difference between us. We say that if you are someone with a weaker credible, a lower FICO score, the great god, FICO, that governs the lives of lower-income people, if you get your mortgage insured and you work hard and make all your payments, you should still be charged more than the gentlewoman from Illinois or I would be charged for a mortgage, because that is the insurance principle. 
   It is an appropriate principle for a private insurance company. For the Federal Government to say to hardworking people who are making their payments that they will be held accountable for the fact that other people didn't make their payments, and I won't be and the gentlewoman from Illinois wouldn't be, that is not appropriate. 
   So this principle of, yes, they say if you are healthy, you shouldn't get your money back, if you work hard and make your mortgage payments, why should you be charged more because somebody else like you defaulted? Let's all share that burden. 
   The gentlewoman said, well, it will be hard to give lower-income people loans. Those are crocodile tears. You are going to help these lower-income people by making them pay more for their mortgage than we would pay. 
   I would also note, and I wasn't in charge of the drafting, but we did adopt several amendments today. The gentlewoman's amendment would, of course, wipe all of them out because it would go back to last year's bill. 
   I understand there is regret on the part of many of my colleagues at the results of last November's election, and it is appropriate to try to undue last year's election. The appropriate time to do that is in next November's election, not by bills that passed a year ago with a differently constructed House and say let's not make any changes. 
   We made changes to accommodate refinancing for people caught in the subprime crisis. That is in this bill. It is not in the gentlewoman's substitute. Taking a year-old bill, with none of the improvements we have made, it goes beyond the philosophy. 
   Now, I understand Members don't want to do an affordable housing fund. That was the gentleman from Texas's amendment. I oppose it. That one makes some sense in terms of ideological division. But to say let's ignore everything that has happened in the last year, amendments adopted here today, several amendments by Members of both parties, the gentleman from California (Mr. Gary G. Miller); the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Tiberi); the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Tierney); the gentleman from New York (Mr. Bishop). We adopted their amendments. The gentlewoman wants to wipe them out. That is not an appropriate way to legislate. 
   I hope that the amendment is defeated, that we do not say in particular  that if you are someone in a lower-income category and you make your mortgage payments, the Federal Government will charge you more. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I think the gentlewoman confused a couple of issues. When I talk about not charging someone more because she has a lower credit score, and it is often a ``she'' that is in that category, it is not the no-down-payment category. What the bill does that the gentlewoman has is to say if you are someone with a lower credit score and get a loan with a down payment, you get charged more even if you make your payments. 
   By the way, the bill that she would replace with last year's bill would also knock out several protections we have in this bill against FHA fees being raised. The FHA doesn't want to raise fees. OMB has ordered FHA to try to raise fees. Congress has had to intervene. 
   There are in our version, unlike the version the gentlewoman is offering, protections against fee increases. We have an amendment that was advocated by the gentlewoman from Florida, Ms. Ginny Brown-Waite, and the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Marshall, to limit the amount that can be charged to older people taking out reverse equity mortgages. That is in the bill that the gentlewoman wants to displace, and she would displace it with a bill that has no such protection for older people. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   The gentlewoman has quite honestly joined this one issue. She says it is the principle of insurance. If you are healthy, you should pay less for insurance than if you are sick. That is not the principle we follow in the Federal Government. That is the point the gentlewoman misses. 
   Yes, if you go to a private company, they will do that. You don't pay more in a Medicare premium if you are sick than if you are healthy. That is apparently what the gentlewoman is advocating, that senior citizens who are sick should pay more premiums than senior citizens who are healthy. 
   The question is whether a principle that is necessary in a private insurance scheme is appropriate for the Federal Government. She says just because you are low income doesn't mean you have poor credit. True. Not in every case. She knows there is a correlation; that the weaker the credit, the likely the people are to have low income. She, again, is saying explicitly that she believes, and she doesn't deny it, that it is the principle of insurance. 
   You are a working woman making in the forties, you get FHA insurance, you make all your payments, and you have got weaker credit than somebody who serves in Congress and makes $180,000 a year. You have to pay more, according to the gentlewoman, than I would pay, even if you made all your payments. 
   What we are saying is at the outset it may be that you want to charge more. Yes, we will give FHA the ability to do that upfront. But you can earn your way out of that. If you have weaker credit, but you work hard, you are diligent and you make your payments, why should the Federal Government charge you more than someone far wealthier than you? 
   The gentlewoman is wrong to think that is the precedent. In the health insurance field and the Federal Government field, if you are under Medicare, you don't pay more in Medicare premiums if you were sick than if you were healthy. This is what we are saying, that you should not charge people more. 
   I would also point out, again, that she said we don't want to raise fees to people. Our bill limits what the FHA can be forced to charge by OMB. We have three separate provisions. I will point out again to the gentlewoman, we adopted a provision, there were negotiations between AARP and the originators of the home equity mortgages, the services, and we have in there a reduction, we put a cap on. We cut by one-third the maximum fee elderly people can be charged for an FHA-insured home mortgage.     
   We reduced the fee that elderly people can be charged by one-third. The gentlewoman's amendment, it is not her fault, she is not gratuitously trying to hurt older people; she just picked up this old amendment from a year ago, this old bill, and offered it without taking into account the progress we have made. That is not a good way to legislate. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Madam Chairman, let me ask the gentlewoman from Illinois: If someone has weaker credit and gets mortgage insurance but makes all the payments for 5 years, why does the gentlewoman think that she should be charged more? And how does it hurt the FHA's ability to go forward if, after someone has  made the payments for 5 years, she gets refunded the extra? I would yield to the gentlewoman to answer that question, a fundamental difference on the bill.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. No. Answer the question. They are not refunded under your bill. They are under, the gentlewoman would not refund them. How does it hurt the FHA in their ability to lend to people with weaker credit if they say to people with weaker credit, if you make your payments for 5 years, we will refund the extra we charged you?

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I take back my time because the gentlewoman is simply, I understand her answer. It is, if there is a higher loan loss rate from lending to lower-income people, people with weaker credit, they have to subsidize each other. 
   We say, no; raise the jumbo limit, and let those people in California and Massachusetts and New York who are getting mortgages at $600,000 and $500,000, let them subsidize it. Nobody is subsidizing. You shouldn't have to subsidize if you are making your own payments.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I ask the Members to follow closely because there are some unusual twists and turns even to this. 
   In the first place, the gentleman talked about people getting FHA loans who weren't here legally, and he made a big point of that. As he later acknowledged, the bill, as reported, already deals with that. 
   The gentleman from Georgia is so enamored of this amendment that he's offering it twice to this bill. Now, he's making up for the fact that last week he wanted to offer it and couldn't. The gentleman from Georgia had filed in the Congressional Record a version of this amendment to offer to the Native American housing bill to prevent illegal immigrant Native Americans from sneaking in. And when we pointed that out, the gentleman from Georgia for once thought better of it and didn't offer the amendment. I think he was afraid that the Indians would have said, you know, sir, that's a good idea, why didn't we think of it? 
   But now, in the amendment, the gentleman offered this amendment in committee, so the illustration he gave of how they are getting FHA loans when they shouldn't, that's already in the bill. What he has done now is to say that this should apply to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, which is not created by this bill. The bill does say that if we later, on the floor of this House, created an affordable housing trust fund, funds from the FHA excess, if there are any, will go into it. So there is plenty of time when we deal with the Affordable Housing Trust Fund. 
   So last week he couldn't offer the amendment to keep the illegal immigrants out of the Navajo housing. This week, he's already got it in the bill that covers the bill before us, but he has now got amendment envy in the worst way, so he's going to offer it to a program that doesn't exist yet, preempting our chance to do it. Even that wouldn't be a problem except that he could have said ``forthwith.'' He said ``promptly.'' It doesn't kill the bill; it significantly delays it. 
   If this comes back to the Committee on Financial Services, it is now wide open. The committee then has a markup, and any amendment can be offered. And I will tell my colleagues that there are Members, yes, there is your indication of what will happen, this will be filibustered again. Thank you for your honesty. I appreciate it. If this bill comes back to committee, it will be wide open. 
   We are in the midst of a crisis. The President said last month, please pass the FHA bill promptly. Even the United States Senate is now acting on this bill. If it comes back to committee, I have 3 days to notice a markup. How quickly could we do it? Well, I don't think I can have this markup on Yom Kippur. There may be a lot to atone for in this amendment, but I can't have it on Friday. 
   So we go over to next week. We have markups scheduled next week on HOPE VI and on flood insurance and other important issues, so we couldn't get to this for a couple of weeks. And then when we do get to it, the clappers over there are going to offer a whole bunch of amendments. 
   Now, if the gentleman just wanted to put this into the program that doesn't yet exist, and that he will have a chance to do it later, he could have said ``forthwith.'' Members are asked, when they rise on a recommit, are you opposed to the bill? The gentleman from Georgia honestly answered that he is. And he used the choice he had to substantially delay this bill. No, not kill it, but this will delay this bill by several weeks in the midst of this subprime crisis. 
   I would say to Members, preventing the FHA loans from going there, that's already in the bill. Read pages 54 and following. The Affordable Housing Trust Fund, it will be created later. I'm sure the gentleman will offer that amendment again and you will have a chance to vote on it. 
   So the sole effect of voting for this recommit is substantially to delay the bill on the FHA because the program that the bill covers, this amendment applies already from the committee. And the program that he would apply it to is not yet in existence and won't be in existence until we vote. 
   And for Members who worry about some cheap shot ad that says, oh, well, ``promptly,'' ``forthwith,'' too complicated, I hope people don't vote for this amendment. Many of them will. You will have a chance to vote for it. Long before the next election, the gentleman from Georgia will have offered this amendment four more times, at least. We've got more bills in our committee, and so you will have the chance to vote for it. 
   Please, if you support the low-income Housing Trust Fund as a concept and want the funding available when we set it up, if you support, in particular, the President's request that we move promptly to let the FHA be available for the subprime crisis, do not vote for a recommit whose sole effect will be to delay for several weeks passage of this bill. It won't kill it, but a several-week delay. I've got to hold off and call the hearing, we have to then have a long markup, they will be offering more amendments. It will substantially delay a very important bill, and I hope Members will defeat it.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, this is a bipartisan bill that passed our committee unanimously. It addresses a series of glitches which have resulted in the communities of Alton and Granite City, Illinois, losing their status as entitlement communities under the community development block grant program. 
   These are both cities that have done a very good job of using these funds. There is no reason why they should not continue to be allowed to enjoy this. The events which led to this having happened are complicated, and even more relevant, quite boring, so it does not seem to me that the House would much care about them. 
   The relevant point is that there is a unanimous view on the part of our committee, and this has been urged on us by the gentlemen from Illinois, Mr. Shimkus and Mr. Costello, that we  should restore Alton and Granite City to their rightful places as entitlement cities, and I hope the House will do that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, this is a very important resolution. It is an appropriate noting of the anniversary, 20-year anniversary, of the passage of the Homeless Assistance Act. It marked the beginning of a formal Federal recognition of the problem of homelessness; it's a great paradox, and one of which we should be embarrassed in this country. 
   It may not seem obvious to people, but before this, certainly 25 years ago and beyond, the homeless population was an invisible one. And it was in the 1980s that people began to focus on it. 
   Two former Members of this body, both of whom sadly died younger than should have been the case, while still in their fullness of powers as Members of this body were among the first to recognize it, and it was bipartisan. The former Member from Connecticut, Stewart McKinney, whose successor will be speaking on behalf of this very shortly, was one of those who began it. And he was joined in his advocacy by the late Bruce Vento from St. Paul. And they were two men of great compassion and vision. They were skilled legislators who served on the committee as it was then called on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs, and they insisted that we, as a body, in this very wealthy Nation, address the terrible tragedy of people who were homeless, including children and war veterans. 
   A number of things contributed to the homelessness issue. There were some trends in this society, and often we hear about unintended consequences. There were some trends that in themselves were welcomed that had these negative consequences. One was the improvement in urban areas, the transformation of many downtowns in our big cities from places that were considered not very attractive places in which to live to places that people wanted to live in, the phenomenon known as gentrification. 
   The area that I represented when I was in the State legislature in the 1970s in Boston, in downtown Boston there were boarding houses, rooming houses in many of the downtown parts of Boston. Most of those are now much more expensive housing. They are single-family homes or condominiums. That, from the standpoint of the city, I suppose, is an improvement. But many of those who lived there were priced out of the market and, in many cases, found no alternative housing. 
   We also had the movement of deinstitutionalization, of deciding that people with various problems, emotional and mental problems, that it was better to try to get them integrated into communities than to have them living forever apart in institutions, and on the whole that was a very positive step. But no major social policy happens perfectly. The combination of the upgrading economically of these downtowns, of the release of people from institutions, these contributed to the homeless problem.     
   There are, of course, other problems. Vietnam veterans who came back from a war that they didn't ask to start, who were sent by this country to this difficult country and came back to a country that treated them poorly, that did not honor their commitment and the sacrifice of their time and of their health. And in combination with substance abuse, all of these came together. 
   At any rate, 20 years ago we recognized that we had this problem, and we have begun to deal with it. And this resolution is a tribute to the two far-sighted men who led this fight; to the many, many people who have worked to try to provide a solution to homelessness; to the homeless themselves, fellow citizens of all ages and races and backgrounds who have had to cope with these difficulties, some because of their own failings, often because of no thing that they did wrong but because of circumstances in which they found themselves. In any case, we ought to deal with it. 
   And this resolution is also very thoughtful, and I call attention to the ``whereases.'' Whereases, to be candid, Mr. Speaker, are often unemployment. They are filler. But in this case the whereases make some very important points, and one in particular I want to address. It talks about the vulnerable groups that are included. Another one talks about the veterans who are involved. That is, this makes clear that we are dealing with people who have a very legitimate claim on our response. In addition, the resolution itself goes beyond really congratulating people for the work they did and deploring the continued existence of homelessness, but it makes some very specific policy recommendations, which, Mr. Speaker, the Committee on Financial Services will be responding to and has already begun to respond to. 
   For example, in the resolution, clause 6 says that we recognize ``that the lack of affordable housing exacerbates homelessness in the United States.'' That may seem to state the obvious, but the obvious may have been stated but hasn't been acted on. We have not done nearly enough to produce affordable housing. Homelessness requires shelter; it requires services. But it requires, more than anything else, homes for people. Affordable housing, also rental housing, but it requires housing. 
   The resolution supports the continued efforts of Federal, State, and local governments in their efforts to prevent and end homelessness through the development of affordable housing. It was not an accident that the gentleman from Connecticut who succeeded Mr. McKinney will be soon speaking on this, is a member of our committee, and is a cosponsor with many of us on legislation that will actually return the Federal Government to the job of producing affordable housing. 
   So I welcome this resolution for what it commemorates but also for what it commits this Congress to do. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I again note that this is not simply words. Words are important and the work of Bruce Vento and Stewart McKinney, two outstanding Members of Congress, ought to be recognized. The fact that we are talking here about veterans, about children, about other populations that we all want very much to help, they are important. But I want to stress again this is also a commitment for the Committee on Financial Services. I know I speak for the chairwoman of the Housing Subcommittee, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters), and my colleague here. 
   And I want to again point to clauses 6 and 7 of the resolution. The resolution ``recognizes that the lack of affordable housing exacerbates homelessness in the United States,'' and No. 7, ``supports the continued efforts of Federal, State, and local governments and private nonprofit organizations in their efforts to prevent and end homelessness through the development of affordable housing.'' 
   The services that are provided, the shelter, the counseling, they are all absolutely essential. But so is a commitment by this very wealthy Nation to help build affordable housing. And if we were not to make that commitment, then the resolution would, I think, be an empty one. 
   So I look forward to the Committee on Financial Services working together in a bipartisan way to continue to bring to this floor, and I hope ultimately to the desk of the President, and, more important, ultimately to the streets of our cities and rural areas in this country the housing that is needed. This is a promise that we are going to go forward with building affordable housing, and it is a promise that we fully intend to keep.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   I was confused, Mr. Speaker, because I had to go up to the Rules Committee and I came back and I heard the gentleman from California saying stop throwing money at the problem, that's not the way to solve the problem. And when I think about what we're throwing money at, I assumed we were talking about the Defense bill and Iraq and reconstruction, because so much money has been thrown at that, none of us can keep track of it. Then it turns out he's talking about a relatively small increase in CDBG. I certainly agree we should not solve problems by throwing money at them. That, however, led me to think we must be talking about the bill that spends so much more money than anything else and that has had more documented waste and abuse and fraud, the Defense bill and the Iraq spending, than all the other appropriations bills put together. 
   As to this bill, now that I know what we're talking about, not to be taken for granted on the floor of this House, I want to be congratulate the gentleman from Massachusetts for doing an excellent job with the limited resources he was given, far too limited. 
   There is an increase in here for the Community Development Block Grant program. The President apparently wanted to continue his path of reducing Community Development Block Grants, having them be lower than they were years ago when he came into office. In fact, that is a very important program for our municipalities, and I am very pleased to see that it is not being reduced. 
   As to section 8, every year when the Republicans were in power, we would approach the point when we were running out of section 8s. And as a member of the committee that has the authorization role here, we would hear from Members, Democratic and Republican, about the importance of keeping this going. Now, I agree it should be improved. And what we have done here in this House, we began something last year but we finished it this year and sent it to the Senate. We passed a bill we called SEVRA, the Section 8 Voucher Reform Act. So, yes, we think there should be reform. This House has passed on a bipartisan basis, support from everybody in the authorizing committee, a bill to improve it. So we are trying to make things better. And I guarantee you that you will not find anywhere under HUD, and I know a lot about that department, anything like the wanton expenditure waste that we have seen in Iraq and elsewhere. 
   What the gentleman from Massachusetts has done in the housing area is sensibly to respond to important needs. I particularly want to say earlier this year, the Secretary of HUD, Secretary Jackson, asked me to meet with a group called ADAPT. These are people who represent people with disabilities. They were concerned about the availability of section 8 vouchers for people with disabilities, particularly those who may have been turned away from public housing projects. In response to that, in collaboration, the bill we have today increases that pool of vouchers. Now, they're not earmarked for that group, and we will have further conversations about how to deal with that, but there are additional vouchers here that the Secretary of HUD came to me and said, look, will you listen to this group and try to respond? And these are vouchers that respond to their needs. 
   I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts. I wish he was able to throw money at the problem. I wish we had a set of priorities in this country that were more respectful of genuine human needs. But given the limited resources he has, he and his subcommittee have done an excellent job.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I thank the gentlewoman who has been the spark plug here. I think it is an important day, that we are dealing in a rational way with credit card legislation. 
   I appreciate the reasonable tone of my friend from Delaware. We disagree some. I don't think anyone could reasonably characterize this as some assault on the free enterprise system. It  understands the importance of credit cards and tries to work within that framework. 
   It is important to note that what this bill does is essentially protect consumers against retroactive unfairness. When it comes to rate setting, this bill, to the disappointment of some, doesn't limit future rates. As far as the future is concerned, if proper notice is given, this bill is not restrictive. It does deal essentially with retroactivity and with honoring the consumers' wishes. 
   The thing I want to address is one thing which seems to be a little upside down, and that is we should defer to the Federal Reserve. I want to say to some of my Republican friends, that sounds a little odd to me after hearing for years that the people must be allowed to decide, that we shouldn't defer to unelected bureaucrats. The notion that we, the elected Representatives, should defer to the Federal Reserve not on monetary policy but on a public policy matter involving what institutes fairness with credit cards, it is not an argument that I have often heard on that side. 
   Now I understand there is nothing in the Constitution or the rules of the House that requires consistency, but I would hope we would at least note there is an element of convenience in the invocation of this argument at this point, let's defer to the Federal Reserve. No, let's exercise the powers given to us under the Constitution. And there has been a lot of talk about the Federal Reserve doing too much. Well, I think sometimes they have to act because we don't. But here we are willing to do it. 
   But again, I want to stress the reasonableness of these proposals. They deal with retroactivity and unfair billing practices. If a credit card company follows the rules set here, they are not prohibited or restricted going forward with setting whatever conditions they think ought to be set. That, I think, is the essence of fairness, and I hope the bill is passed. I again congratulate the gentlewoman from New York for taking the lead.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I will claim the remaining time on behalf of the Financial Services Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a composite package. The President some time ago, a couple of weeks ago, urgently asked the Congress to send him several pieces of legislation, three in particular. One is embodied in the part of the bill that came out of the Ways and Means Committee.  
   Two, in fact, had previously passed the House from our committee, the bill reforming the government sponsored enterprises--and that came out of our committee and on the floor in a form that the administration mostly liked--and the bill to modernize the FHA. 
   In fact, the Senate then acted on the bill to modernize the FHA. We went into conference, we ran into some difficulty. Not a formal conference, but a conversation. What we have done because, as we know, the Senate is in a situation where procedurally it's often harder for them to act, so we are acting on the basis of a Senate bill. 
   We are readopting today two of the pieces we already adopted, reforms of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the FHA modernization. I think it ought to be noted that in both cases they are a recognition by the President that the private sector needs to be able to cooperate with public or quasi-public entities to get the job done. 
   Those who take the philosophy that the market alone is sufficient unto itself, and that public sector intervention will do more harm than good clearly have been repudiated. 
   The FHA is a government agency. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government creations with both public and private aspects. It is clear that we need both of them if we are to get out of this current crisis in mortgage lending and be able to go forward in a healthy way. 
   There is one new element today. That is a bill that our committee voted on last week and the week before. We had a markup. It was suggested to us in many ways by some of the regulators. In its essential form it was endorsed last Monday by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and we worked closely with his staff. The administration had an objection to one major piece of an auction mechanism. That's the longer part of the bill. What it says is that holders of loans, not the lenders, because the lenders have unfortunately long since been able to sell off their loans in many cases--and that's part of the problem--if the holders of loans will write down the amount due them in the principal, and if they get to a point below the current value of the home, in many cases these homes have lost value from when they were first mortgaged, and the borrower can be reasonably expected to repay it, we will broaden the right of the FHA to make a case-by-case determination, provide a guarantee so that can then be financed and resold to the secondary market. 
   It's entirely voluntary on the part of the lender. The lender will retain the right to foreclose. In many cases we believe that it will pay the lender not to foreclose. 
   In fact, we have legislation in this package sponsored by the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kanjorski) that will ensure servicers who are willing to write down the amounts, that they will not be sued if they write down those amounts to a reasonable level. We think that is very helpful. Again, it's voluntary. 
   We do believe that knowing if you write this down to a reasonable level, accepting your loss, you will be able then to at least get some guarantee of that to help stabilize the situation. But people should understand, there is not $1 of taxpayer money going to writing down that loan. The holders of the loans have to write it down. 
   Secondly, the borrower can then go to the FHA if the borrower can pay the new loan, but there is no taxpayer money that will go to help pay off that loan. The taxpayer exposure comes in the fact that there are FHA guarantees. If someone gets an FHA guarantee and subsequently fails to make the payments, his or her house is forfeited to the FHA. 
   We will lose some money on this, we believe. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that half a million foreclosures will be averted by this program, that would otherwise have taken place, at a cost to the taxpayers of $2.4 billion. That means $4,800 for every foreclosure averted. 
   We are told, well, this is a bailout, and I want to follow on what my colleague from Massachusetts said. We have seen one bailout this year over investors and speculators. It came when the Federal Reserve, actively urged on by the Treasury, bailed out for $30 billion potentially--we don't know what the losses will be--but $30 billion is at risk of what will ultimately be public money, to lenders, to speculators and investors, people who were partners at Bear Stearns. 
   Now there may have been some confusion yesterday. I tried to avoid it. I am not critical that we are doing that. I am critical of the lack of sensible regulation that led them to be in that position. I think we do have to examine it, and I want to examine it from the standpoint of what we can do that will make it less likely that we will be confronted with that kind of choice, either provide those funds or see serious further economic debilitation. 
   But for the administration that engineered $30 billion of bailout for the investors and others who did business with Bear Stearns to say that this $2.4 billion cost according to CBO that will avert 500,000 foreclosures is unacceptable as a bailout is as intellectually and morally and economically inconsistent a policy as we have ever seen. It is true, and some of the Republicans have said in a letter to me in the House, that they wanted to question this. 
   I would note, by the way, we talked about this, I have looked at the letter that was sent to me. I looked again at the letter, and in no case does it say they were opposed to it. People raised questions. Maybe that's an easy way to kind of cover your bases, but my point is not so much those who wrote the letter, it's the administration. 
   The administration says they're going to veto this bill, that it's a bailout. It is $2.4 billion versus $30 billion at Bear Stearns. 
   Now, I believe that Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke have been doing the best they can in this situation. I am not critical of what they have done. Chairman Bernanke has been consistent and thinks this is also a reasonable thing to do. 
   The President, of course, appointed Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke, and for the administration that supported and facilitated the $30 billion for Bear Stearns which went to lenders, went to investors and some of them were speculators--to then object when it's homeowners seems to me to be entirely the reverse of the reality of the situation. 
   Again, I want to stress, I was asked by 17 Republicans if the committee would have a hearing. My answer was yes, the committee will have a hearing after we have dealt with the current subprime crisis--and that will be soon, that was our priority--and a hearing not simply to say what did you do, because we cannot compel them to undo it--to look at what they did in the Bear Stearns thing in the context of figuring out how we are best able to diminish the likelihood that it will recur. 
   But we are in a recession, and a major cause of that recession is the subprime crisis. We do not see any alternatives to this bill to trying to work on that. 
   Yes, we had Hope Now, and then we had FHA Secure. The administration had several policies. They have been closer, in many ways, to us. The differences are not as great as they once were. 
   But the fundamental here is this, foreclosures are causing, have caused and are causing serious economic problems. Diminishing the number of foreclosures is in the interest--not simply of those who will avert foreclosure--but of people in the neighborhood of the cities in which they are located and the whole economy. That's why we are going forward with this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, before I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida for 3 minutes, I would like to note the use of the figure $300 billion is not a hopeful sign about a rational debate. Three hundred billion is the total value of the mortgages that could be insured. It would cost $300 billion only if nobody made any payments ever, and when the property was taken by the Federal Government, none of it had any value. CBO gave us a score of $2.4 billion. So we can debate this, but I would hope we can debate it with real numbers. The CBO score for the mortgage part is $2.4 billion. Everybody knows that $300 billion is not remotely what is at risk. 
   I yield now 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ginny Brown-Waite).

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I yield myself first 45 seconds to say that on the scoring, $2.4 billion was the CBO score for the mortgage part. They did say a total of $2.7 billion. The other $300 million is attributable to an amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Illinois on mortgage. So the gentlewoman from Illinois is correct. It is $2.7 billion. That includes the $300 million she added to the bill with her amendment, and the $2.4 million in mortgages.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I regret that, but sometimes people would rather see things not improved so they can then complain that they weren't improved. Fortunately in this case, we are not constrained. 
   The gentleman from North Carolina and the gentleman from Ohio said it had not come to our attention fully until after the committee markup. What happened was that they came forward with this amendment, and we heard some concerns from the Comptroller of the Currency, as the gentleman from Ohio has said, and from bankers. 
   We then talked to the gentleman from Ohio and the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Miller), talked to the American Bankers Association, the Community Bankers Association, the Mortgage Bankers, the OCC, various of the advocacy groups, the State Attorneys General, the National Council of State Legislators, and they came to an agreement that adding these words would make this something that would work. 
   Now, the obvious thing in a constructive way would have been with the agreement of all of the stakeholders and the conversations among Members on both sides to be incorporated into the bill. But constructive isn't always the order of the day. 
   So let me make this announcement which I have also, in anticipation that there might be such an objection, although I had spoken to the ranking member and he told me he thought we should go forward. It was my understanding the gentleman from Ohio had talked to the leadership on the Republican side. They thought it should go forward. So here is where we are. We will vote on the Miller-LaTourette amendment. I will guarantee to the Members that when this goes forward in any discussions we have with the Senate, we will accept this language, the Miller-LaTourette language, or if someone comes up with a better idea, any other language that would be mutually agreed upon by the gentleman from Ohio and the gentleman from North Carolina, the two bipartisan sponsors. 
   So while we don't get the unanimous consent agreement, because some people would rather there not be a resolution over an objection, let me announce what may be a first, and I'm not always the most technologically updated person; I don't have a lot of the devices, but I do want to maybe be the pioneer of the virtual unanimous consent agreement. In good faith the gentleman from North Carolina and the gentleman from Ohio want to amend this, they were denied unanimous consent, but I am prepared to act as if the body, and I have no question that it would have been adopted had we had a chance to vote on it, that it be incorporated. And as we go forward, we can guarantee Members that this language, if this bill is included, this will be included; and I can report that all of the stakeholders, the community advocacy groups, the banks, and the public officials at the State and local level believe that with the language that was worked out by the gentleman from Ohio and the gentleman from North Carolina with the Comptroller of the Currency, it will be fine. 
   So I wish we had got unanimous consent, but I want to assure Members that in this process going forward, our failure to get real unanimous consent, as opposed to virtual unanimous consent, will make no difference whatsoever. 
   On this point, let me yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina to complete this conversation.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, first I wondered how I'd fill 2 hours, but I could do that just responding to the inaccuracies we've just heard. Let me pick a couple. 
   The gentleman from New Jersey said that the administration wanted FHA reform and GSE reform and this Congress wouldn't get it. Well, he misread the newspaper. Bryan Montgomery, the head of the FHA, was quoted yesterday as saying, if Congress had done what I wanted in 2006, this wouldn't have happened. It was the Republicans who were in power in 2006. It was under the Republicans that GSE reform and FHA reform were frustrated. 
   When we took power as the Democratic majority, last year this Financial Services Committee and this House passed both of those in forms very close to what the administration wanted. In fact, the holdup on the GSE, and I know the gentleman thinks the notion of building affordable rental housing with public help is, as he calls it, a slush fund, and I think it's that lack of sympathy for affordable housing that was one of the contributing factors to getting people into homes they couldn't have owned. 
   But the fact is that we sent the GSE bill over to the Senate last year with a very large majority in favor, and the Senate hasn't acted, partly because the ranking Republican on the Senate committee hasn't wanted to act. I know the administration has been trying to persuade him to act. 
   So the notion that the affordable housing trust fund, that's slush fund for the gentleman from New Jersey, housing for lower income people, for elderly people, for disabled people, that's slush fund, well, it was not that that held it up. It was the refusal apparently of the ranking member to act on it. 
   So this is an example of the inaccurate descriptions you're getting.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. No, but the gentleman very inaccurately blamed the Democrats. He forgot, Bryan Montgomery said in 2006, the Republicans did it. 
   I think one ought to be more accurate and less partisan in a description of reality. The fact is that those were defeated under the Republicans when he was on the committee. Then, the Democrats did pass them. 
   And as to the GSE bill, he said it was the slush fund. I really like that phrase, ``slush fund.'' That's affordable housing for people, for lower income people. He said that's what's holding up the GSE bill. That is not remotely true. The GSE bill was sent by us to the Senate. They haven't taken it up. By the way, the affordable housing trust fund was in the Senate committee version when the Republicans were in power under the current ranking member when he was chairman. So that is just inaccurate.  
   It is true they have been held up in the Senate as they were held up under the Republican leadership as well. We are closer to passing them. I am confident that they are going to get passed fairly soon. We did finally get to some conversation on the FHA. 
   My objection was that the gentleman acted as if the world was created in January of 2007 and the Democrats refused to pass the bill, neglecting to note that the head of the FHA himself put the blame much earlier when the Republicans were in power. 
   I now yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Miller).

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to respond to the gentleman from Texas. 
   He says, why isn't the $2.7 written into the bill? It is, in effect, because it is subject to appropriation, and no money will be spent until that is provided. The $300 billion is the number of mortgages that could be insured, up to that. We needed to put that number there before CBO could tell us how much it would cost. And written into this bill before it becomes law and becomes operational will be that $2.7 billion figure. That is the way the process works. You get a CBO score, and then you pay for it. 
   I now yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois, a very diligent member of our committee.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. If the gentlewoman will yield, I know sometimes conspiracy theories rattle around this place. The reason we put in the legislation to protect disabled veterans who had bankruptcy from being excluded from this program is to protect veterans, disabled veterans who have been in bankruptcy from being in this program. There were people who suggested that the sensitivity people would have in bankruptcy could be a problem. Now I will point out, by the way, that thanks to some very good amendments by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Marshall) who has dealt with this problem in a more general way, and he is a bankruptcy expert--from the law side not the subject side. But we thought with disabled veterans, we know this engenders prejudice when people see in some cases people are disabled. So it was there for that reason, to protect people, to make sure that we, the Federal Government, would not, in any way, be discriminating against them and maybe therefore set a good example for everybody else.

   In fact, I think it would be dishonorable for anyone.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I understand the complaints about the process. Remember, though, that several of the bills being reenacted today have already been fully debated and amended on the floor. There is one that was not subject to the normal--and I'm a general defender of the normal--process. It's the FHA rescue bill. 
   And I will say, in this case, I think it is fair to ask Members to vote for it up or down. It is a very interrelated piece of legislation. It tries to balance cost and incentive. It would be easy to put it out of whack. And in this one case I think it is fair to say you can vote it up or you can vote it down. Members will have a chance to vote on it. While it's in the form of an amendment, if that amendment is defeated, it dies. 
   I also want to address the issue of the amendment offered by the gentleman from North Carolina and the gentleman from Ohio regarding preemption, because there may be some confusion. 
   I personally spoke, today, with representatives of the banking organizations, the American Bankers Association, the Independent Community Bankers, and the Mortgage Bankers. They took the position that if we were able to adopt the language offered by the gentleman from Ohio, they would find this a bill that they would accept and would not seek to defeat. 
   Because of an objection, we weren't able to do this, so technically, yes, they had previously said they were opposed to it in that form. They have also said, after we outlined the procedure that was followed by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LaTourette), the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Miller) and myself, that it is now acceptable; that is, while we were blocked by an objection from adopting the actual language, the language that was agreed to by them, by the Attorneys General, by the State bank supervisors, by advocacy groups, will be the language that's in the bill. So let there be no doubt about that. There is no substantive objection to what will happen. 
   Now, let me talk about the bill. I guess I want to, not damn my bill today with faint praise, but support it. It comes from the economists. 
   Now, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake), for whom I have a great deal of respect, a man of very high intellectual integrity, he chided me because I have taken a free market position, but not here. And I'll respond this way. 
   I have opposed systemic interventions in the market. I think it is generally unwise for us to enact legislation which, in an ongoing way, displaces the market. But that's not what we do here. There is a part of the reality of the market that is called market failure. People have won Nobel Prizes, Joe Stiglitz, for work about market failure. Clearly there has been market failure with regard to mortgages. The market failure was the breaking of the lender-borrower relationship and the substitution of securitization without appropriate countervailing incentives. 
   This bill today is no ongoing intervention in the market. It is time limited, and limited in specifics to a subset of mortgages. It seeks to undo, to some extent, to mitigate a market failure. It will leave the market, I believe, stronger going forward. 
   So I accept the gentleman from Arizona's reminding me that I should stay true to free market principles. This bill is true to free market principles. 
   And let me quote one of the leading advocates of free market principles in the English-speaking world, the Economist, called to my attention by the staff of the Financial Services Committee, which has done enormously good work in substantively putting this bill together, and in listening to me talk about it in various ways. 
   And I appreciate both aspects of that. 
   Here's what the Economist said: ``The plan is hardly a bailout,'' talking about this bill. This is a current Economist. ``Lenders would have to write down their loans to 85 percent of the current value of a house.'' By the way, under FHA Security Administration's plan, they can get a 100 percent loan put in. They can get somebody who's defaulted and get them a 100 percent loan. We require an 85 percent writedown to the value. 
   ``Borrowers would pay a fee for the insurance and give up a share of any later price rise to the government.'' By the way, they would also be barred for 5 years from taking out a second mortgage. So the borrowers under this, if there was an increase in equity, would have to share much of it with the Government, and the earlier in the process in which they sold out, the more the Government would get. That's not the bailout that people have described. 
   People worry about moral hazard. I would assure people, no borrower who goes through this process will say at the end of it, ``Boy, that was fun. Where do I buy a ticket to get back on Space Mountain?'' They will be deterred. 
   But we're not relying solely on this. Two-thirds plus of this House, many of my Republican colleagues didn't do it, but many of my Republican colleagues did. We voted for a bill to regulate subprime mortgages going forward. We're not simply relying on people's bad experience. We have put some restrictions on that. 
   I believe this is pro-market. The markets now are in trouble because a lot of people who were very smart bought things they shouldn't have bought, including subprime mortgages. And having bought things they shouldn't have bought, they now don't want to buy things they should buy. 
   We all know the little story about the child who touches the hot stove,  and having touched a hot stove and being burned, won't go near the stove. We have investors today who, having touched the hot stove, are staying away from the refrigerator, the sink and the shower because they have been so badly burned. 
   If we do not adopt appropriate responses to this market failure, we will not cure it, and the lag in investments will continue. 
   We are working through the market here. It is voluntary that a lender says we're going to cut it down. People say, well, they'll dump all their bad loans. Have the Republicans who say that, because many Republicans are with us, so little confidence in the FHA? 
   Nothing in this bill coerces the FHA to accept a single loan that it finds unlikely to be repaid. And CBO accepts that, because they say of 500,000 loans that they expect to be accepted, the failure rate will be, average out to $4,800 per loan. Do you really think if the loan failed it would only cost us $4,800? 
   That figure, that $2.4 billion is CBO saying that there won't be many failures because of the criteria that are in this bill. 
   And people have said, what about the people who paid their mortgages? Well, if they live in a neighborhood where there is foreclosure, they're getting hurt. If they live in a city where the property tax revenues are going down, they're getting hurt. And if they live in America, they are in the midst of a recession in which we are losing jobs when we should be gaining them, in which real wages have been pulled down, and the single biggest cause of this recession is the subprime crisis and its reverberations. 
   This is a rare case of a microeconomic factor causing a macroeconomic problem. And the market got us into this. And we don't say junk the market. And I know people who have said, oh, the market's way too smart. And people have said to me, you know, some smart people don't agree with this proposal. Well, I agree with that. 
   But I also have to note that no dumb people got America into this problem. You had to be really smart to understand collateralized debt obligation derivatives. And the problem is that we need to restrain some of their instincts and let the market function again. And it simply will not happen if you simply let it go. 
   Here's what we say. And, by the way, I supported Hope Now when it came out. But Hope Now had a flaw. It was based on the notion--Members don't even pay attention to this--it was based on the notion that the problem was when the mortgage reset to a higher rate under adjustable rate mortgages, that would be the problem. That hasn't been the problem. 
   The problem has been people who owe more than the loan is worth. Some of them were irresponsible in the first place. Some of them made the mistake that almost everybody else made of not foreseeing the depth of the drop in house prices. So Hope Now has been overtaken by events. 
   We here are responding to reality in a way that is pro-market and minimizes the outlay. I hope the bill is passed.

The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. McCotter) offered an amendment yesterday, notwithstanding any other preferences, first priority to veterans, members of the Armed Forces on active duty, members of the National Guard or Armed Forces reserves, school teachers and emergency responders. That is now in the bill. That is part of the bill. 
   The gentleman phrased his motion as ``promptly.'' Now we have already seen the kind of delay tactics that the minority has been prone to use. Send this back to committee, and you are very unlikely to get it back on the floor in a way in which we can pass it. So last night we adopted preference for veterans. Today, in the guise of redoing what we have already done, a motion is offered that will keep veterans from benefiting from that preference because the bill won't go anywhere. 
   The gentleman was honest. He began by saying he doesn't like this bill. And since a head-on assault will not pass--no, I will not yield. I will explain why I won't yield. I won't yield because I have consistently, when I was chairing the committee, been open to amendments. I have yielded. But when at the last minute with zero notice something is drafted with no chance to discuss it, and they use their full 5 minutes, of course I won't give up the small amount of time we have. It is already inadequate to discuss this. 
   So this will prevent the veterans from getting the preferences they already have. You have seen what can happen with these delays. We have preference for veterans in this bill. 
   Now let me say procedurally, if this had said ``forthwith,'' I would have been less concerned about it. But there is also this: during the markup of this bill, we accepted nine Republican amendments. Yesterday we accepted several Republican amendments. If I was seriously interested in helping the people who are to be the beneficiaries,  I would have offered an amendment at the Rules Committee, and we would have accepted it. I would not have waited to say ``promptly'' so that I would have used the disabled veterans as a way to kill the bill. 
   Similarly, with regard to mortgage fraud--and by the way, this is through the cities. If you think that the cities are going to give out money to rapists, worry about it. 
   I would be prepared, if this would have been put forward in an orderly way so we could vet it and not have unintended consequences as we did with the last recommit on a bill from our committee, we could have accepted it. 
   As we go forward, and let me say further in conference with the Senate, yes, I think we ought to make it explicit that people with mortgage fraud don't get it, as well as certain kinds of sex offenders. Yes, I think we can do these things, and we will do them going forward. 
   But to take it now with a ``promptly,'' designed to kill the bill, and it will in fact undo, take back the veterans' preferences we gave yesterday, and to use disabled veterans and to use concern for the law as a cover to kill a bill for which the votes do not exist to kill it is the wrong way to go. 
   We have amended this bill. Nine amendments were accepted in committee. None of these were offered. Had they been, they would have substantially been accepted, and they can be accepted going forward. But you have seen, my colleagues, what has gone on here. Send this back to committee, we have to go back to committee. We have rules to deal with. You have a crowded agenda in the committee. You will not see this bill again probably for weeks, and we will again have these tactics. 
   The gentleman from Georgia is going to raise the point that it can come out the next day. It cannot. The rules of the House do not allow it. And anyone who thinks you are going to get unanimous consent from this group to waive four and five rules is not paying attention. After we just had two votes on an appeal of a ruling, a frivolous appeal, and we get an appeal of the appeal because people didn't like the wording on the board, you tell me if you think we are going to get serious legislative efforts.     
   So, yeah, I want veterans preferences in the bill. Going forward, we can address this. But Members who are worried about some kind of ad long before your election, the sensible parts of this will be embodied in the bill. You will have a chance to vote to protect against mortgage fraud, et cetera. But vote for this today. 
   And as the gentleman from Arizona made clear, he doesn't like the bill. And I understand the problem the President has. The administration can't decide whether it wants to sign or veto. There are internal debates, so it falls to our Republican colleagues to save this President from having to make the decision. 
   I urge my colleagues not to fall for that partisan ploy. Vote down this effort to delay, and perhaps delay indefinitely this bill. We will, going forward, take the good parts of it and incorporate it. Had they been substantially offered seriously before, they would have been adopted. 
   Please, let's not fall for a partisan ploy and kill a good bill.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. The committee and the House are constrained by a number of rules that cause substantial numbers of days to elapse. Does this motion, if it passes, in any way empower us to forget those rules of the House which require a certain number of days in committee, certain number of layovers, an announcement of a markup, a delay before the bill is reported, the Rules Committee, et cetera? Does this motion in any way reduce any of those timetables?

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. (SHAREHOLDER VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This is a bill to further the workings of the capitalist system of the United States. It has one very specific provision. It says that the shareholders, the owners of public corporations, will be allowed to vote every year in an advisory capacity on the compensation paid to their employees who run the companies. 
   Now, Mr. Chairman, some might think this is unnecessary. In a better world, it would be. But there is not now any clear-cut, uniform, legal right for the shareholders to get such a vote. Some corporations allow it, some do not. Some boards of directors allow it, some do not. In a recent case, the SEC ordered AT&T to allow such a vote, but it was because of certain circumstances. There is no general principle that allows it. 
   We do have, thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission under our former colleague from California, Mr. Cox, a provision that I am sure many considered to be an intrusion into the private affairs of corporations, because without regard to the wishes of the corporations, the SEC under Chairman Cox has unanimously adopted rules that require corporations to put in the annual proxy form a chart of compensation for the top officials and an explanation of the theory of the compensation by which they are there. 
   Understand that this is a decision by the SEC to require corporations to do what they would not otherwise have done, because it only applies to those who haven't done it. 
   We add one simple fact here. The SEC has said that it does not have the power to go further and compel corporations to allow the owners to vote. Our bill simply does that. Our bill simply says, you will have on your proxy form, printed anyway, what the compensation figures are. There is no debate about how they will be presented. We require, if this bill passes, corporations simply to add to that a box that says ``I approve/I disapprove,'' and you can check it as appropriate. And the sole expense to the corporation is the ink in printing ``approve'' or ``disapprove,'' and the tallying along with the other tallying. There is no additional paper, there is no additional anything else. 
   We have had a situation in which people, including the President of the United States, have acknowledged that in some cases CEO compensation has become excessive. I believe that that is clearly the case. A study done by Professor Lucian Bebchuk at Harvard, unrefuted by the defenders of the current corporate compensation system, notes that the amount of corporate profits going to the salaries for the top three employees, the compensation to the top three employees has about doubled to the point where a year or so ago it was nearly 10 percent. 
   We are talking about real money. We are talking about money that goes to these top executives that could be used for other purposes. For example, when Mr. Nardelli of Home Depot received a $210 million good-bye kiss that had been written into his contract, when he was fired and given a $210 million consolation prize, Home Depot was at the same time announcing that they were putting $350 million into improving the stores. Well, suppose Mr. Nardelli had been sent out into the cold, hard world with only $50 million for the rest of his life. $160 million more would have been available to add to that $350 million for the stores, considerably more than a third. In other words, that was a real number. If $350 million can fix up the stores significantly, another $50 million or $75 million could have increased that by up to 50 percent. 
   The President himself has acknowledged that the compensation has gotten out of hand. But from the standpoint of the President, excessive CEO compensation, increased inequality in our economy, which is a part of this, global warming, they all have certain common elements; the President and some of his supporters have reluctantly acknowledged the reality of those things, having denied them for some time, but they appear to regard them as facts of nature that were neither caused by nor can be corrected by human action. We disagree with that. 
   Now, people have suggested that the salaries are too high and Congress should limit them. We reject that. This bill as we have presented it does not intrude into the process of setting compensation. 
   Mr. Chairman, some of the amendments offered would do that. There are amendments that would alter the effect of this, depending on the kind and amount of compensation. I think those are erroneous. I think some of my friends on the other side have become, in their zeal to defend corporate compensation levels, de facto, in a bad situation. They would be more intrusive. 
   All we say is this: The shareholders own the companies, and we believe the shareholders should be allowed to vote. 
   Now, some people have said that is up to the board of directors, why are you singling out compensation for the CEO? And there is a good reason. You can make arguments about corporate governance one way or the other. We are not going beyond one point here. The relationship between the CEOs and the boards of directors is very different than most of the relationships the boards of directors have. The CEOs and the boards of directors select each other. There is a lack of an arm's length situation there that we think makes it appropriate to single it out and let the shareholders vote. 
   It is only an advisory vote, that is true, and you will hear the contradictory argument that we are both too intrusive and not sufficiently intrusive into the affairs of the corporations. But we have more confidence in the boards of directors than some of our colleagues. Not completely, or we wouldn't have this bill. But we do not think boards of directors will likely disregard an advisory opinion from the shareholders and, therefore, we think that is an important input that the board should have. They have their ultimate responsibility, and maybe they will find some special circumstance that says, we can't follow in this case. The shareholders own the company, and we are simply giving them this right. 
   The last point is, and we have heard people say, well, you are interfering with the affairs of the corporation. Corporations do not exist in nature; they are the creations of positive legislative action. No corporation anywhere has powers except those that are given to it by a government, and governments tell the corporations what powers they have, what immunities they have, and what rules they follow. The SEC just intruded very deeply into the affairs of corporations by requiring the posting of the compensation. 
   We say that under current rules, including some State laws, and it varies from State to State, the shareholders don't have enough rights. And all we do here is empower the shareholders to vote on the compensation of the people who work for them.  
   The last dogma I would deal with is, well, how can the shareholders know that? It is extraordinary to me, Mr. Chairman, to listen to people who ordinarily are quite respectful of the wisdom of the market. And what is the market? The market is the people who buy the shares. Those are the people who make up the market. And apparently this group of people who are the shareholders are in most respects quite wise. But when it comes to deciding how much to pay the people who work for them, they get stupid, and this is somehow beyond their capacity. 
   We disagree with that. We think this is a moderate and temperate approach to the issue of runaway compensation, excessive compensation, not in every case, and in every case it wouldn't be used negatively. 
   I should have said one other thing. No one has shown any correlation between these outsized compensation examples and any metric of success. Indeed, too often they are metrics of failure because they are payoffs to get people to leave quietly. 
   So we hope that this bill will be adopted and that shareholders who own the companies will have the right to express their opinion to the boards of directors on the level of compensation for the top employees of the company. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I was frankly waiting, and I was disappointed, but that happens a lot in life, for the gentleman to get to the part of the article that he quoted selectively in which that article says what you really want to do is make the tax system more progressive. I suppose the gentleman didn't want to quote criticism of tax cuts that he voted for, but it did seem to me, if we are going to be quoting things, Mr. Reich said not that he was opposed to this as a bad idea, but that a much better way to do it would be to undo the tax cuts that the gentleman from Delaware supported at the upper brackets. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would ask to insert in the Record the article by Robert B. Reich.  
   Don't Count on Shareholders  
   An acquaintance of mine sits on the board of a major company that just agreed to pay its CEO close to $10 million this year, including deferred compensation and stock options. I asked him how he and his board colleagues could possibly justify that kind of money. ``No choice,'' he said. ``That's what our competition is paying. It's the going rate.'' As Congress struggles to raise the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour, the going rate of CEO pay is now $5,000 an hour. 
   Polls show most Americans think this is obscene. But how to rein in CEO pay? A growing consensus believes the best way is to give shareholders more voice. New Securities and Exchange Commission rules require companies to inform shareholders in greater detail what their companies are paying top executives. In recent months, shareholder activists have submitted proposals to 60 companies seeking input on CEO pay. House Democrats are now working on legislation that would give shareholders the right to have more say over pay. 
   But the growing consensus is wrong: Shareholders won't constrain the growth of CEO pay, because most shareholders don't care about it. The vast majority own their shares through mutual funds and pension funds, and don't even know which companies they're invested in at any given moment. Their only concern is maximizing the return on their total portfolios. They keep the pressure on fund managers to do this by moving their savings from funds that underperform to those that show better overall results. 
   Fund managers, for their part, don't care much about CEO pay, either. They're looking for companies whose share prices are rising, and they push firms to get their prices up by shifting capital out of those whose prices are lagging into those that show more promise. 
   Presumably, shareholders and fund managers would want to constrain CEO pay if it hampered company performance, but it hasn't. While CEO pay has soared over the last 25 years, share prices have soared, too. Between 1980 and 2003, the average value of America's 500 largest companies rose by a factor of six, adjusted for inflation. What happened to average CEO pay in those companies? It rose roughly sixfold. Shareholders have no reason to complain. They don't--and they won't. 
   Depending on shareholders to rein in CEO pay is like relying on gamblers to rein in the owners of Las Vegas casinos. Just look at Britain. Since 2003, changes in British securities law have given investors there more say over what British CEOs are paid. Nonetheless, executive pay in Britain has continued to skyrocket, and now just about matches that of American CEOs. Companies listed on the London Stock Exchange have done sufficiently well that British investors don't care what CEOs are paid. 
   The real scandal of CEO pay has almost nothing to do with shareholders. It has to do  with what's happened to the pay of most other workers as CEO pay has soared. Shareholder returns have kept up with CEO pay, but median wages have not. In 1980, the CEO of a major company took home about 40 times what the median worker earned; by 1990, that CEO's pay was about 100 times the median worker's; in 2006, it was close to 300 times what the median worker earned. (Last year, Wal-Mart's Lee Scott Jr. earned 900 times the pay of the average Wal-Mart worker.) 
   CEO pay is part of a much larger problem: the growing portion of the nation's income that's going to a small number of people at the top. The pay packages of many denizens of Wall Street are even more outrageous than CEO pay--last year reaching $40 million for top traders and more than a billion dollars for top hedge-fund managers. The new stars of Wall Street are private equity funds that are buying public companies back from shareholders and raking in 20 percent to 25 percent annual returns for their private investors--mostly wealthy individuals with yearly incomes already in the stratosphere. 
   Not since the robber-baron era have income and wealth been as concentrated as they are today. This doesn't threaten shareholders; after all, most shares are held by the wealthy. It threatens democracy, as the wealthy use their fortunes to bankroll politicians who tilt public policies in the direction of the wealthy--by, say, reducing their taxes and cutting public services for everyone else. It also threatens our economy, as more and more investment decisions are made by fewer and fewer people, and as the middle class loses its capacity to pay for the goods and services the economy produces. 
   The answer is not to grant more rights to shareholders. It's to enact a far more progressive income tax, including a sharply higher marginal rate on yearly incomes above, say, a measly million.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I would say to the gentleman, I am baffled by this. On the one hand, this is too intrusive, but the gentleman says a better way would be to require corporations to elect directors by a majority. That would be a far greater intrusion into all of the aspects of the corporation. 
   But I will say this, if the gentleman prefers and the Members on the other side prefer: that we instead pass legislation that requires all corporations to allow a majority election for directors in an effective way as an alternative to nominations. Maybe we will hold off on this bill and consider it. I await that bill. 
   The gentlemen on the other side are all full of other solutions, none of which have ever been put to paper.

I am glad now to have this affirmation that even with Sarbanes-Oxley that the Chamber of Commerce praises so loudly, even with the Securities and Exchange Commission apparently not being the FSA, the American system  still works.

I would just say that I have too recently been in the minority to be abusive. I hope that will last. I certainly intend it to. I am told, by the way, by our Parliamentarian, who, as the gentleman knows, was the Parliamentarian when the other side was in the majority, we have already had more rollcalls in committee in this year than we have had in the previous congressional session. While we have been moving a lot of bills and we have been able to do it expeditiously, I think we've aired a lot of issues, on this particular case, members of the minority made this suggestion, and it is a plausible one. It improves the bill. I realize that they still don't like it, but I appreciate this constructive spirit, and so I urge adoption of the amendment.

This is, again, I believe, a technical amendment. It simply tries to conform the language in the bill with regard to what it requires. 
   I think the best way to say it, Mr. Chairman, is this. There was disagreement on the substance of what we require. We did want to make it clear, however, that we weren't requiring any more than that, and any suggestion that we might have been creating procedural or other kinds of obstacles, we wanted to work together to avoid. This is in furtherance of that, so I ask that the amendment be adopted.

   So I think we will take this, I hope, as a chance to give people the message, if this bill becomes law, it should be complied with forthrightly and effectively; and if we encounter any efforts at any kind of obfuscation, then the gentlewoman, I promise her, will be back on the floor with our support.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   The gentleman from California mischaracterized my argument. I didn't say that it wasn't intrusive enough because it wasn't mandatory. I was responding to his earlier assertion which might have led people to think it was mandatory. I was simply correcting the characterization. 
   I would say this. If the gentleman wants to introduce a bill, and he complains a little bit, well, that he was only able to offer this amendment because only in this form is it germane to this bill; I know the gentleman is a relatively new Member, maybe he didn't understand that Members have the right to file any legislation they want. 
   Had the gentleman genuinely wanted to deal with this and broaden the right of shareholders with regard to elections of the boards of directors, that if I were here, I would have filed such a bill, I will tell him now, I will yield only if I can get unanimous consent to extend my time. 
   If Members tell me that, I will be glad to yield. No problem. I will be glad to yield in a minute just to say this: If the gentleman now decides, having considered this, that he wants to file such a bill, I will guarantee him a hearing. I will say this: We will find more opposition to it if we were to mandate that. That is one of the factors I will introduce. 
   I would say, until we had filed this bill, I had not seen any indication from the gentleman this is what he wants to do. If he wants to file a bill to give shareholders the right to vote by a majority for directors, and I think there has to be further change, then I would be happy to guarantee a hearing. 
   I will yield to him.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I am taking back my time.  
   I will explain why to the gentleman, because I think it's going to be hard enough to get even this through. We have had people who said this is way too much. I do not think the gentleman speaks for his party in being supportive of something that will be far more opposed by a broader segment. If, in fact, that would happen, I would be supportive, but I do not want to have the chance to sacrifice this. 
   I will say one other point. The argument is, why do you single this out? I believe there have been problems with boards of directors in general, although I will repeat again that the Chamber of Commerce, as was noted, thanks Sarbanes-Oxley for significantly improving the quality of boards of directors. I think our former chairman should be pleased to have this ringing endorsement of his handiwork from the Chamber of Commerce. 
   But there is still this problem, boards of directors are at their least independent in dealing with the CEO who may have selected them. I do think there is reason to single out the CEO-board relationship from other issues. 
   The other question I have is this and why I wouldn't vote for this amendment in any case, it says a majority vote, but here is the problem. In many corporations, there is no way to nominate someone to be on the board, other than by the board. There are many corporations that do not allow that. 
   If the gentleman wants to come in with a bill that says shareholders, a certain minimum number, not any one person, but if we could agree that a reasonable number of shareholders could designate alternative candidates, then we could do this. An election in which you require a majority to be elected is part of the democracy, but an alternative is also part of the democracy. 
   The gentleman has half of the democracy in here. He has a requirement of the majority vote, but no requirement that there be any competition. As we all know, the fact of competition could affect the final vote. 
   If the gentleman's newly found interest in this sustains itself, and he says it will, and he wants to file a bill that requires that there be access, proxy access to our nomination process and then a majority vote, he will have my support. Until then, though, I see no reason, in the hopes of that, to get rid of this bill. 
   I do want to respond to an earlier comment by the gentleman from New Jersey who said we could only do it for excessive compensation. He fundamentally misunderstands this bill and contradicts itself. 
   It is not the job of the Congress to say what it is or isn't excessive. We have individual opinions about excess. We are leaving it to the shareholders. 
   The gentleman said they should only have to vote if it is more than such and such above the average. What about if you are getting average pay for a subpar performance? What if the shareholders of a particular corporation say, this man doesn't deserve the average, this woman hasn't lived up to the average? 
   The notion that we should qualify the abilities of shareholders to vote on what to pay the owners of their own company, based on what we think is excessive, an empirical definition put in the bill, fundamentally misunderstands what we are trying to do, which is to empower the shareholders to express their opinion. 
   Members keep saying it is simply only advisory. I do not think, Mr. Chairman, that anyone believes that. I do not think that anyone thinks that an advisory vote of shareholders would be easily dismissed by boards of directors. 
   One final point, the suggestion if we do this, the boards of directors and CEOs in pique will take their companies private, when presumably they otherwise wouldn't, because that is the only way it could be causal, what a condemnation of CEOs. How dare you vote on my pay? I will take my company private. 
   By the way, in fact, you can't take the company private over the shareholders' objections.     
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank) has expired.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I just want to repeat the point I made. This threat that we will take the company public, the CEO will take the company public, understand what that says: That if the CEO's pay is subject to a shareholder vote, in retaliation, he will make a fundamental change in the ownership structure. And, by the way, that assumes that the shareholders don't have anything to say about it. No, I do not think that shareholders will sit and vote for a takeover of the company just to allow the CEO to shelter his or her pay; so this threat, I think, is an empty one.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I just wanted to say that this does not in any way enhance democracy. The notion that if you vote against this bill, you vote against democracy, makes no sense. 
   The gentleman says it is an incentive to make the corporations do this. Apparently he believes that, assuming a nonbinding, ineffective, toothless advisory vote will provide a major incentive to corporations to make a major structural change; I don't.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I think the gentleman from North Carolina did correctly state my view, but my position was not simply to keep this bill clean, we did accept a couple of technical amendments. I would point out to him, in committee, the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays) had a substantive amendment, which we accepted, dealing with rights. 
   My view is this: I agree on the principle that a fiduciary's vote should have to be made public, but I wouldn't want to limit it only to pension funds. I also don't think it should be limited only to this subject matter, although I agree, given germaneness, the gentleman couldn't have broadened it beyond that subject in this bill. But it could be broadened beyond pension funds. 
   I believe we should have a hearing on the principle where the gentleman is correct, and I agree with him, that fiduciaries should have to be made public, but that is all fiduciaries on all issues.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I have just been advised by staff, who is very knowledgeable on this, that part of the problem is, and I understand the gentleman has, as I think is appropriate, substantively the model of what was done with mutual funds, but I have been reminded that the SEC has a plenary power over mutual funds that it  does not have over foundations. I have now been instructed that the SEC could not do that. You cannot reason that what they can do over mutual funds to what they can do over these other fiduciaries, so I think it would take separate legislation.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I am disappointed in the characterization. In the first place, it is not accurate that germaneness prevented this from being a broader amendment. As I acknowledged, germaneness does prevent this from getting into other subject matters. But nothing would have prevented this from applying to the other entities that my colleague from North Carolina enumerated. Nothing would have said that other fiduciaries could have been covered. And that is why I am against this amendment. 
   Frankly, we have a difference between the parties here to a very great extent on labor unions and the contribution they make to the United States.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. No, I will take back my time to say to the gentleman, I will not legislate on serious subject matter involving large numbers of institutions on a unanimous consent agreement to an amendment that he filed when he could have filed whatever he wanted at a quarter to 8 or at any other time. I think there should be hearings. I have said we will do this. 
   You know, the gentleman on the other side may, with the motions to recommit, believe in the 5-minute solution to complex problems. I don't. I think it degrades the legislative process. I will not be a party to it. I will not agree. 
   The gentleman could have filed any amendment he wanted to that was germane. He could have filed a broader amendment. We could have had more debate and discussion on it. 
   I do not agree I or he or any of us off the top of our heads are able to decide how better to broaden this. And there is a disagreement between us about labor unions. Let's make it explicit. That is partly what is involved here. 
   There has been a degree, I believe, of denigration and demonization of labor unions, that is part of the reason I think we have the economic inequality we have. For pension funds I read labor unions because they are identified with unions. 
   The gentleman from North Carolina, who is a very good lawyer, mentioned a number of other entities that should be covered if you were going to be covering fiduciaries. I do not think it is accidental that only pension funds are mentioned. I think that bespeaks this notion that labor unions are somehow in need of more supervision, that they are more damaging and dangerous. I think the opposite is the case. I think there have been abuses from foundations. There have been some abuses from unions. So that is why I object to doing this, because I do not think it is the first step. I think it is part of a denigration of the role of labor unions from which this country suffers. Indeed, I will just say I am struck as we debate now whether or not to put standards from the international labor organizations into our trade treaties. We are now being told by opponents that we can't do that because America doesn't meet those standards; that because of the years of denigration of the labor unions, we don't meet those standards. So I do not agree to single out pension funds because I do not agree that we should join in this somehow, this suspicion of unions. And I don't agree that in a unanimous consent agreement off the top of our heads we ought to decide how more broadly to do it. I would rather legislation responsibly. 
   The committee that we are all members of, those of us who are now on the floor, has been, I think, a very thoughtful forum, not just under my chairmanship, under the chairmanship of my predecessor. We have hearings. We have an excellent staff on both sides. We have worked together. 
   I look forward to hearings on extending the principle of fiduciaries having to reveal how they have voted on all issues and to all fiduciaries. But I do not think we should single out pension funds tonight, nor do I think we should on the fly try to broaden it, so I oppose the amendment. 
   And I will yield now to the gentleman.

Yes, I would ask for unanimous consent to make a slight technical change in an amendment to fix wording.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I thank the gentleman and the Rules Committee for bringing forward an open rule. 
   I often disagree with my colleagues on the other side, but I have rarely before been as baffled by the illogic of their argument as I am today. I do not recall the last time I heard such a hodgepodge of inconsistency and inaccuracy. 
   This is a bill that has been condemned for being, A, bullying and intrusive, and B, toothless. The toothless bully is, I guess, a new concept. In fact, let me begin with this denigration of the notion of nonbinding resolution. 
   The gentleman from Texas kind of slipped, I think, when he said ``the sense of shareholder resolution.'' In fact, we spend much of our time passing nonbinding resolutions. Members who think nonbinding resolutions are a waste of time probably should just show up on Wednesday because that is all we do generally on Mondays and Tuesdays, although we are doing more since we have taken over. 
   But let's get to more of the substantive mistakes. My friend from Alabama said we would be second-guessing every corporate salary. Of course not. That isn't even remotely close to being even partially true. We have deliberately said it is not our job to say what the salary should be. We are empowering the shareholders to voice their opinion. 
   Now, I will acknowledge at the outset, if a board of directors sees a vote and the majority of the shareholders vote ``no'' and they decide to vote ``yes,'' the board has that right. I doubt that the board would do that much. In fact, I would not impute to the boards of directors what my colleagues impute to them, a contempt for the views of shareholders. There may be individual cases where shareholders didn't understand certain things, new events may have intervened. But, no, I do not believe that as a general rule people on the board of directors will ignore shareholders. 
   And by the way, we are talking about the shareholders, and I know the gentleman from Texas said they are outsiders, they are activists, as loathsome a word as the rules of the House will allow as he would use it. They own shares. They are the owners of the companies. What a denigration of the people who are in other contexts the fountain of all wisdom. We are told the market is, after all, the best source of wisdom. 
   The former majority leader from Texas used to say, governments are dumb; markets are smart, markets work well. Well, who is the market? The market consists of the people who own the shares in this case. How did they become so dumb when it comes to deciding how to pay for the people that work for them? 
   And we are told, okay, if they don't like it, they can sell their shares. What a concept of ownership. I mean, these are the people, many of them who are outraged at the eminent domain issue. What they are saying is, if you have owned shares in a company for a while, you have made your decision that this is the best way to diversify your portfolio, and then some board makes a decision with which you disagree, that you think may hurt the company, sell your shares. What kind of a denigration of the notion of ownership is that? 
   There are, of course, people who will tell you, wait a minute, what if I believe when Home Depot, for instance, did what it did with Nardelli, it had a very negative effect on people's perception of the company. One of the very decisions you disagreed with led to a drop in the value of the shares because the market said, why did they do that. Should you then sell your shares and be forced to take a loss or take corrective action and restore the value to your shares? That is what we are talking about. It is very simple. 
   And then the oddest one of all is, how dare we interfere with corporations? Corporations are artificial creations of positive law. God made no corporations. No corporations evolved. I will be neutral on that subject. Corporations exist because the law of a jurisdiction creates them. It creates them to give them certain advantages, certain immunities, et cetera. 
   Of course, the government tells corporations what the rules are. This notion that we are interfering with corporations is nonsensical. They exist according to positive law. And the law says, you must do this, you may not do that. That is what corporations are. 
   And now the gentleman will say, oh, well, look what the SEC did, we don't have to get involved. What the Securities and Exchange Commission did was very intrusive. And the gentleman said, well, the corporation can do that if they want to; they could have published the salaries if they wanted to. The Securities and Exchange Commission said, we mandate you to print these salaries. 
   And by the way, to the extent that there is an expense, it is much more in what the SEC did than in what we did. CBO has concurred, there is zero, maybe 8 cents expense here. The SEC has already mandated that the corporations print in the proxy form all this information. We mandate that they add a box, ``yes or no.'' 
   And then my friend from Alabama, great civil libertarian, but on this one I think he may have gotten a little too extreme in his civil libertarian zeal, he said, we are making the shareholders vote. It sounded like he said we are standing over those poor shareholders with a whip and making them vote. Well, in the first place, we are not. Abstention remains an option for shareholders. 
   Secondly, the argument is, well, they already have that right, some of them. No, they don't in every case. There are corporations that have refused to allow it. AT&T was just ordered by the Securities and Exchange Commission to allow this procedure, but it was a case-by-case issue. It is not a general rule. So the SEC that you defend just ordered AT&T to do this, they just intruded, as is their right; but there is not a general principle. 
   Shareholders do not have a right to have this vote on executive compensation. And this bill simply says, the people who own the company take what the SEC has mandated they put forward, has a right to vote on it. Now we are told, and the gentleman from Texas, in a stirring peroration, said he stood for truth, justice, the American way, et cetera; and said, let's reject the European effort. 
   Well, this is not a general European practice, it is a practice in England, what we are talking about. There is a committee that is known as the Paulson Committee, because it was inspired by Secretary of the Treasury Paulson, chaired by Professor Scott of Harvard. There was the McKenzie report, done by Mayor Bloomberg, strongly supported by the Chamber of Commerce and all the financial groups. They have said to us, can't you guys be more like England in your regulation of corporations? 
   Listen to the debate going on right now over relations of corporations in America. We are being told that the  model is the British model, the Financial Services authority. This is Secretary Paulson's committee that said it, this is the Chamber of Commerce. 
   Yes, the English do do this, it is not a big continental thing. But if, in fact, you think we should be very careful never to do anything because the English are doing it, then where is the repudiation of the McKenzie report and the Paulson Committee report which have urged the SEC to follow the model of Financial Services.     
   In fact, it is very straightforward. Here is the problem. Why do normally coherent Members talk in less than coherent form about this, making contradictory arguments, ignoring reality? 
   Here is the deal. My friend from Alabama said, I am not here to defend CEO salaries. But in fact he is, because what this bill says is, the shareholders, not the outsiders, not those evil activists, not those lurking labor agitators, people who own shares. And, by the way, this is strongly supported by the leaders of institutional shareholders, large pension funds, The Corporate Library. Shareholder groups are in favor of this. And it says that people who own the shares should be able to vote in an advisory capacity on whether they think the compensation is too much or too little. 
   Now, the fact is that the gentleman from Alabama said there have been outrageous examples of excessive compensation. It is going up in general to the point where it is a record problem, and he says he is not here to defend them. He is not here to defend them verbally, he is just here to defend them parliamentarily, because if this bill dies, then they are totally unimpeded. And Members have said, don't rush in. Well, these salaries have been going up for a long time, and this is a long-time trend. So if not this, what do you do? It is true, the SEC went to the limits of its power.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. The gentleman misunderstands my point, and I will correct it. I am taking back my time. I was not referring to the gentleman's de facto defense of the salary; I was referring to the gentleman from Texas' statement. 
   He denigrated the product of this legislation because it would produce a nonbinding resolution. In fact, he sneered at it as a sense of the stockholder, sense of the shareholder resolution. And my point was aimed at his argument that the notion of a sense of the resolution is meaningless would invalidate a lot of what we do. So that is the issue I was making. 
   Let me just say in closing, Members on the other side sometimes get separation anxiety when they are forced to differentiate themselves from particular corporate abuses. They brought themselves to do it with Sarbanes-Oxley, but they are having in various ways buyer's remorse there, I think excessive buyer's remorse. 
   Members say we don't like corporate excesses, but we can't do anything about it. 
   Well, no, Congress should not substitute its judgment for the market, Congress should not set the salaries. What Congress can do is to empower the shareholders who own the companies to express their opinion. It is not a right that the shareholders uniformly have now. It is Congress in exercise of the legislative power to set the rules for corporations, which is inherent in the nature of corporations saying that on this one issue; and by the way, one reason for singling them out is, there is reason to believe that the relationship between the boards of directors and CEOs is not sufficiently arm's length for the decision to be left entirely to the board without input. 
   It doesn't mean you take the decision away from the board elsewhere. It simply says there have been excesses in corporation compensation, we think it would be helpful if the shareholders could give an advisory vote. 
   There is really no good argument against it, and that is why we have heard arguments against that aren't very good, that aren't very logical, that aren't based in reality. That is all we are voting on. 
   And in the absence of this bill, Members can then take credit for continuing to enable salaries paid to the top executives to go up and up and up. And if you are a shareholder of a corporation and you think that is a mistake and you think that is damaging, you have the option, we are told, of selling your shares at a loss, of being excluded from an investment decision that you think is in your interest. That is not acceptable.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, we've just heard one of the least persuasive arguments that we have ever heard in this body. We hear them repeatedly. People who are opposed to doing something use the argument that we shouldn't do it, even though they're objecting to it on its own basic grounds because it doesn't go far enough. If, of course, it went far enough, they would be even more upset, Mr. Chairman. 
   The argument that if you cannot solve every problem for everybody, you should not try to improve the situation for large numbers of people is never what people really think. It is always advanced by people who don't want fully to defend the position they take. The objection is to accommodating the many millions of Americans for whom Spanish is the primary language. 
   I have to say, I do not understand the impulse to make life harder for others when making it easier for them has no cost to us. I represent a large number of people who speak English. Nobody has ever said to me, you know what? My life is now more difficult because people who speak primarily Spanish can get a refund. 
   What is the impulse that drives us to object to making life easier for many of our hardworking fellow citizens in some principle when it comes at no cost to us? 
   And by the way, I have a large number of people for whom Portuguese is a primary language. I do not think they will tell me, when I go back to march in parades in that area, we're very upset because you supported allowing tens of millions of our Spanish-speaking friends this advantage and you didn't do everything for us. It is, of course, reasonable for a community to take into account large numbers. 
   And so again, I am really troubled by this lashing out at our fellow citizens when it comes at no cost to the rest of us. You talk about benefit cost analysis. What is the cost, it's minimal, of letting people who work hard who have trouble with the English language? 
   And as the gentleman from New York has pointed out, overwhelmingly the younger people learn English. No one who has had any association with an immigrant community has any doubt about the accuracy of what he said. The young people learn English, they become the translators and interpreters for their parents and their grandparents. 
   There are people who came to America out of love for this country and they work hard, and they are much more comfortable, particularly reading sort of technical information, in the language they grew up with than the new language. Their children and those who come after will speak English. Why do we want to make their lives harder? Why this objection to trying to ease the transition for these people? 
   I very much hope this amendment is defeated. I would hope we would say we are a better country than to begrudge people who have taken the difficult decision to immigrate to make their lives better, this very small accommodation. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I was struck when the gentleman of Florida said, why should we do this at the expense of other people? That's the crux of the disagreement between us. It doesn't come at the expense of other people. The fact that the largest single linguistic minority gets an ability to do this in their own language, which will, by the way, also probably increase tax collection, so it probably is an offset and it probably makes money for the Federal Government. But the gentleman's phrasing ``at the expense of,'' that's what troubles me. It does not come at my expense if we reach out to hardworking people who have trouble with English.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, first I ask the indulgence of the House for the fact that I am dressed a little less spiffily than is my norm, but I have a cast on my arm and this is all that would go over it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have rarely heard anyone repudiate as much of his party's past as I just heard from the gentleman from Texas. First he said this is a restrictive rule. Why, because we said anyone who wanted to file an amendment could file an amendment. There would be no rejection of any amendments by the Rules Committee, and the deadline for that was the day before the bill was to come to the floor. Now we didn't know when that was. And, in fact, what happened was there was a possibility that there would have been an extra day. So the gentleman apparently objects to the possibility of an extra day. 
   I was also struck that he had two objections to deadlines. One was the fact that a rule had a deadline; and one was the fact that a rule didn't have a deadline. He objected to the fact that there was a deadline on the defense bill. He objects to the fact that there isn't a deadline on this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, let's be very clear: The gentleman objects to the being in the minority. When you object to a deadline and the absence of a deadline, you have pretty much exhausted the logical possibilities of argument, and the gentleman has done that. 
   Then we talk about this being restrictive. This bill, a very similar bill, was reported out of the committee under Republican rule in the previous Congress. Nine amendments were allowed by the Rules Committee; 36 amendments are pending to this bill. So because we only had four times as many amendments to this bill as when they were in power, we have become restrictive. 
   The gentleman says we have upset a long-standing tradition. He is right. During their rule, the long-standing tradition was amendments they didn't like and were afraid might pass couldn't be offered. We have upset that. 
   Every amendment that anyone wanted to offer is before us. In fact, the last time this bill came before us, and apparently the gentleman voted for the rule, the bill came out of committee. In the Rules Committee, a self-executing rule was adopted that was very controversial limiting much of what could be done with housing funds, and the Rules Committee then refused to allow a vote on that self-executing rule. 
   So here are the comparisons as the gentleman from Texas laments: Our lack of openness. When he was in power, the Rules Committee took a bill that came out of the committee by a bipartisan majority, inserted its own amendment and insulated that amendment from being voted on. We instead said here is the bill, offer any amendment you want. This is pretty topsy-turvy. I understand the demands of partisanship, but shouldn't logic put some limits on what people would say just to make a partisan point? 
   The fact is this bill came out of committee in the last Congress with an amendment that the Rules Committee put in and wouldn't allow us to vote on, and we have done exactly the opposite. Then he talks about the housing funds, and once again, we have the zeal of a convert. He finds this housing fund a terrible thing, Mr. Speaker. It is a tax on people. It was in the bill that the Republicans brought to the floor. It was in the bill that received more than 300 votes, many of the ``no'' votes, my own included, were from Democrats who objected to the unfair restrictions on the fund that the self-executing rule imposed. 
   So when the Republicans were in power, this housing fund was not so bad. This housing fund came out of committee by a bipartisan majority, came to the floor, and was voted on in a final bill by over 300 Members. This same housing fund, exactly the same principle, it is financed a little differently, but with all of the same effects, when did it become so terrible? What turns a fund to build affordable housing for lower-income people from a thing to be proud of into a terrible tax? An election. 
   When the Republicans were in the majority, this was apparently a good thing. It was overwhelmingly passed. But now that the Democrats are in the majority, this same housing fund becomes something that is awful. It is a housing fund that is supported by the realtors, by the home builders, by everybody in the housing business because it does not have the effects the gentleman talks about. 
   Here is the inconsistency which lies at the root of many of my colleague's arguments. The purpose of this bill is to put some checks on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. People have said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac get certain assistance from the Federal Government that allows them to borrow money more cheaply from the market, and too little of that goes to public benefit and too much goes to the stockholders. 
   So this bill, as did the last bill from the Republicans, headed by Chairman Oxley, and poor Chairman Oxley, he did Sarbanes-Oxley, he did this bill. I always thought well of Mike Oxley. I guess I have to defend him against his former colleagues who now are apparently ready to tear down everything the poor man did. Mike Oxley deserves better of you than for you to repudiate all of the good work that he did, and I speak out. I know you are not supposed to address people who are not here, Mr. Speaker, so let me say that I want Mike Oxley to know that there are many of us, and I think a few on his own side, too, who do respect his work on the housing fund and who respect his work on other things. 
   But what we said to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was we are going to have you make a contribution. You should not keep all of the money for yourself and for your shareholders. We are going to take some of it for affordable housing. 
   By the way, this is an affordable housing fund that a great majority of Republicans voted for 2 years ago. It became terrible because we won the election. Well, wisdom comes in various ways, and I suppose it came late to some of my colleagues over there, but better late than never by their standards. 
   But the fact is this: In this bill, there will be amendments proposed that would impose far greater restrictions on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac than the housing fund. There is an amendment that I assume many of them are going to vote for, that would severely restrict what they could put in the portfolio. Now they make a lot of money off their portfolio, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and that is part of the money that goes to help them keep down housing costs. An amendment will be offered that would severely restrict, that would say only low-income-type mortgages can go in the portfolio. That would have a far greater financial impact in reducing funds available to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac than the housing fund. The problem is that the housing fund would help State governments and others build affordable housing, and apparently there is this ideological opposition to doing that. 
   By the way, where is this housing fund going to go in the first year, this terrible tax? It is going to go to Mississippi and Louisiana. It is going to go to a place where there was terrible devastation of affordable housing in Louisiana and Mississippi, 75 percent to Louisiana and 25 percent to Mississippi. 
   In future years, the money won't be spent until this House and the Senate and the President pass a subsequent bill deciding how to spend it. This bill sets it aside, but it leaves to a later bill the collective decision about how to spend it.  
   So we have a rule that allows 36 amendments. Last year they did nine. We have a rule where the Rules Committee does not add substance. Last year they did and wouldn't allow us to vote on it. 
   We do have one thing in common in the bill last Congress and this Congress: An affordable housing fund. The difference is that the affordable housing fund which my Republican friends took credit for 2 years ago has transmogrified into a terrible beast solely because the Democrats are now in power. That doesn't make any sense.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Well, I again would repeat that the gentleman said last year I supported this Housing trust fund. So did almost all the Republicans, but the basic point here is that he misstated the nature of the hurricane bill. 
   In the hurricane bill, and the gentlewoman from California who was its main author is here and will speak shortly, we did not provide any additional funds for the construction of affordable housing to replace what was lost. That was mostly with vouchers. We did have some project-based vouchers in the amount of a couple of thousand, but if the gentleman will go back to that bill, he will note frequently in the debate we alluded in that debate to this bill. That is, much of the rental housing in New Orleans was destroyed. The rental housing was destroyed in much of the gulf. 
   This was always a two-bill approach, and the gentleman is simply wrong to state that in the hurricane bill we provided funds for additional affordable housing. We stated at the time, we set some rules about vouchers. We talked about public housing, but we were always clear it would be this bill that would provide the funds. 
   So the point that we already did this could not be more incorrect.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, on October 26, 2005, the House passed the GSE bill that came out of the committee chaired by Mr. Oxley that had a housing trust fund virtually identical to this one. This one is financed a little differently at the request of the Treasury Department, but it's essentially the same thing. 
   The vote was 331-90. Republicans voted in favor of this bill containing this housing tax 209-15, and among those who joined in the majority, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions). So I appreciate his concern for this. It did not appear to be evident in October of 2005 when he joined 208 of his Republican colleagues in voting for essentially this same fund.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by again asking the indulgence of the House for my less than usual sartorial splendor, but the cast on my left arm would misalign my jacket, and I wouldn't want to wear a suit unless I could do it full justice. So I am wearing a sweater that Mr. Rogers no longer needs. 
   The bill before us today is a version of a bill that came before this House in October of 2005 after a lot of work by the former chairman, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. OXLEY), and many of us now on the committee. That bill passed the House by a vote of 331-90. Many of those who voted in opposition, myself included, were motivated to it by a specific provision regarding the affordable housing fund that is no longer in the bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, the bill has two major components. First, it significantly increases the strength of the regulator of the two major Federal housing government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It also deals with the Federal Home Loan System. That was seen as less in need of drastic change. There is, in fact, less change there. There will be an amendment regarding that offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kanjorski), which I strongly support, to increase public participation in that system. But this is a bill fundamentally about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
   There is general agreement among a wide range of parties that this bill, building on the bill that Mr. OXLEY brought to the floor, does do what needs to be done in creating a strong regulator. There are some controversial elements here, but very few deal with the powers of the regulator that we have set up. And I am pleased that the Treasury Department, Under Secretary Paulson and Under Secretary Steel, has agreed. In fact, this is a bill which, with regard to regulation and the regulator, is a little bit stronger than the one we passed a few years ago. We had some negotiations. They were useful, and we have a fully empowered regulator here, independently funded and empowered to do whatever needs to be done to deal with any safety and soundness issues that arise from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
   The most controversial areas of the bill involve a provision that was also in the bill when it last passed, and that is an affordable housing fund. A number of people have argued over the years that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac receive from the Federal Government advantages which help them borrow money cheaply in the market, and that is true. There is a connection between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the Federal Government. Those who borrow that money thinking that the Federal Government guarantees it are wrong. There is no Federal guarantee implicit, explicit, or any other way. But it is the case that the market does see these entities in a very favorable light and lends them money at a somewhat lower rate than other entities can borrow. The reason for its having been set up that way was to try to help housing, especially home ownership because these entities buy the mortgages and help bring down the cost of mortgages, but they have also been given for years goals by the law where they are particularly to help lower income housing. 
   Now, a number of people have argued over the years that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's shareholders, and in the past some of their executives, received too large a share of those benefits. The argument was, with some accuracy, that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac benefited very much and not enough of that reached the public. 
   There are two ways you could deal with that. You could reduce the benefits that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac get. Some people have advocated that. Alternatively, you could do what this bill does: leave the existing situation which provides some benefits to them but increase the share of those benefits that go for public purposes. We do that in two ways in this bill: First of all, and this does not appear to be terribly controversial, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have statutorily imposed goals. Some people have said these are private corporations and you shouldn't tell them what to do. Well, we have been doing that for a very long time. They are told that they must, in purchasing mortgages in the secondary market, make certain purchases that  help certain goals, low income housing, et cetera. We increase those goals. Secretary Jackson at HUD had been critical of them for not doing enough. We increase both the mechanism by which they held to those goals and the goals themselves.     
   But the newly controversial element to this is the Affordable Housing Fund. I say newly controversial because an affordable housing fund virtually identical to this one, financed through a different formula, but essentially the same in the amount of money and in the function, was in the bill that passed the House in October of 2005. At that time, the Republicans in the House voted for it 209-15. Now Members having once had an opinion are not required to hold it forever. But I do note that in October of 2005, 209 Republicans voted for the bill that had an affordable housing fund. Now that the fund has been, in the minds of some, transmogrified into all kinds of things which it is not. In economic terms, it very likely reduces the return, not by a huge amount, to Fannie and Freddie shareholders. Some have argued that it is going to raise the cost of mortgages. But ironically, many of those who argued that this will raise the cost of mortgages have supported even greater restrictions on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, particularly by limiting their portfolios, which would have many, many times greater impact on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's profitability, and therefore, their ability to help mortgages, than the Affordable Housing Fund. 
   The affordable housing fund takes some of the profit that Fannie and Freddie make, arguably a part of what they get from their Federal benefits, and said that it will be used for the construction of affordable housing. We have a serious crisis in America and a lack of affordable housing. We have been dealing with this for years by vouchers. Vouchers add to the demand for housing, but an annual voucher cannot create new housing, it does not add to the supply. We have a mechanism here where, without impinging on the Federal budget, without adding a penny to the deficit, in an entirely self-paid way, we take some money from Fannie and Freddie which reflects some of the benefit they get from their Federal arrangements and we recycle it into affordable housing. In the first year, all of that money, maybe $500 million, will go to Louisiana and Mississippi under this bill to replace the severe destruction of housing that has not yet been replaced a year and a half after the terrible hurricanes there. 
   For the future, the bill says it should be used for affordable housing annually, but leads to a later decision by this House and the Senate, I say optimistically, hoping we can get a decision from the Senate, and then to be signed by the President as to how to further distribute it. It creates the concept of an affordable housing fund. But we had in our committee various arguments. Some people wanted it to go through HUD, some through the State housing agencies. I believe that is a decision that we should make collectively, first in our committee, and then on the floor. 
   But we are not here doing anything other than saying the money will be available for a subsequent decision by the House that it will be spent. We do say that it has to be spent for housing, for bricks and mortar. 
   And there are going to be amendments that are going to be offered, let me say we tried to put safeguards in here against abuse. There are several amendments being offered, the minority whip has one, the gentleman from Texas, Mr. McCaul, has one, and some others have amendments, that will further tighten the constraints on this fund. I intend to argue for the acceptance of several of those amendments, at least three, that further tighten up the use of the fund. And I believe we will have accomplished that. 
   The question then will be, given that Fannie and Freddie get great benefits from the Federal Government, given that we have a housing shortage and a budget crunch in this country, does it make sense to take several hundred million dollars of the profits of Fannie and Freddie, which are enhanced by their Federal regulations and rules, and make them available for affordable housing? I believe the answer should be yes. 
   Virtually every entity involved with housing in America, from low-income housing advocates to the nonprofit and religious groups that help build housing, to the home builders and the realtors and the mortgage bankers, all support the notion of beginning to get the Federal Government back in the business of trying to do some affordable housing. 
   I hope that we can go forward with the bill. I do note we had 36 amendments; a couple I believe will be ruled nongermane. Nine or 10 I hope will be accepted without any controversy, including about five from each party. I did note that many of the others, about 18 of the others, are various ways of accomplishing three essential goals, making sure that illegal immigrants don't get the housing, either abolishing the fund altogether or restricting it. 
   I would hope that we could work out among ourselves some kind of representational thing so that we don't have to vote on all 18 amendments, many of which are duplicative of the others. And if we are able to work that out, I believe we will be able to get the bill through. 
   There is an important decision to be made about affordable housing. I believe many of the other issues the House previously voted on, I don't think there's a lot of controversy. We do have an important, legitimate, philosophic discussion about affordable housing. I am hoping that between us, we can structure things so we will have a couple of strong votes on that and we can send the bill forward. 
   Mr. Chairman, I submit the following correspondence:

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.  
   Mr. Chairman, I am disappointed frankly at a number of inaccuracies in my colleague's statement. In the first place, with regard to Katrina, the bill that we passed had zero money for new construction, and if he will go back, he apparently forgot, he will see we constantly said during the Katrina bill that we intended to provide the new housing construction money through this bill. 
   His assertion that there is some duplication could not be more wrong. We were very clear then. The Katrina bill dealt with vouchers. It had one 4,500-unit section with regard to some project vouchers. But throughout the Katrina bill, it was clear that it was a two-step process. This was the second step. There is zero duplication. Nothing in that Katrina bill did any significant increase in housing construction. 
   Secondly, he notes that I and the gentleman from California and the others voted against the bill last time, as I said earlier today, for one specific reason. The Rules Committee, over the objection of the Committee on Financial Services at that time, injected into the housing fund amendments that would have kept the Catholic Church and the Methodists and all the other religious organizations that were interested in building housing from participating. 
   We had one very specific objection. At that time the fund was going to be administered directly by Fannie and Freddie. There was a fear that they would use it politically. So one specific amendment was put in by the Rules Committee, we weren't even allowed to vote on it on the floor, and it would have restricted religious groups from participating. For that reason only, we voted against the bill. Since this does not allow Fannie and Freddie to spend the funds, that is out there. That is why we are being perfectly consistent in now voting for it. 
   The gentleman from Alabama, everything he said about the housing fund was in the bill he and 208 other Republicans voted for in 2005. Every single thing. 
   The gentleman has told me that he is philosophically opposed to the Housing Trust Fund. Then why did they all vote for it, those who share that opposition, 2 years ago? 
   The final thing, the gentleman from Illinois is here. The gentleman from Alabama inaccurately said we were raising FHA fees. In fact, the FHA under the Bush administration asked us to raise fees. Last year, the House passed a bill that would have allowed them to raise fees. The gentleman from California and I objected to some of those increases. Our bill restricts the FHA's ability to raise fees above what they wanted. In fact, what we got was an amendment at that markup from the gentleman from Illinois substituting last year's bill that most of the Republicans voted for. That would have allowed the FHA to raise fees far more than us. 
   So I don't understand how the gentleman from Alabama, who voted with the gentleman from Illinois to allow the FHA to raise fees further now blames us when we passed a bill that would have restricted their ability to raise fees above what they wanted. Maybe people got to go back and look at what they voted for and look at what they offered. The staff will have time. We have time to do that. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), an alumni of our committee who despite having left us still thinks of us from time to time, and she's one of the originators of the notion of an Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I would take it to say that we often focus on what we disagree on. Let's be clear. 
   We agree on the strongest regulator that you could possibly have and still be workable. The gentleman from Louisiana is here, he was one of those who started on it; the gentleman from Ohio who has left, Mr. Oxley. Many of us worked on this. We will be arguing about the housing fund. 
   But let's be clear that what this House will be doing overwhelmingly is create a strong regulator. As to the affordable housing fund, I would just say this, the notion that all of this comes out of the mortgages and not out of the shareholders is bad economics. Fannie and Freddie do not have monopoly power such that they can pass on every cost to the customer and absorb none of it themselves.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I thank the gentleman. First of all, let me say, given that our staffs have worked this out, it would be a good thing for neither one of us to mess it up. I have read it over. It does correctly reinforce the point this is not creating any new governmental involvement. We don't want anyone to misinterpret this. 
   This is not to increase regulation, not to increase any kind of entitlement or entanglement. I thank the gentleman for this initiative. I very much agree this ought to go on the Record as something that is universally agreed to in the Congress.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   I appreciate the gentleman for offering this. This is the central question we will be debating today, and I realize we are going to be debating it in a number of forums, I hope not all 17 that are offered, but several. 
   There was a legitimate question here. I have to say I do want to defend my friend, the gentleman from Alabama, from my friend, the gentleman from California, who said that anybody who would support such an idea is advocating socialism. I do not think the gentleman from Alabama was advocating socialism when he joined 208 other Republicans in voting for the Housing Trust Fund 2 years ago. I think that's a little bit excessive. 
   We have, I think, some economic disputes here. First of all, the notion that all of this money, $500 million, roughly 5 percent of the profits of the two institutions together, the notion that all of it will be passed along to the people who take out the mortgages, the banks and everybody else, incorrectly assumes that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have a degree of pricing power that virtually allows them to set prices however they wish. 
   In fact, there was a time when they had a very large share of the market, and might have had such monopoly power. They no longer do. There is economic competition. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not the only games in town. The notion that this will all get passed along and none of it go to the shareholders is faulty economics. 
   In fact, this will come out of the profits of these institutions, and it will, I believe, reduce the return of the shareholders. Now, I think that's legitimate. These are institutions that receive significant benefits because of various Federal laws and the way those laws are interpreted by the market. 
   We say that they shouldn't keep all of the benefits. By the way, those who believe this ought not just to be opposing the Affordable Housing Fund. We have long had goals of, affordable housing goals, which dictate to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that they must buy certain kinds of loans rather than others. We have got that to the point where they have to give preference to people whose incomes are at 80 percent and medium and below. That also impinges upon the profitability of Fannie Mae. 
   In other words, the argument is that anything that impinges on the argument of Fannie and Freddie will automatically be passed along to the home buyers. I think that's faulty economics. But if you think that's true, then why are you supporting, I would ask the Members on the other side, the housing goals. 
   Why would Members be voting for the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey, which would severely restrict the portfolio? Eighty-five percent of the profits of Fannie Mae are being made on the portfolio. Now many on the administration and many on the other side want to severely restrict the portfolio, reduce it or say they can only be used for the lowest income mortgages. 
   That amendment, which many on the other side apparently plan to vote for, would have a far more serious impact on the profitability of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac than on this housing fund by 8, 10 times as much. It is simply inconsistent to argue that you cannot impinge on the profitability of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac without hurting the average mortgage buyer, and then  be for this much more significant impact on the profitability, and the economics are the same. 
   The argument is no direct pass-through here. The argument is that if you impinge on that profitability, they will raise their prices. First of all, the answer is, of course, they wish. They wish they had that kind of pricing power. I don't think they do. 
   To the extent that there is some impact, it will be far more greatly achieved if the amendment were to be adopted by the gentleman from New Jersey and other efforts to restrict the portfolio. 
   The gentleman from Alabama also said we have all these other housing programs. No. We do not have enough programs currently being funded that build affordable housing for families. We have 202 for the elderly. We have 811 for the disabled, both of which the administration has tried to cut back. 
   We are not building public housing. We have the voucher program. The voucher program, on an annual basis, adds to the demand for housing in a way that does not increase supply. There is not now a generally funded affordable housing construction program for families, for working people. 
   So the notion, and I would challenge Members who say there is duplication, show me which program this duplicates. It doesn't restrict it to the elderly and the disabled. It is a general family affordable housing program. That's what we think we should get into. It does it without taking money from the general Treasury. It pays for itself. 
   Finally, people have said, well, how is it going to be spent? We made this point very clear. 
   In the first year, it will go to Mississippi and Louisiana State authorities. Subsequently, none of it will be spent until a second bill passes this House and the Senate, and we will collectively decide how to spend it. I know there are people who think the Federal Government should provide affordable housing. That's the only argument for this amendment.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I fully agree with my friend from North Carolina. 
   I rise only on one specific factual point. The gentleman from North Carolina said this would levy 1.2 basis points on the mortgages. That's in lieu of a profit. The Treasury asked us to change it. 
   The gentleman from North Carolina said 1.2 basis points. That's equivalent to a 1.2 percent tax. No, that's 100 times wrong. A basis point is one one-hundredth of 1 percent. So 1.2 basis points is not 1.2 percent as the gentleman said, but .012 percent.

   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose the amendment. 
   Sometimes I am more impressed with the gentleman's work product than others. He just made a misstatement of his own amendment, if I have the right amendment. He says, instead of putting it in the Affordable Housing Fund, put it into Social Security. 
   Nothing in this amendment does that. This amendment says that if there is a deficit in the Federal budget, then you don't put the money from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into the Affordable Housing Fund. It does not say you put it anywhere else. It is unrelated. It simply says that if you don't have enough money to meet the deficit, then you don't take money that would not otherwise go to the deficit. 
   There is no connection between the money being spent from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This one is scored at zero by CBO; so, not spending the Affordable Housing Fund would in no way reduce the deficit. 
   I would yield to the gentleman if he would show me where in his amendment it says that, if we don't spend on affordable housing, we would put it into reducing the deficit. I am reading the amendment. There is nothing like that in here. I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I take back my time. The gentleman has now acknowledged that his statement was not accurate. The gentleman has now acknowledged that nothing in his amendment does anything about the deficit. He says it is a two-step dance. It is a Kabuki dance. It is a Dance of Seven Veils. It has got an unrepresentative argument here. 
   Nothing in this puts the money into Social Security. There is nothing in here that would do that. What it says is, let's not put any money into affordable housing from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac if there is a deficit. 
   Frankly, the gentleman did not, it seems to me, clearly represent his amendment. He says it is a two-step dance. Is he proposing that we would then take the money from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the 1.2 basis points, not 1.2 percent, and put that into the Social Security Trust Fund? He has now acknowledged that nothing in his amendment would help Social Security. I guess we will learn later what is the second step of the dance. 
   I am kind of older; I used to watch Arthur and Kathryn Murray teach dance, but I don't think even they could have taught us how this is going to spin into putting money into Social Security. So this amendment is a perfect definition of a non sequitur.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I take back my time. That is absolutely untrue. I have never asked people to trust me. If he is talking about spending affordable housing later, what I have said is it will be spent in accordance with a bill to be passed by the Congress. That is not trusting me. 
   And I have never said that one thing was going to accomplish the other. We have said we would set some money aside and later decide how to spend it. It doesn't do that here. It leaves the money with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This isn't public money. It is a non sequitur. I repeat. 
   It says we have a deficit in Social Security. That is too bad. Let's keep fighting the war in Iraq for hundreds of billions of dollars, let's keep doing all these other things, but let's not take money from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that would not otherwise contribute a penny to Social Security and spend it on affordable housing.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I'm disappointed in the gentleman from Illinois, having yielded to him, refused the same courtesy. It's my time, the gentleman from Georgia's time. 
   I never asked anyone to trust me. He repeats that. It is simply inaccurate. 
   I've said that I thought we should set some money aside for low income housing, a specific purpose, low income housing, and then in a later bill, not me personally, but the Congress, decide how best to disburse it. That is hardly saying trust me and I'm disappointed. The gentleman generally it seems to me is fairer than that. 
   Secondly, he says higher priority. Again, this is fantasyland. Nothing in his amendment does a penny for Social Security. And he says temporarily suspend. Hit the pause button until the deficit is over. 
   Let's be very straightforward. That means kill it forever. There's no pause here. No one is assuming that the deficit is going to be ended within the next 7 or 8 years, so the argument that the gentleman makes that it is more important to do Social Security trust fund than the housing fund is irrelevant because nothing, nothing in the gentleman's amendment puts a penny into the Social Security. It's one more way to kill the affordable housing fund reflecting an ideological opposition to the existence of the Federal Government helping build affordable housing.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, that, I must say, totally disappoints me. For the third time the gentleman has tried to put words in my mouth. The words ``trust in me,'' the gentleman read that, and the gentleman's distortion, systematic distortion, has gone beyond what I can deal with in a brief intervention. But I will say this: I continually said we should address that in separate legislation. If the gentleman doesn't know the difference between passing legislation which sets guidelines and saying ``trust me,'' then the gentleman understands less in this place than I had hoped he did.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Illinois apparently misremembered something. He looked diligently to try to find what he said, and he couldn't find what he imputed to me. I never said ``trust in me.'' I didn't imply it. His subtext notion makes as little sense as his argument that we are going to somehow help Social Security in an amendment that doesn't touch Social Security. 
   What I said repeatedly was I want to reserve this now because I think this bill will not be vetoed and we will get the reservation, and for budgetary purposes, CBO scoring, it is a better way to do it, and we will then pass a separate piece of legislation. And his equation of my calling for a separate piece of legislation with my saying ``trust in me'' falls below the level that I had thought we would debate here. 
   I would again repeat, the gentleman from Alabama eloquently said let's start now. Let's do this. I want to be very clear, Mr. Chairman. I have never stopped him. The gentleman from Alabama had a new-found passion to help Social Security. Where is his amendment doing that? Where is his legislation doing that? This notion of let's get to Social Security, the central point is: The gentleman from Illinois' amendment does not put one penny into Social Security. Passing it would not help it. It would kill this fund forever. 
   What we have had is a variety of amendments. This is the fifth one tonight that finds a different way to kill affordable housing. The gentleman from Alabama was straightforward. He said he just wanted to kill it. So this has nothing to do with Social Security. It has to do with killing the Affordable Housing Trust Fund. 
   And I would just add this, and I thank the gentleman from Colorado for yielding, I find it somewhat ironic that Members who continue to support spending hundreds of billions of dollars on that terrible war in Iraq, which does America more harm than good, lecture me because we are going to spend half a billion dollars a year on Affordable Housing Fund out of nontax funds. Yes, let's do something about Social Security. Let's do something about the war in Iraq. Let's do something about other wasteful programs. But to take $500 million, I didn't see this concern for Social Security when we were doing the defense budget. I didn't see it when we did the authorization earlier today. I didn't see it when we were adding money. 
   I must be very clear, Mr. Chairman, within the rules, I am unpersuaded that the real motive of Members here is to do anything about Social Security. It is clear if you look at this pattern, they don't like the notion of the Federal Government's helping to build affordable housing, even if we do it, as we have succeeded in finding a way to do it in this bill, in a way that has no impact on the taxpayer, no impact on Social Security, and no negative consequences on the other government programs.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I do not think we are ready to put this into a nationwide operation at this point. It has a great deal to commend it, and the gentleman is right to talk about pilot projects. 
   In the Committee on Financial Services we have created a task force, headed by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter), to look at all housing programs to promote energy efficiency. This is something that we should have looked at a while ago. We have been late. There are some various programs. There are some in public housing. We tried to put some into the FHA. The chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee, my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. Olver), is interested in doing this, along with the gentleman from California in HOPE VI. 
   What I think would be best would be if we could defer this now and give it some study. There are some implications for how you carry it. There are some fairly specific calculations. It is one thing when you do it in a pilot project; it is another for Fannie and Freddie to do this nationally. And, of course, they don't do it directly. They do it through their various lenders. 
   So while I think in concept this is something we should be moving towards, I would hope we could do some further work on it. It is our expectation to bring out an overall housing energy promotion bill sometime this fall, and this would be an ideal candidate for inclusion in that. 
   I yield to my friend.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I will yield to the gentleman at the end. 
   First, let me say to the gentleman from Louisiana, I agree with him in many ways. Yes, they haven't done enough. I do find a great inconsistency, not on the part of the gentleman from Louisiana, who has been completely consistent on this issue for years, but first, we were being told that we should not interfere with the profitability of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac because we would be driving up the cost for middle-income homeowners. We heard that in several of the arguments in trying to get rid of the Affordable Housing Fund. 
   Now we have a much more serious attack on the ability of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to help middle-income homeowners. This says no more middle-income homeowners, only people below the median. We were told before that if we took $500 million from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's profits each year, we would inevitably be driving up the cost for middle-income borrowers. This would reduce Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's profits by 7, 8, 10 times that amount. They get most of their profit from things held in the portfolio.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Regular order, Mr. Chairman. I yielded to the gentleman. 
   I have said that I do not think it is my intent or anybody else's intent that will override the economics of the situation. I do not think we can legislate that it comes either out of this or out of that. The money is fungible. My view is that in the competitive situation in which they find themselves, much of this will come out of shareholders' profits. Some may come out of the banks and others they deal with. 
   The point I am making is this: The gentleman and others on the Republican side argue, they were arguing before about a mortgage tax increase. They kept saying we are going to raise the cost of mortgages, not by anything we did directly. Their argument was that when you reduce the profitability of these entities, they will be driven to raise their prices and that will cost other people more. 
   I believe they are far more constrained in their ability to raise prices. I don't think they are holding prices down now out of love. I think they are getting them up as high as they can now in the competitive situation. 
   But if you believe that reducing their profits will cause them to increase their prices and thus hurt other people, in this amendment that has a much greater impact of that kind than the housing fund, because this restriction on the portfolio will cause a far greater reduction in the profit than 1.2 basis points. And it again emphasizes to me that what we have are people who don't like the Affordable Housing Fund, because they have had various contradictory ways of trying to get rid of it. Now, the gentleman from Louisiana is correct, they haven't done enough to help low income people. 
   One of the things we do in this bill is to greatly increase the goals. We impose goals on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which also reduce their profitability. We tell them to do more of this kind of thing and we increase the enforcement mechanism for doing it. So we do try to increase the goals in the enforcement mechanism and we create the Affordable Housing Fund. 
   I would say this: Maybe they shouldn't have created these hybrids in the first place. They are part profit making and part with the public enterprise. It is hard to run them that way, I understand that. That is why many of us decided that we will try to get them in the direction of helping low income people, but given the pull of profit, some of what we should do is to take a piece of the profit and put it directly into affordable housing.  
   That is why we have a hybrid solution dealing with a hybrid. That is why I hope the amendment is defeated.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman, and I will yield to my friend from New Jersey after I have propounded a question. 
   My position consistently today has been that it is not possible with absolute specificity to say an enterprise is paying for this out of this pot or that pot or the other pot. I do believe most of this will come from the shareholders. 
   But people on the other side argue no, reducing the profitability by $500 million a year for both enterprises, levying 1.2 basis points on the portfolio, was going to raise the mortgage rates for the middle class. For people who believe that, I want them to explain to me how reducing the portfolio so substantially would not cost even more to the middle class? 
   Again, Members said taking $500 million in profit, 1.2 basis points on the portfolio, would raise the rates on the middle class. I assume it doesn't do it specifically. It does it by reducing the profitability and inducing them to raise prices. 
   Since it would reduce profitability by many multiples of the housing fund, why would it not have a much greater effect? 
   I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Excuse me, I am taking back my time to apologize for apparently not being clear in my question. I wasn't talking about cross-subsidization. Here is the point. I would have thought it was clearer, and I apologize for my inarticulateness. 
   The argument was that by taking $500 million from profits, 1.2 basis points on the portfolio, we would be reducing profitability and inducing the enterprises to raise prices and therefore that would be a mortgage tax. 
   The gentleman's amendment would reduce the profitability by far more than $500 million a year. It would be a far greater levy on them than 1.2 basis points. Now, the mechanism by which they claim that the fund is a mortgage tax is that as you reduce their profitability, they are driven to raise prices and that will cost more. 
   Now, it has nothing to do with cross-subsidy. Why does an amendment which would substantially reduce the profitability not have an even greater effect in terms of the middle class, who would not be benefiting from the portfolio, in raising what they have to pay? 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Chair will remind Members that the Member  who has the time decides whether to yield.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   There has literally been no Member of the House who has been more dedicated to helping those who are in trouble than the gentleman from Texas. He represents a community that is a model community: Houston. 
   We don't always show neighborliness in reaching out to others. The city of Houston, its mayor, its congressional delegation, its citizens, its police department, has known an extraordinary degree of compassion for fellow human beings in trouble. There are few examples in this country's history of one community reaching out as generously as the people of Houston have to the people who were forced to evacuate the gulf, particularly Louisiana. 
   The gentlewoman from California and I listened to the gentleman from Texas, and we put some language into the bill that we did last time on the hurricane. 
   On this one, at this point I would ask the gentleman to withdraw his amendment. We appreciate what has gone on. The destruction was greater in Mississippi and Louisiana. There are still unmet needs in Texas. We appreciate that. We have done something, and I acknowledge we have not done enough. 
   I promise the gentleman, we will continue to work with him to that end, but we have commitments in terms of the physical reconstruction to go to these two States. 
   There will be further years in this bill. Texas continues, particularly Houston, to have a big claim on us, and we will continue to try to work with the gentleman to try to resolve it, but we hope not to do it in a kind of zero-sum situation.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, the author of the amendment clearly indicates he would like to kill the housing fund altogether. He voted to do that in several  ways. We had several votes to do that. We're going to have about 10 votes on the same issue on this bill. I don't know, there's seven different ways to kill your lover. We have about 11 different ways to try to kill the affordable housing fund. Some of them contradict each other because they are joined only by the common opposition to the Federal Government constructing affordable housing. This bill continues that, this amendment, because the key change it makes is to strike the provision that says it will be used for the construction of affordable rental housing and says only vouchers. Now, the vouchers are useful as part of a balanced program. But the vouchers now have been, under the Republicans policy, annual vouchers. We haven't been able to change that yet. Maybe we will.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Well, I will then take back my time. The gentleman chides me apparently for telling the truth. I have the amendment as printed. I am reading the amendment. He says where in it is the voucher program? Here on page 2 on lines 2, 3 and 4. And it's not very arcane. Let me read it. Affordable housing fund grant amounts of a grantee for any year after 2007 shall be eligible for use or for commitment for use only for rental housing voucher assistance in accordance with paragraph 19. 
   Now, I apologize to the gentleman for reading his amendment. I had previously to apologize to the gentleman from Illinois for reading his amendment. The gentleman corrected me incorrectly.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I take back my time. I've yielded to the gentleman for varying explanations of his varying amendments. But I want to talk about the one we have. First of all, I do not give consent because we had a pre-filing deadline precisely so that we can study these things. They are somewhat complicated. I think having them come right off the top of people's heads, particularly at 10 o'clock at night, after we've debated the same issue about seven times, it's not a good idea to come up with something brand new. 
   Here's the amendment. It says only vouchers, and it says it in several places, that it's for vouchers. And here's the problem with vouchers. He says it's still better than constructing housing. No, it is not, because a voucher program helps you compete for existing rental housing. But an annual voucher program, which is referenced in this bill, in this amendment, does not give you the ability to build new housing. 
   In parts of this country there is a housing shortage, that's a problem. In the gulf it's a problem because the housing was destroyed. So when you only do vouchers and do not help build affordable housing, you run into that problem. 
   Now, under our proposal, communities would have the ability to make choices. But what the gentleman says is in parts of the country where there is already a shortage of physical affordable housing, all his amendment would do would be to drive up the price by increasing the demand for it without in any way adding to the supply. 
   Now the gentleman's apparently acknowledged the flaws in the amendment by trying to modify it after he had previously submitted it. I don't believe this kind of last minute changes ought to be made at this point. And so we are left with the flawed amendment. 
   I understand the gentleman's desire to kind of disown it. But the fact is, it is what it is. And a voucher-only program does not add to affordable housing supply and that's what we need.

I would agree between now and when we get to conference to give a first preference to disabled homeless veterans. I have two problems with this amendment. First of all, it is not clear that there are that many disabled homeless veterans to absorb 800 million a year. If there are you could deal with it. 
   But secondly, I do not think in many parts of the country, including my own, that if you only did vouchers you would be doing enough for them. I'd like to build some housing, some with supportive services. But I will give the gentleman my commitment that in the final bill we should be giving a very high preference to disabled homeless veterans.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I also want to strike a few misconceptions. First, the gentleman quite inaccurately said that the money here is authorized with no direction about how it is spent. The only money that will be spent if the bill becomes law, unless there is further action by the Congress of the United States, is the money that will go to Mississippi and Alabama, and the bill is quite clear that that will go to the States of Mississippi and Alabama. No further expenditures will be authorized until a second bill goes forward describing how they will be done. So the bill does describe how they will be done for Mississippi and Alabama. And, yes, there will be a second bill that will, we believe, describe how this money will be spent. 
   Secondly, he said we are reaching down to corporations like Exxon and taking their money. Well, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are very different than other corporations. They are federally chartered and have very specific Federal advantages. So, no, there is not an analogy between directing them and, in fact, other corporations, as was recognized, for instance, by Secretary Jackson of HUD as he began to criticize them for not doing enough in their affordable housing goals.     
   But the more important issue I have to say, Mr. Chairman, is I am somewhat puzzled by the, I don't know if it's a clash of egos or what, the inability of people on the other side to coordinate. 
   There were four separate amendments that seek to do exactly the same thing. Yes, we agree; people who are in the country illegally should not be the beneficiaries of this program. In fact, we accepted the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Boozman) who says that very clearly. It does say that you can't be here unless you are here legally, and says that the director shall issue requirements calling for sufficient evidence to show that. Now, one difference between that amendment and this one is this one gets people back into the controversy over the REAL ID Act. That was controversial when passed. A number of States, governors and legislatures have expressed disagreement. 
   Now, we already have accepted into the bill the amendment of the gentleman from Arkansas to deal with the question of keeping out people who are here illegally. Three other amendments, I guess people all want to get credit for the same thing, but one of the things they do is to get into the REAL ID Act. 
   So Members should understand that in voting for this amendment, you will be going beyond simply keeping people out of this program who are here illegally; we've already accepted an amendment directing that that be done. Instead, you will be getting the privilege of getting back into the controversy of the REAL ID Act. If you come from a State where that's not popular, then you get a chance to vote for it unnecessarily, since we already have the restriction. 
   Mr. Chairman, I will now yield to the gentleman from New Mexico.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I will take back my time to say yes, that's true. That is why the gentleman from Arkansas' amendment, which was adopted, sets forward the requirements. 
   This does mention the REAL ID Act. It is an affirmation of the REAL ID Act. It doesn't say it's the only way. But Members should understand, in adding this to what we have already accepted from the gentleman from Arkansas, what Members will be doing will be getting a chance to, once again, tell their State they may have a problem. Yes, we like the REAL ID Act and you've got to stick with the REAL ID Act. I don't understand why Members would want to reintroduce that controversy when we already have accepted an amendment that says there shall not be anybody in here who is not here legally. And it says, ``Regulations, as the director shall issue, setting forth requirements for sufficient evidence that they are lawfully present in the United States.'' 
   So we have an amendment that has been accepted that will be part of the bill if it becomes law that says you must, according to the director, be able to show, the gentleman said there are various ways to do it. Now, this bill gets more specific and it gives some examples, including, they said, the REAL ID Act. And I don't think all the Members are eager once again to take a position about the REAL ID Act in the face of a lot of opposition from governors and legislatures when exactly the same purpose has been identified here. 
   You know, people used a cliche before, everybody's entitled to his own opinion, but everybody's not entitled to his own facts. But I guess on the Republican side, the rule is everybody is entitled to his own amendment on a popular issue, because we have four identically on this. We had 11 on the fund. We have six on something else.  
   Now, far be it from me to try to get them to coordinate, but we're going to be here for a couple more hours mostly debating amendments that were offered by people on the same subject of a previous amendment, some of which were offered because somebody didn't get the credit for it. So maybe this isn't the REAL ID Act, it's the ``Real-Credit-For-Me Act.'' And we already have in the bill, as I said, an amendment that accomplishes this purpose.

   I would say the other language that the gentleman from Georgia was talking about does not have this direction. It directs the director to require sufficient evidence that they are lawfully present in the United States. Yes, I do think some flexibility is there. 
   And while the gentleman from Georgia wants to back away from the REAL ID Act, if you vote for his amendment, you are once again reaffirming the REAL ID Act and saying only drivers licenses from those States are good, and it specifically gives very great prominence to the REAL ID Act, as opposed to telling the director, with some flexibility as things change, to accomplish the same goal.

But I have said that there are a number of links, and everybody except the gentleman from New Mexico, apparently agrees that government-sponsored, enterprises, we do many things to them that we wouldn't do to a purely private corporation. They have a line of credit, they have a supervisory board. There is no OFEHO for private corporations. So, no; we treat them very differently, because they continue to be linked to the government, than other corporations in a variety of ways, including giving them housing goals, having OFEHO set up, giving them a line of credit and doing other things. They are subject to many more restrictions than a purely private corporation.

   If you are not for a complicated amendment, adding some language to a disclosure that is somewhat controversial, you are anti-American. I hope the debate bounces up from here. 
   I would then also say to the gentleman from Georgia, my colleague from Georgia quite correctly pointed out that his amendment would call on people to reaffirm the value of the REAL ID Act. And it is true that the REAL ID Act is only one of four things, but some Americans don't have passports. In fact, the majority of American citizens don't have passports.

   My problem with the answer the gentleman from Texas gave my friend from North Carolina is he voted for the amendment from the gentleman from Alabama to kill this fund before he knew whether his amendment would be accepted or not. 
   The gentleman says he doesn't know anybody in this body who would turn his back on communities. He has a far more limited circle of acquaintances than I would have thought for someone who had been here this long. 
   The fact, though, is that the amendment from the gentleman from Alabama would have, if it passed, killed the fund. The gentleman from Texas voted for it. Had he been successful in that vote, there would be no fund for him now to ask for. 
   Now, I thought my friend from Mississippi who has been an eloquent and passionate defender of the interests of all the people in the gulf made a very good point. As I said to the gentleman from Houston, Mr. Green, yes, I think we should look at the needs of Texas. We did some in the hurricane bill in terms of vouchers. 
   I'm prepared, if this bill gets to conference, to accommodate. We may have underestimated the physical destruction in parts of Texas. I don't think we should now pick a number, but no one had approached me. Mr. Green from Texas had approached me, and I said I would work with him. I would be glad to work on it. 
   I do think when the gentleman says we couldn't expect him to vote for a housing fund that ignored his community, he voted to abolish that fund before he knew what would happen to his amendment. Maybe he just thought the die was cast, but I'm perfectly prepared to work on this. 
   I hope the amendment is defeated. I don't expect the gentleman to withdraw it, and I would be glad to then look at the arguments about how much destruction there was in Texas, and I would undertake to find some way to try to help in Texas. Of course, the gentleman will probably vote against the whole bill, and if he succeeds, I won't be able to help him, but you can't help everybody all the time. All you can do is offer. 
   So I hope that we do get a bill through, that it has the housing fund. I hope this amendment is defeated, but I do think that when we look at the concentrated destruction in the part of Texas, something not statewide, and the reason we did Mississippi and Louisiana was we felt the destruction there was more statewide, not the whole State, but it was fairly widely distributed. It would appear there was a more narrow geographic impact in Texas, and I would think that is worth looking at. 
   And if the housing fund survives the four or five more Republican efforts to kill it, chop it, dice it and slice it, which are probably coming in their infinite list of amendments, and we do get it to conference, I will be glad to work with the gentleman. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I am going to insist on my point of order. 
   I am moved, and I mean this, by the eloquence of these arguments for adequately funded public service. I hope all Members will listen to this. 
   But unfortunately, this is beyond the scope of this bill, which is housing related. I, therefore, must insist on the point of order, not out of lack of sympathy for my two colleagues, but because if we open the floodgates, we would get swamped. So I do insist on the point of order. It is not germane.

   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Without further discussion, the Chair is prepared to rule. 
   The amendment offered by the gentleman from California provides funding for various infrastructure projects, including law enforcement and public education. 
   The bill is confined to housing and housing-related matters. Clause 7 of rule XVI precludes amendments on a subject different from that under consideration. 
   In the opinion of the Chair, the infrastructure projects addressed in the amendment represent a subject matter different from that under consideration. As such, the amendment is not germane. 
   The point of order is sustained.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I thank the gentleman, and he and I have been working together on a lot of this. I am glad he is going to withdraw it and we won't be proceeding further, but I would note that a number of recent developments in the mortgage field have made it clear that securitization is not the absolute unmixed blessing that people once thought it was. There are advantages to portfolio and there are some disadvantages. There are obviously advantages in terms of liquidity being created through securitization, but there are some problems. So I thank the gentleman for raising this issue, and it is one we will continue to work.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is another version of the effort to kill the fund. It is very similar to amendments we have had before. I will ask Members to draw on their memories. I think at this point they would try to remember than stay up an extra 10 minutes listening to the debate very similar to what they have had before. 
   It is subject to the frailty which the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Watt) pointed out before, since we have had a similar amendment before; namely, that it would give to the Director the right to cancel this. It doesn't ask just for information from  the Director for us to take into account when we do this after the sunset; it empowers the Director to end it. 
   And it also says: Will not result in increased costs to borrowers on their residential mortgages. 
   There may be a de minimis cost increase. The way this is worded, a director would have to find that there would be no cost increase at all, not 10 cents, not $1 a mortgage. 
   I do not think it is intended mainly to deal with the soundness of the enterprise; I think it is dealing, once again, with an effort to try to kill the fund, which we have had five or six votes on already and a couple of more pending amendments. 
   The other factors, other than it might raise the cost of the mortgage, are already in the text of the bill and they are already factors that the Director is required to study. 
   So since we have talked about this before, I do not think at this hour anybody is going to bring any new knowledge. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   The question I have for the gentleman that was raised here, and he may have explained it as I was going over this. He did submit it in a timely fashion, so we should have checked it earlier.

In fact, if you find someone paying full tuition in a college, she is probably from another country. And if that parent wanted to buy a home for that student, I don't believe they would have to get a Social Security number; I believe under a student visa you might not be able to work.

What about a student lawfully in the U.S., under a student visa, whose parents in another country want to finance the purchase of that home? The student doesn't have a Social Security number, maybe under the visa can't work. I think that is the case. The student wouldn't be able to buy a home. 
   And I do agree that we should tighten up the rules on people here illegally, but as I read this I think it may sweep too far, impose too broad a mandate on Fannie and Freddie over things they can't control. And there may be other categories, but somebody here under a student visa whose family lives in another country, is prepared to finance the purchase of a home, it would appear to me that would make that impossible. 
   I yield to the gentleman.

   There will be some enforcement issues that we could work out, but I would hope we could more clearly define it; that is, I do think it's important that we say that this be confined to people who are illegally here. But relying on the Social Security number as the exclusive validator of someone's legal presence in the U.S. seems to me not good policy.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. The gentleman overstated what I said. I do agree as to B. I would say this, and B, I think is perfectly reasonable. I think it might be hard to administer, but I would certainly, I would want to agree to B. 
   I have a problem with A for this reason. We got CBO to score this. CBO scored it based on a tax reduction, and then there's a repayment in the REFCORP bonds. There's a fairly complicated proposal that we accepted from CBO to keep it revenue neutral, and it includes a tax deduction at one end, but a payment back at the other end. If the gentleman would be willing to ask unanimous consent to strike A, I would be prepared to be in favor of B. We could go back into the whole House, we could get unanimous consent. The problem is that if we strike A, I'm afraid it could unravel or scoring from CBO which assumes that they could deduct it and they would get the deduction, but CBO then said the government will lose money because you deducted it and we make up for another way with payments for the REFCORP bonds. I don't always understand what CBO says, but I can say that it's revenue neutral, recognizing the tax deduction, but making a payment that offsets that. 
   So if the gentleman would agree, I would certainly agree, because I think B is a reasonable effort to do this. I'm not sure how effective it will be, but I agree we should try. We are not sure about the pricing. I know procedurally we could do this, so if the gentleman would be agreeable, I would hope we could do that. If you would ask unanimous consent to modify the amendment by dropping A. If not, I will oppose this amendment, but I will move to, if I am successful in opposing it move to incorporate B when we get to conference. But I think a better way to do it would be to get unanimous consent to modify the amendment. 
   I will yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is not an entitlement. It isn't close to one. It cannot get out of control. The only money that can come from this is very clearly limited to 1.2 basis points on the mortgage portfolio of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
   The gentleman misstates the problem of entitlements if he thinks this is a problem. An entitlement is when the Federal Government, without necessarily a funding source, says if you are X, if you have these characteristics, you are entitled to this amount of money. That is Social Security and that is Medicare. That is not this bill. This bill does not entitle anybody to an affordable housing fund. It does not say if the population grows at a certain rate, then there is the demand for spending. It defines the spending source, a nontax spending source. It says 1.2 basis points of the mortgage portfolio. It doesn't entitle anyone to housing. 
   Social Security and Medicare, he mentioned. Those are entitlements. That means if you are a certain age and have a certain characteristic, you are entitled to receive the funding. 
   No one is entitled under this bill to receive housing funding. This is an authorization of spending, but it is not an entitlement to receive it. 
   Secondly, there is nothing secret here. It says it will be transferred if there is enacted a provision of Federal law establishing the Affordable Housing Trust Fund. That means it only becomes operational if this Congress decides in open session, with another 47 duplicate amendments from the Republican side, to deal with it. We will have a dozen roll calls to make sure that it happens. 
   I should also point this out. Why do we do it this way? To make sure we meet the PAYGO issue. This bill creates a fund out of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac profits. We have not yet got any consensus on how best to spend it after the first year when it goes to Louisiana and Mississippi. So we say to meet budgetary requirements, we don't want to be in a situation where we create a pot of money in one bill and then in the second bill decide how to spend it. This means that when we get to the collective decision in open session about how to spend it, whether it goes through the States, whether it is goes through HUD, whatever method we choose, we will not be charged with a source of funding. We will simply take the source of funding and hold it in limbo after Mississippi and Alabama and it will catch up if this Congress decides to do it with the method of distribution. That is not an entitlement. An entitlement is when you as an individual are legally entitled to receive money from the Federal Government because of your status. No one is entitled under this bill. No one gets the right to say I'm such and such, build me a house, rent me an apartment. This says a fixed sum will go at a limited rate, a percentage of the mortgage portfolio, and Congress will decide how it will be distributed.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I very much resent the gentleman from Texas simply doubting my words so blatantly. You do not create an entitlement by accident. Secondly, of course, he misstates the word ``entitlement.'' An entitlement means that you as an individual are entitled to receive the money. That has never been contemplated here. Nothing I ever suggested says it. I repudiated the notion. The gentleman says, yeah, but who knows what he is thinking? I really do not believe the gentleman has any basis for impugning these kinds of motives to me. I am simply repeating what the gentleman said. Well, he says it is not an entitlement but how can we be sure? 
   Because the committee which I chair where I have talked frequently with all the members, including certainly the majority, I know what we intend. It is not to create anything remotely like an entitlement. An entitlement means that individuals will be able to say give me housing, I am entitled to it legally. What we are saying is we will set up a housing fund. We will debate how it is distributed, but it will never be close to an entitlement. No one has ever suggested that any individual would have the right to demand, as you do on Social Security and Medicare, which makes then entitlements, the funding. 
   I said no to PAYGO because I rejected the assumption that it was necessary. This meets PAYGO. It totally meets PAYGO. Has scored this as revenue neutral. We asked them from the standpoint of the Federal Government, and it is revenue neutral. You don't need PAYGO with something that is revenue neutral. What it says is that the Congress, not me personally or a small cabal, will decide that we are going to create an entitlement when no one is looking. It says that having reserved this money in a revenue-neutral way, we will then decide as a Congress how best to distribute it but to distribute it as a housing fund, not as an entitlement. There has never been any suggestion that it would be an entitlement. It is not remotely going to be like Social Security and Medicare, and it cannot be a runaway fund. It is limited to 1.2 basis points of the mortgage portfolio of Fannie Mae. That is an entirely different funding mechanism than an entitlement funding mechanism. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I unfortunately have to again correct the ranking member. There was no money for affordable housing construction of any significance for Katrina affected areas. 
   The gentleman from Alabama incorrectly stated that we already voted $3 billion for Katrina. In the bill that we passed for the hurricane, there was one proposal for project-based section 8 that could help build 4,500 units. There was no other money in that bill for housing construction. Members will go back and read the debate, and they will see it was always contemplated by those of us for the bill that would be accompanied by this bill. 
   The assertion that this duplicates money voted for housing construction in Katrina has zero accuracy. This was always contemplated to be the second bill. 
   Additionally, the gentleman said I said the money wouldn't come from anywhere. No, quite to the contrary. I said several times in this hearing that it would come from the shareholders. I do not believe that Fannie and Freddie have monopoly pricing power that allows them simply to pass along every cost. Beyond that, I did note know that there were other positions being taken that would reduce the portfolio of Fannie and Freddie that would have far more impact on the profitability than the housing fund. 
   So those who believe that when you impact Fannie and Freddie's profitability you raise the cost of mortgages, they should not be for any other reductions in the housing fund.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I am disappointed in the gentleman's naive economics. No, you cannot by statute affect this economic question. 
   My point is that is a measure of where the pricing power is, and it is impossible to sort out where it comes from when you are talking about profits. A corporation will maximize profit. One of the restraints on that will be competition. 
   My belief is that there is sufficient competition in this field so their ability to put all the costs on the customers and not have much on the company shareholders is far less than the gentleman from New Jersey thinks. That is not something you do by statute, as in every other context he would recognize.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is another effort to try to kill the fund, this time by obfuscation. 
   We have tried to work out some agreement. There are about 11 different amendments that try to do the same thing. Members should just be ready to be here all night and maybe until Tuesday or come back on Tuesday. 
   I understand the objections to the fund. What I don't understand is why Members wouldn't be willing to accept two, maybe three chances to defeat it. 
   Now, with regard to the economics, first of all, there is this myth that we have said it's not coming from anywhere. We do believe that it will come primarily from the shareholders. 
   By the way, in earlier debates on this, some of the opponents of the bill said the same thing. If you go back and look at the transcripts of our committee, although I can't understand why anybody would want to do that, you will find people saying we were unfairly levying on the shareholders. That didn't work. 
   There are people who do not believe that the Federal Government should be encouraging the construction of affordable housing, and understand that however we propose to do it, they will object to it. If we try to do it through appropriations, that will be a problem because of the deficit. Here we try to do it by taking, we believe, essentially from the profits of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
   Now, as to the legitimacy of their concern, I will repeat, and the gentleman from New Jersey seemed annoyed when I mentioned it, he has an amendment that, by making restrictions on the portfolio of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, their main profit generators, would hit their profits far more than anything you could conceivably attribute to this amendment. So it would have, if you believe that this is going to hurt the borrowers, a much more negative effect. 
   I heard the gentleman from Texas say this is a government-sanctioned duopoly. At one point it might have been. In fact, today, the securitization  market is far more competitive. It's not atomistic, but there are states, economic states, between duopoly and atomic, and this is where we are here. There are significant private competitors to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. You will know that because some Members, Mr. Chairman, have heard from them who don't like what we are doing here. And we believe that the primary burden here will come from the shareholders. The notion that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can raise prices at will does not seem to me to reflect economic reality. 
   Now, the gentleman from New Jersey said why don't you pass a statute saying that? That is the naivete of economics. You can't pass a law that says economic reality shall be X or Y or Z. There is an interplay among various forces. We do believe that the great bulk of this will come from the shareholders. 
   By the way, it amounts to 5 percent of the profit. Other amendments would restrict the profit by far more. And if people legitimately believe that any restriction on the profit was going to hurt the mortgage borrowers, then they wouldn't be offering those other amendments. 
   There is a common thread here. They don't think the Federal Government should help build affordable housing. We strongly disagree with that. We believe that the Federal Government should. The calculation that is being asked to be made here is a very difficult one to make. 
   The gentleman prides himself on his economic expertise that he learned some time ago. I don't know where he learned that you could easily make this kind of calculation. There will be legitimate debate.     
   And by the way, what he does say here is that if at any point it turns out that there is an impact, you know, things can happen slow, the competitive situation can be more or less, a lot of factors will affect this. If at any point it happens, then the fund is permanently shut down. You will note that he strikes the word ``temporarily.'' This is an effort, once again, to kill the fund.

And by the way, I would note again, not the gentleman from Texas, but 209 Republicans in October 2005 voted for legislation that included exactly this sort of fund. Some of us voted against it because of a provision that is not now in this bill that would have kept the Catholic Church and others in the religious field from building housing. But I don't understand why, if it's so terrible today, it wasn't then.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Well, in the first place, the universe is not exhausted by the borrowers and the shareholders. There are banks involved. There are many other people in the transaction. And yes, I think there will be various distributions, of course, and it will differ at different times and different economic circumstances, depending on the competitive situation. 
   I believe that it is possible in some circumstances a very small percentage of the 5 percent might go on to the mortgages. It is likely to be de minimis. And the answer is it doesn't come just from the shareholders, it comes from the banks, from the mortgage brokers----

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I am impressed with the precision and exactitude of my friend from Texas. I am actually used to Texans talking slower. I appreciate my friend getting to the point so quickly, and I apologize for my not being there. 
   It is a very good amendment and I think has been agreed to by both sides. 
   The gentleman from Texas has been a strong proponent of housing counseling. We all agree that if we had had more of that earlier, we might have less of a problem than we have today. He has been very strong on the questions of literacy. So I very much appreciate this amendment and hope it is adopted.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. The gentleman from Louisiana has consistently been one of the most constructive Members in this regard. Some of us were not as tuned in as we should have been earlier, and I appreciate that. 
   I differ with him somewhat in emphasis here because I do think if there were to be any of the threats that he very lucidly and cogently outlines, they would have to involve a threat to the safety and soundness of Freddie and Fannie. That is, I have a metaphor problem. I don't see Freddie and Fannie as pulling down the temple without getting a couple of rocks in their own head. But I do understand it is a matter of concern. 
   Let me also add, I have some uneasiness because I have worked very closely, and all of us here have been the beneficiary of the very thoughtful approach of Secretary of the Treasury Paulson and Under Secretary Steel. We have come to some agreements. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentleman from Louisiana has expired.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   As I was saying, Secretary Paulson and Under Secretary Steel made it possible for us to come to agreement. 
   I would like to say to Mr. Baker, as he looks and as I look at who has come there, and I think some statements were made that shouldn't have been made that made people nervous. I want to give my friend from Louisiana and others the assurance, Mr. Chairman, that assuming this wins, and it looks likely to, I don't consider it to be the last word on the subject. I think the concerns he has talked about are legitimate. 
   We are going to have a bill from the other body, and we will get to a conference. I want to promise that I plan to continue to work with the gentleman from Louisiana, as well as the ranking members on the other side, the Secretary of the Treasury. We win here and we are going there. Maybe we have to move back a little bit. I understand where this comes from. 
   I agree with him that I don't think there is a point now in trying to fight it here, but I do want to acknowledge that I don't consider it a solely settled issue, and I am hoping that we will find some way to accommodate the very legitimate concerns that he has as we go further.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, first I yield myself 30 seconds to thank the gentleman from Arkansas. 
   There are actually four amendments trying to achieve the same purpose. I must say I thought his did it in the best possible way, leaving flexibility. There may be legislation adopted. I am hoping this may save us some time later, but I do want to say we completely agree. 
   Let's be clear now, with the adoption of this amendment, no one will be able to benefit from the Affordable Housing Fund who cannot demonstrate that he or she is legally in this country. I think that was very helpful. I'm glad that it's going to go through unanimously, and I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for the straightforward way in which he did it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I believe there are no Members left on our side who need to be recognized, so I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I thank the gentleman. I really appreciate his offering this amendment. As I said, I understand there will be some philosophical differences over the existence of the fund, but it certainly is incumbent upon us to make sure that that's all we're debating, not whether it would be misused or abused. 
   We tried to deal with that. You never anticipate everything, and the gentleman's amendment is a very good addition of the kind of safeguards we want so that we can be debating the real issue and not other things, and so I am grateful that you're offering it.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. I don't see other sponsors. 
   Just to say, in the absence of the minority, I don't mean to be presumptuous and others may want to speak as well, but one of the amendments we're adopting was offered by the gentleman from Missouri, the minority whip, to require that any assistance provided in the fund from the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund be considered a Federal award for the purposes of the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act, full disclosure, et cetera. 
   I appreciate, once again, the gentleman from Missouri offering this. I have heard the gentleman from Texas' amendment. These are two safeguards that we neglected to put in. 
   What it makes clear is that while this is not going to be Federal funding, it will be treated, since it comes from this Federal enactment, with all of the safeguards that would apply if it were Federal funds. And I think the whip has done a very good job in doing this. He's picked up an existing set of rules, and this is one more example I think of the extent to which, and I know this doesn't do away with all the controversies, but it does allow us to argue, as I said, on a philosophical basis. 
   So I just want to acknowledge my appreciation to the whip for coming up with this, and I'm glad we're able to adopt it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, when I hear some of my Republican colleagues leap to the defense of section 8, I can only compare that to learning that Ahmadinejad had applied for membership in B'nai Brith. We have been trying to defend section 8 against assault for some time. 
   One form of the assault has been formulaic rules that prevent all of the money that is appropriated from being spent. Because there is a lot of support for section 8, the administration has been unhappy when we have voted here more money than they have asked for. So they have had a series of formulaic restrictions that keep us from getting it all spent. 
   I will note, by the way, that the particular change here that the committee has recommended is supported by the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials, the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities, and the Public Housing Authorities Directors Association. That is, all of those who administer section 8 through their organizations endorse it. 
   Here is the way it has worked. There were formulas put in there that kept some agencies from spending money which they received. That is, many agencies were given money that could not be spent and had not been spent that came out of the hide of agencies that needed to spend more. What this bill does is to make sure that every appropriation is spent; and as to those agencies that might be losing an allocation, in every case they are losing money that they had not been able to spend because they did not have the legal authority to do it. 
   This bill guarantees, and we will be here to make good on that guarantee, that any agencies that can say, well, we are not getting the same allocation that we got before, they will have reserves available to them on which they can draw. So we can guarantee that no one will be unable to serve everyone they are now serving. 
   What it does mean is that money which this formula has prevented from being spent in some agencies will now be spent. We will not give some agencies more than they can spend and some less. We will even it out. 
   And I stress again that the reserves will be available, and that is why every one of the agencies in this country that spends money on section 8, all of the public housing authorities have explicitly supported this particular change.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This is a reauthorization, and I believe with the initiative of the gentleman from New Mexico, which I hope the House will adopt, will extend the Federal program that responds to the economic needs of the Native Americans. It also has a provision reauthorizing the Native Hawaiian legislation. 
   The program primarily provides funding, subject, of course, to appropriation, to the recognized tribes for housing. Members will be aware, if they represent areas where the tribes are and if they have visited those areas, that inadequate housing is a serious social problem for many of our Native American residents. And this is a bill that provides money to them to help them meet that need. 
   Now, the program is changed in three ways: First, as I said, it has not yet been changed but we expect it to be. Our committee has unanimously expressed its support for an amendment that was drafted by the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce), who will be offering it, which creates an economic development program to go along with the housing program, and we do believe adequate housing and economic development go hand in hand. 
   Secondly, at the request of the tribes, the Indian Housing Council, we have added in this a provision for a reserve fund and we have also provided funding for a self-determination program. So this bill comes before us strongly supported by the broad range of the tribes and it continues Federal support to help the tribes themselves build housing and will, I hope, also now have a component for economic development. 
   There is one item of some controversy which I think all of us involved here regret but we cannot ignore. The gentleman from North Carolina will be offering an amendment which says that no funding under this bill, including the housing program and the, I hope to be adopted, economic development program to the one tribe, the Cherokees, who have recently decided that the descendants of the slaves that the tribe had in the 19th century will be excluded from tribal benefits despite a treaty obligation to the contrary, we hope in the end that will never be necessary. In fact, I believe we will see an amendment that will make it clear that the amendment will only apply as long as the tribe maintains that position and there is pending litigation in the tribal court to change it. We hope it is changed. That's, as I see, the only controversy that applies to the program itself. I take it back. I know there will be an amendment to strike the Native Hawaiian program, and we will very vigorously oppose that. We have had that debate before. This is a program that works well, that is overwhelmingly supported in the State of Hawaii, and we believe should be allowed to continue. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, there are issues in which a number of Members of the House are recognized as leaders. There are sometimes issues where one particular Member, by the force of his commitment, by the intellectual powers he brings to bear, by the length of that commitment, really stands out as a leader. And on this particular issue, the issue of Native Americans in general, that is our colleague from Michigan (Mr. Kildee) dating back from his days in the State legislature in Michigan, when he represented a district with no Native Americans. They named cars in his district after Native Americans, but they're the only ones with those names that lived there. And just out of a concern that America honor its commitment in this area, which we haven't always done, he has been for many years a champion of the cause of Native Americans.  
   I am delighted to have worked with him on this bill, he is the sponsor of the bill, and I yield him such time as he may consume.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I agree that the amendment is a useful one, and I support it. The gentleman from Oklahoma, who is a member of the Financial Services Committee, has been a very able advocate for Native Americans on a variety of issues, as well as on others. I think this is an example of his constructive approach. But I do want to take some exception with the reasons for it. And we can do things for somewhat different reasons. I don't think what the gentleman from North Carolina was doing was rash. 
   In terms of what is best for the tribes, what we are doing here is trying to enforce a treaty. Frankly, I think the tribes have suffered more from violations of treaties than they have been the violators of treaties. I think that, in fact, it is a national embarrassment that this Federal Government has historically been the one that has initiated breaches of treaties and ignored treaties. So I am glad to say this is a sign here, not simply on the merits of including the Freedmen, but a reaffirmation by this Congress that we will hold everybody to those treaties. I do believe by establishing that principle, we will be doing the Native Americans in the end some good, as well. 
   Beyond that, in terms of timing, I understand this is in the courts. But let's be clear what is in the courts. The issue here is whether a decision taken by the tribe to exclude the Freedmen, I believe, in violation of the treaty should be upheld or not. At any minute, the tribe could resolve this by saying, okay, we will abide by the treaty. So it is not that they need judicial permission to do that. They don't have to await the outcome. 
   Given all that, I do agree if the court decision, the tribal court as I understand it, upholds the right of the Freedmen, if the current status of the Freedmen is maintained, then the amendment wouldn't be necessary, and, in fact, if that had been the case, the gentleman from North Carolina wouldn't have offered it. 
   As all the Members have said, this is a very agonizing issue for many of us. None of us wants to be put to this kind of a test. But the principle of adhering to the treaties, I think, governs. The gentleman from Oklahoma has proposed a useful amendment. As I understand it, he cooperated with the gentleman from North Carolina. They worked together on this. And what this says is if the resolution comes either by a court decision that says the Freedmen must be continued as tribal members or by a decision by the Cherokees, and again, they aren't bound by a decision by the court not to do this. They could always do it. So from the standpoint of cutting off, you know, they say when people are in civil contempt they have the keys in their pockets. The Cherokees have the cash here. It is entirely up to them as to whether or not the benefits continue to flow. Nothing in the gentleman from North Carolina's amendment would in any way impede the flow of funds to the Cherokees unless they are found to be by us, I think very clearly, in violation of the treaty. 
   So if the Cherokees, either because of the tribal court or of their own volition, decide to continue what has been the status quo of the Freedmen, then there is no cutoff. So I do not believe it can fairly be said that this will penalize them. It leaves it in their hands. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased that the gentleman from North Carolina and the gentleman from Oklahoma, we have had the cooperation from Members on the other side, I think we have come to as good a resolution to a difficult situation as possible. I hope both amendments are adopted.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I want to express my strong support for the amendment and my appreciation and admiration for the gentleman from New Mexico. This is a very important piece of this. 
   We try to do this in our committee increasingly. We tried to do it with regard to the recovery from the hurricane as well. It is housing and economic development. They are both necessary, and they go together. If you don't have decent housing that is affordable, you are going to have a hard time filling the jobs. But if you don't have economic development, then housing without it is somewhat sterile. 
   The gentleman from New Mexico has come up with a very thoughtful approach here. It is very logical to make this part of this program. There was some original talk about it being separate, but I think from the standpoint of making sure this survives all the way through the process, it is better to link the two, because the underlying housing program is going to expire and, frankly, putting them together this way gives us more assurance that it will ultimately be signed and not caught up in some unrelated controversy. 
   So both procedurally and substantively, the gentleman from New Mexico has made the right choices, and I join in hoping the amendment is adopted. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce). 
   The amendment was agreed to.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, to begin with, I implore Members of the House not to give in to this effort to invoke judicial activism, to cancel the vote of the people's elected Representative. 
   My friends on the Republican side are very selective in their denunciation of judicial activism. From time to time, they complain, if the courts uphold some fundamental constitutional right, that our ability as elected officials to make public policy has been trifled with. Here the shoe is very much on the other foot, and I think the foot on which the shoe is is in the mouth. 
   This is an effort to overrule the overwhelming decision of the people of Hawaii through their elected officials to create these programs. There are few things in Hawaii that are as broadly supported as this housing program. 
   There are controversial aspects of some of what goes on in Hawaii. We are aware of none here. This has been fiercely defended by everyone who is representing Hawaii who has been here since I have been here, and this Congress is voting on it. 
   What are we told? What is the argument? Well, the Supreme Court doesn't think you should do that. What happened to the objection to judicial activism? What happened to the will of the people? 
   In fact, as the gentlewoman from Hawaii has pointed out, there is no clear-cut Supreme Court decision here. There is room for us to make choices. But I am struck at the ease with which some of my conservative colleagues invoke this principle of popular rule against judicial activism in such a selective fashion. 
   This harms no one. This isn't excluding anyone from anything. It is providing housing for people who need it. The gentlewoman from Hawaii has given a very good explanation of the history. 
   I do not understand, Mr. Chairman. This is a fairly small program affecting a fairly small number of people in Hawaii. It is overwhelmingly supported by the people of Hawaii. 
   Mr. Chairman, what motivates Members of this house to get up and interfere with the arrangements that the people of Hawaii have arrived at? What drives them? What angers them that the arrangement has been reached that says this to the Native Hawaiians? And no one disputes the history that our friend from Hawaii has given. The United States came in and overthrew the government. That is very well documented. 
   What drives people at this point to continue to battle against this effort to help these Native Hawaiians and to invoke the courts to say we don't care what the votes were in Hawaii. We don't care about an overwhelming vote in the U.S. House. 
   This is a very reasonable effort by the polity of Hawaii, the Native Hawaiians and others, to meet a very real need. No one is saying the program is badly run. No one is saying it is corrupt. No one is saying it is unnecessary.     
   There is some hyper-abstract, ideological objection to people reaching out to their fellow residents in need. And while it is overwhelmingly supported, what we have is an ideological objection, the nature of which I cannot understand. No one has told me what harm is done by this. I don't understand who this hurts. But somehow, people are motivated to attack this program which helps this particular, fairly small minority of people. And then, absent any rational arguments in my judgment, they invoke the principle of judicial supremacy, which they so often scorn in other contexts. I hope this amendment is defeated.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I just want to give a little more information than we got in the last intervention from the gentleman from Georgia. 
   He disappointed me when he decided to inform us that the bill had been defeated in March. Yes, it was defeated. It was ``defeated'' by a vote of 272 ``yes'' and 150 ``no.'' It lost because it required two-thirds. 
   But I must say, Mr. Chairman, to refer to a bill having been defeated to refute the notion that it was widely supported and to neglect to mention that in fact it got a 122-vote majority and simply failed by 10 votes to get two-thirds, is a very incomplete reporting of the facts.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, as I understand this amendment, it is to make illegal what is already illegal, and since it was offered I  guess to the appropriations bill, it is to make apparently for the second time illegal what is already illegal, but the gentleman from Iowa explains why it is necessary. 
   It is that as we approach the next to the last year of an 8-year term for President Bush, his administration is still unable and apparently, according to the gentleman, unwilling to enforce that law. 
   The gentleman says the Federal Government, headed of course by President Bush, is the largest employer of people who are here illegally and not able to work; and he says that they lack conviction. 
   Mr. Chairman, I'm prepared to take on various responsibilities as chairman of the committee. Defending the President against the gentleman from Iowa is not one of the things I'm prepared to do today. 
   The gentleman from Iowa believes it's important for us for the third time to pass a law that he said the administration wouldn't enforce. I suppose the House could do that. I don't see any reason to think that they're going to enforce it any more this time than the other two times it was binding.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment that does not make a great deal of sense, even in its own terms. 
   First of all, the PAYGO principle applies in the appropriations process. Authorizations are authorizations. The Appropriations Committee balances the various authorizations. Nothing is committed to be spent by this bill. 
   What it says, however, is really quite striking. It says no authorization or appropriation shall be effective except to the extent that this act or the amendments made by this act provide for offsetting decreases. In other words, if you thought that it was important to provide housing for the Native Americans who live in such desperate straits in so many places and make up for that elsewhere in the Federal budget, you couldn't do that. 
   This says if you want to help the housing needs of American Indians, then you better reduce housing somewhere else. For the disabled? For the elderly? It does not allow for there to be offsetting decreases elsewhere.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Well, I will take back my time to say the gentleman has just stood up and said, look, I don't understand this language; I just borrowed it from you. Well, don't borrow things if you don't know how to use them. I mean, don't lend your car to someone who can't drive. 
   The fact is that the gentleman apparently didn't understand the implications of what he borrowed because the way this goes now, PAYGO in general has broader application. In this particular case, what it says is within this act. So if you want to spend more money on Indian housing, you have to in the same act, under this act, find offsets elsewhere. This is an example of how he misunderstands the process. 
   I would also say by the way there's a selectively to this because we don't get this amendment on every spending bill. Maybe it was offered on some of the other bills, the Ag bill, the space authorization. I don't see it all the time. I didn't see it on the Defense bill. Are we going to get this on the Iraq supplemental? I mean, I don't know how much we're going to spend here, but whatever we spend here, we spend in about, what, a week in the Iraq supplemental. I don't see it coming there. Somehow this becomes particularly important when we are trying to help people in dire straits; but even there, it's not logical. 
   Nothing in here will break PAYGO. PAYGO applies in an overall basis at the appropriations process. 
   If the gentleman wants me to yield, I'll be glad to yield.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I will take back my time to say the gentleman hasn't read his amendment. Here's what it says: to the extent that this act or the amendments made by this act provide for offsetting decreases in spending of the Federal Government. 
   Now, the rules of the House are such that you could not here offset other programs. You have germaneness rules. So under the terms of this amendment, you would have to make reductions in this same act subject to the same act.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. No, because the gentleman keeps repeating his error. 
   The fact is that PAYGO applies in a broader context. That's the problem. If you want to do PAYGO, you want to be able to say at the appropriations process, we'll shut this down here and we will increase it there. 
   Again, as I said, it's very selectively applied. The amendment does not have any real effect on PAYGO, except if it were adopted it would apparently require us in this very bill, in which we authorize more money for Indian housing, to reduce, I don't know, Indian housing or something else because it's internal to this. 
   You couldn't say that a Mars space shot was wrong or that we're spending too much money in the farm bill. It would be internal to this act. That's the problem with taking the general PAYGO principle and trying to microapply it. 
   The fact is that the Indian housing program is a very important one. To single this out for this kind of restrictive approach beyond the general PAYGO principle would victimize people who are very much in need. So I hope the amendment is defeated.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I thank the gentleman. 
   The gentleman from Georgia misunderstands my view. 
   What I want is fiscal discipline. What I object to is the very selective application of that to people who are in need. The gentleman from Iowa says we are going to restore freedom. 
   I don't think the freedom of Navajo children that live in inadequate housing is something worth defending. I am especially struck by the fact that we are about to ask the President to spend tens of billions more where we spent hundreds of billions in the war in Iraq. 
   I offered an amendment a year ago to restrict spending on a manned space shot to Mars. I lost on the floor of this House. 
   I don't know how every Member voted. I do know a majority of the Republican Party voted against me because the President wanted to send a man to Mars. 
   I voted against the Agriculture bill. I voted for an amendment that would have cut the spending there. But to be accused of being careless with the taxpayers' money by people who have supported this enormous corruption-ridden expenditure of hundreds of billions in Iraq is like being called silly by the Three Stooges. 
   Now, back to the gentleman from Georgia. He says well, don't blame me. The gentleman says he just borrowed the amendment from other people. It's germane to its rules. The gentleman could be more creative than that.  Here's the point. This is why you don't do the PAYGO in this restrictive fashion program by program, selectively by program by program. 
   When you like a program that spends a lot of money, in some areas you don't do it. If you don't like the program, you do it, and you claim it's just the neutral principle of fiscal responsibility. But PAYGO is sensibly applied over the whole budget, over the whole appropriations process. You can say, you know, we need more in the environmental area, we need more in the housing area, we need more in the transportation area. Let's reduce it in the manned space shot to Mars. 
   The way this is written, the only way you could have this pass and be valid would be if you cut within this program. The gentleman says, well, those are the rules of germaneness. Yes, that's why you do PAYGO on a broader scale. 
   To say you can only do Indian housing if you cut other things that are germane to this bill is precisely to shield the manned space shot to Mars, it's to shield expensive military spending, it's to shield cotton subsidies beyond what ought to be, and then say, you know what, if you're going to interfere with the freedom of these Navajo children to live in squalor, then we're going to have to make you cut back on money elsewhere. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This is a bill that was brought forward in the previous Congress by the gentleman from Texas. It is very important that we regulate when necessary; it is equally important that we not regulate when it is unnecessary. This is an example of our recognition of that principle. 
   We have rules that govern housing authorities. These are complex and difficult issues that housing authorities face. But one set of rules should not be made to fit all. Smaller housing authorities ought to have more flexibility than the larger housing authorities. This bill, brought forward by the gentleman from Texas, and I congratulate him for his persistence in calling this to the attention of the committee, acts on that principle. 
   It exempts from excessive regulation, but not entirely from regulation, smaller housing authorities. In particular, I would just say that there was a rule for example that plans be made every 5 years and in some cases housing authorities have to report on certain things every year. In this case what we would say is that the smaller housing authorities would file their plan every 5 years and only if there are any changes of any significance in the covered matters would they have to report again. So it would save a lot of time, energy, and paperwork for the smaller housing authorities. It will help these people with the difficult job that they do. 
   I thank the gentleman for bringing the bill forward.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a good day for the cause of human rights and for drawing on the strength of the American people to vindicate the values that are so widely shared among our people. 
   This bill is part of a package of two. Subsequently we will deal with a bill involving the country of Iran. Both of them have a similar purpose; namely, to empower Americans in their individual capacities, through their State governments, through organizations to express in a concrete way the overwhelming opposition in our country to the genocide being perpetrated by the Government of Sudan in Darfur, and to the effort by the sometimes pro-genocide Government of Iran to acquire a nuclear weapons capacity. 
   Now what we have, we have sanctions against those countries. Let me say a word about sanctions. People are sometimes supportive of sanctions when they agree with the cause and denigrate the notion of sanctions when they disagree with the cause. History is clear. When economic sanctions are widely supported globally, they have an impact. 
   I had a great day years ago, Mr. Speaker, standing in Statutory Hall and listening to Nelson Mandela thank the Congress of the United States because we had enacted sanctions. He said that the enactment of sanctions by the U.S. as part of a worldwide enactment of sanctions brought an end to apartheid earlier than it would have otherwise. Our former colleague, Mr. Dellums, the mayor of Oakland, had a very proud day then. He had been the leader of it, and it is very fitting that the initiator of the bill we are dealing with today is his successor, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), who has been the driving force in the bill we have before us. 
   And what we have is this: There are American citizens, State governments and others who have funds invested in collective investment entities. They have invested the funds to get a maximum return, pension funds, State governments and others, individuals in mutual funds. And they have in many cases gone to the investment entity and said, We don't want our money helping the dictatorship of Iran go nuclear. We don't want our money used to perpetuate genocide in Darfur and help a government that does that. We want you to sell our investments in companies that are complicit in this through economic support. 
   And they have been met in some cases by the argument, Well, we can't do that because we have a fiduciary responsibility as the investment entity to maximize returns, and, therefore, we cannot sell this company and that company. And to the extent that they are complicit in Darfur and complicit in Iran's nuclear weapons, that is irrelevant. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think that is often more of an excuse than a reason. But today, we render that debate moot because the two bills we are dealing with, now with Darfur and subsequently with Iran, do not compel any investment entity to do anything. These are not bills of compulsion. They fully respect the market. What they say is, if you are a mutual fund, if you are a pension fund manager, and significant numbers of the investors in your entity or the beneficiaries of your entity come to you and say, Clean my hands; I do not want to be financing these outrageous regimes and their terrible practices, you cannot plead, Oh, I am sorry. The law won't let me do it, because these bills have a common theme. They prevent lawsuits against these investment entities who take these issues into account. 
   And they have a powerful double effect. First, they will add to the effectiveness of sanctions because there is in the United States widespread anger at both regimes. Not only will they add to the effectiveness of sanctions, they do it in a way that is fully respectful of the autonomy of these entities. As I said, there is no compulsion, no interference of the market. It is freeing Americans to do this, and that is also important because you have the regime in Iran and you have the regime in Sudan trying to avoid the public obloquy that they so richly deserve by saying that is just the American administration. They try to separate the President and his policies in opposition to both of these from the American people. 
   What these bills do is to make it clear, as I think they soon will once they are law, that the opposition to the genocide in Sudan and to the weapons nuclearization in Iran are widespread throughout this country, and that this opposition is not just the President and not just the Congress. It is a broad, deeply held American view. 
   One final point. A letter from National Council on Foreign Trade complained that with these bills we were going to let the States get into the foreign policy business. No, this is the Congress of the United States into the foreign policy business. This does not say that any mutual fund anywhere at any time can divest for foreign policy reasons. I think, by the way, they already have that right, and we make it clear in this bill. We are not trying to say that they don't. 
   But what this package of bills does is these two bills makes two foreign policy judgments. The United States Congress, by passing these bills, will say we have an absolute horror about the genocide in Darfur and want to do everything we can to put an end to it, and we are overwhelmingly opposed to the regime in Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. These are two very specific foreign policy judgments that Congress will make. We will then be empowering people in the United States to join us in implementing them. But the argument that this somehow throws open the foreign policy process willy-nilly is simply wrong

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I thank the gentleman for making this point. The gentleman from California is a very careful student of the intertwined legal and economic issues, and the point he is making now is very important. We expect this to be subjected to a sensible economic analysis; that is, if you are providing real value to that government, then you are covered. Clearly, if you have a secondary market for bonds, you've enhanced the value of the initial instrument. So people who support a secondary market for a particular instrument are clearly investing in the underlying issuer. They know that. It is a conscious act. No one is going to be trapped. 
   So the gentleman is making a very important point, and we want to be very clear. We will be expecting the administration, in preparing this list, to use the same kind of economic analysis we would use in any other case. If an activity, a purchase, an investment, a loan, any financial activity is contributing to the financial enhancement of the Iranian Government, then it triggers, we would believe, this bill.

   We have some people who have claimed that they do not now have the legal authority to do the divestment. When this bill becomes law, as I hope it will be, and its companion bill, that argument won't be able to be made at all. 
   I agree with the gentleman from California. I don't think it's a good argument now. But we do want to make clear, in absolutely nailing this down, we in no way want to give any support to the argument that, in the absence of this bill, the authority isn't there.

   And I hope that we will, I'm told it will be tomorrow, have two overwhelming rollcalls in this House which will be, in themselves, an expression of the American people's views on both the genocide in Darfur and the nuclearization of the Iranian military, and that will then be followed by a widespread demonstration across this country of people's determination as Americans that we will do what we can to stop both of those. So I think this is a very good day for the bipartisan legislative process

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. (INCLUDING ALL BANKING AGENCIES WITHIN THE EXISTING REGULATORY AUTHORITY UNDER THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, this is a bill that was broadly supported in our committee that we believe will enhance the ability of the Federal bank authorities to provide consumer protection. It's a little bit of a complicated story. 
   Congress passed an amendment to the Federal Trade Act that gave the Federal Reserve System the right to promulgate rules which defined what were unfair or deceptive practices engaged in by banks. The Federal Reserve has, for many years, declined to exercise that authority. 
   The issue was first brought to my attention when I was ranking member of the committee by a very distinguished public official who, sadly, died earlier this year, Ned Gramlich, who was the Federal Reserve Board Governor in charge of, among other things, consumer protection. And here's how it played out. 
   The Comptroller of the Currency and the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision a few years ago promulgated very strict rules preempting State rules and State laws and regulations regarding the activities of national banks. As a result of that ruling, which was challenged but upheld by the courts, States have virtually no authority over the banking practices of national banks. Only the national bank regulators may regulate. 
   The problem is that there were, in many, many States, most of the States from which we here come, consumer protection laws which were invalidated by that. In fact, the preemption said even when there were rules of general application that were covering the banks, the ability of the States to enforce them was limited. They had to go through the Federal regulators. So we then went to the Federal regulators, but many of us were opposed to that. We were critical. And on a bipartisan basis there was criticism of it on the Financial Services Committee. Our former colleague, the gentlewoman from New York, Mrs. Kelly, who was chairman of the Oversight Committee, was a very strong critic of what she believed to be excessive overregulation. But that has been upheld, and there is no realistic chance of undoing it. 
   So the second best for us was to have the Federal bank regulators able to provide the consumer protections that were lost when the State rules were invalidated. I spoke with the Comptroller of the Currency, and his response was, Well, here's the problem. Under the Federal Trade Act, the Federal Reserve has the right to promulgate the code of unfair deceptive practices. He indicated to me that he would like to do that, in fact, two Comptrollers said we would like to do this, but we don't have the authority to promulgate the rules. The Office of Thrift Supervision, which preempted, interestingly, does have the authority to promulgate the rules. 
   Now, what motivated our colleagues of an earlier era to give the Federal Reserve the right to make the rules for the Comptroller of the Currency and to give the Office of Thrift Supervision the right to make the rules only for themselves? I do not know. I can't speculate. Based on most recent experience, it was probably the Senate's fault, because almost everything that goes wrong these days is. But I don't know that for sure. On the other hand, it's our job to try to correct it. 
   What this bill does is to say to two of the Federal bank agencies, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation through its depository institutions has some authority over both national and State banks since it insures the deposits in both, we take away in this bill from the Federal Reserve System the power they have refused to use to promulgate a code of unfair and deceptive practices and give it, instead, over to the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC, either jointly or concurrently, and it comes with their support.     
   The Fed said they didn't like it, but they weren't using the power. The Comptroller of the Currency, he is, after all, a defender of this preemption. He has maintained the preemption. This is not an effort to undo the preemption. He acknowledges that in presiding over this national set of rules, it would be helpful to him to have this code of unfairness and deceptive practice, and what the code does is give some notice to the banks as to what are prohibited practices and what aren't. So this bill does nothing in terms of substantive promulgation of the code, but it gives to the active agencies, the Comptroller of the Currency, who promulgated the preemption, and the FDIC, the ability to put into effect what we think should have been put into effect before. It comes with the support of those agencies, and I think that if we get this done, they will proceed to do it. 
   I should note that the Office of Thrift Supervision, which already has the authority to promulgate such a code, is in the process of doing so. No legislation is needed. But they have put out a proposed rule in that regard. We have, many of us, encouraged them to go forward with it. And as a result of what OTS is doing under its authority and what this bill would give the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC by early next year, we should have in place rules that will tell people what are unfair and deceptive practices. And as I said, I would have preferred that the preemption would not have been so far reaching, but it's a fact of life. This will then empower the Federal bank regulators fully to be available to provide consumer protection when it's appropriate in lieu of the State laws that were cancelled. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I take back my time. I think the gentleman doesn't have 30; he doesn't have three. 
   Would the gentleman please abide by the rules. 
   He made a statement, and I am yielding my time. He has equal time. I don't think there are 30 programs. I don't think they can come up with them. 
   The HOME program, I agree, there are reasons why this must be in addition to the HOME program. 
   Community Development Block Grants are not supposed to be primarily a construction program. Mayors and city council members and others all over the country will be appalled to be told that they are supposed to put CDBG primarily in housing construction; they aren't. It is for a whole variety of programs. People know that. 
   We do have programs to build housing for the elderly and for the disabled, but there is simply not a list for housing construction. 
   Secondly, the gentleman from Alabama says, Why don't we fix these programs? Of course, the Republican Party was in control of both Houses of Congress and the Department of Housing and Urban Development for 6 years. Apparently, they didn't do anything. 
   He then says, Why don't we fix FHA and GSE? Well, I was surprised by that, Mr. Chairman. The gentleman knows that this House has, in fact, passed bills that do make reforms in both the FHA and the GSE. For him to say why don't we fix FHA and GSE when he knows we have passed bills to do it seems, to me, strange because we have done that. 
   Here is the point. We do have the HOME program. It is subject to annual appropriations. And we do have local  housing trust funds. It is the local housing trust funds that want this bill. The gentlewoman from Illinois mentioned the Low Income Housing Coalition. They are the major driver behind this bill because they understand its importance. 
   We want to supplement the funds. What is the problem with the one program that builds affordable housing, the HOME program, there is not enough money. It competes with other appropriated funds. 
   By the way, the argument that somehow we are being unfair to the elderly, in this bill, unlike what happened during the Republican rule, we limit the fees that can be charged to the elderly under the HOME equity mortgage program. We do that. They didn't. We limit what the FHA can charge for mortgage insurance. OMB ordered HUD to raise the fees so they would make even more of a profit. We said you can't do that. We authorized some additional activity. We have limited the fee increases, and we have taken some of the money from the additional activity, not from fee increases. 
   The fact is this: The Republican Party has opposed any funding for affordable housing construction. They inherited the HOME program. They haven't been very good to it in the appropriations process. This says we need to get back in the business in a major way of helping build affordable housing. There is no 30 programs that build affordable housing for low-income people. That is not what CDBG is intended to do, and it is not what CDBG largely does. Most of the money goes for other things. 
   This list of 30 programs is mythical. I await its reality, but I don't have any high expectations. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia for a colloquy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. First, there was allusion by the gentleman from Alabama to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In fact, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the bill we passed, which we did do some reforms in, we did say that they should in their secondary mortgage activity be supportive of people at 80 percent of median. We have given them the affordable housing goals, and people who understand this issue understand that there is a distinction, as the gentleman from Virginia understands. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have primarily and historically been aimed at helping people in the more moderate income range. We have actually lowered it to 80 percent of median. This gets to people much below that in general, which is why there is no overlap between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and this program. 
   Secondly, to the gentleman's argument, what we want to do here is give as much flexibility as we can to the local communities. That is why, yes, we are not creating a Federal bureaucracy here. The Federal Government will largely be passing this money through to the State and local housing trust funds who can focus on the needs of their own community. They would have the ability, with the 15 percent, to spend it where they think best. If they thought it was needed for the lowest income people, they could do that. But if they felt, as in the gentleman's area, this needs to go to people at 60 percent of median, and ultimately when we get the fund up to 80 percent of median, they would have the ability to do that. So the 15 percent is within the discretion of the local communities.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume to underline an important distinction that appears to have escaped the gentleman from Alabama: There is a difference between a section 8 voucher program which gives people money to pay their rent on a year-by-year basis and does not encourage the construction of any housing, there is a difference between that and a program to help people build affordable housing. The gentleman now has disclaimed the list to some extent. He says it is not his list; it was when he first mentioned it, it seems to me. Now it is HUD's list. 
   It is a list that he very carefully reworded, the phraseology, I think. It is a list that assists people who are poor with housing. Yes, it builds shelters for the homeless. That is probably one or two of the programs. It gives section 8 vouchers. 
   The HOME program is the only one of that list that helps build affordable housing. It helps build it. So the gentleman's list, and he doesn't want to read it, and I understand why. He mentioned Community Development Block Grants. No one familiar with Community Development Block Grants think they are primarily for housing construction. That is not what it does. There are programs that help build housing for the disabled and the elderly. But other than the HOME program, there aren't programs that help build affordable housing. 
   Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are now aimed at helping people at 100 percent of median and above. We say that should be dropped to 80 percent of median, not 100, but it doesn't help people in the lower income categories. There are no such programs. And so that's the answer to what the gentleman said. 
   He keeps talking about, Well, we should fix the programs. Of course for 6 years with a Republican President and a Republican-led Congress, they didn't do much. 
   There are fixes this year. The House did try last year on the FHA. We have repeated that. So we do improve the FHA program. We improve the GSE program, and we also take additional nontax dollars and make them available. 
   Again, I await this list of programs that help the construction of affordable rental housing. I think I will wait a very long time. 
   The only other point I make is that I regret we have limited time. I was sorry that the Ways and Means Committee didn't yield time to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) since he talked about trade and taxes, none of which have anything to do with this bill. So maybe Ways and Means owes us a few minutes, and when their bill comes up later, maybe I will come talk about housing to offset the gentleman from Texas talking about trade and taxes. 
   I now yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott).

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute just to say that the assertion that this is ignoring the private market would be more persuasive to me if it were not for the fact that every organization that is engaged in the private market building of housing disagrees. 
   The National Association of Realtors and the National Association of Home Builders, neither of which are known for its socialist tendencies, have written letters in support of this bill exactly as it has been presented. They who fully understand the market, and we don't just use boilerplate rhetoric to describe it, understand the importance of interactivity between some public sector participation and the market, and this creates no new government bureaucracies. 
   This funds existing State and local housing programs. The Federal role will be for HUD by a formula to distribute it. It is a funding mechanism for the State and local authority. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green).

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I regret to say that my colleague from Alabama does not appear to be familiar with the bills. I will say, this argument that, oh, how can we do this and create a housing trust fund at the moment that we have a subprime crisis has no validity, it's purely tactical, because exactly the same arguments were being made before the subprime crisis. There's an ideological objection to getting the Federal Government in the business of helping build affordable housing. 
   The gentleman finally named some of the programs: Building intermediate nursing home facilities, housing for people with AIDS. 
   My question to him, repeated and ultimately unanswered was, where are the programs that help build affordable family housing? It is not an annual section 8 voucher program which doesn't help build housing. It's not intermediate nursing home facilities. It's not help for people with AIDS. It's none of those programs. HOPE VI, yes. It exchanges some kind of housing for others. HOPE VI has not resulted in any net addition to housing. We're trying to prevent it from being a net diminution. 
   He then says, well, you're taking money from the FHA and they won't help low-income people. Totally and completely false, portraying a total misunderstanding of the bill. In fact, it is the bill that we passed, unlike the bill that passed under the Republicans, that prohibits the FHA from raising mortgage insurance premiums on people and give that money to the Treasury. That was the Republican approach. We capped those fees. 
   Here's where the FHA money comes from. We take the limit that the Republicans allowed to stand for years on the number of home equity mortgages the FHA can insure. We also, unlike the Republicans, limit the amount that the elderly can be charged for the first time under those by the servicers, and we are told by CBO that as we increase the volume of FHA home equity mortgages at a lower price for the elderly than existed under the Republican rule, we will generate money. 
   Now, if we didn't pass this bill, this administration would take that money and put it into the Treasury so it could go help fund the war in Iraq; it could go help fund highway projects, agricultural subsidies. 
   That's the choice. Do we, having created an additional revenue stream for the FHA, while limiting fees, let it go to the Treasury for agricultural subsidies and the war in Iraq, or do we put it into affordable housing? 
   With the GSEs, until we talked about helping build affordable low-income housing, my Republican friends were very critical of the GSEs on the whole. The stockholders were getting too much money and too much return for too little. 
   Nothing in this bill will increase the amount that people have to pay on the mortgages any iota. What it says is that out of the profits of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we're going to make them divert some of this for these public purposes. So in direct contradiction to what the gentleman says, there are not 34 programs that help build affordable housing. There is one, now there will be two, and I hope the bill passes.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I don't believe any of these are controversial. 
   The first thing we do, we had in the committee an adoption of an amount, a minimum amount that would go to each State. Remember, this is largely a distribution to the States. It's not an existing Federal. This would not be administered at the Federal level. It would be sent to the States. 
   And some of the smaller States raised a question, and the smaller communities that they might be excluded. Indeed, while this is not exactly what the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis) had wanted to offer, which I thought was perfectly reasonable, it comes close to, it touches on the same area. So this would make sure that no State would go without, and at least one community in every State would get some funding. 
   Next, we had a provision that really didn't make sense requiring a mixed income requirement in elderly projects. We didn't think that was reasonable, and we take it out. 
   We have a clarification involving the number of units that go to people who are below 50 percent, and we say that applies to all units. 
   And finally, in response to concerns in the House, we had language that could be better worded. It was somewhat hastily added at the last minute, and I hope it will be improved as we go forward, which seeks to say that no one who is in the country illegally should be allowed to be a resident of one of these projects. 
   That's the manager's amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Washington has been a strong advocate of energy efficiency and reducing excess energy costs. He approached the committee and argued that it would be very useful to have in the bill the language of this amendment, which says that you will take into account, in making the grants, the extent to which the money would reduce utility costs for residents. This would, of course, have the dual advantage of making it less expensive for these low-income residents and also conserving energy. So it seemed to us an entirely reasonable approach, and I was glad to tell the gentleman from Washington that I agree with him and, in fact, to serve as his designee in offering it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman is absolutely right. And that same issue, as he knows, is arising in the context of our work on HOPE VI. We want to do the green building standards. We want to do them in a way that will be sensible and reasonable. 
   Let's be very clear. There aren't enough law enforcement people in the world to make this work if there isn't a willingness on the part of those involved to do it. If people think it is too rigid or inflexible, it's just not going to work as well. I think we have a wide willingness now on the part of the homebuilders and others to be participating in this. 
   And, yes, we will make this very much a collaborative enterprise. Of course if the gentleman's substitute were to pass, it wouldn't be relevant. But in case it didn't, we will work together.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, this is a very reasonable and thoughtful amendment from the gentleman from Maryland. What it says is that we hope this program is established, we hope that there will be entities that will be repeat applicants. We just want to make explicit that if people have gotten a grant and now come back for another one, they be very explicit about what they have done with it. It is, I think, a very useful kind of oversight that's built into the program. It may seem obvious, but we sometimes read about people getting renewed programs when they haven't done a very good job in the last one. This won't make that absolutely impossible, but it will make it less likely. I think it is a very useful amendment by the gentleman from Maryland, and I hope it's adopted.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, this is an unusual amendment. The actual author offered it, and the Member rising in opposition actually opposes it for the first time today. And I appreciate the cooperation we've had. 
   I want to say that I appreciate, not just that, but the gentleman from Texas, who has been a very constructive member of the committee. We have some differences. That's why we have different parties. But we have a great deal in agreement. And the gentleman's expertise in the homebuilding field has been very helpful as our committee has gone forward. And here is, perhaps, a philosophical difference between us. 
   The main difference here is that the gentleman's amendment, recognizing, as he does from his own experience, the value of additional housing construction, would do away with our two funding sources. Now, we chose to go in addition to the HOME program, which is the one program where there is a parallel, for a couple of reasons. First of all, the HOME program is, of course, subject to annual appropriations, and that's appropriate for most government work. But we did want to have in the government a program for housing construction that had a little bit more assurance for people than an annual appropriation. Appropriations get caught up in omnibus issues, CR issues. The trust fund will be outside of the kind of deadlock that we have had in the past and may, we hope not, but may have in the future. If you're trying to build housing, the notion that your funding has been slowed down because there has been a fight over some unrelated issue, like the debate about the Iraq war funding, could slow you down, we want to avoid that, so we keep the HOME program. But we have an additional program, and again, it's for the construction of affordable housing, unlike any other program, except HOME, and we want to give it some assurance to operate in a trust fund. And this is, to some extent, modeled after the highway trust fund. It is a trust fund that will still be subject to work by the Appropriations Committee, but it won't be bogged down as the rest of the government gets bogged down, and that's important when you are doing construction when you have an ongoing situation. 
   Secondly, we do have two additional funding sources. Now, there is some debate about that. I do want to stress, in the FHA bill, which was already voted on by the House, we say in the first place that if any question arises about the solvency of the fund, if the FHA fund should appear to be in trouble, not a penny can go into the affordable housing fund that year. Only after the HUD Secretary has certified that the money won't be needed to hold down premiums or prevent insolvency will this go forward. 
   We have said that by the creation of a new funding stream, namely, allowing an unlimited amount of home equity and mortgages, we get a lot of money that CBO made available. And I should note, by the way, that some of that money, as the gentleman from Texas, among others, have suggested, has gone to upgrade the computer system of the FHA. Some of it will go for a great increase in counseling to homeowners, which is, again, supported on both sides. A good chunk will be left over, we're not sure exactly how much, we hope it will be $200 million a year. But it only goes to the housing trust fund if it would otherwise have gone to the Treasury. There is zero chance, the way this bill is written, for it to force that kind of an increase. That, by the way, is why CBO gives us a flat score on this. There is no budget deficit situation here at all. 
   Similarly, with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and here I have to say some of my Republican colleagues have been a little inconsistent, the administration, some of them, they've been critical of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They've said, you know, we give all these advantages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a line of credit, some people think they're government-run, there used to be government members on the board, although we will not have that if our bill passes, and here they are, they're making all these profits and they're not doing enough for public purposes. Well, in our Fannie and Freddie bill, we amend that to some extent by increasing the housing goals they have by dropping the credit they get from 100 percent to 80 percent immediately. But we also say, you know what? You've been doing pretty well, you're making a lot of money and your sales are doing well, so without in any way impinging on your mortgage functioning, we are going to take some of the profit you've made and put it in the affordable housing trust fund. 
   By the way, I find it a little odd that people who have said that we should basically reduce the portfolio of Fannie and Freddie and make them securitize more, which they believe will do more damage to their ability to function  than anything else, that now they become very concerned when we talk about a housing trust fund. I should be clear that that does not describe the gentleman from Texas, who understands very well how best to help Fannie and Freddie. And I think we put through a bill that will enhance their ability to function while better regulating them. 
   So, in other words, we have 800 or $900 million, we hope, in the first year, and we hope it will go up. And this is the main difference between us, it doesn't come from appropriated funds. And I believe we have written it so it will not interfere with either Fannie and Freddie or FHA's ability to function. And we do not create a new bureaucracy. We distribute it to the State and local housing funds. Indeed, many of the amendments that we've adopted here in agreement by both sides, and some that we adopted in committee, I was looking it over, in committee we adopted a number of amendments, more from the Republican side than the Democratic side because I don't have to worry about other people telling me where we are on that. We have, in every one of these amendments, increased the flexibility for the local housing trust funds. 
   So with that, I hope that the substitute is defeated and that we will continue to improve this bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. First, if this were a serious effort to put on a work program, it might have been offered as an amendment to the bill. It wasn't offered before the Rules Committee. 
   Secondly, it would have said ``report back forthwith,'' and it would have been voted on and it would have been  added. It says ``promptly.'' Now it is true that if we were to adopt a motion to recommit that says ``promptly,'' it would go back to the committee. 
   Our committee is a fairly busy one. We have the subprime issue before us. We have credit card reform issues. House floor time is fairly busy. I am told there are Members who don't think working here on Friday is the best thing that has ever happened to them. We are getting towards the end of this session. We have the appropriations bills. So the choice of ``promptly'' rather than ``forthwith'' is clearly motivated by animus against the bill. 
   Having failed in several tries to kill the bill as a whole, they now say, let's do it this way. And on its own merits, here is the problem. I have not been a supporter of the work requirement within the public housing area, but at least in public housing you have administered a framework where it can be applied, although I think inappropriately. 
   Here we are talking about a program whereby the Federal funds will be distributed. And by the way, they are not mostly taxpayer; they are shareholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac dollars in the largest amount. But what we are going to do is distribute this money to hundreds of local housing funds, State and local funds. You talk about unfunded mandates. This says to all of the grantees, the Catholic Church in some places, or B'nai Brith housing or other local housing groups, Habitat for Humanity or any of the others, you must, in addition to building the housing, undertake to administer this kind of volunteer work program. Lest anyone think this is something that they can do easily, read the third page of the recommittal motion.     
   ``Administration. A grantee providing assistance with Trust Fund grant amounts may administer the work activities requirement under this subsection directly, through a resident organization, or through a contractor having experience in administering work activities programs within the jurisdiction of the grantee.'' 
   This takes some of the limited amount of money that would be available for housing and creates another new set of contractors. Maybe Blackwater will lay down their guns and come over here now when they get run out of Iraq and so a whole new set of contractors will be dealing with this. And the organizations that get this money, they are religious organizations, they are nonprofits, they are homebuilders. They will now have this new mandate to go and make people work, and it becomes a complicated one. 
   Here's what it says. For example, if you are ``a single custodial parent for a child who has not attained 6 years of age,'' then you have to go out and do this volunteer work for 20 hours a week, unless you can show that you couldn't get child care. You've got to show that it's unavailable. There are three different kinds of paragraphs. It's a very complicated thing to administer. 
   So you say to people, you know what, thank you for helping build affordable housing, thank you to the archdiocese, thank you to the Methodists, thank you to Habitat for Humanity, thank you to these charitable groups. Oh, and by the way, you are now in charge of making the parents of small children go to work unless they have first shown to you the unavailability of child care, and you have to go out and hire somebody to administer this for you. 
   So, even if it were ``forthwith,'' I would be opposed to it, but ``promptly'' means that the people who are opposed to using funding to help build affordable housing want to at best delay the bill, and maybe if they're lucky enough, because they can combine this with other filibusters, kill it. 
   This is a very difficult program to administer. It is not one for which there has been any demand. I guarantee you it will be strongly opposed by all of the organizations, the charitable and nonprofit organizations, that will be told to administer this housing. It is an unfair imposition on some of the best-motivated organizations and people. It doesn't give them any money to do it. It gives them this very difficult task. It delays the bill at best, and I hope it is defeated for what it is meant to be, an effort to derail a bill that can't be derailed in a more straightforward fashion. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, there are times when we will have arguments across the aisle. I don't think there is any need for us to engage in that now because our differences are across the building, not across the aisle. 
   Let me begin by saying to the gentleman from Texas, we agree, we will not let this program die. And as the gentleman from Texas knows, he has had to sit through this on the Rules Committee three times this year, twice this past week, because we did originally think about taking the bill the Senate had passed, amending it, and sending it back. I am disappointed to say that we heard from all points that if that happened, the Senate might be so unable to function as to kill the program. 
   The United States Senate has perfected something I call ``the strength of weakness.'' They labor to do anything whatsoever, and having done it, tell people that if we ask them to change one bit of it they will collapse in a heap. It's like the song from ``MacArthur Park,'' someone left the bill out in the rain, and they won't be able to remake it because they will never have the recipe again. That's what we keep hearing. 
   But, on the other hand, and here's where I do disagree with my friend from Texas, I know we've had some disagreements here about the role of preemptive strikes in foreign policy. Here our disagreement is on the role of preemptive surrender in interbranch negotiations. 
   I agree that if all else fails and the Senate does not act on this bill, we will have to acquiesce. I regret that. I think it would be much less good public policy than we could do if we had the normal legislative process. But I have spoken to the Senators from New York. They report to me that the Governor of New York and the mayor of New York, and New York is not the only entity covered by this, and indeed, some of these things, they're all universal. But people are concerned, and so we have reluctantly agreed not to endanger the chances of this if the Senate is unable to act. 
   On the other hand, and here's where I differ, I am unwilling at this point to let it end without the Senate once again being given a chance to function on several issues. The gentleman from Vermont just talked about the smaller companies. The reduction of the trigger from $100 to $50 million was done unanimously, I believe, or overwhelmingly, by our committee at the request of small insurance companies who wanted to be able to insure. The argument is, if they do not have the smaller trigger, many of them would not feel able to bid on insurance for these building projects. So, I think that's important. 
   We had the inclusion of group life insurance. I am afraid that in the Senate version, this is kind of the analog of the old neutron bomb. Remember the neutron bomb; it killed people and left the buildings standing. The Senate would have us have a provision that ensures buildings but ignores people. Well, people die in these terrorist attacks. We all remember that this Congress, in 2001 or 2002, passed a program that cost us billions of dollars to compensate those who lost their lives. Why should we not allow that to be done to the insurance system? That's another thing we would like to have in there. 
   And as part of the life insurance, as has been noted by a colleague, there is a provision that was not contested in our committee that would prevent discrimination against people who are traveling to places that some companies might think inappropriate to travel, particularly Israel. There is a provision in here that says you're not going to be penalized for, and this was brought to our attention by some of our colleagues from Florida. Now, all of those are in the bill we want to send back. 
   Also, a reset mechanism that, obviously it applies to New York where they've already had a terrorist attack, would apply nationally so that you don't get only one bite at the apple if the terrorists choose to strike again. And I think the major reason for doing TRIA is to neutralize the effect that murderous thugs who wish this country and its people ill can have on our policies. That's why we want terrorism insurance. This is part of national defense. This is to make it a government program as part of our defense against this activity. 
   But there are other parts of this where we have accepted this. Frankly, this looks like what a conference would look like if we were in a rational world where we could have a conference. We said 15 years, they said 7. We've accepted 7. By the way, I will say that in the prior Congress, we only had 2. 
   The reason for a longer term is that this is important if people are to be able to build in our large cities and other areas which are threatened by terrorism. Because you cannot get the building without a loan, you cannot get the loan without insurance, and a 2-year timeline is obviously too short for major building projects. We accepted that. We wanted protection against nuclear, biological, chemical, radiological attacks. No one thinks that's out of the picture. The Senate said no to it. We accepted that. So, we compromised with them. 
   And finally, a PAYGO issue arose at the last minute. We didn't do it well here, and the Senate did it well, and I congratulate them for that. It was good legislating. So we accept their term of 7 years. We accept their version of PAYGO. We accept their jettisoning of nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological. But we would like to include group life, and we would like to accommodate the smaller companies, and we would like to have the reset mechanism. 
   In the end, as I said, we understand we can't compel them, but we believe it is worth another try. Passing this bill will in no way jeopardize our ability in the end, if nothing else fails, to accept the 7 years that the Senate sent us. 
   But I appeal to the Members here out of an institutional concern. Let's understand that in the end, if the Senate refuses to do certain things, they may have an advantage. But let's not make it easy. Let's not continue a process by which Senators can avoid tough issues. Maybe some Senator will raise some of these issues. Maybe, I know it's ``maybe'' in a land of fantasy, the Senate would vote on some of them and Senators would have to decide if they wanted to say no, it's okay if you can't travel to Israel with your life insurance, it's okay if the smaller companies are kept out, it's okay to insure buildings but not people. Maybe it won't work, but no harm will be done. 
   I would also add this: In terms of the rule, nothing in the bill that we are proposing today is new except for the Senate PAYGO, and the Senate PAYGO, we all agree, I believe, is superior, given the need to do a PAYGO. 
   This is a bill that was voted on in subcommittee and in committee and came to the floor. It was amended in various ways. It was a bipartisan product. In the end, the vote was something like 300-plus to 100-plus when the bill passed here in the House; not unanimous, obviously, but with a lot of bipartisanship. 
   Everything in the bill today, with the exception of the Senate PAYGO, has already been through subcommittee and committee and the floor. But we are saying to the Senate there are important issues here, on group life, on the reset, on travel, on smaller companies. And we are simply, I hope, not ready to say to them we roll over and play dead without giving them another chance to address these issues.

I would just say on this, and I didn't want to make it in any way partisan, but what we have been told is that the senior Republican on the committee, the gentleman from Alabama, has said this is all he will accept. I have talked to the chairman of the committee, the Senator from Connecticut, I've talked to the Senator from New York, and they were ready to discuss it. But they said that given Senate rules, they could not get the Senator from Alabama to do anything else, and they didn't feel they could change that. 
   There were also concerns that even if we were to send back exactly the bill that he had wanted, another Senator might object, because that is a volatile place. But we did talk to the Senator from Connecticut, we talked to the Senator from New York. The Senator from Alabama, the ranking minority member, was the major opponent. 
   I would yield to my friend.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the House passed a version of the terrorism risk insurance program by a large vote, 300-something to 100-something, earlier this year. It happened after a very open process at the subcommittee and committee level. We had a very good set of meetings. There were concerns raised. I think there was general agreement that terrorism insurance had to go forward, but there were some very legitimate debates about how to do it. Not all of them, obviously, have been resolved.     
   We had, unusual for our committee and I think maybe for other committees, a full markup in subcommittee followed by a full markup in committee. The bill that emerged was much closer to a consensus product, although obviously not unanimous. There were amendments offered by both sides. There were bipartisan compromises worked out. We came to the floor. It wasn't as open a process as I would have hoped, but it still represented, we thought, a fairly good piece of legislation, and, of course, it got well over 70 percent of the House Members voting for it. Then it went to the Senate and nothing happened for a very long time, and I regret that. We had hoped that we could continue this process and in fact have a conference. The Senate did not act. 
   Finally, the Senate acted and sent us a bill which was an extension of the current program, better in my view than the current program, not as comprehensive as the bill we passed. And we were told by the Senate, as we have been from time to time this year: This is all we can do. Take it or leave it. That seemed to me to be a problem and, now, not so much for substance as for institutional concerns. Members have asked, well, in the end we may just have to accept what the Senate sent us. That is possible, and we have preserved the option to do that. 
   Let me be very clear, Mr. Speaker. We are here dealing with a new bill that we introduced. The Senate bill still sits at the desk. It will be available if the Senate continues to refuse to act in any kind of a bicameral manner. But I am not ready to give up yet, Mr. Speaker, on some important issues, the most important of which is the institutional one. It is simply not in the spirit of the United States Constitution for one of the Houses to say, this is it, take it or leave it, especially when you contrast the way in which the two Houses acted. We had subcommittee and committee markup and debate on the floor. The Senate had one of their not very open processes. The bill emerged from some quiet conversations among the senior members of both parties and went to the floor, no amendments, no votes, here it is. As I said, I regret that. We may not be able to prevent it from happening in this instance. I do think it is important for us to send the message that we do not want to see this sort of procedure repeated. 
   So what we did was to in effect have a virtual conference. We looked at the Senate bill, we looked at our bill, and we came up with what I think might well have resulted had there been a conference. The bill we passed had a 15-year extension. The reason for a long extension is that we are talking here about building projects. We are talking about the need for terrorism risk insurance if we are to get large commercial buildings, or residential, but especially commercial buildings built in our big cities. You can't get those buildings obviously without bank loans and you can't get the bank loans without insurance. That is why the Chamber of Commerce scores this as an important bill, why the real estate industry, the cities, a whole range of business and urban interests tell us this is important. And you need to have some assurance of a timeframe in which to build. We thought 15 years. The Senate said 7 years. We didn't here come with a split-the-difference. We have accepted  the Senate's 7 years. We were told at the last minute that there was a PAYGO problem in a calculation by the Congressional Budget Office that I still do not understand, but we have no option but to abide by it. We came up with a PAYGO solution which was not a very good one. The Senate came up with, and I give them credit here, a much better PAYGO solution. They had more time to work on it, but they did it well. We have accepted the Senate PAYGO solution. So we accept that term of years, we accept that PAYGO solution. 
   We had also broadened this from simply being in case a building was destroyed to include group life insurance and protection against what sadly we cannot rule out, nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attacks. The Senate rejected both of those. We split the difference. We accepted their rejection of nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological attacks. We did feel that group life insurance should be in. I should say that including the group life provision is something that was called to our attention on a bipartisan basis from Members from Florida which says that you should not have your life insurance cancelled if you go to Israel. That is basically what we are talking about, or maybe some other areas where the insurance companies think there is a problem when there isn't one. And we checked, and the number of payoffs they have had to make of people who died going to Israel or other countries on their list is negligible, zero, from what we could tell. So we included a provision in our bill that was overwhelmingly supported by both sides, to say that there were rules; not that you couldn't deny someone life insurance if they were going to a hazardous area, but that you had to have a rational process by which you defined that. 
   We put group life back in. Members will remember that after the 2001 mass murders of so many innocent Americans by vicious thugs, we adopted a very expensive program to compensate people. A better way to do that would be to have this group life insurance as part of the terrorism risk insurance. 
   And at the request of smaller insurance companies, we lowered the trigger from $100 million to $50 million per incident, because small insurance companies said to us: We would like to be able to insure some of these buildings. Our colleagues from some of the smaller States brought this to our attention. But if it is $100 million that you have to absorb before this kicks in, we can't do it; we can do it at $50 million. 
   So we accept the Senate version on 7 years versus our 15. We accept their version of PAYGO. We accept their rejection of nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological weapons. We do ask that group life insurance be kept in with the travel provision I mentioned, and that the trigger go from $100 million to $50 million. 
   Finally, there is the reset provision, which says that if you have once been attacked and you have to deal with it, should that same area be attacked again, the clock starts again. That is, you would not be in a position where, having been attacked once by these vicious murderers, you would be unable to get full insurance if they did it a second time. 
   Those are the differences. As I said, we have no guarantee that the Senate will do this or pay even serious attention. We have retained a vehicle in case they don't. But I don't want, and I said this earlier, we are not debating preemptive strikes here. We are debating preemptive surrender. I don't want to have a situation where the United States Senate passes legislation, sends it to us and says, You may not even think about changing things. 
   We are prepared to compromise. But I think inclusion of group life and that travel protection is important. We think that the smaller insurance companies had a legitimate concern. We think the reset provision is legitimate. 
   We are asking the Senate again to consider them. We can't compel that. But I think it would be a mistake for us to set the precedent that, when they confront us with these ultimata, that we simply cave in. 
   Let me repeat, because I got it right now. I was quoting before the lyric from ``MacArthur Park.'' What the Senate tells us is, Look, we were able to do this, but we can't do it again. You just have to accept it as it is. And the theme song apparently is, if people will remember; I will say it because I sing something awful. 
   ``Someone left the cake out in the rain. 
   I don't think that I can take it 
   'Cause it took so long to bake it 
   And I'll never have the recipe again.'' 
   If someone in the Senate tells us, we left the bill out in the rain, or at least they are telling us that if we were to try to get them to change it, it would be leaving the bill out in the rain, and they couldn't remake it because they don't have the recipe. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think it's time to send the Senate back to their recipe books and ask them to keep track. I understand in the end we may not be able to change things, but I do not want this House simply at this point to say, Okay, you gave us an ultimatum, we accept it. 
   I would hope, and we are going to be here obviously next week, that the small life insurance companies, people interested in the ability to travel to Israel and others would then at least go to Senators and say, Can't we at least even have a vote on this? Can't you even consider this? 
   And that is why I ask that today we send this bill back over. We retain a vehicle if the Senate remains impervious, but I think it's worth a try. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, first of all, there is no chance of waiting until after it expires. I don't know why the gentleman would have said that. He knows there is zero chance of that. 
   Now, I agree it has waited too long. But I would have been more impressed with the urgency if I had had people joining us in trying to get the Senate to act. We passed the bill months ago. We would have liked to have seen an act. But I didn't hear all this passion trying to force the Senate to act, and it was partly the minority in the Senate that was blocking it, that is, block the ability to have a conference.     
   Here is the point. I think telling the life insurance companies that they should not be restricting people's ability to travel unfairly is important. We think group life is important. We think that not allowing your community to be disadvantaged if it has been attacked once is important. And we may not be able to accomplish them this year, but we think it is important not simply to cave in and say those aren't even worth fighting for. 
   We are going to send a message, I hope, by voting for those principles because we pass the bill this year, and we may have to accept a minimal position, but we will be back here in a month or two and we hope to renew some of these things. 
   So I just reject the notion that the Senate can achieve this by waiting and waiting and waiting and then saying, Oh, well, there isn't enough time. There is not enough time because they held it up. No one can seriously argue that having seen this delay of many months, and again I didn't hear all this passion trying to make the Senate act for all of those months, nobody can argue that another day or two is going to make a difference. And that's what we're talking about. 
   So I reiterate, there is no chance of this expiring. Everybody knows that. We have preserved our ability at any point simply to accept this bill. The question is do we give up now or do we send them the message that the ability to travel to Israel, the concern for the small insurance companies being able to insure commercial properties and the concern for group life and not just property, that those are important issues. 
   We can take that vote today and send that message. And if we have to, we will accommodate reality. But we will have sent that message, and it gives us a basis upon which to act next year. 
   I yield now 6 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Ackerman).

   The gentleman has raised a red herring. There is no chance of it expiring, and the fact that he would talk about a nonexistent threat of expiration seems to me to be an indication that there's nothing substantive to talk about. 
   In the end, we would retain the vehicle to pass this bill. But we will not give up talking about issues prematurely, and that's why we will not allow the Senate's unanimous consent agreement, very hastily done, to shut off debate here. But there is no chance of this expiring and the gentleman from Alabama knows that. 
   I yield now 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott), a member of the committee.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I would just say the gentleman from Alabama appears to have the Senate's preference for conflict avoidance confused with genuine consensus. 
   There weren't 100 votes for that. They didn't have a roll call vote. They're barely able to act, and so a couple of Members worked out a deal and the rest of them waved it good-bye. But the notion that that comes with some great significance clearly misunderstands what's happening, and it certainly shouldn't keep us from legislating. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Sires).

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin with the schizophrenic attitude towards the Senate. The gentleman said a number of times that the Senate passed this unanimously. Yes, by avoiding conference, by making a deal. 
   But he also continually said, correctly, that this bill was passed way too late. Why are we here now? The answer as to why we're here now, Mr. Speaker, it's the Senate that he was so admiring of. Yes, the Senate passed it without a vote, on November 16. We passed the bill on September 19. The House passed the bill with 3 1/2 months left to go in the year. The Senate passed the bill less than a month ago. The Senate passed the bill, by the way, a different bill than ours, after we had adjourned for the recess. 
   So the Senate, whom he extols for having managed to put everything under the rug and make one of their deals where nobody gets fingerprinted for anything, they sent us this bill, and the earliest we could have passed it was last week. So all this rhetoric about 6 months, et cetera, well, that's, Mr. Speaker, his friends in the Senate who caused that problem. If they had worked with us, we would have had several months. 
   Now, we are going to pass a bill. We understand that. And we may well be able to pass only the Senate bill early next week. We have preserved our ability to do that. There is no chance of this expiring. The question is this: Should we acquiesce in a procedure by which the United States Senate waits until after we have adjourned for the Thanksgiving recess and sends us a bill and says, this is it, take it or leave it, or do we say, no, we don't like that and we're going to at least try to make you vote on things. 
   Now, I know the gentleman from Alabama likes the Senate version apparently where you just have unanimity so-called. I prefer democracy. I prefer letting things get voted on. Maybe the Senate won't vote, but let's at least give them one more option. It may take us another 3 or 4 days. So the notion that we are somehow delaying this for 3 or 4 days, no. We waited from our bill in September to theirs in November. Two months later they passed it. Three days or 4 days isn't going to make any difference and we'll get the bill through. 
   Here's what we want to do. We want to say that the point that the gentlewoman from Florida made that you should not arbitrarily cancel people's life insurance because they're traveling to a country that's on the State Department watch list, whether it's the nation of Israel or others that Americans want to travel to. Yes, if you can show that there's danger there, you can cut off their insurance. But don't say that we're just going to give up on that. Maybe we can't do it this year. Let's take the motion to recommit, then, because we're going to pass this bill soon, anyway, and we may have to pass the Senate version. Let's have a referendum on the freedom to travel provision. Let's have a referendum on whether or not we include group life or say that we insure buildings in this country but not life. Let's have a referendum on whether smaller insurance companies should be able to participate. Under our bill they can. Under the Senate bill they can't. And let's have that reset mechanism that the gentleman from Queens, New York, talked about so eloquently, which says we're going to rebuild and any place that's hit, we will rebuild them again. 
   Let me say, we have a referendum on those issues. We may not be able to win this year, but I want to be able, as chairman of the committee, to go back early next year and say to our friends in the Senate, okay, your rope-a-dope tactics may have worked, but they didn't work on the merits.     
   And we want to go back at you on small insurance companies and on group life and on the question of freedom to travel, and we want to bring it up again. 
   And the last point, when we're talking about why is this being done now, it's supposed to be temporary? I never thought it would be temporary. Here's the point: If you go through the private market, it is paid for by the insured, ultimately. I do not think that those people who are choosing to do business in areas that may be singled out by the terrorists ought to have to pay the higher cost of insuring themselves for that. Against fire, against theft, against liability for someone falling down, sure, that's their responsibility. But defending ourselves against terrorism is not a market matter; it's a matter of national security. And the whole country ought to come together in a unified way and say you may not threaten New York or Chicago or Atlanta or Miami, or any other part of America, or Los Angeles, as they threatened the airport. You may not threaten us and make us pay more. You cannot make it more expensive to do business in one part of this country than another. We will come together as one Nation in this program and say, yes, you are responsible for insuring yourself against various dangers. But for insuring yourself against murderous thugs seeking to do harm to this country, this country will come together as one in a national program and rebut that, and we will not allow them to intrude. 
   Now, again, it may be that in the end the best we can get is the Senate bill. But at this point, I urge the Members not to vote down, in principle, a reset mechanism that says, okay, you only get hit once and then you're gone, or the freedom to travel, or group life, or smaller companies. 
   I hope the motion to recommit is defeated and that we let the Senate know that we will continue to engage in democracy in this part of the Capitol.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, we have just heard a great example of an important form of political debate. The Republicans specialize in this. It is kind of political necrophilia. There is this love of dead Democrats among many Republicans. Democrats who, when they were alive were trashed by the right wing, once they are dead and safely no longer possibly candidates for office, get lionized. Nothing of course shows that better than with Harry Truman, but it is John Kennedy, and it is others. 
   The assertion that the Democrats who are supporting this resolution, and the unspoken Republicans who will be joining with us, that we somehow oppose the use of force is terrible history. It is wrong. In fact, the most recent entirely successful use of military force by the United States came from a Democratic President, Bill Clinton--he's still alive, so don't say good things about him--and supported by Democrats in Congress, and it was opposed by many of the Republicans, including many of the current Republican leadership. 
   Under Bill Clinton, American military forces were used quite successfully; and the result is not perfection but a much better situation in the former Yugoslavia than we had before. And the Republicans brought forth, guess what, nonbinding resolutions. 
   Now, they pretend to be upset about nonbinding resolutions. Frankly, I was a little encouraged when I heard the Bush administration criticize nonbinding resolutions, because, up till now, I had thought that Bush and Cheney thought that everything we did was nonbinding with regard to national security. So they were at least implicitly conceding that some things can be binding. 
   But the fact is that the Democrats strongly supported--I didn't mean to make it partisan, they did--the effort in Yugoslavia over Republican opposition. 
   And then let's talk about terrorists. We were attacked in 9/11 from Afghanistan and overwhelmingly, with only one exception, Democrats in the House and Senate supported the war in Afghanistan. We are continuing to support that war in Afghanistan. 
   I am critical of an administration which has diverted military resources and energy and political resources from Afghanistan. They are weakening the number one fight against terrorism, which is in Afghanistan. And that is one of the reasons for opposing this war in Iraq. 
   Now, the war in Iraq has been, in my judgment, the greatest national security disaster in America history. And it isn't one in which we got sucked in and had to defend ourselves. It was an entirely voluntary error. This administration unwisely went into Iraq on inaccurate grounds; and not only did they make the wrong war, they have been disastrously wrong in virtually every decision. So the question now is, are we doing more good than harm to the causes we care about? 
   I believe, in fact, that fighting terrorism, fighting extremism, fighting that particularly radical fundamentalist form of Islam, not all Islam, obviously, by all means, that that is  weakened by our being in Iraq. It has clearly weakened our effort in Afghanistan. The commanders in Afghanistan beg for more troops, and instead they go uselessly to Iraq, uselessly not because of the lack of capacity of the fighting people but because they are condemned to fight in a very mistaken strategy. 
   It has emboldened radicals elsewhere. This administration predicted that our overthrowing Saddam Hussein would strengthen the forces of moderation. In fact, it has weakened them. 
   Let's remember that when America invaded Afghanistan with the overwhelming support of both parties and the united support of this country, we were popular in the world. We mobilized the world. And since that time came the invasion of Iraq. And because of the mistaken decision and the poor way in which it is carried out, I do not think there has been a time in recent history when America has been less able to accomplish in the world the things we want to accomplish. 
   So then the question is, okay, but isn't this escalation going to change that? 
   There is zero reason to think that. First, we are told this is what the administration says. If ever any group of people forfeited their right to be listened to, it is the collection of people who have shown an aggressive incompetence with regard to Iraq. Can anyone think of a single decision from the invasion forward that has been correct, that has been borne out by events? 
   So why do you take people who have been wrong about everything, wrong about the politics, wrong about the military situation, wrong about the economy, and then you say, oh, but this time we think they got it right. Maybe it is the theory of random occurrences, that people, having been wrong so often and so consistently, they are owed one. But that is not a basis on which we ought to be making a decision. 
   This war in Iraq continues to hurt rather than help our efforts overall. If I thought we were doing some good there, then it would be a different story. But the causes of the disaster, in addition to the rampant incompetence of this administration at virtually all levels, the cause of the disaster is internal, it is ethnic and political and a whole range of other things within Iraq. It is not a lack of American firepower. 
   So to try to resolve this disaster by taking the advice of people who created the disaster and have been wrong about it would be a terrible error, and I hope the resolution passes.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. If the gentleman from California wants to claim Iraq as a success, he is entitled to do that. I must say that the initial victory was a very deceptive one, because it led to the current situation. But the biggest difference between us, I guess, is when he cites Lebanon as one of the successful ripples, as he says. In fact, the terrible tragedy that went on in Lebanon that was initially something that was promising, we have had that war with Hezbollah in control in Israel, I think Lebanon is a further sad example of the extent to which this misguided and badly run operation in Iraq has sadly strengthened the most radical and anti-American forces in the Middle East, not weaken them.

   We had an open rule. Any amendment that they wanted to offer could have been offered as long as it met the deadline, which was a very long deadline. Now we have ambush legislation again. There have been 10 tries at this. 
   Mr. Speaker, if they really wanted this to be debated thoughtfully, it would have been an amendment. It wouldn't have been held back for 5 and 5 with us having only a chance to read it now. It is just one more attempt to kill the bill.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. No, I will not yield, Mr. Speaker. I will not be part of self-ambush. I will say to the gentleman from Virginia, offer an amendment when you have the right to offer an amendment, and we will debate the amendment at length as we debated many of these amendments. 
   But to play this kind of ambush game, do not expect cooperation. 
   The gentleman may say, well, it is unfair. We got the last word. That was his choice. The gentleman could have offered the amendment in a fashion that would have allowed a broad debate on it. But they chose to have the benefit of the ambush, but not pay the price of it. 
   This kills the affordable housing fund. What it says is none of this money goes for rental housing. 
   By the way, they list a lot of the States. They say ``including.'' It can go to any State; so does the bill as it now stands. The bill as it now stands allows the money to be spent in any State. And the key is this: This amendment, if you take it at face value, I would advise that, but if you do, it kills rental housing. 
   Now, homeownership is a good thing, but as we have seen from the subprime problem, if you ignore people who should be renting, if you try to shoehorn everybody into homeownership and don't build a single unit of affordable rental housing, and that is what this amendment says, this amendment says none of the funds go to build rental housing, it is all homeownership. Homeownership is useful, but it is not the exclusive answer and we have a problem of people being pushed into it. 
   Then this says ``promptly.'' Promptly means maybe not, as we know in parliamentary language. We got some explanation why it couldn't be ``forthwith.'' 
   There are some people who don't like this bill. They don't have the votes to kill it. They have tried every which way to do that.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, we debated a long time on Thursday. I had to have my cast rewrapped because I was waving my arm so much. I did become unwrapped, I will tell the House. 
   But the point is this: We had ample opportunity to debate this with give-and-take. But you cannot, Mr. Speaker, it seems to me, expect to come in at the last minute with a very tough amendment that kills the housing fund  that we have already voted on 10 times because it says no rental housing can be built at all under this, says ``promptly'' rather than ``forthwith'' for no good reason except they don't like the bill and don't have the votes to kill it, and then says you wouldn't give me a chance to go back and forth. 
   Yes, the rule did. The rule said that this amendment, if it was a thoughtful attempt to amend the bill, could have been offered as an amendment. Instead, it is held back. No one gets to see it until literally a minute before the debate starts. It is a 3-page amendment. It kills the affordable housing in a very limited debate. 
   To put this forward under a procedure which Members know limits debate to 5 minutes and 5 minutes, and then to complain that there isn't enough back and forth, Mr. Speaker, that is the equivalent of accusing the Three Stooges of being silly, and I hope the recommital is defeated.

We hear a great deal about public sector-private sector, and I believe that people have unwisely seen this as if there was an opposition. In fact, we need to cooperate, and I particularly here want to call attention to an aspect of this bill that is relevant to those who tend to see the private sector as the fountain of all benefits and the public sector as somehow a source of negative activity. 
   What we are doing here is giving local governments the right to use Federal money to clean up messes that were left behind by the private sector. Brownfields overwhelmingly are the result of industrial activity that was once profitable and no longer is. That doesn't mean that the people that did it were bad people, necessarily. It does mean given the change in economics, private sector entities walked away in many cases and left the public sector responsible for these cleanups. 
   What we are doing here is giving more flexibility to local communities so that they don't have to take out a section 108 loan, which can tie up their Community Development Block Grant funds for a long time. It does give in to local judgment. 
   I do want to note one very important point that the gentleman from Michigan, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, has stressed, and a point on which I am in complete agreement with him, namely that the funding flexibility here should be for brownfields, not for Superfund sites. 
   In the Superfund situation, we have provisions for those who polluted to have to pay in to cleaning up the messes they left behind. We do not want the brownfields money here to be used in any way to diminish that liability. 
   So I very much agree with the point that was made by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell). In fact, when we sent this bill previously to the Senate, they removed the restriction that we had put in there that would have prevented this from happening, and we then would not pass the bill. We will send this again to the Senate and we hope they will accept that this is for brownfields, it is not for Superfund. It should be used in this very strict way so as to not become a substitute for private contributions that ought to be coming. 
   If we limit this to CDBG money for the brownfields situation, we will be doing it right. This bill is entitled the Brownfields Redevelopment Enhancement Act. We want moneys that are freed up here to be used only for that purpose. 
   Mr. Speaker, with that, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1066. 
   It does occur to me on reflection that we should have asked the gentleman from Florida and the gentleman from Washington, Mr. Hastings and Mr. Hastings, to join in supporting this bill given its number. But in their absence, I will note that this is a bill that passed the House last year unanimously as part of a larger regulatory relief bill that came out of the Committee on Financial Services. It went to the Senate, and the Senate passed much of what we sent them but not all of it.     
   The Senate deleted some provisions. We, in the interest of getting some legislation through, accepted the Senate's proposal, and so much of what we sent originally did become law. Some pieces did not. 
   This is a piece that provides more flexibility for banks that are engaging in what is called, and it is a particular legal term here, public welfare investments. Banks are allowed to spend, invest up to 15 percent of their capital in what are called public welfare investments. This would allow that very good policy some more flexibility. 
   I would note, that, for instance, the Association of Affordable Housing Lenders, people who build subsidized housing, are in favor of this change. What it does is it broadens the definition. It doesn't change the 15 percent, but it gives more flexibility. 
   We have this situation where we do want these investments to be for the benefit of low and moderate income people. But it is one thing to say that they should generally be for the benefit of low and moderate income people, and another to strictly confine them to areas that have this direct benefit. What you do is you lose the flexibility we would like. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will include in the record at this point letters from John Reich, the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, and John Dugan, the Comptroller of the Currency.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. (NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE ACT OF 1968 AMENDMENTS -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, from time to time in this House we are asked to choose, to some extent, between the strong views of people concerned with excessive spending by the Federal Government and those interested in environmental protection. Let me say to the Members, today is a happier day because we bring forward a bill today out of the Financial Services Committee which is authored by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett), who will soon be speaking, which advances the legitimate concerns of both those interested in saving taxpayer money and those interested in environmental protection. 
   We have a Federal flood insurance program that exists because of market failure. That is, we do not believe that if you abolish it altogether the private market could entirely handle this. In fact, there are some areas where this committee is moving, and this House has voted, to expand the role of Federal flood insurance, particularly in the area of disasters. But as we do that, it is important that we do it in a responsible way. 
   There has been legitimate criticism of the flood insurance program as it was existing before. Frankly, this committee, both, again, under Mr. Oxley's chairmanship and recently, addressed it, and it encouraged people to build where they should not have built from an environmental standpoint and incurred too much taxpayer money. Essentially, there was too much subsidy in the program, from both the environmental and fiscal standpoints, to builders. 
   In the bill that we adopted last year in the previous session, we began to address that. We began to charge people a more appropriate amount, but we did not do it fully. The gentleman from New Jersey had an amendment that he wanted to offer that we considered in committee, and we had talked about it being offered on the floor. I regret that he wasn't given the chance to offer it on the floor, and I gave him my word that we would, as soon as possible, bring it forward. And it is my intention, if this bill passes today, as I expect that it will, if and when we get to work with the United States Senate on comprehensive legislation, this will be a part of this. In effect, this is a delayed amendment to the flood insurance bill we've already passed, and it will be treated in any deliberations in which I am a part as if it had been included back then. 
   So, I think the gentleman from New Jersey has done us a service by giving us something that is both environmentally and fiscally responsible. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. (SECTION 515 RURAL HOUSING PROPERTY TRANSFER IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the leadership that my colleague and neighbor from New Hampshire has shown on this bill, and I appreciate, also, the work on the other side. 
   Let me begin with a very important point: People in this country, I think, and our friends in the media misunderstand the true and legitimate meaning of partisanship. Partisanship has a very essential role to play in democracy. The Founding Fathers simultaneously launched this Nation, denounced parties, and formed them, because it does seem inevitable when large numbers of people are going to govern themselves that some forms of organization come forward. 
   Partisanship is not only not a bad thing, it's a necessary thing in a self-governing polity. Partisanship becomes a problem if the legitimate differences that define the parties spill over angrily and make it impossible to work on issues where those differences should not exist. 
   I think the Committee on Financial Services, under my predecessor as chairman, Mr. Oxley of Ohio, and I hope under my own chairmanship, have shown that that is not necessary to be the case, that it is possible from time to time to have legitimate strong differences on an ideological or partisan basis without that in any way interfering with our ability to come together on areas where we should agree. This bill, obviously, today is an example of the latter. 
   We have a bill that has been brought forward in a totally bipartisan manner to improve the efficiency with which  assistance goes for rural housing. That's the second point I wanted to make. Much of what we do is, in fact, to improve the efficiency with which programs work, and the committee has had a chance to bring several bills to the floor that do that. We will be doing more. 
   The gentleman from New Hampshire mentioned one of the conflicts we are trying to resolve here is between the rules that apply when you were trying to use tax credits for low-income housing and those that apply when you were talking about the programmatic legislation. We do something about that here. 
   Under the leadership of the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel), and the Financial Services Committee, we are working out legislation that will do that kind of reconciliation for all housing programs. And we will shortly have on the floor of this House a bill that will greatly increase the efficiency with which all housing programs can be merged, tax-based ones and appropriations-based ones, increasing the amount of housing we can build at no further increase to the taxpayer. 
   And the third point I would note is that this is rural housing. Too often when people think about Federal housing programs they think only about the urban areas. Urban areas are important, but so are rural areas. And I am very proud that this committee has given equal attention, or let me say appropriate attention, to both. Obviously, the need is often greater in the more heavily populated areas, but we have given fully proportionate attention to the rural areas. 
   So, I am very proud we have a bill today that shows how you can be bipartisan, even while there are legitimate partisan differences, that aims at increasing the efficiency with which Federal funds are spent and which recognizes that people in the rural areas have a need for housing assistance, to some extent, just as do people in the urban areas. 
   I thank the gentleman from New Hampshire for the leadership he has shown. I appreciate the gentlewoman from West Virginia, who has become the ranking member of the Housing Subcommittee and with whom we have very good relationships. And I hope the bill is passed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I will address much of the substance of the bill in the general debate. I do want to say we are here dealing with an issue, subprime mortgages, that is the single biggest contributor to the greatest financial crisis the world has seen since the Asian crisis of the late nineties. 
   We are in a very difficult situation now in the financial markets; and wholly unregulated subprime mortgages, unregulated by the originator and then unregulated in the secondary market, has given rise to this. 
   The previous speaker talked about the danger we could do with our liability for the securitizers. I would note that one of those who volunteered to our committee that we should do something, he wasn't specific about what, but something to put some liability there was the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Mr. Bernanke, who has talked about what he called the originate-to-distribute model, i.e., people who give mortgages who are not themselves subject to regulation who then in turn sell into a secondary market, and what has been lost in that is the responsibility to worry about repayment. Now, we will talk more about this. 
   There is a delicate balance here. I am not in favor and this bill does not in general preempt the rights of States to do what they think is necessary in the consumer protection area. But in the matter I just talked about, when we are talking about a national secondary market, we did believe some preemption is necessary. We have tried to define it precisely and hold it to a minimum necessary to have a functioning market. As I said, I will address some of those more. 
   The bill, I believe, does strike a balance that can be a difficult one to achieve, particularly in that area of some preemption so that you have a functioning secondary market, but not to the point where you intrude on the rights of States to make these decisions. 
   I do want to address the rule. At my request this rule does make in order a number of amendments from both parties. Several of the amendments offered by Republicans will be, I hope, accepted. The manager's amendment itself is a genuinely bipartisan amendment. Much of the manager's amendment, in fact, came from the minority; and, indeed, in our committee the ranking member had a major input into this. This bill did pass committee by a vote of 45-19, which was the Democrats and, not a majority, but a significant number of Republicans. 
   We have, I believe, a rule that allows most of the issues that are at stake to be voted on. There are amendments that would strike major parts of the bill. The gentleman from North Carolina has one. The gentleman from Georgia has one. There is a third, the gentleman from New Jersey. Three amendments that would strike very much at the heart of the bill. I believe they should be debated and I would hope defeated, but they are made in order. 
   I did consult very much with the ranking member, and I believe we have a procedure today that doesn't cover everything, but will have the major issues before us. 
   At the end of today, I hope we will have passed a bill and it will be a bill which I must say will probably leave all parties at interest a little bit unhappy. I'm not pleased with that, but I think given the competing interests here, that is the best we can do, particularly on this issue of whether or not we preempt. 
   I would note that while some of the groups that I work with in the consumer area are disappointed because they wanted no preemption at all, passage of this bill is supported by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors. They think there are some things they would like to see changed further on. It's supported by the NAACP and La Raza. And it has, we believe, the essential elements. 
   The core is this: loans made by banks as originators subject to bank regulation have not been the problem. The problem has come when loans were originated by unregulated people, not that they were morally deficient, but there was no regulation. Here is the core of this bill: we have tried talking to the bank regulators and others to take the principles that the bank regulators have applied to loans originated by regulated depository institutions and apply them to the unregulated originators, the brokers. And it is not the case that the brokers were morally deficient. In all of these professions, we have an overwhelming majority of honest people. But the problem is, in the absence of any regulation and the availability of a secondary market with no rules, that minority that was not scrupulous caused us problems. This bill fixes that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   We are dealing with legislation today that seeks to prevent a repetition of events that caused one of the most serious financial crises in recent times. 
   We understand today that we are in a worldwide problem economically, with a terrible shortage of credit, with some institutions threatened. There is no debate about what is the largest single cause of that. 
   Innovations in the mortgage industry, in themselves good and useful, but conducted in such a completely unregulated manner as to have led to this crisis, I know people have said, well, we may be exaggerating it. Here's what we recently heard from the head of the Blackstone operation: 
   ``The mortgage black hole is, I think, worse than anyone saw. Deeper, darker, scarier. The banks are now looking at new reserves and my sense ..... is they don't have a clear picture of how this will play out.'' That's from one of the leading private sector entities. 
   What we have today is a bill that cannot undo what happened but makes it much less likely that it will happen in the future. 
   The fundamental principle of the bill, and many people have lost sight of this, is not to put remedies into place to deal with these problems when they recur, but to stop them from occurring in the first place. 
   We have had two groups of mortgage originators recently. We have had banks subject to the regulation of the bank regulators, and they've made mortgage loans. And then we have had mortgage loans made by brokers who were subject to no regulation, who had access to pools of money that were not regulated and could sell it to an unregulated secondary market. It is not the case that the brokers are morally inferior to the bankers. In both cases we are talking about people overwhelmingly who are decent and well-intentioned. The difference is the absence of regulation so that pressures to do things that were irresponsible were checked by regulation in the banking area and were left unchecked elsewhere. 
   Essentially what this bill does in its most important form is to try to conceptualize the rules that bank regulators used to prevent loans from being made that should not have been made and apply them to all loan originators. Again, the goal is not to give more remedies when people face foreclosure when there have been abuses, but to prevent the abuses in the first place. 
   One question has been raised from some in the Attorney General field and elsewhere who say, what about our current efforts to deal with the people who were abused? Thanks to a very explicit amendment by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Watt) who, along with the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Miller), is one of the main authors of this bill, this bill will be entirely prospective in its effect, and people should understand no cause of action, no legal complaint, no remedy sought against anybody who up until now and until this bill is signed many months in the future, none of those causes of action will be abrogated. Every remedy being pursued against past abuses and even abuses that may yet to have occurred, although we hope they won't, until this bill becomes law will not be stopped. 
   There is some controversy about preemption. The bill takes a balanced position which has made a lot of people on all sides a little bit unhappy. We do not preempt the right of States to decide how to deal with mortgage originators, with lenders, with any of those. We do say that with regard to the secondary market, we are going to put some liability on those who are the active packagers, and that's in some ways controversial; but we believe the unregulated secondary market was a large part of this problem. 
   We do believe that you need to have some uniform rules if you are going to have a functioning secondary market. And we believe the secondary market has been on the whole useful but, having been unregulated, has caused some problems. So there is a limited preemption to that extent.  
   We are continuing to talk with people about ways to, frankly, improve this bill. There will be some amendments adopted today that will do this. It is a subject of great complexity with a lot of interlocking parts and some legitimate competing interests. We have arrived today, we think, at a reasonable balance. We do not believe that this is the way the bill absolutely will look in the end, but it is clear progress. And I want to stress the key point here is not in remedying past abuses. This bill allows all existing remedies for past abuses to stay in effect. This bill tries hard to prevent this pattern of loans being made that should not have been made for a variety of reasons from recurring and causing that great damage. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I yield myself my remaining time to enter into a colloquy with my colleague from Alabama. 
   Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Alabama, this has been a collaborative effort in many ways. We have had some disagreements, but there has been a lot of agreement. And the gentleman from Alabama in particular took the lead in the language that went into the bill in committee and is being refined here dealing with nationwide registration requirements, a prerequisite for any kind of enforcement. Now, I appreciated the work he did and the committee benefited from it. 
   Community banks are obviously very important in this. And, indeed, if only community banks had made loans for mortgages, we wouldn't have a crisis. But we don't want to interfere with their ability to help going forward. 
   I would just yield to the gentleman in a minute to have him give his interpretation. My view is, and I defer to him as the spokesperson for the committee on this, because we are here talking about language which he developed and which we incorporated. We do have some regulatory requirements here that would affect not just the brokers but community banks. And I assume my colleague from Alabama, in drafting this, certainly intended and we meant to do this in the language, that the regulatory agencies would be able to show some flexibility in terms of the impact of these requirements on our community banks. 
   I would yield to my friend from Alabama on that point.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I thank the gentleman. In my closing seconds, let me just reiterate an important point. 
   Attorneys General have been concerned about their ability to prosecute and defend against certain abuses. Thanks to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Watt), the effective date of this bill and all of its provisions will be the date of enactment. What that means is that any transaction that occurred before the bill becomes law, any loan that was made, will not be subject to the preemption. So we do want to reassure any law enforcement official out there that their rights to go against people who have been abusive will in no way, up until new loans are made, be in any way diminished.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, first, this bill makes some substantive changes, including one of the things we came across was the problem of people who were renting who lost their right to live there when there was a foreclosure. 
   We have compromised in this. I have had some conversations; I will have some further ones with the gentleman from Colorado. But we do try to preserve some protection for the renters in the bill. As passed by committee, we had 12 months. This reduces it some to 6 months as the maximum. We will talk more about it. 
   Beyond that, there are two things that the manager's amendment clarifies, and I have found from some on the consumer side two objections in this bill, and we deal with these in the manager's amendment and we will deal with them further. One is the issue of preemption. 
   I think a certain amount of preemption is essential if we are going to have a secondary market, but it is possible to read the language previously as preempting more than we meant to. What this amendment does is to make very clear that, no matter what the issue is, if the problem was based on fraud or misrepresentation, deception, or false advertising, there is no preemption. The ability of people to go after anything that was based on misrepresentation or fraud is fully preserved, whether or not it affected their ability to pay. 
   Secondly, we have--and I am pleased to note that La Raza and the NAACP support this bill--we included at the insistence of the gentleman from North Carolina and the gentleman from California specific language about civil rights violations. No civil rights violation that a State may have would be preempted. 
   So we have narrowed the preemption. We have made it clear it does not preempt anything growing out of fraud. 
   The second issue that has led to some concern, and I am about to yield to my friend from North Carolina (Mr. Miller) has to do with compensation. It was our intention to say that no one who was originating a loan should be given an incentive to put the consumer in a loan that would charge that consumer more than he or she could otherwise get, and we dealt with that. 
   The question then came about the way in which brokers are compensated, and we tried to provide two things: One, an absolute prohibition on any incentive to charge people more, but, two, not an interference with the way in which people chose to make those payments. 
   We thought we had the language clear. Some people think it isn't clear enough. One of the things we will do is to make that clearer. 
   And I would yield on this point to the gentleman from North Carolina.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Yes. I would say, and let me just read the language at the bottom of page 4 of the manager's amendment. Those payments ``do not vary based on the terms of the loan or the consumer's decision about whether to finance.'' 
   So we have tried to make it very explicit: Flexibility in method does not in any way reduce the prohibitions that have been stated against an incentive to charge more. And if it is necessary for us to say that again more clearly, as some people may think it is, we will find new ways to say it.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I yield myself 1 minute to comment on what the gentlewoman has said because we've agreed to the gentleman's amendment, so we're on some other subjects now. 
   What I would say is this: I would want to stress with regard, for instance, to ability to pay and jeopardizing the right of the homeowner, nothing in this bill in any way diminishes State remedies regarding ability to pay on prime loans. That's the argument, that we do not deal with the ability to pay on prime loans, et cetera. But the effect of that is that any remedy a State wants to pursue against the originator of the loan or the lender remains unimpeded. So we did want to make that point. 
   And just to say also, with regard to the incentive to charge more, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Miller) and I discussed that. It will be very clear to anybody by the time this bill becomes law that there is no possibility of anyone being given higher compensation in return for getting people into a more expensive loan. 
   As to preemption, there will be some. There are people who want none at all. I do not think you could have a secondary market if there were no preemption. But we have already, in the manager's amendment, defined it, and I think reassured people that, for instance, fraud, deception, et cetera, that causes arising out of that will not be preempted. 
   I now yield the remaining time to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee).

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I will say on this, as on a number of other issues, I will say very sincerely that the gentleman from North Carolina has persuaded me. I think he has clearly identified an issue that needs some further work. And as we go forward, ultimately to get this bill done, I would hope that we can work together on this.

   Mr. FRANK OF Massachusetts. The gentleman said he had been led to believe that I would be supportive. I wouldn't want the gentleman to be in suspense as to whether or not he had been misled. 
   I know there have been conversations between him and the gentleman from North Carolina about a secondary amendment. And assuming everything goes as we have all discussed, he has not been misled. The gentleman can sleep easily tonight that people told him the truth, because I am prepared to be supportive of what we have got worked out. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

If as we go forward, assuming the secondary amendment and the primary amendment are adopted, if the gentleman needs some further clarification of questions that we can deal with between now and the time of the final bill, we are open to continue those discussions.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I appreciate the gentlewoman coming forward. She has on this and other occasions played a very constructive role in helping us work things out. We have already done this for the Veterans Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs. Yes, in fact, it is our hope to get more people into the FHA program as an alternative to subprime. One of the things we've done, and the Senate is now doing it, is to extend the FHA's reach to people with subprime; although I do want to remind my friends in the Senate, I feel very strongly that when we do that, it would be terrible social policy to make people with weaker credit who are faithfully making their payments pay more than other people, and we will deal with that as we work out the two bills. 
   But for purposes of this bill, the gentlewoman is absolutely correct. So I intend to support her amendment. 
   And that leaves me with some extra time, so I would now yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California, a member of the committee.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. As I said to my friend from Louisiana, I know everybody can't hear everything. He defends against an accusation that was not made when he said, Don't say they are all up to no good. Several of us on this side have explicitly said that we believe the majority are well-intentioned. The problem, I think, is that where there are people who are not well-intentioned, there are no rules to stop them. But we did on several occasions quite say the opposite of what the gentleman said we shouldn't have said.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I offer this amendment, but I do not intend to push it today. I will be withdrawing it with the consent of the body. I was not as careful as I should have been in supervising or making clear my intentions in what I wanted. I do believe one of the two most controversial items in this is preemption. Very few people think we have done preemption just right. Fortunately, a lot of us are here. A lot of other people think we have done too much or too little. 
   The question of preemption is really twofold: one, should you preempt; and, secondly, having preempted, having prevented the State from acting, have you put sufficient rules in there to defer bad behavior. I think we probably didn't, as I read this over. That is, I think we have preempted, as we have clarified it, the right amount: not too much and not too little. But we have not put into the preemption enough in terms of deterrence. 
   We do have the policies and procedures in the safe harbor exemption. But what I think we should have and what this amendment was meant to embody is the ability of aggrieved parties or representatives, Attorneys General of the States, others, to go to the regulator of the entity in question and say, Look, there's been this pattern of abuse. When we have a pattern of abuse, you act. 
   We did not want to make the liability for any one violation too heavy. We didn't want to overkill. But we then would run into the problem the gentleman from North Carolina talked about, where violations at a moderate level of penalty could be simply a cost of doing business. So having a pattern and practice approach in here prevents people from treating a moderate penalty from simply being a cost of doing business. 
   It was drafted more than I had intended. That is my fault. I should have been paying more attention. I do not think originators ought to be covered in this, certainly not with a $1 million limitation. 
   So for that reason I am going to offer this and say that I hope to withdraw it now and work on it further. 
   I would yield to my friend from Colorado who is one of those who brought some of the problems here to my attention.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Let me take back my time. The gentleman raised that issue. 
   The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Marchant) raised an issue on renter protection. So you cannot be the homeowner being foreclosed upon and then get the rights of a tenant. The gentleman from Colorado had a further point, which is in those cases where there was a very specific prohibition in the loan against rental, that should not be overcome by what we do. 
   I would yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from North Carolina.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Let me take back the time. The gentleman has underlined an important point. We are going to see this back again in somewhat buffed-up form. It goes to the regulators, so this isn't going to lead to court. It is not an explosion of litigation. It would allow a range of people to bring it, including State Attorneys General, but it would be brought to the regulator, someone familiar with that business model and an entity able to discriminate between good and bad practices. 
   I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn. 
   There was no objection.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I thank the gentleman from Maryland. 
   This is a very complicated subject. It involves a number of moving parts. 
   At every stage, and we said this from the beginning, at every stage in this bill, from the bill's introduction to the hearing to the markup to now, it has been improved. No one really knew enough. We are in a somewhat unknown area. 
   I would also say ultimately, I think, if we're going to get any legislation here, as I said before, we are going to get a bill that no single Member of this House likes in every particular because we are going to have to work together. 
   The gentleman from Maryland has identified one more area where we believe improvement can go forward. It is a subject that has to be refined some. This is the end of the session. We are getting legislation drafted. It can't always be done as carefully as we would like. 
   I appreciate the gentleman calling this to our attention; and in the bipartisanship spirit we have had, I believe we can continue to work on this, and by the time this bill is finally ready to be signed, we can include the thrust of what the gentleman is trying to accomplish.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. We have, from time to time, debated the issue as to whether or not we could make sure that no one who is not a legal resident or a citizen could qualify, but that's not what we're debating today. Let me read from page 2. 
   There are four kinds of identification that you must show. By the way, the mortgage industry and the real estate industry will not like the further paperwork here, but listen to this, lines 14 and 15, ``You must show a passport issued by the United States or a foreign government.'' Now, what makes anyone think that people who are in the United States with a foreign passport are here legally? They have foreign passports from other countries. 
   I think the problem is some on the other side have taken the word ``alien'' too literally, that is, they think an alien is someone who's not from the Earth. Because someone who is in America illegally who is from the Earth might have an Iranian passport or a Venezuelan passport or a Burmese passport. 
   So understand, what I think is happening is this. I've been seeing these a lot. I do a lot of recommits; it's a heck of a way to spend your life, but that's my job. This foreign government passport is new. I think what happened was this. I think the real estate industry, this is literally my speculation, the real estate industry said to the Republicans, Hey, wait a minute, we make a lot of money selling houses to foreigners. Don't cut out the foreigners.     
   But you forgot to say legal foreigners. This is what this bill says. So you may have some Americans who don't have all this ID, who don't have a passport, who don't live in a REAL ID State. They may not have this. They may have a driver's license that they can use and it's not a REAL ID State. 
   An American in a REAL ID State who doesn't have a passport can't make it. But an Iranian with an Iranian passport, Welcome to my home. Here's your mortgage. 
   Now, I understand the impulse to prevent illegal aliens from getting predatory mortgages. That's a very kind thing that the Republicans want to do for them. But they don't do it competently. Read the bill. It says if you have a foreign passport, you qualify. You vote for this and you will be favoring people from other countries who are here illegally over Americans who don't have a passport and don't live in a REAL ID State. Now, that's irrefutable. 
   In your desire to further the profitability of the real estate industry, and a lot of them are my friends and I have nothing against their profitability, but why would we want to vote for a recommit that elevates a foreigner who has no legal right to be in the United States and say they can qualify under this recommit, but an American who doesn't have a passport and doesn't live in a REAL ID State, has a driver's license and therefore didn't think they needed something, they wouldn't qualify. So we say to Americans, if you happen to be American, you had better get a passport and, now, it could be a Venezuelan passport, could be a Canadian passport, we don't care where it's from, just get a passport. I am baffled by this and I just think somebody didn't think this one through. 
   The point is that this recommit says nothing about restricting the mortgage process to people who are here only legally, because if you really think that people who are here illegally don't have a foreign passport, then you don't understand the situation. 
   So I say let's reject this effort to elevate foreign passports from people who may be here illegally over Americans who happen to not live in a REAL ID State and reject this recommit. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I thank the gentlewoman. I appreciate the initiative, and she's clearly right in concept. 
   We would say that this bill, we hope, will pass today, but it's not going to pass the Senate until we come back early next year. We do obviously hope to get this bill in place before the next hurricane season so we could get started. But that would give us time to work on this before our final passage was done. 
   And as the gentlewoman understands, because she's been involved herself, the State-Federal issue can become complicated. So while we very much agree on the substance, we don't want to engender a kind of State-Federal issue which could go beyond Florida. This is obviously something for all the States. 
   So with that in mind, it's a common objective, indeed. We think the gentleman from Connecticut's amendment goes in that general direction. But we really want to be very careful about the State-Federal-local interactions here. 
   So if the gentlewoman is agreeable, we would be working with her between now and some time in March or April when we finally hope to get this bill done so we can improve these kinds of requirements, but in a way that isn't going to jeopardize the whole thing by a big Federal-State dispute.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I want to apologize to Dawn Dawson. Ms. Dawson is a thoughtful young woman who was engaged in a lawsuit involving a charge of discrimination based on sexual orientation. An organization in the dispute we had about the scope of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, in my judgment, misquoted the holding in that lawsuit. In the course of refuting that, I quoted some passages which reflected somewhat negatively on Ms. Dawson. I should not have done that. There is no reason to make any negative inference about her. It was in a legal context which does not support factually any negative response. 
   Ms. Dawson called me after that, came to see me. I was impressed by her grace, by her thoughtfulness, and by her commitment to working for a better America for all of us. 
   So I want to express my regret that I brought this young woman into this dispute for no good reason. She deserves much better from me, as she deserves from all who are concerned about fairness in this country. And as I said, I apologize to Ms. Dawson. I continue to believe that the organization with which I was disputing misinterpreted her lawsuit, but that was not her fault.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, first my friend from West Virginia said, well, we would be displacing the private insurance market. We have fellow citizens represented here who are trying desperately to find that private insurance market. This is hardly a case of our intruding in a perfectly functioning market. 
   And then the amendment bans cross-subsidies; it bans cross-subsidies that do not exist. The CBO report: ``Assuming the appropriation of the specified amount CBO estimated in implementing this provision would cost $75 million over the next 5 years.'' That's the total on one provision. On the other provision: ``CBO estimates that loans made under the bill would have an insignificant cost over the next 5 years. Enacting H.R. 3355 would not affect direct spending or revenue.'' So there is no taxpayer expenditure; so there is no subsidy. 
   Then as to cross-subsidy, it is very carefully worded. It says: ``No cross-subsidizing in any geographic region.'' It doesn't say across State lines because that could not happen. No State is in this program unless it volunteers to get in. So now, apparently, the worry is that north Florida will subsidize south Florida. I think we leave that to Florida. 
   One last point. Many of my colleagues have had this button, article I. This does not attempt to change the program substantively. It does not try to deal with the subsidies because they're nonexistent. It says: ``The Secretary of the Treasury has to certify.'' It is a very disturbing provision. It gives to a Secretary of the Treasury, who might be ideologically opposed to this, the power to kill the program voted by both Houses of Congress. If it said the Secretary could make a report and we would consider it, that would be one thing. But there is no taxpayer subsidy, according to CBO. There is no interstate involvement unless the States have volunteered to get in. 
   And then it says that these nonexistent hazards will stop the program. And it doesn't say, by the way, that the Secretary stops it if he certifies it's causing a problem. He has to certify the negative. He has to certify that it's not causing the problem. To give that kind of power to the Secretary on a carefully drafted bill that already says no subsidy, that bans any interstate involvement unless the States want to, is just a way to kill the bill. I do not think that it's fair to our colleagues from Florida on both sides of the aisle who have brought this forward and colleagues from other States who may want to join. 
   The worst thing about this is the title: ``Prohibiting Cross-Subsidization from Middle America.'' Well, the gentlewoman left out apple pie and the flag, but all of them are irrelevant to this bill. If Middle America doesn't want to be in this bill, it simply stays out of it. There is nothing here that would coerce any State to be involved. So Members can safely vote against this recommittal and know that Middle America will sleep soundly tonight without having to subsidize the State of Florida. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, sic transit gloria Oxley. Mike Oxley, my Republican predecessor, is barely gone, when one of his great works is being trashed by his former colleagues. 
   Indeed, as I look at this assault, the gentleman from New Jersey started out talking about small business, but small business clearly appeared to be the stalking horse here. He talked about the New York Stock Exchange. They don't deal with small business. He talked about Sarbanes-Oxley in very negative terms broadly. His complaint is not about small business, but about Sarbanes-Oxley in general. If you analyze what the gentleman said, it was an assault on Sarbanes-Oxley. 
   Now, Sarbanes-Oxley was passed by a Republican House and a Democratic Senate. It was signed and claimed as a great triumph by our Republican President, George Bush. 
   I am sad for President Bush. No Child Left Behind, Sarbanes-Oxley, immigration, Medicare part D, even the war in Iraq. Mr. Chairman, are there no Bush policies left that can escape the assault of the Republican Party? I am inclined to think that there are only two Bush policies left that command strong support on the Republican side: illegal wiretapping and torture. Everything else they appear to have abandoned. 
   In fact, 10 days ago, the Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary Paulson, explicitly disagreed with the gentleman from New Jersey on the need for this amendment and said, no, we don't want to do this now. This is working. 
   What is working is a couple of days ago the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, our former colleague Mr. Cox, said, we don't need legislation. We are in the process of changing this. All five of the Commissioners appeared, and none of them asked us for legislation. Mr. Cox specifically said it is not needed. 
   This is a vote of no confidence in Chris Cox and the SEC. They have said, yes, we should change this. We have more time. It is in a deferment period, and the SEC is in the process, along with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, of winding this down, of making it easier. 
   Mr. Cox was asked just yesterday, well, what is this going to cost small business? He said, we don't know yet, because we are changing it already for the big businesses that have to pay. But we are going to look at that, and we will make adjustments. 
   So Chris Cox, on behalf of a unanimous SEC, three Republicans, two Democrats, along with the Republican Secretary of the Treasury Mr. Paulson, says we are fixing this. Please do not at this point legislate.  
   Of course, what we see is, if you listen to the gentleman from New Jersey, this is the beginning of an assault on Sarbanes-Oxley in general, because much of his speech was not about small business, it was about Sarbanes-Oxley in general, which he does not like and thinks is a terrible burden and is driving people overseas.     
   It is not driving small business overseas. Nobody argues that. It is not driving small businesses off the New York Stock Exchange; they were never on it. So this is step one in the assault on Sarbanes-Oxley. It is an unnecessary assault because the SEC, under Chairman Cox, with a Republican majority and Secretary Paulson are already trying to fix this problem.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. 
   First, as to executive compensation, the gentleman from New Jersey, he finds inconsistencies where none exist. They are kind of like Harvey, his invisible rabbit. 
   On executive compensation, the SEC has said when asked that they do not have the power to do what our bill does. That is very different than Sarbanes-Oxley. With regard to Sarbanes-Oxley, Chris Cox has said I am doing this, so they are quite different. 
   The SEC with executive compensation said we can make them say how much it will be; if you want to go further, we have no power to do that. 
   That is exactly the opposite of what they have said on Sarbanes-Oxley in which they said we are fixing this, and Chris Cox said there is no reason for you to legislate. 
   The gentleman from New Jersey is being unfair to Chairman Cox in caricaturing him as saying ``we don't know.'' 
   What he said when asked what it would cost is very straightforward: ``We don't know yet.'' He said we are in the process of finding out because what the chairman said is we are downsizing Sarbanes-Oxley. We are downsizing it for everybody. We will know better after we see what the new requirements are for larger businesses, how much there will be saved for smaller businesses. 
   The fact is that the gentleman from New Jersey quite graphically misrepresented what the SEC said. The SEC did not say ``we don't know,'' the SEC said ``we will tell you after we have had some experience.''

Small businesses don't do IPOs. It is not in the small business area where the decline has happened. So  what we see here is small business has been taken hostage by people who never liked Sarbanes-Oxley because the argument the gentleman makes has nothing to do with the specifics of the gentleman's amendment.

The number of people who are in trouble on the Republican side by this group grows and grows and grows. It is the Speaker of the House, the gentleman from Illinois, the former Speaker, who apparently acquiesced, inappropriately, according to the gentleman.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. The fact is that I will not allow my time to be diverted by internecine Republican warfare. You don't like George Bush's bill that he signed. You don't think that Oxley did a very good job. You are upset at your own leadership procedurally. You think Chris Cox doesn't know what he is doing. You disagree with Paulson. 
   Mr. Chairman, they can fight it out. I would like to discuss substance. I'm not here to get even for past grievances that Republicans have with other Republicans. 
   Again, the gentleman from Florida's assault has nothing to do with this amendment, but it is relevant in this sense: It shows that what we have here is the beginning of an attack on Sarbanes-Oxley. 
   The IPOs, small business don't do IPOs. Small business hasn't left America to go to England. That is the clear indication of what is up. 
   Now to get back to the substance, Chairman Cox and the other members of the commission said we agree it went too far in the regulation. We are scaling it back. We are scaling it back first for the big businesses who will be affected by it, and we will learn from that scaling back how much it will help smaller businesses. 
   Again, the gentleman from New Jersey quite unfairly mischaracterized what the commissioners said. The commissioners didn't say ``we don't know,'' period. They said we don't know now because we expect to get experience from the reductions in the scaling back we have already ordered, and that will tell us how that will help small business.

   No, I am not yielding any more because this is just not a debatable issue. The five commissioners didn't say simply ``we don't know.'' They said, ``We don't know as of now, but we will know better once we have had this experience.'' 
   I want to go back and respond, the gentleman from Florida said the SEC is fiddling while capital markets burn. I don't think Chris Cox is fiddling.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Let me make the substantive argument here. 
   Law enforcement in America is not totalitarian. It is not authoritarian. It requires a buy-in by those regulators. And that's why this amendment would do so much damage. There is, of course, a disconnect between the amendment which hides behind small business and the broader attack on Sarbanes-Oxley that we have heard from the two speakers. 
   But here's where the connection comes in. The SEC, with the full backing of Secretary Paulson, all these Republican nominees, Secretary Paulson from Goldman Sachs, Chris Cox and the others, they understand that Sarbanes-Oxley was overwritten in the regulatory phase. They are writing it down, but they don't want people to just think this is chaos. They have asked us explicitly, the Secretary of the Treasury and the SEC, the Republican appointees, to let them work this out. They agree that it needs to be reduced. 
   But if you start now with Congress piecemeal amending it, the degree of consensus they are trying to reach in the business community will erode. If people think, oh, we got one amendment through, we got this piece out, then there will be others who want another piece, people who have always resented it. And Mr. Cox has been very careful to try to get, for instance, unanimity in the commission because he wants people not to think this is a chance he's saying, it's going one way, it's going the other. And to begin now to whittle away at his authority, when he is in the process of doing exactly what critics of Sarbanes-Oxley as it now stands say they want to do, undermines his ability to reform this in an orderly way.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. First of all, does the gentleman not understand that his question, as virtually all of his debate, has zero to do with the amendment he purports to be supporting? 
   The fact is that the problems, yes, in China they have decided to do it in Shanghai. I think there are a lot of reasons why there has been a shifting and we're no longer overall in the world. But it has nothing to do with this amendment because it's not about small business. We haven't lost the share of small business. But the gentleman has reinforced my point. I mentioned Shanghai. Shanghai is appropriate, because this amendment is an attempt to shanghai small business into the cause of undermining Sarbanes-Oxley and undercutting the effort by the SEC, supported by the Secretary of the Treasury--and I assume the Bush administration--to allow the process of scaling back Sarbanes-Oxley to be done in an orderly, reasonable fashion. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentleman from Wisconsin has expired. 
   The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I thought the Republican  budget deficits that we have seen since they took power in 2001 were pretty big, but the rhetoric deficit between what they say and economic reality is even bigger. There are zero tax increases or cuts in any of these budgets. The tax situation at the end of the year, the end of this fiscal year, will be the same. 
   Now, the gentleman from Texas is worried about people who will be facing tax increases later on. By the way, he says tax increases that are in current law, that's current law that the Republicans passed. 
   I didn't vote for the current law, so they don't like what they put into the law. But the people I talk with, working people in my district, no, they are not worried about estate taxes on $20 million. They're not worried about incomes over $200,000. 
   The gentleman did make an accurate point. He said, What about the person whose paycheck will be exactly the same next year? Well, before the Republicans took over, her paycheck wasn't exactly the same. They used to go up. Paychecks used to increase. Only with the Republicans in power have we seen this freeze on real pay, in fact, a decrease in real pay. 
   Let me tell you why I am for the Progressive budget, because I do believe we ought to save the taxpayers money. I am prepared to say that when the Republicans were in power, we won the Cold War. They apparently don't recognize that, because they've got a budget that's still fighting it. In addition to the enormous waste of lives and American prestige and everything else that is involved in the Iraq war and the enormous waste of money there, we are still funding weapons in this budget. Now, many of these weapons are great weapons, but they have one defect: they have no enemy. A weapon without an enemy is a pretty silly thing to have. 
   So I like the Progressive budget because, among other things, it brings under control this enormous increase in Pentagon spending, and apparently according to my right-wing Republican colleagues, spending on weapons that we don't need is good spending. Spending to pay for health care for children is bad spending. I think they get it exactly opposite and the Progressive budget is the way to fix that.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   I consider it a great honor to be able to stand on the floor of this House and as the Chair of the committee bring out the bill that would honor Ed Brooke. As a citizen of Massachusetts in 1972 and again in 1978, and as a fairly partisan Democrat, I was proud publicly to endorse him for reelection both times to the Senate. 
   The gentlewoman from the District of Columbia made the point he was the first African American elected attorney general and then to the Senate only shortly after this country officially said segregation was morally and legally wrong. 1954 was the Brown v. Board of Education decision, not made final until 1955 in its decree. Seven years later Ed Brooke is elected attorney general. And as we look back now, it is probably difficult for some people to understand what an important accomplishment that was. But he is not a man who should be honored simply for having broken those barriers, because having gotten the opportunity, he used it. 
   The committee I chair has jurisdiction over housing. As I work in the housing area, I find myself frequently trying to preserve some of the pioneering efforts on behalf of affordable housing that Ed Brooke created. I was very proud about a month or so ago when he called to say that he liked what we were doing. 
   I was just reminded, Mr. Speaker, when I was up in our State of Massachusetts over the weekend, that it was in 1978, in his last year in the Senate, that Ed Brooke began the policy of saying that when housing had been built with Federal help with a certain restriction that set it aside for lower  income people and those restrictions expire, it shouldn't be simply sold to the highest bidder, but that public policy ought to make some efforts to preserve it for people who were in need of housing. We are still fighting that fight today. 
   We have something known as the Brooke amendment, one of the greatest acts of compassion ever to pass this body. It said originally that the poorest of the poor who get housing through various public programs shouldn't be expected to pay more than 25 percent of their income for housing, precisely because they have so little. That was changed, regrettably, in the eighties. I voted against it, but it was changed to 30 percent. But it is still there. It is still the Brooke amendment. It is still a major barrier to a degradation in the quality of life of lower income people, because there are those who would make them pay 40 and 50 and 60 percent of their income, depriving them and their children of the necessities of life. So it is with great pride that we fight and have fought to continue the Brooke amendment. 
   Senator Brooke was a leader in a number of areas. Yes, he broke the barrier of racism and became the first African American to win statewide office in Massachusetts and then to come to the Senate at a time when racism was even more virulent than it is today. We have made strides in diminishing it. 
   But, as I said, he didn't just do that. He was a leader in a number of areas, and particularly in the housing area. I don't believe anybody who has ever served in the Congress of the United States has a record that exceeds his. 
   So I am delighted to join under the leadership of our colleague Senator Kennedy and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) in voting for this medal, the second medal, the third medal that Brooke will have gotten, because he got the Presidential Medal of Freedom and he earned the Bronze Medal in World War II, fighting in a segregated outfit, putting patriotism ahead of the indignities to which he submitted in the fight against that terrible tyranny. 
   This is a medal well earned by a man who exemplified the commitment to the public welfare that we could well remember today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that because of the energy of a number of people, we are going to be awarding this gold medal to a man who so richly deserves it. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I am about to yield back. 
   Ed Brooke, in addition to being a superb United States Senator who fought very hard and very effectively for economic fairness and obviously against racial prejudice, but he also was the chief law enforcement officer of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for 4 years. 
   Just to give people a flavor of that, I will mention one accomplishment. It was under his attorney generalship that the Boston Strangler was prosecuted and imprisoned. So people who may not otherwise be able to relate should know. And if you saw him in the movie, I think he was played by Raymond St. Jacques, but if you go see again the movie of the Boston Strangler, you will see a part of that book. We are here to talk about a number of other parts, including a superb legislative record on behalf of social fairness. 
   I am prepared to yield back if the gentlewoman is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, I am pleased that we appear to have a very broad consensus in favor of this. My friend from Texas is right. There is no one single answer to the problems of poverty. But I am pleased that we have agreement that this is an important part of it. 
   We have some history here that argues for this bill. In the year, I think it was 2000, we in this House passed a bill on the floor over some objection from the administration at the time, the Clinton administration, and from some of the House leadership. But we passed a bill to begin the process known as the HIPC, the heavily indebted poor country debt relief, and it has worked very well. And for those who think that these enterprises are doomed to failure, we can point to many successes in HIPC. And we did this in a way so that countries that had not lived up to what should have been their part of the bargain didn't get the benefit. 
   The time has now come to do this again. And if this is done right, relieving countries of debt--debt that was often incurred by prior undemocratic and repressive regimes, and they will be primarily African but not entirely--relieving these countries of debt does as much to promote education and reduce poverty as anything else we can do. 
   I think it is particularly noteworthy on this day when His Holiness the Pope is in our city that we received a letter from the Most Reverend Thomas G. Wenski, the Bishop of Orlando, who is chairman of the Committee on International Policy of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. He strongly supports the bill, and I ask that that be introduced into the Record now, along with a letter from the Jubilee Coalition, the Jubilee Network, many religious and civic organizations, and the NAACP.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. We have said that from the standpoint of the U.S., in order to be eligible for our help, they will have to cooperate with us against human trafficking, against terrorism and against illegal immigration. Those are the kind of conditions that is appropriate to impose. 
   Finally, we should note that this bill obviously does not, as it cannot itself, accomplish debt relief. It is a mandate to the United States executive branch to begin negotiations. And these negotiations must be multilateral, because we do not want to see America give debt relief when other countries don't do it and that nullifies the effect. And we also want to press the international financial institutions to do it using our influence there. 
   Today, we take a step widely hailed by particularly those who are concerned with the alleviation of poverty in other parts of the world. We take the step that does more than any other single step to reach that goal.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I yield myself the remaining time. 
   I join in thanking all those who participated. It may seem that this is an orgy of self-congratulations but it really is a celebration of an important point, namely that we are capable of disagreeing with each other strongly on very important public policy issues without that injuring our ability to cooperate in other areas where we can agree.     
   The Committee on Financial Services has some very sharp divisions, for example, in the role of the Federal Government in helping to build affordable housing and the rules that should apply there on the restrictions that should apply. I am very proud that has not in any way hindered us from working together on these things which are both in the national interest and in the interests of humanity. 
   Talking about the committee, I do want to mention one other person who has played a very important role here, no longer a Member, but the former chairman of the committee, the gentleman from Iowa, Mr. Leach. 
   The initial effort to put through debt relief was over the objection of the leadership of the House and the administration, the Republican House leadership and the Clinton administration. They weren't opposed to it in principle, they were hesitant. A group of Members pushed it through, and among those was the then chairman of the Committee on Financial Services, Mr. Leach, and we are following in the footsteps of those actions. 
   There are just a couple of points about this that I want to stress. We have some amendments. I will be agreeing to all the amendments. One or two may need some little work later on. But there is an important principle here. 
   During the nineties in particular, we had a great deal of turmoil in the world because as the international institutions, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and the others, provided some financial assistance to low-income countries, they also provided some very intrusive prescriptions about public policy and decisions. If you are going to talk about democracy, Mr. Chairman, you have to honor it. You can't be for democracy only when you know you are going to agree with the outcome. 
   For the international institutions, with the backing of the American government all too often, and other governments, to have used the need of these countries for assistance, financial assistance, as a lever to dictate what should have been left to the democratic process, was harmful theoretically and practically. It led to decisions being imposed which undermined popular support for the governments and even for the concept of democracy. 
   So what we say in this legislation, and I know the President raised some concerns about it, there is a constitutional issue here, we think we are very clear, when the Congress of the United States authorizes activity that will reduce revenue to the government, not by an enormous amount, as the gentleman from Connecticut mentioned, but we are talking here about revenues, when we say we are willing to forgo some of these revenues because we think much more good will come from forgoing them than we could do with collecting them in this situation because of the need for stability and peace in the world, we have a right to set the terms under which it happens, and we say in here that there shall be no intrusion into the democratic processes. 
   We also say, and it is perfectly consistent, we do insist that there be democratic processes. This is not a bill that says no conditions. It sets conditions. The conditions are democracy. The conditions are no corruption, transparency and democracy in the sense of votes and democracy in the sense of free speech and democracy in the sense of people knowing what is happening. 
   We do say we want a framework of honesty and openness, which hasn't always been there. We will talk a little bit later about some of the differences about interpretation of that. Essentially it goes in the right direction. 
   I do want to note, this is a decision that it is not appropriate in the guise of providing financial assistance for international institutions or other governments to dictate to the recipient government issues that ought in a normal society be the subject of a democracy. 
   I repeat my gratitude that we have got broad support for this. I think there is an overwhelming consensus that reducing the debt of those countries which are trying to do the right thing for their people is, of course, primarily in the interest of the poor children and the other poor people in those countries, but also in our interest in trying to promote a stable and peaceful world.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert) alluded earlier to this amendment. We reject the kind of conditions that try to set tax policy or education policy or resource policy within a country, because if you go with democracy, you allow the countries to make them. But we did have a right, we thought, to set some conditions that affect us. We set forth some conditions involving democracy and openness, in consultation with the minority. We were reminded of some other conditions. So this adds to the conditionality. 
   If this amendment is adopted, there will be conditions requiring that people assuage terrorism, that they work with us on immigration, and that they avoid any participation in human smuggling. 
   I believe that these are agreed on, and in fact in some cases were put forward at the request of the minority. In some cases we thought they were clear. But one of the things I learned when you are legislating is never object to redundancy. It is better to say it twice than to have some ambiguity about whether you offered it at all. 
   So I offer this amendment I believe on behalf of the leadership and the membership of both sides of the committee. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I will finish by saying the gentleman from California was gracious and said I had been fair and he talked about my not being partisan. I want to congratulate him for his lack of partisanship, because having served the majority of his time here under Republican administrations, he retains a deep distrust of the State Department, including the current State Department, and apparently his point is he cannot trust the current State Department to enforce democracy.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I know I am taking the time in opposition. I am not so much in opposition, but I am about as close to it as anybody we are going to find here, so I think I qualify. 
   I agree very much. On a case-by-case basis, I believe the gentleman from California and I would agree at each instance. And so I hope the amendment is adopted. 
   I would make one point, as I thought about it. It does reinforce the point that we should not be imposing on the recipient government's policy choices that a democratic government ought to make. The flip side of a commitment to democracy is recognizing the validity of those decisions. 
   I also agree with the gentleman. His wording is better than the wording I put in here for the future, permits free and fair elections, although there is always, when you are talking about the future, some weasel word. 
   I will work with the gentleman going forward. I am going to suggest to him maybe later that we might empower them to do a moratorium for a short period of time on payments in the following situation. We have had cases where bad governments were overthrown by people who are democratic. East Timor is an example. There is Ghana, where Jerry Rawlings overthrew a government and then had an election. His party is now in the opposition. Uganda. The gentleman is right. Ordinarily it may not take that much time, but things could be so chaotic, like in Liberia, when the new government came in there with some bad people. Maybe a year would be too little. 
   I will be talking to him later. I hope this amendment is adopted. Perhaps we could provide a temporary moratorium for a government that took over in those circumstances for perhaps 6 months or a year. But that's something we might work out. 
   The gentleman seems to agree that that is something that, while no commitment is obviously made, that we could work on. 
   I hope the amendment is adopted. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I understand that. Iraq is not currently there, but here's the deal. This is not just for now. It is conceivable to me that Iraq will end up owing us money. I hope it will, because we've sure given them a lot, and if they don't owe us any money, it's a big gift. 
   So the question is going forward, if in the future, because there is no current list of countries, we're talking about an eligibility criteria. Would this prevent debt relief from the United States or the International Monetary Fund, to the World Bank, to Iraq going forward? 
   I would yield to anyone who would answer.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I will take back my time because I'm trying to get an honest answer. 
   We are setting policy here, not just for this week. We are saying here that if you do business with the government, if your government has business interests with Iraq, you're ineligible. I think it is fair to ask whether Iraq, if it were to become eligible in other ways, would be covered. That's not a trick question. Would this have the effect of excluding Iraq from such a program in the future? 
   I yield for an answer.

   You limit eligibility under this program. Iraq might very well owe us money. The question isn't nuclear weapons. It is, would this prevent Iraq from being eligible, these criteria. And I would hope someone would answer that.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. No. The answer is, of course, one that leads me to suggest that the answer really is ``yes.'' When people dance around and won't give you the answer, Madam Speaker, the answer is ``yes.'' 
   Apparently, under the criteria set forward here, while Iraq is not now on the list for relief, it could not get it in the future. We will be setting policy that would have screwed you up because apparently, as this is defined, I infer that the Government of Iraq is covered because if the Government of Iraq wasn't covered by this, the answer would be ``no.'' When I don't get ``no,'' but when I get a discussion of nuclear weapons and what's currently in the bill and I don't get an answer to the question, then it is clear to me. 
   So Members, I guess, are free to vote on this.

   Here's the response. The minority had the right to offer this in a way in which we could debate it. They didn't choose to do that. They chose to do it in this limited fashion. 
   So it does look to me like you are having problems here that does the Government of Iraq have business interests with Iran. I know there are close ties between the Governments of Iraq and Iran. There's interchangeability. 
   I think this is a pretty sketchy way to go forward. I'm not sure that there are any other countries. I think Iraq may be one of the few that doesn't. It's fairly narrowly drawn, but that's of great concern. And I couldn't get a direct answer, and I don't know if anybody really knows it.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. No, I'm sorry. The gentleman does not seem to understand the rules. I'm giving you a lot more of my time. Well, I guess free speech that we put in is for other countries. 
   Look, I understand the thought. The minority thought they came up with a clever idea and they outsmarted themselves. They put language in here that I think would interfere with the ability to have economic relations with Iraq. And apparently what I'm being told is if you believe that the Government of Iraq has no business interests with Iran, then you can vote for this bill and not worry about Iraq. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the important role he has played in our committee as a representative from a State which has a very large number of Native Americans. The gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Boren) has played a lead role in helping us live up to our obligations to Native Americans. And I am very proud of the role that the committee has played in general in this area, in the coinage area, a couple of things that have come up in the housing area and elsewhere, and the gentleman from Oklahoma has been a major part of that. 
   I am also very pleased to be here with one of the great advocates for human rights in general and particularly for Native Americans, our colleague from Michigan (Mr. Kildee), who has been the major mover in insisting that we live up to the obligation we as a Nation have to Native Americans. This bill is in furtherance of that. It is, I am glad to say, and has been from the beginning, bipartisan, and I hope it is passed. And I just want to pay tribute to the work of both the gentleman from Oklahoma and the gentleman from Michigan.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. (IN MEMORY OF LEON SHULL, FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, AMERICANS FOR DEMOCRATIC ACTION -- (House of Representatives - September 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, during the recess recently, one of the men from whom I learned a great deal, I hope with some impact about how to be a successful advocate for a better and fairer world, died. 
   Leon Shull had been, for many years, the executive director of Americans for Democratic Action. He had a passion for social justice which he combined with a clear-headedness about how to get there that was extraordinary. 
   Too often in our politics, we see a divide between the people with passion, the people with reason, people who feel very, very deeply about the need to correct injustice, and people who are able to calculate in a cool manner what types of political activity will be effective. Leon Shull was one of those rare people who combined both of them in a way that made each of those qualities more important. There wasn't any trade-off with Leon between his pragmatic and clear-headed political analysis and his strong idealism. His idealism and his pragmatism worked together. They strengthened each other. 
   He was determined to be effective because he felt that he had a moral obligation not simply to will a fairer world, a world with fewer poor children, a world with less discrimination based on race or gender or sexual orientation or religion, a world with less widespread killing for unjustified reasons; he felt the moral obligation to diminish those things to the extent that any one human being could. And because he felt morally obligated to do it, he knew he was morally obligated to be effective. 
   He worked with many people who would give in from time to time to that wonderful feeling of just lashing out, of just letting your emotions run. But he knew the work to which he was committed was too important for that, that he owed the children and the victims of racism and poor, elderly people and working people thrown out of jobs, people in other parts of this world living in dire poverty, he knew that he owed them not just goodwill, but a commitment to making their lives better. 
   He was for many years the leader of Americans for Democratic Action.  Americans for Democratic Action immediately after World War II under the leadership of Eleanor Roosevelt and John Kenneth Galbraith and Walter Reuther and others was a very important organization in which liberals fought a two-front ideologic war against conservatives who wanted to retreat from the New Deal on the one side and from Communists who were anti-democratic on the other. 
   As time went on, the Americans for Democratic Action, ADA as it is known, became less important, probably because the Democratic Party, I believe, moved more in that direction. But it was still important to have that organization then as it is now as an independent force, and Leon Shull kept that organization vibrant. 
   There is an expression used about boxers who are fighting in a weight class heavier than their own, that they are able to punch above their weight, that they have a strength and a physical ability that allows them to be competitive with people bigger and theoretically beyond their reach. 
   Leon Shull punched above his weight, and ADA under him punched above its weight. He was in this city for many years a beacon for those of us who believed that the liberal tenets of Franklin Roosevelt were still very relevant, that a wealthy society in the United States had both the obligation and the resources to diminish inequality, not to dispose of it altogether in a capitalistic system, but to diminish it. 
   Leon Shull was an ally of people fighting racism, of people fighting poverty, of people fighting unjust wars, of people fighting for rational environmental policy, of people fighting for free speech and fairness. And with all that, he was a gentle man. He was a fierce advocate of these policies, but in personal demeanor a man of gentleness, a man who inspired the love and affection of those who worked with him. In later years he retired and he moved away from Washington, and I saw much less of him. 
   Mr. Speaker, when I read of his death, I realized as I thought about it all that he is one of the people from whom I learned a great deal. To his wife, Anne, to his daughters and others who have lost this great man, I send my deepest sympathy; and to his memory I express my gratitude for being the model of an effective liberal.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. (CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO UNITED STATES FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS DOING BUSINESS IN CHINA -- (House of Representatives - September 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the very important work the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Marshall) is doing on this, and the bipartisan cooperation we have. 
   It is really disappointing that we have to bring this resolution forward. It does not speak well of the government of the People's Republic of China that this is necessary, because they are trying to have it both ways in an inappropriate manner. 
   On the one hand, China insists on being treated with the respect due a great world power. And they are proud of their economic strength, and they say to America, in fact, they try to have it both ways in two ways. Maybe they're trying to have it four ways, because what they tell us is, open up, economic competition is the way. If we are selling more goods in your country than you are selling in ours, that's because we're doing a better job of it. And so they want respect as a world power, and they want an openness in the economy, but only in one way, because when it comes to areas of economic activity where they don't have that overwhelming advantage, where, frankly, cheap labor doesn't buy you a lot, where our technology and our level of sophistication works to our advantage, all the arguments they've used go out the window. Now they're no longer this great world power. They're a poor country that has to shelter its banking activity from the United States and others. They don't single us out. They shut out much of the world. 
   The argument that you should open up your economy and let economic forces play out, without imposing political barriers, that apparently works with manufacturing of their goods, but that's exactly the argument they repudiate when we talk about our financial institutions. 
   I would add that there is, of course, another example of this with regard to the intellectual property failings in China, but we're here to focus on the financial services. And so what we are saying to the Government of China is, essentially, I guess I would say this, they may be credited with one of the great engineering feats in history, even more impressive than the Great Wall of China, is turning the Pacific Ocean  into a one-way street, because when it comes to allowing the forces of economic competition to determine outcomes, where they would have an advantage, they're all for it. But where we say, look, we have these very important financial institutions, as my two colleagues have mentioned, institutions which will benefit the Chinese, which will help with the savings rate. 
   The gentleman from Georgia has made it clear. This isn't an assault on China by the outsiders. This is something that would be of interest to the Chinese because the Chinese use the same argument to us. They say, look what we're doing for you. We're giving you these cheaper products. Don't turn them down. 
   Well, I don't understand why that doesn't translate into their doing the same thing. 
   And so you cannot, I think, in this world consistently, at the same time, be a complete free trader where you have an advantage, but a mercantilist and protectionist and restrictionist society where you think somebody else might have the advantage. 
   But this resolution is aimed only partly at China. It is also a directive from this House. And I hope, with a very large vote, and I hope our colleagues in the Senate will do it, to the United States regulators, to the Securities Exchange Commission, to the bank regulators, to the Federal Reserve, the Secretary of the Treasury: do unto others as they do unto us in the financial area. Do not allow the Chinese financial institutions a freedom to operate in the United States that they would deny to us. And I want to stress that. 
   There have been criticisms that have come from China and from some in the United States who say, yes, China sells a lot, but don't be restrictive. The answer is openness. 
   Well, this is the test. Is openness a two-way ocean? 
   And if the Chinese continue to resist living by the doctrine they preach to us, then the United States regulators, those in the United States who decide whether Chinese institutions can have access here, really, in their own interest, should take account of that because if you continue to have a situation in which Chinese financial institutions are allowed activity in the U.S. that the Chinese Government denies to American institutions in China, I believe this body will go beyond a resolution. And I can tell you that the committee that I chair will begin to consider, then, legislative changes. And we're often told that you can't legislate that because of the WTO. But here we're asking them to live up to their WTO responsibilities. And if this continues, I will consult with our colleagues in the Ways and Means Committee, and I think we will try to put some binding legislation here. I hope it doesn't come to that. 
   And I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Marshall) for taking the initiative here and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam) and others. This is, I hope, unanimous, but certainly overwhelming, it was unanimous in the Committee on Financial Services' request. 
   And the gentleman from Georgia read a very impressive list. Every important entity of financial institutions in the United States was on the letters that the gentleman from Georgia read. 
   So we hope that the Chinese Government will listen. And if they don't, we hope the United States regulators will listen, because we are only asking here that the Chinese live by the doctrines that they profess to believe in. And we believe that this is something that is in the mutual interest of both countries. 
   I submit the following exchange of correspondence regarding H. Res. 552. 
 Hon. Barney Frank, Chairman, Committee on Financial Services,  Washington, DC.  
   Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you concerning the bill, H. Res. 552, calling on the Government of the People's Republic of China to remove barriers to United States financial services firms doing business in China. I understand there are certain provisions of this legislation as it will be presented to the full House that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. 
   In the interest of permitting your Committee to proceed expeditiously to floor consideration of this important legislation, I am willing to waive this Committee's right to sequential referral. I do so with the understanding that by waiving consideration of the bill, the Committee on Foreign Affairs does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the legislation which fall within its Rule X jurisdiction. 
   I would ask that you place this letter into the Congressional Record when the House has H. Res. 552 under consideration. 
   Sincerely, 
   Tom Lantos, Chairman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I thank the gentlewoman. 
   As I summarize, let me say I think there is a common theme here. We have discussion again about the global morality of politics, and the role of morality in our lives. Father Robert Drinan exemplified that. In his personal life for over 60 years a priest, he gave the exemplary disciplined life that he chose as a priest and adhered to a code of personal morality that very few human beings achieve with a dedication and a belief. 
   At the same time, he recognized that the personal moral choices he made as a priest, and that he urged others to make, were those personal choices and voluntary choices, and he understood the difference in the scope of governance. He understood that there is a private morality and a public morality. Not that they are in conflict, but that they cover different spheres, and where human beings interact with each other, it is required that government set the rules.  
   He was a man who did as much to make sure that those interactions were governed by a set of moral principles founded on what was for him a fundamental religious belief and the dignity of man, and in his side-by-side example of a strict code of personal morality, which he followed as a matter of choice, and his insistence that government, when it became coercive, followed the morality of recognizing the dignity of all human beings, he helped us, if, when we listen and read the lesson of his life, to understand what for some people is a difficult decision.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I appreciate the indulgence of the House; I appreciate the Members who spoke and submitted information and material for this Record. 
   Mr. Speaker, I submit for printing in the Record the eulogies for Father Robert Drinan referred to previously.   
   Homily for the Funeral of Robert Drinan, S.J.  
   John XXIII, in his great encyclical, Pacem in terris (1963), which was written exactly halfway through the course of Robert Drinan's life, has a passage which puts before us an important goal, the vision of a society of citizens exercising and claiming rights: It is agreed that in our time the common good is chiefly guaranteed when personal rights and duties are maintained..... If any government does not acknowledge the rights of man or violates them, it not only fails in its duty, but its order completely lack juridical force.'' Pacem in terris (60-61) 
   A society built on the practice of rights is not so sweetly transcendent as the holy mountain of feasting and joy which Isaiah summons up for us; it is not so intimately and delicately responsive as the virtue of charity or agape which St. Paul commends to us. But it is essential to the realization of the common good in a world which is marked by enormous human diversity and intermittently intense social conflict. It is a reality which protects those of us who are neither beasts nor angels from our own worst impulses and from the harms which others would do to us. It is the not the realm of the best but of the imperfect good and the necessary. It has been the favored realm of Anglo-American jurisprudence and a refuge for those who suffered from brutal and destructive social experiments carried on in the name of ideology and religion. It is a realm which Robert Drinan, as a distinguished American lawyer and professor of law, and John Courtney Murray, the great American theologian, valued and commended to other Catholics, especially for its affirmation of religious liberty. It is a realm of ideas which has enabled Catholicism to flourish in this country and which has taught Catholicism important lessons about the theory and practice of human rights, a cause to which Bob Drinan devoted enormous amounts of his apparently inexhaustible energy and many years of that life whose end we now mourn. It is a realm which always needs to be defended, but especially in times of fear and uncertainty when false prophets would persuade us that the magnitude of some threat justifies the overriding of those rights which constitute the core of our liberty. It is a realm which we as Americans have been anxious to extend, perhaps even beyond the limits of our capabilities. In taking up the causes of South African victims of apartheid, of Soviet Jews, of the disenfranchised in Central America and the disappeared in the Southern Cone, and of the Muslims of Darfur, and in arguing for effective judicial protection for universal human rights, our friend Robert was preaching the same values and ways of thinking as he did in opposing segregation and capital punishment and protecting civil liberties in this country. 
   For the most part, his advocacy of human rights harmonized with the social and moral teaching of the Catholic church. But it must be acknowledged that on the immensely painful subject of abortion there was sharp conflict, a conflict which I wish neither to minimize nor to revisit but only to put into a larger context of common concern for the well-being of women and children in a society wracked by moral disagreement. This point also reminds us that the notion of human rights is not transparent in its content but is often used to express profound conflicts in a common legal language. It is not what Bob would call a MIGA, it does not ``make it go away.'' In the matter of abortion, it is important to remember that a decisive point of disagreement for many Catholic politicians is about the appropriate limits of state action and about the attainability of a stable democratic consensus on a matter on which the major religious and philosophical traditions reach conflicting conclusions, not about the moral issue in itself or about Catholic teaching. The shape of legislation can be a matter for prudential disagreement, not an issue of faithfulness. 
   Three years after Bob began his career in Congress, Roe v. Wade turned abortion from a contested legal issue to a divisive political issue. This he had to live through, for in addition to being an advocate for human rights, he was also a practicing politician. This, in combination with his priesthood, was the feature of his life which most attracted the attention of the media and the general public. It was also what made him particularly significant to his colleagues; for here was a moral and religious leader who was ready to walk the walk and talk the talk of politics with them. In fact, it became clear to everyone that he enjoyed doing so and that he was very good at it. In listening to comments from various of Bob's colleagues over the years, I heard a gratitude and a pride which arose from the fact that he as a priest was ready to work alongside them in the demanding though often derided task of legislation in a modern democracy. This is an indispensable and noble contribution to our common life, a vocation in itself. Bob had the vision and the grace to combine two difficult vocations in a way which strengthened the commitment and the morale of his colleagues. His ability to do this was a consequence of the fact that he lived what he was doing as the work of justice, not merely the ambitious pursuit of a career. 
   The contribution which he made as a priest in politics was a suitable prelude to the work of his later years in promoting the study of legal ethics and in founding the Journal of Legal Ethics here at the Georgetown University Law Center. Events of the last twenty years have presented a series of disillusioning crises which have created widespread public demands for reform of the profession and a continuing need for careful scholarship and prudent judgment. This was a work in which Bob could find a happy convergence of his professional and priestly roles. It also provided an academic and professional counterpart to the concern he always had for the growth and the well being of those aides whom he called his ``minions'' and whom he enjoyed for the generous energy which they brought to political life. This energy was, of course, their imitation of and response to his own enormous energy and sharpness of focus. If Robert Drinan, was like Christ and all Christians, a grain of wheat destined to fall into the earth and die, as today's Gospel reminds us, he has born much fruit in those supporters and aides and in the generations of students who cherished him as one of the most remarkable teachers they ever had and who have been filling up the web page at the Law Center with testimony to his impact and his dedication. 
   But the underlying unity of the incredible amount of work he did as teacher, writer, speaker, political leader was his commitment to his identity as a member of the Society of Jesus and as a Catholic priest. When he was confronted with a very stark and public choice, he made it clear what his own priorities were. This may have puzzled and pained many of his friends and colleagues, but it made it clear that his commitment to the work of justice in the law and in politics was truly an expression of his response to the love of God, a response which affirmed that love and justice are indeed bound together, but that neither requires a particular office or role, that at the center of his being he would be God's faithful servant first, last, and always and that this meant he would continue to be a very American, very pragmatic idealist, an advocate of the society of right in which the work of justice still needed the dedication and guidance of one who would remain priest and prophet. 
   I do not know what purgatory will be like for Bob. He would dismiss any form of physical suffering or infirmity as a trivial restraint on the desire of his heart for the good and an empty distraction from the important work to be done, as he did in the year before his death. I surmise that the central part of his purgatory will be accepting that he has indeed arrived in a jurisdiction where justice can be attained without lawyers and where the administration is reliably good and beyond impeachment. But I cannot imagine that this will be a long or traumatic episode. 
   Through his eighty-six years he learned much and gave much to his students, is colleagues, his country, and to his community of vocation and choice, the Society of Jesus. As a result, so many of us mourn him and look to him as an iconic and exemplary figure, a man in whom the religious and political issues of our age came together fruitfully, if not always happily. We salute a life well lived for the good of others. We recognize a Catholic son of New England, who learned Protestant virtues and institutions and who came to share Jewish joys and sorrows, and who in consequence became more comprehensively Catholic and more universally human. We give thanks for a man of talent who seized opportunities to serve and a man of peace who was not afraid of conflict. We give praise for a friend who gave generously of his time and his knowledge to so many of us even while he remained splendidly and eccentrically himself. 
   But in this task of capturing Bob's special union of the vitally personal and the universally good, the deeply Christian and the proudly American, I will give the last and best word to our fellow Jesuit, Gerard Manley Hopkins, who wrote in 1881 this sonnet: 
 ``As kingfishers catch fire, dragonflies draw flame; As tumbled over rim in roundy wells Stones ring; like each tucked string sells, each hung bell's Bow swung finds tongue to fling out broad its name; Each mortal thing does one thing and the same: Deals out that being indoors each one dwells; Selves--goes itself; myself it speaks and spells, Crying What I do is me: for that I came. 
 I say more: the just man justices; Keeps grace: that keeps all his goings graces; Acts in God's eye what in God's eye he is-- Christ--for Christ plays in ten thousand places, Lovely in limbs, and lovely in eyes not his To the Father through the features of men's faces.''   
   So we salute a man who has challenged our judgments of what is truly important, who has given a superlative example of generous service, and who never rested from his desire to do the work of justice. As he said to me in what turned out to be our final conversation, ``I do not rest in the daytime.'' He goes on one final trip back to the district, where he will finally rest with his brother Jesuits in New England. We pray--may God be with you, Bob, and may God be with us as we take up our share in the great work. For, as Congressman Hoyer reminded us the other day of the motto above the Speaker's Rostrum in the House, where Bob spent his happiest and richest years, ``In God We Trust.''  
   Eulogy for Fr. Robert Drinan  At this sacred place, As the ancient and solemn prayers are unfolding, And our spirits are finding peace and rest, We remember the faithful servant of God, Robert Drinan, our friend. 
 He was a priest who offered prayers on our behalf in troubled days; He was a teacher who had no fear to tell the truth in confused times; He was a voice for those who had no voice; He reached out for those who were in distress. 
 In our spirit he is still alive, his words still echo in our mind. 
 Now, a silence envelops him, A silence surrounds us. 
 How shall we keep his memory alive? 
 Powerful persons build monuments for themselves so that they are remembered: the pharaohs built pyramids in their quest for immortality. 
 But, a good person will be remembered for what he was: he needs no monuments; he lives in the minds and hearts of those who knew him. 
 My task is to speak well of him (this is what eulogy means). 
 This task is hard and easy. 
 It is hard because he had a rich and complex personality. And throughout his life he struggled to receive an abundance of grace. And God struggled to get hold of him. 
 It is easy because what I am going to say you already know, all I do is to articulate what you have perceived. 
 Let me then say it simply and plainly--with no ornament: 
 Fr Robert Drinan was a good man. He had an immense capacity to give: that tells it all. 
 Whenever his restless eyes caught sight of someone, He or she could be a local or a visitor, a student or a teacher, a poor soul or a rich benefactor, If conversation ensued Fr. Drinan invariably unfailingly was ready to help him, to help her; and then he the helper said gently ``Thank You!'' 
 He fulfilled the greatest commandments in the law: 
 ``You shall love the Lord, your God'' And ``you shall love your neighbor as yourself.'' These two commandments--Jesus said--Are the perfection of the law (cf. Mt. 22:34-40). 
 He was therefore a good lawyer: he fulfilled the greatest commandments of the law. 
 How did he come to that? He gave from his own riches. 
 I presume, (I do not know, but no other assumption makes sense), That once upon a time, The young Robert Drinan discovered the gift of this beautiful creation, And had a glimpse of its almighty Creator, 
 Thus he became rich And he conceived a gratitude For all that he received, And responded by enriching others. 
 And then the decisions that shaped his life simply followed: He became a priest, a teacher, an advocate of human rights, a helper of those in distress. 
 The goodness that he received and possessed shaped his personality, And throughout his life he kept giving, Assiduously and impatiently, Perfectly and imperfectly, But always magnanimously To all and sundry. 
 In one way or another, we all experienced it. I am indeed articulating what you know. 
 Indeed, he was a good lawyer. And he fulfilled the perfection of the law. 
 In response to the gift that he has received he wanted to mend a broken world. Now we understand his bursts of energies, his broken sentences, his impatient gestures, and--the quiet retreats year by year. 
 Fr. Robert Drinan needs no monument to be remembered: His spirit is alive in many minds and hearts, 
 May his spirit be the driving force of our lives.  
   Father Drinan Funeral Mass February 1, 2007, St. Aloysius Church, Washington, DC  
   ``Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen one in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him and he will bring justice to the nations.'' 
   These words of the Prophet Isaiah describe a man we all know as a true servant of the Lord, because he was a true servant of justice. 
   Our University community, our country, our global community--we were all profoundly fortunate to have known him, to have benefited from his wisdom, his keen intellect, his principled leadership, his great heart. 
   A devoted patriot, he demanded that the government serve all of the people and not only the wealthy and the influential. 
   A cherished pastor, he shared the joys of countless weddings and baptisms and provided guidance and unwavering support to so many as they wrestled with difficult questions and great personal challenge. 
   A gifted teacher, he expected that students master the letter of the law, while cultivating in them a respect for the spirit of justice and preparing them to accept the ethical responsibilities of their profession. 
   A man of deep and abiding faith, embraced the command to love his neighbor--and for Bob, that meant solidarity with those in need throughout the global community. 
   Bob understood that human dignity is not contingent on the whims of the state. It is an absolute, objective good that government, that power, that the rule of law must protect and promote. Human dignity is not constrained by manmade boundaries and borders, and neither is our obligation to foster and support it. Bob traveled the globe on human rights missions, telling the stories of those whose voices those in power could not or would not hear, and championing those who could not fight. 
   The way Bob brought his faith into public life can be an inspiration to us all. Public service was a means of living out his deep faith, his vocation as a priest. And so, he was a public servant of extraordinary compassion and conviction, conscience and character who knew that the power and platform of public office were subordinate to justice. 
   It was the depth of commitment to his vocation that was the most striking dimension of Bob's character. 
   I first met Bob more than 25 years ago when I was serving as assistant to Father Tim Healy, then President of Georgetown. For those of you who knew Tim, you will remember that he was not easily awed. 
   When he spoke of Bob Drinan, there was a sense of awe in his voice. 
   No doubt, Tim was as impressed by Bob's achievements as all of us were. But there was something else that moved Tim when he reflected on the example of Bob Drinan. They shared the most profound dimension of their identities--they were both Jesuit priests. 
   When asked about his ability to serve Georgetown, Tim would often say, ``I serve at the will of our Board of Directors, but I am available to serve because my superiors in the Society of Jesus permit me. If my superiors believe that I can best serve in some other way, then I will do as I am told.'' 
   At the peak of his engagement in the Congress, Bob Drinan was told he could no longer serve as an elected member. We all can imagine how difficult the choice might have been for us. But for Bob, there was never any real choice. The true character of the man, the depth of his identity as a priest, was revealed by his act of obedience. 
   The passage from Isaiah concludes, ``He will not falter or be discouraged until he establishes justice on earth.'' 
   Whether as a dean of law school at Boston College of 14 years, or as a member of Congress for 10 years, a member of our Law center faculty for 26 years, a Jesuit of 65 years, the call was that of justice. Bob Drinan never faltered, was never discouraged. 
   It remains for all of us to carry on the work for which he prepared us, to build an earth in which justice will prevail.  
   Remarks of Senator Edward M. Kennedy at the Mass of the Resurrection for Reverend Robert F. Drinan, SJ 
   Father Brown, Father Langdon, Madam Speaker, Helen, Betsey, Suzy, Anne and all family and friends of Father Drinan, and members of his Georgetown Community. It's an honor to join in celebrating Bob's extraordinary life and enduring legacy. More than any person I've ever known Bob took to heart the belief that here on earth, God's work must be our own. 
   We know how hard he worked every day to make our community, our country and our world a better place. Now he is with God, and we know the Lord has told him, ``Well done, thou good and faithful servant.'' Well done indeed Bob. 
   To look back over the sweep of his incredible life is to see vivid proof of what even lone individuals--armed with moral clarity and courage--can do when they set their minds on making a difference. He demonstrated constantly that each of us has the capacity to work for change and have an impact, and he did it by example--through his service, his faith and ministry, and his writings and his passion for education. 
   Of all the hats he wore, none fit him better than that of teacher, and we'll never forget all he taught us. 
   His election to Congress was a dramatic turning point in the effort to end the tragic, misguided, and wasteful war in Vietnam. We miss him more than ever in the halls of Congress today, when that cruel history is repeating itself.  
   He stood up to the abuses of a President--at first as a lonely voice, but in the fullness of time, the nation agreed and the President stepped down. 
   He took on immensely challenging and often unrewarding tasks such as rewriting the federal criminal code to make the administration of justice both effective and fair. The challenge was tough; it was complex; it was thankless; it took a decade--but it was no match for the brilliant legal mind and the will of iron of this Jesuit. 
   He summoned all of us to ease the plight of the oppressed--whether African Americans in our own country; Jews in the Soviet Union, or the countless heartbreaking number of impoverished, dispossessed and neglected throughout the world. He held up a mirror to our conscience, both in and out of Congress. He touched us all, and made us see in our own lives the truth of those great words: 
 For I was hungry, and you gave me food, I was thirsty, and you gave me drink, a stranger and you welcomed me, naked and you clothed me, ill and you cared for me, in prison and you visited me..... whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for me.  
   When I think of Bob Drinan, I'm reminded of the famous lines from Oliver Wendell Holmes: ``As life is action and passion, it is required of a man that he should share the passion and action of his time at peril of being judged not to have lived.'' 
   He served with us in Congress for only ten years, but for that brief time, he was like a meteor across our sky. I think back to that first campaign, and to the team of extraordinary young people he inspired--like a young John Kerry--whom he affectionately referred to as his ``minions.'' 
   They were brimming with ideas and determination to change our nation for the better, and--decades later--many remain passionately engaged in the public square unbent and unbowed in their commitment to serving others. 
   That's how great his influence was, and I'm grateful too to Bob, because from this group of young idealists, I think I've gotten a Senate colleague; at least two chiefs of staff; a pollster; a team of advisors; and one determined core of volunteers. So thank you Father! 
   That his droll wit, immense intellect, and his unwavering commitment to justice and peace are gone from us now, makes me sad. 
   But we know that ``Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God''--and we know too that our great teacher, friend, and leader is smiling down on us today. God Bless you, Father Drinan. 
   Your inspiration still guides us.  
   Tribute To Father Drinan  
   Father Drinan and I first met in early 1980, the last year of the Carter administration. President Carter had unexpectedly asked me to spend three months in Madrid heading the American delegation to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, known as the Helsinki process and consisting of thirty-five countries. 
   The Congress had established a joint House and Senate Commission to make certain that the United States would not permit the human rights dimension of the agreement to be buried by the Soviet Union and those states more interested in economics and security. Father Drinan was an active member of the Congressional Commission. 
   In my role as Chairman, I invited the Commission to be an integral part of our delegation and urged its Members to spend as much time in Madrid with me as they could. Father Drinan took advantage of that opportunity and I was proud to have him, a frocked Jesuit and a Member of Congress, symbolically and actively representing our country and our values. 
   The meetings lasted for three years and not for three months. With the help of Father Drinan and the Members of the Commission, our Delegation decided not to bring the meeting to a close until we could see signs of improved Human Rights on the part of the Soviet Union and its Eastern European colleagues. We quietly negotiated significant achievements in that area. 
   Father Drinan and I remained friends even after he left Congress. The decision by the Pope that he leave politics and, in the Jesuit tradition, engage in teaching was, we know, not an easy one for him to accept. My own view was that the Pope knew that Massachusetts would be in good hands with Ted Kennedy in the Congress and that there was an urgent need for the legal profession to learn what Father Drinan would teach. 
   Our last meeting was a few weeks ago when he invited me to lunch in the lovely new dining room for Priest at Georgetown University. I pointed out to him that I was five days older than he and, therefore, should be considered the senior, but he insisted on paying the bill. He had read an article I had written which was published in The New York Timescalling for a serious active rebirth by our government of the Reagan effort for the world to destroy all of our nuclear weapons of mass destruction. This interested him immensely. I told him of the progress being made in that direction and I promised to keep him informed. I will. Death, after all, is only a horizon; and the horizon is only the limit of our sight.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. (ISRAEL -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I want to express the strong feelings that I and many others have on the 60th anniversary of the State of Israel. 
   Israel was created by a U.N. resolution 60 years ago. People who have stressed the importance of U.N. resolutions with regard to the Middle East sometimes forget to note that when a U.N. resolution was passed which created the State of Israel in a fairly small part of what had then been Palestine, it evoked violent opposition from almost all of Israel's neighbors. That is, those countries which launched an armed attack aimed at obliterating Israel as it was born, in defiance of a U.N. resolution, do not come with clean hands when they talk now about living up to every U.N. resolution. That's no reason to ignore them, but it is a context that ought to be clear. 
   There are a number of perspectives that people bring to the existence of Israel and its history. There is one that I want to talk about in particular as a liberal. 
   By all of the values that motivate me to be in public life, the State of Israel is the only nation in the Middle East today that qualifies as a nation that respects them. Whether it is the principle of nondiscrimination--and some things are very controversial in their own country--the rights of women, free speech, the rights of gay men and lesbians, Israel stands out by a very strong margin over all of its neighbors. 
   I do want to address some of my friends on the left who are critical of some of the geopolitical aspects of this. It's legitimate to do it. Indeed, if you want to hear criticism of the approach Israel takes towards the peace process or the question of settlements, one of the best places to go is Israel. Because unlike every other Middle East nation, Israel is a place where democracy thrives. Indeed, one of the important lessons the existence of Israel teaches the world is that those who argue that if you have threats to your national security, democracy becomes a luxury, are wrong. 
   Israel was born under attack. It has lived its entire 60 years to date with the great hostility of its neighbors. It has fought a number of wars. And it is today confronted by many nations, Iran, for example, that profess to be interested in its obliteration. Despite that, it has maintained a strong democracy; governments win and governments lose. And the Israeli High Court has a record, frankly, that in some ways exceeds our own U.S. Supreme Court in vindicating civil liberties. 
   Now, having said that, I will add that I am critical of some aspects of Israel policy. The point, however, is that that's a right that people have within Israel to exercise those differences that others don't. I thought the recent comments by Secretary Rice that were somewhat critical of what Israel was doing were useful in helping move towards the peace process. 
   On the other hand, it ought to be clear, and I do believe Israel should continue to maintain its willingness to withdraw from most of the West Bank, I think they should be removing settlements, but it must be remembered, Israel did withdraw from southern Lebanon and it did withdraw from Gaza in the face of a good deal of controversy at home, one under Prime Minister  Barak, one under Prime Minister Sharon, of two different parties. 
   Tragically, in both cases, Israel's voluntary withdrawal was followed by the entrenchment in those two areas of organizations dedicated not simply to territorial change, but to Israel's obliteration, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza. And they have used those places from which Israel withdrew as bases for attacks. I understand the emotional reaction that says, ``We'll never do that again.'' I think it would be wrong; I do not think it would be in Israel's best interest. That does not mean they should not be able to defend themselves, of course they should. 
   But the fundamental point is this: Yes, there are serious issues about how to pursue peace. Nowhere are they more openly debated than within Israel itself, and that is one of the great glories of its 60 years.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I thank the gentleman from Mississippi. 
   Mr. Speaker, I guess as I get older my memory is even worse than I thought. I thought I remembered what it was like when the Republicans were in power. But I don't seem to remember any of those bills my friend from Texas was just talking about. Apparently they were saving them up until we came to power, because I don't remember them ever bringing them up when we were here. 
   Having said that, I do want to apologize to my friends on the other side for talking about the legislation under consideration. I hope they will indulge me as I do that. 
   And as I do it, I want to say that I think what we've seen in the bill being brought forward by our newest colleagues from Louisiana and Mississippi is the importance of timing. We've had this problem in which public housing authorities in Louisiana and Mississippi were being treated unfairly. This is not singling them out for special treatment. This is ending a bureaucratic glitch that disadvantaged them. And we're doing it in the way that was suggested by the Bush administration, and I give them credit for that. 
   But it ought to be clear to people that having new Members here from Louisiana and Mississippi, the areas affected, had an impact. They are both on the Financial Services Committee, and I'm very proud that the Financial Services Committee on which they are now members gave them the opportunity to bring this bill forward. 
   I also want to express my appreciation to the gentleman from Mississippi and the gentleman from Texas, the Chair and Subcommittee Chair of the Homeland Security Committee. 
   One of the things that plagues this institution is jurisdictional arguments and turf fights. I'm very pleased that we've been able, my colleagues particularly on the Homeland Security Committee, to work so closely together on this. I'm also glad to say that this is genuinely a bipartisan issue, and I appreciate the Republicans supporting us. 
   But I do want to stress again, this is no special deal for Louisiana and Mississippi. By a bureaucratic glitch, the existence of a provision that has never been funded keeps them from getting money to replace public housing that was destroyed. And there's a Federal program under FEMA that provides Federal funds for public buildings that are destroyed. This simply allows public housing a fair share.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. (WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JULY 26, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Madam Chairman I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   This bill as presented significantly expands the ability of the Farm Credit System to operate in nonfarm contexts in two ways; first of all, in terms of the membership that would be required to be farm credit providers, and, secondly, in terms of the transactions in which they engage. And I think that would be  an error. And I believe that it is a mistake to allow an expansion into the banking system by entities that aren't banks. We have a particular exemption in the Farm Credit System for agricultural lending, and it was meant to be lending by and to agricultural commodities. This bill goes beyond it. 
   Now, I want to say, and I have had conversations with the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Members have said that especially with the interest in alternative energy, there have been problems in getting loans from banks. I must say that, and I talked to my colleague the ranking Republican, no one has brought this to our attention. Had this been brought to our attention on the Financial Services Committee, we would have responded. And I want to say now, and I talked to the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, I am prepared to have, I think we should have in the fall, joint hearings of our two committees, the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Financial Services, to listen to people's concerns here. And if it is documented that there have been problems with the availability of loans for the purpose of alternative energy for agriculture, then, yes, I would agree that something is appropriate. My problem is that this bill as it now stands goes beyond that in several ways. It weakens the restrictions in terms of stock ownership as to who gets involved. 
   Now, another issue that has been raised was allowing an increase in the town size, from 2,500 to 6,000. My reaction to that was favorable, but we were never able, as we were willing, to negotiate out some limitations and some expansions. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Madam Chairman, I yield myself my remaining minute. 
   I know my friends have said they sought a compromise. The only problem is they had a unique motion here, it was the unilateral compromise, they compromised with themselves. And they did a pretty good job of compromising with themselves, but I think we need to compromise with each other. 
   There are two committees here that have concerns: one about the integrity of the banking system and not having non-banks get into the banking system. This House is aware of that because we dealt with a similar issue with regard to industrial loan corporations. 
   What we are saying here, the gentleman from Alabama and I, is we were not previously told about a problem of a lack of availability of credit from the banking system for alternative energy. If that exists, it needs to be remedied. And as I've said, I've spoken to the chairman of the full committee; I've spoken to my ranking member on our committee. We're prepared to have joint hearings and be available for people to document to us what the nature of the problem is, and then respond, whether it's an increase in size, or what. But I do think the history shows that we should be very careful about who gets into the banking industry and who doesn't. The banking system ought to be preserved very carefully.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I am suffering a little disorientation because I didn't get the anti-immigration amendment. So I hope the gentleman from Georgia isn't ill and was not, therefore, able to present it. 
   On this amendment, I congratulate the minority. They make a reasonable point. Yes, I think that we should have included the veterans. To that extent, I think this is worth supporting. I do not understand why this has to come at the expense of people who had committed an offense and have come out. I had thought there was these days some sense that rehabilitation was a goal. As the gentlewoman from California will explain, we are talking about a very narrow category of ex-offenders. We certainly don't believe that when you come out of prison, you ought to then become homeless if you have otherwise satisfied society's reasonable demands. But I do not oppose this because, I agree, we should be including the veterans. 
   I will say this. What this does is two things: it says include the veterans, but then excludes people who have been sentenced, served a term, et cetera, and have shown that they met all these conditions. We will be going forward with this bill with the Senate, and there is no need to put these two issues against each other. So I believe that we can accept this with full support then for the veterans, but then not have the other issue foreclosed. I would ask the gentleman, I will yield to him, if he would clarify this. 
   Sadly, one of the problems we have had with some veterans, because of problems that were created, some veterans have committed offenses. I would ask the gentleman, what about a veteran, and this has two parts, yes to veterans, no to people who are ex-offenders. I would ask the gentleman: How should the housing authority on this treat a veteran ex-offender, assuming again it was an honorable discharge. Someone who was honorably discharged, later got into some trouble, completed all the term, et cetera, how should the housing authority under this deal with a veteran who's an ex-offender? 
   And I will yield to the gentleman.

He may not be sorry he had trouble hearing me, but now I will try to be more clear. We say in this ``preference for veterans.'' We agree with that. But it also denies that, not preference, but listing in this category for ex-offenders. What does the housing authority do if a veteran who was an ex-offender who has served his or her term, satisfied all the conditions, how do you treat under this amendment a veteran who's an ex-offender? 
   I will yield to the gentleman.

   We are, I assume, going to back this, but I think there is this ambiguity. So I will have to say we will have to deal with this further. I would not want to give to the veterans with one hand what you might take away with another one. We do know some veterans, not entirely through their fault, given the conditions in which they serve, problems that occur, some of them become offenders. So we will deal with that going forward, and I would assume people would want to vote for this because we should have included veterans. But I will say, especially after my inability to get an answer, the question of ex-offenders will remain an open question and we'll have to deal with that going forward.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. (HOPE VI IMPROVEMENT AND REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I thank the gentlewoman who chairs the Housing Subcommittee for the time and for her very creative and diligent work on this bill and others. And I also want to acknowledge our new ranking member of the Housing Subcommittee, the gentlewoman from West Virginia. 
   Let me begin by noting that obviously in the parliamentary forum we focus on areas of difference. Members should note how small those are relatively in the context of this bill. This is a significant rewrite of the HOPE VI program in which there was not a lot of objection. In fact, I think every amendment but one that was offered was made in order. I disagree with several of the amendments, but I do want to stress the commonality of reform that is in here as we go forward. 
   There are two basic areas of difference. Two amendments on the other side of the aisle from the two gentlemen from Texas would reduce the requirement that with Federal money we replace low-income units that we destroy. Yes, there are low-income units that should be eliminated as they now exist, but that does not mean that the total number of housing units available for lower-income people ought to be diminished as a conscious Federal policy. And the amendments of my two colleagues from Texas would do that. 
   The Sessions amendment would allow the Federal Government to give people money simply to tear down all of the houses that poor people live in in a particular area on the grounds that those weren't very nice houses. No doubt in many cases they are not nice houses, but the poor people who live in those houses didn't decide voluntarily to live in bad housing as opposed to nice housing. They had nowhere else to go. And if you tear down where they now are and build zero in its place, you have exacerbated the housing crisis. 
   Similarly, the amendment of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Neugebauer) would diminish our capacity. We say if you tear them down, you have to replace them. You don't replace them in the same place. You can do it in a much broader area with more flexibility. You have 4 1/2 years to replace the ones you have torn down and may go to the Secretary of HUD and get a waiver, say there is a court order, there is this land shortage. Some of these were, in fact, so useless. There are a lot of reasons you can go to the Secretary of HUD. So we are not saying that the one-for-one has to be followed in every case. We do say that should be the standard. 
   Here is the problem with the Neugebauer amendment. He says the housing authorities only have to replace units that they tear down that were occupied. Most people who run housing authorities are diligent, hardworking people in difficult circumstances, but there is incompetence in some housing authorities. People who have incompetently been unable to rent housing for one reason or another shouldn't be rewarded by then being allowed to tear that housing down. 
   In other words, if housing authorities, who have the obligation to use the money available to house people, refuse to do that or are unable to do that, we should not reward them by saying then you don't have to build those. And there will be places where people don't like poor people living in their community, and the political leadership of that community could then order the housing authority to leave some of those units vacant, and then we will apply for a HOPE VI grant and we will be able to replace far fewer because we will be rewarded for leaving them vacant. 
   The gentlewoman from West Virginia's amendment, and again there is some common agreement that we should go towards encouraging green building, but here is the difference. I know the homebuilders say this is bad for them, but understand, this is a Federal program with Federal money. We are not talking here about imposing on private-sector developers any requirement whatsoever to do energy efficiency. We are here as the landlord, not as the regulator. 
   What we are saying is that we are the Federal Government and we will set an example. We will take the money that we, the Federal Government, makes available, and hold ourselves to a high energy efficiency standard. If people think that is inappropriate and it is too expensive, they don't have to apply to come here. That leaves everyone in the private sector free to do as they wish.  
   Beyond that, one of the strongest advocates of this has been my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. Olver), the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee. He has to fund all of this, and he has to fund it going forward. We don't simply build the HOPE VI projects and walk away. We don't. The builders do. It is not their fault. 
   If I am the contractor to build the buildings, my obligation is completed the day I have done the building and gotten the money for it. But we, the Federal Government, then have to fund it on an ongoing basis. What we are saying is, as the landlord, we want to build it in a way that makes it energy efficient going forward. 
   We will take an up-front cost because, over time, over 20 and 30 and 40 years, we will reduce our operating budget. So we are being told that as the landlord we can't make the decision about how efficiently to use funds and how to say we will reduce costs going forward. So I would hope that the gentlewoman's amendment is defeated. It would take it from a mandatory to one factor among many. 
   We also have an argument about the standard. We do mention one standard. The homebuilders are wrong in their letter where they talk about the LEED standard. That is out of the bill in the manager's amendment.     
   On the green communities, we do mention the green community standard; but we explicitly give the Secretary of HUD the ability to propose another standard if it is equivalent in energy savings, and that's the key. 
   So the amendment of the gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. Capito) makes this one factor among many, not a required factor, and everything we do with our money to be energy efficient. 
   And, secondly, she would allow a much weaker standard in many cases than ours does. So we allow flexibility, but flexibility as to how to achieve the goal of energy efficiency, not flexibility as to how much energy efficiency to offer. 
   I hope the bill, as essentially presented, or a couple of amendments I think are relatively noncontroversial, are accepted.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. The gentleman from Alabama correctly quoted the carpenters' letter. The manager's amendment responds to that. The manager's amendment, which we are now debating, removes reference to the leadership and energy and environmental design. So the objection raised by the carpenters we thought had some validity to it, and the manager's amendment takes care of it. 
   So there is no reference to that. So two of the points the gentleman made we agree with, and we're correcting, restoring main street and removing any reference to LEED. There will be other differences, but I did want to acknowledge this is an example of how we're trying to work together.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I appreciate the cooperative spirit, and we should note that the one-for-one replacement will remain in effect, but there's a question about what it accomplishes. 
   Let me describe the one-for-one replacement, because it is not nearly as prescriptive as my friend would have indicated. In the first place, communities will have 54 months after the demolition with which to replace the housing. Secondly, it does not have to be new public housing. We have explicitly added here the ability to do project-based vouchers. We have worked with some of those who in fact try to do HOPE VI, to make it more flexible. 
   Third, there's a waiver in here. One of the factors in the waiver, the gentleman from Texas correctly mentioned open spaces, one of the desirable things. My colleague from Massachusetts, Mr. Capuano, offered an amendment that has been incorporated into the manager's amendment that would say when you apply for a waiver, your willingness to put in more open space would be one of the justifications for a waiver for one-for-one. So we do have flexibility. 
   On the other hand, I reject the notion that we shouldn't be prescriptive here. This is not the Federal Government reaching out and telling people what to do. This is a restriction on the expenditure of Federal funds for a limited purpose. Here is the problem: we do have a shortage of affordable housing units. We do not want to see a Federal program contribute to a diminution of that. We allowed flexibility in the replacement. 
   Here's the problem with the gentleman's amendment: most of the people who run housing authorities are decent, hardworking people who have taken on a tough job, and we have tried to help them. But there are political situations in some community where the people running housing authorities are not supportive of this purpose. 
   What the gentleman's amendment says is if they leave the units vacant, they can then permanently get rid of the units. That is the problem. Going forward it gives people an incentive or reward not to fill the units. Most housing authorities won't be like that, but there is incompetence and there are people who for political reasons say, We don't want these people, they are too much of a problem. 
   So rewarding housing authorities for leaving units vacant by allowing them,  if the people left them vacant may want to have fewer housing units, allowing them that is a very bad idea. We should have flexibility, I agree with the gentleman. But that is flexibility with the waiver; that is flexibility in how you deliver placement. In other words, show why you're trying to do it. But to diminish the requirement at the outset arbitrarily to reward people for leaving units vacant, to reward the incompetence. People say, We have got too many other units here. We're going to leave them vacant. Remember, elderly housing is a major component. That would be a very grave error.     
   We have, I believe, in much of this country a shortage. 
   Now, if a community comes forward and says to HUD, You know what, there is no population here left anymore, there is nobody who wants to live here anymore, those are considerations that can be put into the waiver. So we agree there should be flexibility. That is why we have a waiver component. 
   By the way, in addition to open space, if you show you are going to do day care facilities, if you show you are going to do health care facilities, that can further justify fewer units. If you say you are going to build more large units for large families, yes, you can trade in a couple of small units for a large unit. All of those are encouraged. 
   The only thing we disagree with, because we believe we have built flexibility in here, is, as I said, to give people in some cases those who are, and it is not the majority by any means, people who are not supportive of this, give them an incentive to leave housing vacant. 
   Now, let me say this to the gentleman: His amendment didn't say housing that was physically unoccupiable. I agree the bill does not make that consideration. I would say to the gentleman, going forward, we might be able to work on a situation where units that were physically not habitable might not be counted. I agree with that. If that was the amendment, I think we might be working something out, and I hope we will as it goes forward. But what the gentleman's amendment says, units that are perfectly in good shape, that the authority either can't rent because they are incompetent or decides not to, that those can be disregarded. 
   So I hope the amendment is defeated. But I would promise to work with the gentleman as we go forward so that units that are in fact not habitable, not occupiable, would not be counted. 
   I would yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Taking back my time, I would agree with that if we didn't have a waiver in there, if we didn't have a variety of ways of meeting the one-for-one replacement. It is not all public housing. In fact, one of the things I plan to do in future legislation in cooperation with my colleagues is to go to some of the other housing programs we may have, maybe the Low Income Housing Fund or others, and give a preference to housing authorities who have that HOPE VI obligation. So, in other words, there would be a wide variety of ways in which they could replace the housing, not simply by public housing, because, I agree, that would be self-defeating.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, first, there are two points,  and the gentlewoman tends to confuse the two. One is should there be flexibility in the standard. Both versions have that. Our version says the green communities or a standard promulgated by the Secretary, but we say it has to be substantially equivalent in what it accomplishes. 
   Secondly and more important, the bill with the manager's amendment says that a green component must be in any HOPE VI application. The gentlewoman dilutes that. She says it will be one factor that can be considered. But under her proposal, if you are very strong elsewhere, they would not have to be very much in the green. So there is a real difference there. We both say it is a good idea, but the bill says you must include the green component. Her bill says you may include the green component. You will get points if you do, but you might not. Both have flexibility as to how you reach that. 
   Now I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Olver), the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on HUD and Transportation.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. First, Mr. Chairman, yes, the carpenters objected to the LEED standard. They did not object to the green community standard. We thought the objection was reasonable and met it. 
   Secondly, again, the bill, without the gentlewoman's amendment, does provide flexibility. We say, however, that when HUD does an alternative proposal, it has to meet the minimum standard. That is the difference.     
   We put in the minimum. The other difference is that her amendment would allow some of the projects to go forward without green components, depending on how they were otherwise rated and others would not.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. (RECOGNIZING THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CIVIL LIBERTIES ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I thank my friend from Michigan who then and now has been a leader in the effort to protect the civil liberties which are so important to us. 
   I had the distinct honor of standing on this floor and presenting that bill as chairman of the subcommittee, and I remember today the emotion I felt then and feel now when I read the words ``on behalf of the Nation, Congress apologizes.'' 
   The ability to admit a mistake is a sign of greatness, and I felt privileged then that we did it. 
   People have talked about the lessons, and they are important. And we should draw on some of them. 
   One is that abandoning your principles in the face of a threat is a temptation which ought to be resisted. It's easier for us today than it was in 1948 to be very critical of those who locked up our former colleagues Bob Matsui and Norm Mineta and many, many other totally innocent Americans, Americans of Japanese descent, but we're talking about Americans, people born in this country, American citizens. 
   But at the time, the notion that the security of the Nation trumped everything else looked like a pretty good argument. J. Edgar Hoover was right, but he wasn't running for office; Earl Warren was. Franklin Roosevelt was. Very few elected officials stood up against that. And that's one of the lessons we ought to draw. 
   It is much too easy to give in to the temptation to say, ``Well, we're in trouble. Protections of individual rights, civil liberties, they're for the good times.'' And obviously, there are some analogies to today. Now, things are much better today. We haven't done today anything like that. But there are lessons still that we have to look at. 
   Another is that if you are going to try to protect yourself, as you have a right to do, don't do it en masse, don't say there is this whole group of people, and we're not going to stop and decide whether this or that individual did something wrong; we're going to look at some essential characteristic of their being, and on that basis we're going to penalize them. We're going to restrict them. We're going to segregate them. 
   Now, obviously, being locked up in a camp for years is a far, far greater wrong than not being able to fly on an airplane. But the fact that it was much worse to lock people up doesn't justify us restricting people's travel rights because of the ethnic group they belong to or because of a mass fear. 
   So yes, we should be proud of having realized this mistake. Talk about history. I was in college in the 1950s when I read the case, I think it was Korematsu, in which the U.S. Supreme Court said it was perfectly constitutional to do what was done. And I was  appalled. I was a college junior, and I said, ``Boy, this is my country. I didn't know we did things like this.'' 
   And I came here eager to participate in its undoing, and I felt I was very lucky to be chairman of the subcommittee, along with my colleague from California who was then on the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Lungren, to be able to bring that bill forward. But I also understand that I had the benefit of hindsight. I had the easy decision to make. 
   As we legitimately congratulate ourselves today for having recognized 20 years ago a mistake that we made 65 years ago, let's leave a little energy for resolving that we don't do it again. Let's, as we talk about the folly of 1943, be very determined not to repeat it even in a smaller measure and with fewer people. 
   I believe that we have had government policies in the past couple of years since the terrible mass murders of 2001 that have also failed to live up to our ideals of protecting individuals. Not on the same scale, I acknowledge that, and I think it's a mark of progress. But let's do what we can from this day forward so that no one 20 years later or 40 years later has to apologize to any extent because we let our legitimate need for self-defense diminish us from our principles.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. (SEASONED CUSTOMER CTR EXEMPTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, this is an example of sensible regulation because sensible regulation includes deregulation when that is appropriate. 
   The Committee on Financial Services reported this bill out last year. It passed the House. Surprisingly it managed not to make it through the Senate. The efficiency of that body failed us on this occasion apparently, but we are going to try again. 
   We believe in regulation, and this is an important area where we provide information to our financial detectives, and it is especially important with regard to terrorist financing. 
   But too much regulation can defeat the purpose for which regulation is intended, and we have a situation now where the banks are required to report every year on customers' transactions of $10,000 or more. Now, one of the things this bill would do is give the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to increase a dollar figure that has been left unadjusted for inflation for too long. 
   More importantly, we are talking now about the exemption that is given to what we call seasoned customers of the bank. When the banks are dealing, and this is particularly important for our community bankers, when they are dealing with people whom they know, with whom they have had regular and continuing relationships, having to report every time they do a transaction of $10,000 or more generates extra work for the bank, and I believe, if anything, interferes with the ability of the regulators to find what they should be looking for. 
   If we are telling people to find needles, we should not set about building them bigger haystacks. What this bill says is that where we are talking about regular customers, regular seasoned customers, they can apply for the exemption, which is in the control of the Secretary of the Treasury, with careful criteria. 
   And having received that exemption, as long as they remain seasoned customers of the same bank, that process does not have to be repeated every 2 years. It reduces the regulatory burden on banks, and it is particularly important to small banks. 
   I would ask at this point, Madam Speaker, under my general leave to include a letter to myself and the gentleman from Alabama from America's Community Bankers strongly endorsing this bill.  
   AMERICA'S COMMUNITY BANKERS 
   Washington, DC, January 22, 2007. Hon. BARNEY FRANK, Chairman, Financial Services Committee, House of Representatives Washington, DC. Hon. SPENCER BACHUS Ranking Member, Financial Services Committee, House of Representatives Washington, DC. 
   Dear Chairman Frank and Ranking Member Bachus: America's Community Bankers is pleased to support H.R. 323, the Seasoned Customer CTR Exemption Act of 2007. The legislation would make important improvements to the current exemption system for cash transaction reports (CTRs) by making it easier to exempt the routine transactions of certain seasoned business customers. H.R. 323 would more appropriately balance the cost and benefits of the Bank Secrecy Act's CTR reporting requirements. The legislation would also reduce the number of CTRs filed on routine transactions of well-known, law abiding customers. 
   We urge the full House of Representatives to adopt H.R. 323 and look forward to working with you to enact this important legislation. 
   While we fully support H.R. 323, we urge the Committee to modernize the Bank Secrecy Act further by increasing the $10,000 threshold that triggers CTR filing. This threshold has not been updated since 1970. Increasing the $10,000 trigger would more appropriately balance the reporting obligations of depository institutions and the information needs of law enforcement agencies. 
   Sincerely, Robert R. Davis, 
   Executive Vice President and Managing  Director, Government Relations.     
   What this will do is to reduce the paperwork burden on the banks; it will ease the burden on the regulators. It will not diminish in any way the flow of information that is needed for those whose job it is to keep us safe. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. (TAUNTON RIVER WILD AND SCENIC DESIGNATION -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by regretting the animus toward the people we represent that we've just heard. The gentleman from Utah said, ``Wild and scenic. The only thing wild about this are the gangs there.'' The city of Fall River, the gentleman has an amendment that would exempt from this bill the city of Fall River, Massachusetts, a city full of working people, many of them immigrants who became American citizens, and their descendants, from Portugal and elsewhere, people who worked in the garment industry and the textile industry, a city which has suffered economically the fate of de-industrialization. 
   Characterizing them and saying ``The only thing scenic about them is their graffiti, the only thing wild about them is their gangs,'' they don't deserve that denigration, no matter what political points people want to score. If you want to come after me, if you want to come after Mr. Kennedy of Rhode Island or Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts, we'll deal with it. But please don't denigrate these hardworking people. Don't impute to them gang activity that doesn't exist. The gentleman who accused them of gang activity has no idea of what goes on there and he makes an inaccurate statement. 
   The only thing scenic is the graffiti? Is that not scenic? This is the Battleship Massachusetts. It's part of a national park. It's one of the few battleships that comes with a Patriot missile, because I got Raytheon to put it up there. It's a park, a park for patriotic people. Do you see any graffiti on the Battleship Massachusetts? 
   In fact, that is part of the problem here. Apparently we're told it's okay to have a wild and scenic river. And of course we're not saying it should be wild and scenic. We are talking about a part of the statute that says you can have recreation. And these are people who have decided that in part because they have lost their industrial base that they had for a variety of reasons, they will develop new economic activity that is based on their river. 
   By the way, one of the bridges that is talked about, one of these structures, we have gotten money to take down. Like a number of cities that walled themselves off from the river, Fall River has appreciated the great beauty and attractiveness of that waterfront. And they would like to tear it down. 
   But here is the issue. Is environmentalism only for suburbanites? Do working people who have found themselves in economic distress have no right to try and enhance the quality of their environment? 
   Let me have some more of those pictures down here. Let me have some more to show people what we are talking about. We are not talking about only what was pictured. 
   This is part of the area that would be banned from the bill under the gentleman from Utah's amendment. So is this. Part of it is Mr. McGovern's district. Part of it is my district. It impacts the other districts. Yes, it is not everywhere beautiful. These are people who haven't had the good fortune to live always in land that was so attractive. But they would like to try and improve their situation. They would like to be able to enhance the quality of their environment without being denigrated as gang members or graffitists. Yes, there are a few people who do graffiti. The overwhelming majority in every single community along this river on both sides has asked for this designation. It was begun by our late and beloved colleague Joe Moakley before anybody heard of LNG. By the way, on LNG, there is an LNG plant in the district of our colleague, Mr. Markey. We in the Massachusetts delegation overwhelmingly supported a second LNG plant just a little bit offshore, just north of Boston that has been approved. Many of us support a third one. It is not a case of rejecting LNG. And I notice that people on the other side, those who think Fall River is just full of graffiti artists and gang members and don't know that wonderful city and the decent, patriotic people who live there, they circulated an editorial from the Boston Herald saying this isn't needed. And the Herald editorial, the op-ed piece that they circulated, concluded by saying, of course, it's not necessary because the LNG plant is dead. It's not simply the current LNG plant that has been rejected. It was the Coast Guard saying that in that narrow waterway, with the bridges that have to be traversed, you can't do it. 
   Carlos Gutierrez said ``no,'' the Secretary of Commerce. I've got to say, I didn't know that I would be defending the Bush administration so much here. I know I will be defending them against the Republicans on the questions of the housing bill. But we were also told there was this terrible conspiracy with the Park Service under George Bush. I don't think the Interior Department  under President Bush was engaged in this kind of chicanery that has been imputed to them. 
   We are talking about the desire of people who live in an area that has some industrial activity, but some residential and recreational areas, who want to protect what they have and make it better. They have asked us, and we have worked with them, to tear down an elevated highway. We are working with them to enhance the quality of their environment in a way that will also improve things economically. Every Member of Congress whose district is remotely near here strongly supports this bill. Every city and town along the way supports this. Every elected legislator and local official supports it. For them to be told essentially that ``it's too gritty, it's too grubby, you aren't people who we had in mind when we talked about the beauties of the environment, you don't deserve this because you've had graffiti and some of you belong to gangs''--an inaccurate characterization of the whole city--to deny them that is I think a degree of cruelty, frankly, that I hope this House does not encompass. 
   I and others have tried very hard to take into account what other Members think about their districts. To repudiate what all of the Members of Congress, five of us very directly involved here, think would be important for this particular area because an LNG plant that has been rejected by the Department of Commerce and by the Coast Guard and cannot be resuscitated, might some day in 10 years be resuscitated, and by then we will have had enough other LNG plants that it wouldn't even have any demand probably, that these people should be told, just the 9 miles, conveniently, the city of Fall River, the urban area, the area of hardworking immigrants who became American citizens, that they should be told that they don't qualify for environmental protection is a decision that I hope this House would not make. 
   I thank the gentleman from Arizona and the gentleman from West Virginia for the consideration they have given. It may in part be relevant that these are Members who themselves understand the desire of working people, of people who have lived in these kinds of areas, to get the same kind of consideration for their environmental needs as wealthy suburbanites. 
   I hope that the bill is passed without amendments that would cripple it.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I concede three business people out of this whole area opposed it. So we did not pass this by unanimous consent. Three people were there. Fortunately, my area that I represent is not the Senate. You don't need unanimous consent. If you get 98.9 percent, that's good enough. 
   What particularly puzzles me, though, is the gentleman from Utah apparently thinks that Congress in 1968 reached the ultimate in wisdom and that because something was passed in 1968 it can never be changed. We're not talking about interpreting the statute, we're talking about passing one. And, in fact, our views of the environment have evolved. 
   As my colleague from Rhode Island eloquently put it, the nature of the economy of New England has evolved. Back then it was a very industrial economy. We have lost that industrial base for reasons not, I think, largely the fault of the people there, and they are trying now to go in a new direction. 
   So here is where it is. If you were ever industrialized, according to the gentleman from Utah, that's it. The environment is not for you. He says, well, why doesn't the State do it? Probably because we are talking about navigable waterways, and as there are limits to what the State can impose on navigable waterways. This is a navigable waterway. There is Federal responsibility. So we are coming here to the Federal Government to empower the State. Every single community there. Governors. The previous Governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney, was for this. The current Governor is for it. But again the gentleman says, well, because it didn't meet this definition of 1968 you can never do it again. 
   We are talking about recreation, recreation for the people there, and, yes, we are saying that there is an act of Congress. We look at the 1968 act, we look at our current views of the environment, we look at the needs of the people, and this is the question. This isn't a test on what was in the minds of  people 40 years ago who passed the bill. We are the Congress. We are now passing the bill. 
   The gentleman's amendment excludes 9 miles, the City of Fall River, whom, again, he characterizes, as, well, the only thing that's wild there are the gangs, the only thing scenic is the graffiti. That is a very unfortunate thing to say about a city of hardworking people in which there are a number of very attractive and useful institutions and places. 
   But the question is, do the people who live in that 9 miles--by the way, that's on both sides of the river, and there is a less-developed town across that my colleague Mr. McGovern represents--are they to be denied the chance to maximize the quality of their environment? Are they to be denied this planning tool, overwhelmingly supported by the city, so that as we tear down this elevated highway, as they expand the open space, as they take advantage of the river, they can do it in a rational way. 
   The gentleman keeps saying, well, but what about 1968? What about 1968? Maybe it was a good year for wine. 
   But the notion that because a bill was passed in 1968, this Congress has lost the ability to make subsequent decisions, makes no sense. 
   We are asking you, all of us who represent the affected area, all of the elected officials in the area, the overwhelming majority of people in the area, give us this tool so that we can enhance the recreational character, improve our environment, and don't say that because we once had this industrialization, we don't qualify for environmental concerns.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. That is a most extraordinary misunderstanding of the law. Yes, there was a law in 1968. Guess what this will be if we pass it--a new law. The notion that a law passed in 1968 somehow defies this Congress of the ability to pass a subsequent law incorporating current judgment doesn't make any sense to me. 
   You're not in court here arguing. The question is, does this Congress have the right to take into account evolved views to amend the law? Yes, there is a law on the books. If the law on the books, I would say to the gentleman, covered this, we wouldn't need this law, but this is a law that we would pass. So the notion that there was a prior law really makes less sense than a lot of other things I have heard today, which says a lot.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   These are the portions of the river bank that would be excluded by the gentleman's amendment. These would not be protected. The historic park enshrining the battleship Massachusetts would not be protected. 
   The gentleman made an argument I found hard to follow. It was because the 1968 Act said one thing, it would be a violation of the rule of law to pass a law. I have never heard that. We are here in the House of Representatives debating a law. If it gets a majority and is passed by the Senate, never to be taken for granted, it will become an addition to the law. The notion that a law being passed somehow distorts the law is a grave error. 
   The gentleman talked about the will of the people. The overwhelming will of the people in this area is to have this designation. No, it is not wild and scenic in the dictionary definition. It is recreational, which is one of the provisions that the law calls for. 
   And the question is today, 40 years after the original passage of the law, do we, as a Democratically elected House--the gentleman will forgive me for using the word ``democratic'' affirmatively. Unlike Aristotle, I don't think ``democracy'' is a bad word. Do we have the right to say to urban dwellers, the people in the city of Fall River who are targeted by the gentleman's amendment, the people in the city of Fall River, an industrial area. They are the ones that are being told the environment is not for you. Environmental enhancement, the ability to use this law to get the planning right, you don't get that. You are not entitled to it because you have been an industrial area. 
   I don't think the House wants to deny the right to environmental improvement and enhancement to working people who live in an urban area. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I will close. 
   I appreciated the kind words the gentleman from Utah had to say about me. I only wish he would extend those courtesies to my constituents who have, I think, been unfairly denigrated. 
   And I again want to stress there was nothing inappropriate about 40 years later the Congress deciding, by a vote, this is no fiat here, to look at the law and say, we now believe that this is an appropriate designation. It is to say to an area that has been subjected to de-industrialization, you get the support of this planning mechanism, which is necessary because it is on a navigable waterway, so it can't be entirely done by State authorities. It is supported by all of the locally elected officials, overwhelmingly by the people there, by all of the Members of Congress nearby, by the four United States Senators who would be affected. You get this ability to enhance the quality of your life and, at the same time, to find, as my colleague from Rhode Island said, a new economic pattern. And that is engaging in self-help. We are trying to help them tear down an elevated highway that is a barrier to this river. There is a coordinated set of planning activities to improve it. 
   And I have to say, the gentleman, I think, has helped me prove the point. In his diligent search to defeat this bill, he came up with three people in the area who were against it. Well, I don't think three people in an area of hundreds of thousands gives you, even under Aristotle's definition, the right to impugn the legitimacy of this, particularly since we are following the regular order. 
   I would say to my colleagues, Mr. Chairman, please don't tell the people, the hardworking people of an industrial area who are trying to improve the quality of their lives for themselves and the lives of their children, don't tell them that this environmental designation stops where they live, and that they are to be, by a specific vote of the Congress of the United States, excluded from this set of benefits.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, first, let's note the nonseriousness of this. It says ``promptly.'' It kills the bill. If you want to vote against the bill, you can vote against the bill. This says ``promptly.'' If it were seriously intended to be a legislative act, it would have said ``forthwith.'' 
   Beyond that, it is not simply about energy. The last two lines say ``nothing shall be used as a basis to restrict current and future business and economic activities.'' This is a license to do any business whatsoever. Now I know a couple of businesses down there that I didn't think the Republican Party would be all in favor of. They would love to have this. They will expand it and invite you down and give you a discount. 
   This isn't just about energy. First of all, it's about killing the bill. But what does it say? The gentleman from Arizona read the amendment we have adopted about energy. ``Nothing shall be used as a basis to restrict current and future business and economic activities or expansion of such activities.'' It is hardly about energy. 
   The LNG plant has been rejected twice by the Coast Guard and once by that radical environmentalist, the Secretary of Commerce, Carlos Gutierrez, appointed by George Bush. 
   I'm about to yield to my colleague from Massachusetts. He and I represent hardworking people, working class people. Many of them are Portuguese immigrants and others who became American citizens who have lost their industrial base. They are trying to enhance the quality of their environment and at the same time offer an alternative economic mode. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, don't take it out on them. If we've got a political fight over energy, let's carry it out among the big boys and girls. Don't turn to these working people and say, do you know what? You're not classy enough. You don't deserve environmental protection. That is for the elite. That is for the wealthy.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, the House today revisits the subject of the industrial loan corporation. 
   Industrial loan corporations were created early in the last century as a kind of a niche at a time when it was felt that banks did not adequately serve working people, people of lower incomes. 
   When Congress dealt with the situation of banking reform in the 1980s, Congress decided to limit this form to six States, which now have the right to issue industrial loan charters, and recognize that the general business of banking was now being carried out in a way that did not require these niche banks, which Congress did not want to at that time wipe out banks that had been appropriately established under existing law. 
   But it's clear that they were regarded as a somewhat nonconforming use. There are people today who talk about what a good thing the industrial loan corporations are. None of them, however, seem to me to have shown the courage of their convictions, because those who believe that the industrial loan corporation should continue to flourish and grow, as will happen if we don't pass the bill, ought to be abolishing that restriction that says only six States can issue those charters. 
   I cannot think of any other financial instrument of which we have general approval where only six States are allowed to charter them. People who genuinely believe in the ILCs are the ones who ought to be pushing legislation. They do not. They implicitly accept the fact that they are an exception to a general principle. 
   The particular general principle to which they are an exception is the one which we have affirmed recently when we did the Gramm-Leach-Bliley bill, namely that banking and commerce should be separate. 
   Now, let me be very clear. If an entity that is in the manufacturing business or the retail business or any other business wants to get into financing its purchases, or even wants to lend money to people, they wouldn't be affected by this as long as they were willing to forgo deposit insurance. 
   We are here because if you become an official bank, as ILCs can be to this extent, you get various benefits from the Federal Government, including deposit insurance. So this is not the Federal  Government intruding on purely private business decisions, it is the Federal Government saying, look, we have set up the system of deposit insurance. We have set up other things that apply to banks. We want to restrict those services to entities which are only in the banking business. We do not want people who have as their primary business a manufacturer or wholesale or retail sales also dealing with banking. We think that is an unwise mixture. We think that the decisions that are made that we want to insure through the depository insurance system ought to be made purely on the banking aspects of this and not because the bank will make money on the side from where the purchase goes. 
   Now, people have asked, why this legislation now? The answer is that for a variety of reasons, I am not fully aware of why, this situation changed drastically in the last few years. 
   ILCs, as they exist today, are not a problem. No one is talking about abolishing them. In the State of Utah, where they are most important, and where there continues to be strong support for them, there is opposition to them even in some of the other States that have the right to charter them, the estimate we received from the Utah bank supervisor was that 93 percent of the assets of ILCs meet the test that we would apply here in this bill to everybody. 
   That test, by the way, is the one that we took out of Gramm-Leach-Bliley; namely, that to be in the banking business, you have to be at least 85 percent a financial institution, though we do recognize there will be some incidentals. Ninety-three percent of the Utah ILCs meet this. 
   The problem is over the last few years, a number of large manufacturing and commercial entities have decided that they would like to get into the ILC business. So people have said to us, why are you upsetting the status quo? We are not. Here, to be honest, we are preserving, we think, the status quo, which is the principle of the separation of banking, commerce, a banking system which exists under that rubric and a small niche for some banks which, for historical reasons, were allowed not necessarily to follow this. 
   What's changing the status quo is the application from a number of large entities, Wal-Mart, Home Depot, many others, to get into the ILC business. We believe that does not really reflect what Congress intended in the 1980s. It's not illegal under current law, but we think that Congress did not anticipate then that large commercial and manufacturing entities would seek substantially to broaden the ILC approach. 
   There were people who disagreed with us that we should preserve the distinction between banking and commerce. I asked them, where is that bill? 
   Again, those who would support by not changing the law a broad expansion of the ILCs are the ones who are seeking drastic change in our banking laws. They are, in effect, saying, you know, this distinction between banking and commerce you make is arbitrary, it has been outdated, let's get rid of it. 
   Well, the way to get rid of that is for people to bring forward a bill. I can promise them as chairman of the Financial Services Committee, we will have a hearing, we will consider it. But let them bring forward a bill, and let's do that as a conscious decision of the Congress of the United States. 
   I will oppose it, I think most Members will, which is probably why they don't want to bring it forward. But let's not do it in a kind of a back-door way by the expansion of what had been intended to be a residual niche kind of banking. This bill today would say that going forward, it doesn't wipe out existing entities, but going forward, ILC charters will only be granted to those that are at least 85 percent financial. 
   I want to give my thanks to the Chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission, Chairman Bair. They have been put in a tough situation, because the law theoretically allows them to create an infinite number of new ILCs with no respect whatsoever for the banking and commerce distinction. Once this House passed a bill on the subject, although it did not pass the Senate, a phrase one often hears, the FDIC at our request has imposed a moratorium on new ILC charters. 
   But the FDIC is a law-abiding organization. Chairwoman Bair has an appropriate understanding of the role of the regulatory body in a democratic system. She will not forever maintain a moratorium, nor should she. What she did was, quite appropriately, give Congress the chance to legislate. We are beginning that process today. 
   I hope that we will pass the bill, that it will go to the Senate and they will pass something, and we will be able to work out legislation which will essentially preserve the distinction between banking and commerce. The necessity for us to act now is that if we do not act, the status quo will be greatly transformed, and the distinction we have long maintained in our law between banking and commerce, instead of admitting a fairly small exception where six States can do it, and where even in the State where it is most prominent only 7 percent of the assets under this form are the exception, we will then see a general erosion. Erosion may understate it; a general abolition of the line between banking and commerce. We do not think that is appropriate, and passing this bill is the way to stop it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I now yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Matheson), a former member of our committee with whom many of us disagree but who, representing the State of Utah, has been a very staunch and articulate defender of a form of banking which is very important in his State.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. If the gentleman would yield to me, let me say, and I want to pay tribute to members of the staffs on both sides, Mr. Paese and Mr. Yi on my side here, who did a lot of negotiating. There are a lot of regulators involved here, the FDIC as the primary regulator, but the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Comptroller, and we did the best we could to try and not have this be a means of changing existing relationships. 
   So I can assure the gentleman from Alabama that he has precisely stated our intent. When we grandfathered these firms in this bill, it was our purpose and is our purpose to let them continue to operate the existing industrial banks under the limitations of the bill and under the supervision of each grandfathered firm's appropriate supervisory agency. 
   So I hope that would respond to the question. It is our intention essentially to ratify the existing arrangements by law, which would, of course, preclude the need for a waiver if the law is clear about what it does.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I just want to respond to my good friend from Utah. He made an interesting point which is, well, if these are terrible, why don't you abolish them? That, of course, becomes a Catch-22. I guarantee you that if we had proposed in fact to abolish or severely restrict existing ones, he would have been justifiably a lot less happy than he is today.     
   Congress made a decision. We don't always make the best decisions when we look back; we often make good decisions, but not perfect ones. We believe it would be unfair to undo what was originally done by law. 
   I would note again that even in the State of Utah, which has become the primary focal point for the industrial loan corporations, 93 percent of the entities functioning as industrial loan corporations in Utah would be unaffected by this bill. They would be able to expand because they meet the 85 percent financial test. 
   As to the others, we believe that it is those who have finally figured out the potential of the industrial loan corporation going forward who are trying to change things. People have said to us, well, there's been no problem. Why are you doing this? Well, for once, maybe not once, let's not be too self-denigratory, we're doing this to get ahead of the problem. Yes, that's precisely the case. The ILCs have not caused problems. It is the, I believe, overwhelming view of people here and people who have watched the banking business and who believe in the separation of banking and commerce that if we don't act, we will see some problems. So that is what we are doing here. And I hope that this bill passes with a large margin, and we can pretty soon engage with our colleagues in the Senate about putting a final product on the desk of the President. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   The gentlewoman from Illinois decided to get into another bill, the FHA bill, and made a couple of statements about it, one of which is inaccurate and one of which is incomplete. 
   The inaccurate one is to suggest that it has been held up because of the fact that we want to use some of the money that will be generated by the bill, by specifically removing the cap on home equity mortgages, for affordable housing. I understand her objection to our trying to spend some money for more affordable housing construction, but that is not what held up the bill. 
   We ran into a dispute between those people who do the home equity mortgage servicing and the AARP over the fees to be charged. We adopted an amendment; it was a bipartisan amendment. Our colleague from Georgia, Mr. Marshall, and the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Ginny Brown-Waite) offered an amendment, and that led to a dispute. I asked that the groups try to work this out, and they have done that, so we are now able to come to the floor with that bill. But we then ran out of time because of the appropriations process. But what held that bill up was that dispute over funding. 
   Secondly, the gentlewoman said we passed this very good bill last year. We passed a bill last year, and I voted for it because, with the other party then in control, we couldn't make it better. But here is the major difference between that bill and the bill we will bring forward regarding subprime. Under the bill we passed last year and under the position of the gentlewoman from Illinois, people with weaker credit who make all of their payments will be charged more. I think it is inappropriate for the Federal Government to do that. 
   The FHA, under the bill that was passed last year, would extend credit to borrowers with weaker credit, would guarantee their mortgages but charge them more. Under our bill, because we don't think that the Federal Government ought to charge people more if they are meeting their responsibilities, we cross-subsidize, and we say, if you have weaker credit, your initial payments will be higher. But if you make your payments for 5 years, you will get all of the money back, and I look forward to debating that difference. 
   I don't think we should be penalizing people, and I don't think people making $40,000 a year who are diligent in making their payments ought to pay more than us. 
   Mr. Speaker, on this resolution, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) who was the main sponsor of this important resolution.

   But I would hope that we can work in committee on the subprime. I would note, by the way, that 2 years ago, the current ranking member of the full committee was the chairman of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions, and he was pretty far along in conversations with my two colleagues from North Carolina, Mr. Watt and Mr. Miller. And frankly, I think if we had not been interfered with from above, we might have gotten a bill a couple of years ago, I think we can pick up where we left off. I am optimistic we can do a bill this fall.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership on this bill. 
   This legislation began last year when she was the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy, which you, Mr. Speaker, now chair, and in a bipartisan way we've brought forward this bill. 
   A brief history here. The administration, I think, made an error in granting authority to the company, Dubai Ports World, to take over seaports. They should have anticipated the reaction. 
   I think it was a mistake to let Dubai buy those ports and I'm glad that that was dropped, but I think there was an overreaction. Foreign direct investment is a very good thing for our country. It is a source of jobs. 
   I remember when I first came here in the early 1980s one of our major goals on the Democratic side, with a lot of Republican support, was to get more foreign direct investment. We had a bill we called the domestic content bill. It was to require that a certain percentage of each car sold in America be made in America, and the purpose of that was frankly to help get Japanese, at that time, automakers to come here. 
   People should understand foreign direct investment means we're talking direct investment as opposed to buying our bonds or buying financial instruments. It means putting money in here that creates jobs, and it ought to be something welcomed. In a few cases, there could be a problem, but the general rule should be that we welcome foreign direct investment. 
   Now, after the Dubai Ports and the reaction to it, concern grew in the rest of the world that we were not fully supportive of foreign direct investment, and there was this view that we had scared it away. I mention that because there are some who have incorrectly reported this bill, the CFIUS bill as we call it, the bill giving statutory reform to the Committee on Foreign Investments in the U.S., as an effort further to restrict foreign direct investment. That is the exact opposite of the truth. 
   We've worked very closely here, not just with the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Paulson, a great supporter of foreign direct investment, but also with the Financial Services Forum headed by the former Secretary of Commerce, Don Evans. He's been a real leader in this effort. 
   This is an effort by the Congress to make clear that we welcome foreign direct investment as a rule, but we will have procedures in place to prevent those exceptional examples where it might be problematic, where it might cause a security problem. 
   So I, again, want to stress this is the Congress of the United States reaffirming that foreign direct investment is a good thing for our economy, and it is our belief that the structure we have set up will help move things quickly. 
   By the way, Mr. Speaker, people won't be required to go through the CFIUS process, but they will be given assurance if they do that they can go forward. Now, that's very important  for people making investments. So this is a wholly supportive operation, and I thank the gentlewoman from New York and the gentlewoman from Ohio who have worked hard on this; the minority whip, the gentleman from Missouri, who is one of those who helped lead the fight for this. This is a genuine bipartisan bill. We passed it last year, and it's something that I know you will find it hard to believe, Mr. Speaker, after we passed the bill, somehow the United States Senate was unable to do that. I know that will cause some surprise to you, but there we are. 
   This year, it's different. We passed the bill, and the Senate under the leadership of the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, has passed a very similar bill, not identical, but they're close. I prefer in a few details what we have, but given the nature of the legislative process, we thought the best thing to do in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and with both parties was to accept the Senate version. 
   So this is accepting the Senate version, but we're accepting the Senate version of our version because what the Senate did was to make some fairly small changes in the bill that we adopted last year. 
   Now, with that, Mr. Speaker, I'm ready to yield. My understanding is that the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, who is concerned about this bill, wanted to raise a technical point. So I would ask the gentlewoman from New York if she would yield to the gentleman from Missouri for the purposes of his and I having a colloquy. 
   Mrs. MALONEY from New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my distinguished colleague, IKE SKELTON, as much time as he may consume.

I will work to accomplish a correction of this error, and I agree with the gentleman's statement of what the legislation intended and in the specific incidents that he cited.

   And while this technically falls in the jurisdiction of the Financial Services Committee, I am deviating from the script I was given to say that I think the besetting sin of this place is an excessive concern about turf. The people who put jurisdiction ahead of substance really should think better. 
   So I am delighted to be able to provide an example of intercommittee cooperation with my very good friend whom I admire, the gentleman from Missouri, and I will look forward to his correcting this error in that conference with the blessing, I believe, of our committee.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, we are about to see the great majority of Republicans deliver both orally and then, by their votes, a stunning vote of no confidence--but not in the automobile industry--in the Bush administration. 
   This is a bill that was brought forward in consultation with President Bush and his chief aides. The funding mechanism here is one that was insisted upon by the President. The amount of money and the source of the money complied entirely with the wishes of the Bush administration. 
   Now, one set of questions raised about this bill has to do with the administration of the TARP Program, once again, by the Bush administration. I believe that is too harsh. I believe we would have been worse off had we not passed that. Yes, I have some criticisms of it, but let's be very clear. This bill takes the Bush administration's proposal about how to fund this, and in turn gives to the Bush administration now, if it becomes law, significant power to begin the process of restructuring the automobile industry. 
   As I said, much of what we heard is a lack of confidence in this administration. Now, we were told that it's going to put a lot of taxpayer money at risk. My friend from California said don't pick winners and losers. 
   Well, may I ask then, Mr. Speaker, how we would characterize the decision to give well over $100 billion to AIG? Were they not a winner in this? If they were a loser, I should be such a loser at $100 billion. Six plus times as much money as being authorized here to be lent to the auto industries was lent to AIG. 
   Is there a certainty that the auto industry is going to pay it back? No, no more than there is with AIG. In fact, I think a little bit more. But AIG, that's not an industry, that's a company. That one company received over $100 billion. 
   I also disagree with those who would say, as apparently a Republican subgroup says, well, the way to deal with that is to take the wages that were bargained collectively over time by the unions in these three companies and drop them to some other level. I don't remember anybody saying, now, we have all agreed that CEO compensation and money for the top people should be restrained. 
   But the average worker at AIG makes more money than an auto worker. The average worker at Citigroup, the recipient, again, of a large amount of money, makes more than an auto worker. Does anybody remember Citigroup being told that as a condition of this money they have to get no more than a community banker would get? That may be a fair standard, but why is it only applied to blue-collar workers? Why is it that this insistence on leveling down the wages of people whose companies receive loan funds only applies to people who do this physical work? 
   I agree with the gentleman from California. There was a great reason to do the financial services bailout, because financial services are important, and I agree with him as well. That helps the auto industry. 
   People buy cars on credit. An occasional buyer will come into an auto sales room to buy a car with cash. He generally wants bulletproof windows and special getaway mechanisms. Most people are buying it on credit, and that's because, as we have said, not that they are too big to fail, but too interconnected. But so is the auto industry. The gentleman himself talked about the suppliers elsewhere. This is an industry that has an enormous nationwide impact. 
   But, finally, what are we doing here? We are lending them $15 billion. We are lending them $15 billion that is to be repaid, if by March 31 they haven't been able to persuade the new administration's appointee that they are making very fundamental changes. The bill says look for changes from the workers, but also from the bondholders and also from the suppliers and also from the dealers. 
   Let's not single out those who work with their hands as the only ones who might be accused of unjust enrichment, because they ain't rich. So that's the proposal, $15 billion if they can show that they are making these reductions. 
   By the way, we regret the fact that the President insists on taking money that we had set aside to help them become more innovative. We will replenish that. I think the Speaker deserves a great deal of credit for yielding in that way, but in a way that would protect this point. 
   But the $15 billion comes with super seniority or very serious collateral. On March 31, either this Congress will have to vote more money, there is no more automatic money, this Congress will vote more money, and we will have a chance to make changes in the bill if we think it's necessary, or we will have to repay the $15 billion with a great deal of seniority in debt preferable to any other debtor and with high collateral. Yes, we are acting quickly.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. We are in a crisis. They were having problems. Like a lot of other entities in America, including the job market in general and banks, the deterioration has been more rapid than anyone had anticipated. And, yes, they now face the potential of financial collapse more quickly than anticipated. 
   If we had known in September what we knew today, we could have begun acting back then. What we are doing is an interim measure. Fifteen billion dollars is a short-term fix, $15 billion that will be repaid. It's not the hundreds of billions that we talk about with Citigroup or the over $100 billion that we talk about with AIG, it's a lot of money, but it's money that will be repaid. It gives us a chance, particularly the new administration and this Congress to figure out what can be done. If by March 31 it is clear that  pessimism has prevailed and nothing can be done, we will get the $15 billion back. 
   But, finally, as to the rule, my understanding when I went up to testify before the Rules Committee, I was told there was one amendment that had been offered by the minority, and it has been made in order, and I plan to vote for it.

   I did want to comment briefly. The gentleman from Virginia, apparently, once again, no confidence in the President. The President is given the power, under this bill, to appoint someone with great power, and he says things need to be done in a few days and apparently doesn't trust George Bush to do it. 
   But the answer is that the bill does empower those restrictions to be any kind of compensation.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. The provision of the bill that gives the authority or the ability to veto any $100 million grade of investment or any $100 million impact decision includes the right to say ``no'' to a closure or to move the plant somewhere else, and it is primarily designed by us to ensure against the possibility that the taxpayer dollars being lent to them would be used to facilitate movement to other parts of the world where even the gentleman from California would agree that they would not be American.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, we consider this bill in a context, a context framed by the report last Friday of a massive loss of jobs in the American economy. This economy is in the worst shape that it has been in since the Great Depression. 
   We are facing a double hit, a credit crisis brought on by a variety of factors, but resulting now in a serious lack of confidence on the part of investors and a deterioration in the physical parts of the economy, which have combined to cause a serious, deep recession. 
   That is relevant because there have been suggestions that we could afford to allow the three domestically owned auto companies to founder, that there are other sources of automobiles, that they could be required to declare bankruptcy, to, therefore, not pay suppliers, to cut back substantially on money owed dealers, to reduce by large amounts the workforce and the compensation of the workforce, to take one of the major factors of the American economy and substantially reduce its economic impact. 
   I think that would have been a mistake in any economic period, but to contemplate the severity of that blow to our economic activity at this time is to invite further deterioration of an economy that has already deteriorated beyond what people expected and beyond what the American people ought to have to tolerate. 
   The bill is a limited bill. It is the product of a compromise, the terms of which were largely dictated by the President of the United States. I am struck, Mr. Speaker, by the lack of confidence that has been expressed on the Republican side of this House, not in the auto industry, but in George Bush and the people he has and will appoint. 
   The amount of money here, $15 billion, is a loan. It is a loan far more likely to be repaid than many of the much larger amounts that the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve, working with them, have advanced to Citigroup and AIG and the number of other entities. 
   It is $15 billion because the President said no new money, not even money from the $700 billion troubled assets fund, the TARP. This Congress voted a month or two ago, 2 months ago, to advance $25 billion to the auto industry to promote innovation, which everyone agrees is necessary. It wasn't just to the Big Three, it was to any applicant who was going to use this money to try to innovate. 
   The President said, to our dismay, he would veto any legislation trying to keep the auto industry out of bankruptcy that used any funds other than that $25 billion that had already been voted for that purpose. The Speaker, to her credit, resisted what I think was a strong temptation to engage in a dispute with the President that would have killed any effort to get legislation and instead, perhaps to his surprise, she agreed with him and said we would live with that constraint. 
   So the amount of money that is here is both in amount and, in short, exactly what George Bush wanted. This is an amount of money that George Bush told us we could make available. 
   We have made it available in a form that makes it overwhelmingly likely that it will be repaid. It is a loan with the American Government in a super senior position in terms of repayment and where there were some potential problems with that because of clauses in other agreements, heavy collateral. 
   So this $15 billion is very likely to be returned if the program fails. That's the worst case. 
   We will have advanced $15 billion, we will get it back in 3 months because disaster cannot be averted, but we are not willing to say that disaster cannot be averted without trying. 
   What this bill then says is the President of the United States, George Bush, shall designate an administration official to preside over a process of hard negotiation with all of those who have a share in this industry, the companies, of course, the bondholders, the workers, the suppliers and the auto dealers, and make it clear to them that if they are not willing and able to come together and reduce costs and put in place a program that makes it possible to envision a future in which more efficient cars are made and sold with a great likelihood of success, then not only will there be no more money than the $15 billion, but the $15 billion will have to be repaid. 
   Well, apparently my Republican colleagues, again, do not think that the Bush administration has within its ranks anyone capable, with all the help that they have been given, of beginning that process. Some have said, no, make them go bankrupt. 
   There is nothing about bankruptcy that cannot be accomplished within the framework we have said except the ability to unilaterally say ``no'' to this or that class of people who are owed money. All of the powers that you could accomplish in reorganization in a bankruptcy are given here, and the enforcement power is that the money will be withdrawn if this is not done and the entities will collapse.  
   We have provisions in here that make it impossible, if the Bush administration and then the Obama administration coming after them, say so to have money that was, in part, provided by the American taxpayer, used to finance activity in other countries. That doesn't mean American investors should never be in other countries. It does mean that taxpayer dollars made available in these circumstances shouldn't go to other countries. Then the question is, then, well, why the haste? We are hastily reacting to very fast-moving events. 
   A month ago it did not appear that the car companies would be in such dire straits. Car companies all over the world have been hurt by the credit crisis. Automobiles are paid for by credit. As credit has tightened up substantially, and as people have lost their jobs, there has been a greater than anticipated fall off in auto sales. Of course, the auto companies have made mistakes in the past, a lot of people in the industry have, including consumers. 
   But we find that the rapid deterioration in the general economy, it hasn't caused the problem for the automakers, but it has exacerbated them and greatly shortened our time horizon. 
   This bill is intended to keep them from going bankrupt between now and March 31. It does it in a way that will allow us to recapture the money if that effort fails. It does express the belief that, done properly, in conjunction with other things, things that could unstick the credit market, funds that we hope will be made available under the troubled assets program to auto dealers, who have a very real claim here, and we will be pushing for a program that will include them and funding be made available. Several Members of this House have spoken out strongly in favor of doing that. 
   We believe it is possible, and likely, that as the economy gets better, and as they continue the movements they have already made towards cars that are likely to sell and be more energy efficient, that we can survive this. 
   There are some Members who have consistently opposed any intervention, but this administration sent over $100 billion to AIG. Citigroup has been the recipient of very large amounts of money. I do not understand how people can have not made any effort to undo the administration's intervention with AIG, well over $100 billion, and then try and stop about one-seventh of that sum as a loan to the auto companies. 
   Yes, credit and finance are important, but the physical work done by working class and middle-class Americans in auto companies, in car dealerships, in the small businesses that are other suppliers, cumulatively, are just as important. To give up now on the auto industry would be to condemn the American economy at one of its most vulnerable periods in our economic history to a degree of further hurt, and the American people deserve better.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to note that I am surprised to hear my friend argue that the bankruptcy courts have more automotive expertise and engineering and finance and industrial policy expertise than is present in the whole Bush administration. I think he is too pessimistic about that and too much supportive of the bankruptcy process. 
   Second, I would also just recall the very thoughtful remark of our colleague from Texas, Ms. Jackson-Lee, who noted that those who thought bankruptcy was a disaster for mortgages appear to see it as a panacea for automobiles. Many of us fail to see how that transformation took place.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to say that my friend from Georgia apparently doesn't trust the auto companies to know what's in their own interest. He says that the provision in our bill that gives the administrator the ability to cancel a decision, which we have in there as protection against money being sent overseas, is way too interventionist, and instead, they'd be better off with bankruptcy. That's a choice they will be free to make under this bill. 
   This bill doesn't force anybody to apply for the money. Any company that thinks the provisions of this bill are too burdensome and too interventionist retains the full authority to run to bankruptcy.

   None of them want to make that choice, but if they do, this bill leaves them free to do it. It doesn't force them to take the money. They still have the joys of bankruptcy which the gentleman from Georgia explained to them.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I will take 30 seconds to say that my friend from Arizona says how can we assume that one bureaucrat would know more than the marketplace. Well, it's not harder to do that than to assume that one bankruptcy trustee would know more than the marketplace. Bankruptcy is a suspension of the marketplace. I am puzzled by this double standard here. Let's leave it to the market by appointing a bankruptcy trustee--a total abnegation of the concept of the market--and the appointment of a lawyer who is less likely, it seems to me, to have the expertise than the whole Bush administration might be able to find in industrial matters.

We would want an automobile manufacturer to be able to use any of its existing unfunded credit facilities as a source of liquidity.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I will now speak, and I will have one speaker after that. So when I'm through, it will be the turn of the gentleman from Texas to do his closing because I'm retaining one speaker after myself. 
   I yield myself 1 1/2 minutes. 
   Here is the dichotomy: Bankruptcy versus a piece of legislation which says to the administration--the incoming and outgoing--you do what you hope to accomplish in bankruptcy but with more flexibility, with a greater pool of people to call on. 
   We've heard mocked the notion that either this administration or the next would have within its ranks expertise in economics and industrial organization, and we're told, ``No, no. That doesn't work. Find a bankruptcy trustee.'' I think they get the worst part of that argument if they listen to it. 
   Beyond that, we have consumer marketing issues. The three companies are convinced--and almost every expert I talked to agrees with them--if they declare formal bankruptcy, their ability to sell cars is damaged. People buying cars want to know they will have a continuing relationship with an entity that will service the cars and make parts for the cars. 
   So this continuing longer term relationship makes bankruptcy far more of a problem for them than for an airline where your contingency was just to buy one seat and nothing further.  
   But again, the greatest illogic is to argue that somehow in the bankruptcy courts with a bankruptcy trustee, we were going to tie it to the lawyers. You get a far greater degree of expertise than either one of the two Presidential administrations could find within its ranks of economists and engineers and others. Therefore, we believe that our solution is the preferred one.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Well, I intend to use the 3 1/2 minutes to speak enthusiastically for this amendment now for a couple of reasons. 
   First, the merits of the amendment. We were told by the Treasury Department that they would get more lending done. Some people unfairly said that the bill we passed didn't have good oversight. It had a number of pieces of oversight, including the best oversight you can have in this Federal Government, the Government Accountability Office, an outstanding organization. 
   We worked with them, and they were there on the first day of this program. We had a briefing with them. They have given us a report, and the report said that Treasury was not doing a good job of seeing whether the people who received the capital injections were, in turn, lending. 
   We heard that anecdotally, we got a confirmation that Treasury wasn't measuring. What particularly distressed me was Treasury didn't say, well, you don't understand how hard it is. Treasury said, you are right, we are not going to try, that we will judge the overall success of the program without doing that. 
   Now, I will give Mr. Kashkari credit. Today, at a hearing we held--and we called a hearing just to deal with this  issue--he indicated they now do plan to do it. But I think given the initial reluctance, this amendment is very important. 
   For Members who voted for the TARP and want to see that vote vindicated, you need to vote for this amendment, because it makes it valid. But there is one other thing you have to do. Let me ask you another procedural question. This is the last train out of the legislative station this year. 
   So I would advise Members, if you believe that we need to put pressure on the Treasury to have the TARP do more lending, you have to do two things. You have to vote for the LaTourette amendment, but then you have to vote for the underlying bill. Because I would advise Members, if you vote for the LaTourette amendment, and you then vote against the bill, Mr. Speaker, I would caution Members going back to their districts and taking credit for having voted for an amendment into a vehicle which they then crashed into the sea. 
   So the only way the LaTourette amendment will have any effect, and I hope it will have effect because it's important, is if the bill to which it is about to be attached passes. 
   So I congratulate the gentleman on an extraordinary amendment. I am envious that I didn't think of this strategy to help get the bill passed, but I will acknowledge my strategic better in this case. That may sound ironic, but it's the case. 
   If you vote for the LaTourette amendment--which I think does a very important job of improving the TARP--and you then vote against this bill, you have completely and totally negated it. 
   Now you may, Mr. Speaker, have Members here who find it of value to be on both sides of this issue, to take credit for improving the TARP in theory, but disimproving it in practice, but I would hope that most of us would not want to be in that position. So I urge Members to vote for this, and having voted for this important thing, the gentleman is right, the gentleman from Ohio, he did put it in a separate bill. But that separate bill is not going anywhere. 
   There will be no further legislative work. So if you believe that we need to have the banks who have not been lending, and who have received part of the TARP, relend, vote for the amendment, and vote for the underlying bill.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, everybody wants to deal with the problem of the AMT, but only some of us are prepared to deal with it responsibly and realistically, namely, by an alternative revenue source. 
   You look at the taxes that are being reduced here and the offsetting taxes that are being raised, and it is the most extraordinary piece of tax fairness I have ever seen. 
   The one argument is that we can't afford that fairness because if we raise taxes to the normal level that people pay on income on the wealthiest people in the history of the world that they will stop doing what they do. Now, I do not criticize these people. I think they perform a useful economic function. But they are the wealthiest people in the country and in the history of the world on the whole. The notion that they have to pay somewhat more tax up to the level that most of us pay on income, they will somehow go on an economic strike and stop doing these things is badly flawed. 
   They are not engaging in this activity as a favor to us so that they can quit if we offend them. They are doing it because it's a way for them to make money, as they have a right to do. They'll still be making enough money to keep doing it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I begin, appropriate to this bill, on a note of bipartisanship. My counterpart on the Financial Services Committee said we must reduce spending, and I agree. And we will have a chance this year to reduce the most wasteful drain on our economy imaginable, the war in Iraq, $100 billion a year, far more than the excess in any other program. So I hope the American people this year will heed his view and we will put in place a policy that will save us $1 trillion over the next 10 years if the wishes of some to stay in Iraq are maintained. 
   Secondly, let me reinforce what the chairman said. It was in late November of last year that Speaker Pelosi urged us to begin thinking about the economy and called together a group of economists, labor leaders, and business leaders. And she took the lead and more than anyone else is responsible for the fact that we are confounding the cynics by acting so quickly and responsibly today. 
   Lastly, on the housing piece. What we have is a private housing market that has gotten itself into a terrible jam. And part of this bill is to use public and quasi-public entities, entities created by the Federal Government, to go to the aid of the private market. The private market has stopped making loans for houses above a certain level because of, as my friend from Alabama said, a lack of confidence. What we do today is to empower the Federal agency, the FHA, to help untangle that with a higher loan limit. And those two creations of the Congress, quasi-public/private Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we here today send the public sector to the rescue of a mortgage market at the upper end that can't function on its own. 
   But let me say this: there has been an argument that we should not have done that without further structural reform in those two entities. I have agreed to those limits and, in fact, pushed for them being raised now because we're in an economic crisis and we need a short-term response. 
   But I am committed, and I know my friend from Alabama joins me in this, we will not agree to any further extension of those loan limits after the expiration date of December of this year unless we are able to accompany them with structural reform. And let me say, I see my friend nodding, that's our commitment. 
   So we are committed. And the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and I and Members are now talking about the FHA bill. We will not, and let me give this commitment, we will not bring out of our committee an increase in the time at which the jumbo loans can be paid for until we have comprehensive reform. 
   Given that, we have here a reasonable package. We get money out, thanks to the Speaker's insistence on this bipartisan framework, to precisely the people who will spend it, which is what we need now. And we send the FHA and Fannie and Freddie in a responsible way to the aid of the private market because private sector-public sector cooperation is the foundation of our economy.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I thank the gentlewoman, not so much for yielding but for the really extraordinary work she has done on this, the gentlewoman from California, and I want to say how much I admire the two tracks she has worked on. On the one track, she has been one of the leaders on our side in the House on the issue of Iraq and ending our involvement in the war in Iraq where I am a strong follower of her. 
   Simultaneously, she has engaged in some very careful and thoughtful legislative work, and I think that is the mark of a complete legislator, to be able to do the ideologically based advocacy but also work in a bipartisan way, continuing work which began when she was the ranking member and in a seamless way to go forward. 
   I spoke during the rule where I expressed my strong support for the legislation. I have rarely seen legislation so broadly supported by the landlords, by the local housing authorities that administer it and by the beneficiaries. There is a three-way operation here, and all of them consider this bill to be an improvement. 
   As the gentlewoman from Illinois said, it does not improve everything as much as everybody would like; nothing ever does. But she is correct, this is an improvement. I would ask my friend from California to yield to her so we can talk about it, but she has already done some of the things that she talked about. For instance, in the manager's amendment, we will increase the reserves available to housing authorities to avoid any damage that would come in the transition on the new funding formula. I know the gentlewoman has some other concerns, and I hope if the gentlewoman from California will yield to her, I can respond to them.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. The answer here is definitely yes. I think a hold-harmless provision is appropriate. 
   The purpose of the change, as the gentlewoman knows, in our mind was to prevent a kind of downward ratcheting in the overall usage. But consistent with that, we don't want to penalize particular authorities. 
   We have already done some work, for instance, with the Dade County authority to take into account the fact that their shortfall came because of a hurricane, so they were not penalized by that. But the hold-harmless provision is a perfectly reasonable one, and I agree with the gentlewoman. I promise to work with the gentlewoman to do whatever we need to do legislatively to accomplish it.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from California is absolutely correct. The alternative interpretation would make no sense. 
   Of course, HUD should have and does have the authority to select replacements. What we set was a maximum number of participating agencies, and if an agency withdraws, then a new agency should be replaced. 
   If I may, I should note that the chairman of the subcommittee, who is such a devoted supporter of fairness, has raised some questions about the Moving to Work program, or whatever the new name is, and I have spoken with her. And I think what would be appropriate, and I think we would all agree, when we return from the summer recess to have a hearing on how the Moving to Work program is, in fact, operating, and I think that would be an appropriate thing to do. 
   But certainly under this law and under the agreements we reached, we set a number of housing authorities that are eligible to participate, and there shouldn't be any question, if an authority drops out, then HUD has the obligation, not just the permission, but the obligation to replace it.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I thank the gentleman from California. 
   I appreciate the gentleman from California making this very important point because it gives us a chance to highlight an important issue that this committee will be acting on. 
   I should just note that later today we will be considering an amendment on behalf of the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey) and the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Pryce) in similar circumstances, and we will be directing HUD to allow these to go forward. 
   The gentleman just learned of this, I know, and brought it to our attention, and I would begin by saying to him, if necessary, I would be supportive of doing the same in his case. I hope it won't be necessary. 
   Here's the situation that may people may not understand. Forty years ago and more, or about 40 years ago, we began, not us, with the exception of Mr. Dingell, began a program of affordable housing where the Federal Government lent people money at either no interest or very low interest in return for it being affordable, but for some reason they put what they called an expiration date of 40 years. 
   Now, we stand to lose a lot of housing that is good housing currently affordable. We are looking for ways to let that be transferred to others who would keep that it way. I think HUD is being overly technical in some of these interpretations. It would clearly be in everybody's interest, for no budgetary cost we can preserve these units. 
   By the way, if the units are lost, what then happens is, under certain laws, the current tenants are entitled to enhanced vouchers. So we would then be paying more in enhanced vouchers to a new landlord. That doesn't make sense. 
   I just want to make this commitment to the gentleman. I hope after today's bill, which I hope it passes and the amendments for Mr. Markey and Ms. Pryce are passed, that we can then sit with HUD on a bipartisan basis and try and find a way for them to do this administratively. If they tell us that they need a small fix, if there's some legislative problem, we could do that on suspension immediately. Even the Senate would do that one quickly. 
   I would say this. I hope that we will, today, get HUD's attention so that we can sit with them and work this out. I would rather have it done in policy. If necessary, we'll do a little fix. 
   And I would also say before the end of this year, and this is high on the agenda of the gentlewoman from California and myself, because this situation occurs all over the country in everybody's district or in most districts, if necessary, we will pass a bill that will give HUD all the authority necessary to prevent this loss of affordable housing for no good reason. 
   So I admire the gentleman for bringing it to our attention. I think, frankly, if we pass this bill and pass the Markey-Pryce amendment, we'll probably get a better response out of HUD, and if necessary, we will legislate it.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I thank the gentlewoman. 
   Mr. Chairman, again, I want to emphasize, this is a process that began when the Republicans were in power, when Mr. Ney was the chairman. 
   The gentlewoman from California was the ranking minority member and has continued in her chairmanship. The gentlewoman from Illinois is the ranking member. This is an example of how you can make something better and deliver better, with one exception, there is no additional money in this bill. 
   I hope that we will succeed in authorizing 20,000 new vouchers. That's an issue we will debate, although it is subject to appropriation, as to whether or not it gets done. I think our appropriator friends would like to do it. 
   But most of what this does is to improve the delivery. We talk about it a lot. It isn't always done. And in that context, we often thank the staff. 
   This is a case where the staff of the Financial Services Committee and subcommittee on both sides, we already did a great deal of work; this is a more technical bill than many that have come forward. 
   This is a less than ideological breakthrough. We hope to have some of those. We have had in the past. It's more a systemic examination of a very large program with improvements of a technical and specific sort in many aspects of it. It took a good deal of hard work, and it took a good deal of mutual cooperation. 
   As I said, there were some differences, and we will debate those differences, but it should be made clear that those differences come within a context of a broad agreement on making the program better. 
   There is a lot of talk about waste and fraud and abuse. Waste and fraud and abuse are more generally decried around here than diminished. This is a bill that will make it much less likely that money will be wasted, much less likely that there will be an abuse of the public purse. As I said, let me say in closing, it is to the credit of the gentlewoman from California, the gentlewoman from Illinois, and the people who have worked with them. 
   Every stakeholder is a supporter of this bill, the landlords, the tenants, the advocacy groups, the housing authorities that administer it. It is rare that you get this degree of agreement. It's a process that began with civil conversation. I am pleased to see, at least on this night, it's going to end with a civil conversation, and the product will be significant improvements in one of the most important social programs in the Federal Government.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. The gentleman has given a very clear statement of what is in here. This bill does not create the bilingual mandate; it puts it where it should be. 
   The other thing I would say is this, and I understand there are some who oppose it on principle. But from the court's standpoint, having HUD do the translation of all these documents means that they don't have to be done individually. So it also is cheaper for HUD to do. It is not just that it is more appropriate for the Federal Government to do it, but it is cheaper, because there will be some basic HUD documents so this will avoid the unnecessary duplication of translations. And I thank the gentleman for that very clear way he stated it.

   First, Madam Chair, in the interest of conciliation that has marked this debate, I would say to my friend from California, I would be willing to accept this amendment that puts a time limit on people being able to stay in section 8 if we could work out a time limit on their being poor. I think it is entirely accurate that when you're no longer poor, you should no longer be able to live in section 8. But what if we can't? 
   I can understand people who think that there are adults who have not been very responsible in their life choices, but some of the adults come with children. The gentleman exempts the disabled and the elderly, but his amendment does not exempt families with small children. So you have a parent with children.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Yes, not exceeding more than 20 percent of the families. It doesn't single out children. Well, maybe there will be 30 or 40 percent, because in my experience, it may differ, you say make an exception for a hardship. That's not the exception for people in section 8; it's the rule. There aren't a lot of rich people living in section 8 or middle income people. 
   The fact is that under the gentleman's amendment, if adopted, there will be single parents with children of 7 or 8 or 10 years old, several of them, and at the end of 5 years, they'll have to move. Those kids didn't do anything to anybody. 
   And you know what we've learned from education and from homelessness, 7 years, the gentleman tells me. He does give them 7 years. It's very biblical. But they'll still have to move after 7 years. 
   Churning poor people isn't useful. Making people move isn't useful. We've adopted some rules here. The gentleman knows we agreed with him that we should not charge them for more rent if they're making more money. We don't want to have a disincentive. We've done other things to improve it. 
   But here's a fundamental point. People in section 8 housing are there because they meet strict income criteria. Under the gentleman's amendment, someone who continues to be poor, who continues to meet the income criteria, who has lived up to every rule, who has small children, who has tried diligently to get a better job, but in many parts of this country, by the way, we're talking about working people. There are many people who can work full-time at twice the minimum wage and not be able to afford rental housing in his district or in parts of my district or in other districts, the gentlewoman from California's district. And they'd be evicted. They'd be evicted from housing that they were eligible for, for no reason other than the clock. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Madam Chairman, I would say to my friend from California, work on that in a future amendment and we will look at it. 
   But I want to address the gentleman from Ohio. He says he wants to help these people and save them. Boy, would they be in trouble if somebody came to hurt them. He is going to help them by evicting them when they remain economically eligible. And he says it is encouraging dependence. 
   In fact, in many parts of this country, you can be making two and three times the minimum wage and not be able to afford decent rental housing, and that is who gets the section 8. 
   And then he says that section 8 housing is so terrible that we have to keep people from having to live there. But does the gentleman think that there are people who say, ``You know what? I can live in a nice place or I can live in a lousy place. I think I'll choose a lousy place until the gentleman from Ohio comes along and rescues me from it''? 
   People live in the best place available to them, and throwing them out of the place they now live in when they have done nothing wrong because you don't think it is good enough for them when there is no alternative that is as good is hardly helping them. 
   The section 8 program is one that serves many people who work. It is a sliding scale of subsidy, and to say that it encourages dependency totally misunderstands the program. Many of these people are people who are working and they work at low-wage jobs in areas with high rent. How are you encouraging dependency by telling them and their children that after 7 years they go out? What kind of an incentive is that? 
   So, Madam Chairman, this amendment takes people who have already been in some economic difficulty and makes their lives harder. I hope that it is rejected. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Gary G. Miller). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Madam Chairman, I thank my friend and colleague for yielding. 
   And I want to say, as I said to the gentleman from California (Mr. Campbell), people are saying why are you making this exception. We are making this exception because we think this ought to be the rule. And we are dealing with this now because we have time problems in this area and in the area of the gentlewoman from Ohio. But it is our intention to pass legislation before the end of the year, I think on a bipartisan basis, that will make this a rule for the whole country. So this is not singling out any one area except for the fact that we face time restraints, as the gentleman from California did and the gentleman from Ohio did. 
   So I want to thank my friend for bringing this forward. And I want to make it clear this is the first step of what we believe will be a general policy of preserving affordable housing.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, this bill has two parts. 
   One part is to reiterate what is already the law. It is already the law that only people who are in the country legally may benefit from this. The second part is how to enforce it, and what it does is to continue an unfortunate tendency that goes counter to everything we have tried to do about privacy, of making the Social Security card a universal identifier, and there are real dangers in that. 
   Members who have been concerned with privacy know that an unreasonable and unrestricted use of the Social Security card is a problem. Indeed, we have talked about legislation, bipartisan, to restrict the requirement that you give your Social Security number. But here is what this bill says. It does not change the law. It's already illegal for people who are not here legally to get these benefits. 
   The gentleman mentioned 26,000 FHA loans in Colorado, zero section 8s. I haven't heard the evidence. I would be glad to listen to it. I will invite people, if there is evidence that this is a problem with section 8, let's listen to it. But here's what you impose on the housing authorities. There is now a requirement that people show that they are here legally. But now in this legislation, if it's adopted, would narrow that. 
   So here is what you would have to take to get someone who wanted to get into section 8: 
   They could show you their passport. The number of really poor people carrying passports is less than you might imagine. Although, I don't know what they might imagine, so I take that back. 
   Or a USCIS photo identification card. Well, if you are a citizen born in the United States, you don't have one. 
   Or a driver's license. You may not have a driver's license. 
   So if you are an 82 year-old who doesn't travel a lot to foreign countries and you are an American citizen, what are you going to show them? Your Social Security card. What this does is put more legal emphasis behind that. 
   I would say to Members, Members can vote as they wish. But the next time people complain to you about privacy problems and about Social Security numbers floating around being misused, if you voted for this, say, yes, I helped, because that's what this does. 
   The only thing this adds to American law is a requirement that most people trying to get section 8s will have to show their Social Security card, because a lot of them won't have driver's licenses, and they won't have passports. If they are American citizens, they won't have that card. The most common form of identification required will be the Social Security card. 
   I have been working, the people in the Energy and Commerce Committee, the people in the Ways and Means Committee, we have all been working to restrict the idea that the Social Security card is an ID card. I thought that was fairly generally accepted, that we don't want the Social Security card to be the ID card. 
   What's the Federal Government saying here? Because, yes, you can say,  well, who wants to steal the identification of a poor person? You know, being up against a section 8, no big deal. But once the Federal Government, the minority has been consistently arguing, once we have stated the Social Security card is the most universally accepted, the Social Security card is considered to be the best form of identification, then what's the argument against every business in America doing it? How do you stop this from becoming that universal identifier? 
   Members can cover themselves by voting for something that's already in the law. It's time to cover yourself anyway; it's kind of late. 
   But understand what Members will be doing. They will be furthering the practice of using the Social Security card as an identifier. They will be weakening our efforts to undercut. 
   Members may be unhappy to understand the implications of what they are doing. But I do not think it is wise for this House to continue a pattern of saying that the Social Security card will not just be a means of checking for Social Security but will become the universal identifier, that people will have to show it. Because if we, the Federal Government, say you have to show it, then how do you tell the hotel that they can't say it? How do you tell anybody else that they can't require the production of Social Security cards? 
   The logical consequence of this will be a serious impediment to our efforts to protect privacy and to deal with identity theft. The unrestricted use of the Social Security card is a serious problem there, and this makes it worse.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman. I thank my colleague from Florida for the generous words about the procedure. There were some differences between us on the parties on this, but in general, this represents a consensus. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, I want to give credit where credit is due. This is a result of a process that was begun by our former colleague from Ohio, Mr. NEY.     
   He convened when he was Chair of the Housing Subcommittee a set of roundtable discussions with participation from HUD, from tenant groups, from landlord groups that participate, and from others. And much of what is in this bill came out of the sessions that he and his then ranking member, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters), now the Chair of the subcommittee, did. 
   So as is always the case in a parliamentary body, we will, as is appropriate, focus to some extent on some differences. And there are several amendments that will present sharp differences, but people ought to keep in mind that it is in the context of a great deal of agreement. 
   In addition to the agreements already there, I have had conversations with several of the Republican Members, the gentleman from California (Mr. Gary G. Miller); the gentleman from California (Mr. Campbell); the ranking member of the subcommittee, the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert). We have some agreements about what we should be doing, how this should be interpreted, what we should be doing going further, and I look forward in the general debate to colloquies with all of them so that I think we can further solidify the agreements that we have going forward. 
   Now, as to the substance of the bill, the section 8 program is a very important one. Many of us believe that the problem has been not with the section 8 program but that it stood alone, that it was not accompanied by programs that would build housing. And in other pieces of legislation that have come out of the Financial Services Committee, some of which have come to the floor, some of which are about to come to the floor, we are going to try to add a supply side, if I may borrow the phrase, to the demand side. 
   We have a program here which increases the demand for housing by putting money in the hands of people who otherwise would not be able to afford decent housing. But if all you do is that and you don't also help build housing, you can have an adverse impact on price. So we hope to be able to balance it, but that is not the fault of this program. 
   What this bill does is to make it more flexible. It has much in there that HUD agrees with; although, again, I don't claim that everybody agrees with everything. An indication of the extent to which this simply improves the program, I will include in the Record several letters on this subject. One letter comes from those who are the landlords, who rent. 
   And, by the way, we are not automatically doing them a favor. In a tight rental market, as we have in many parts of this country, it is a good thing for the public purpose that landlords are willing to participate. Many of these landlords, they don't have to be in the section 8 program, so we try to reach out to them. And here is a letter endorsing the bill from the Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, the Institute of Real Estate Management, the National Affordable Housing Management Association, the National Apartment Association, the National Association of Home Builders, the National Leased Housing Association, and the National Multi Housing Council. 
   We also have strong support from those in the public sector at the local level who administer this: the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials and the Council of Large Public Housing Agencies. And then we have also a letter from a large coalition of advocacy groups, of religious groups that are in the business of building the housing. There is a very broad degree of support for this bill. 
   I understand there are a couple of points of difference, and I realize, too, there are some points of difference that couldn't have been presented. I would have liked them to be. But I think that the three amendments that are in order on the Republican side do present some of the most important differences. 
   I should note, by the way, that while three amendments reflect the disagreement that many in the minority have with the bill, two of the other amendments are really bipartisan. The manager's amendment is an amendment in which the gentleman from Illinois and the gentlewoman from California collaborated. 
   So the manager's amendment, one of the six amendments, it is designated as the Waters amendment, but it is very bipartisan. And the second one that is bipartisan is an amendment that deals with situations that threaten the ability of people to stay in affordable housing in the district my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey) and our colleague from the committee from Ohio (Ms. Pryce). 
   So we have two amendments which are completely bipartisan. We have those three. And then the one that the gentlewoman from New York will offer on domestic violence, which I don't think is terribly controversial. 
   So I understand that we haven't resolved all the differences. I do think that, and let me put it this way, of all the housing bills that have come to the floor from this committee, this is the  least controversial. I don't want anyone to get bored. When we come back in early September, we can fight again. But I do think on this one, while there will be some disagreements, what we reflect is a basic consensus on how to improve an important social program that, as I said, began under Republican leadership in the last Congress and we have largely continued the process. 
   I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I thank the gentlewoman. 
   Mr. Speaker, we confront here one of those moments in which there is a certain degree of confusion, and we are here, in substantial part, today at the urgent request of the Bush administration. 
   This package has several pieces. Three of them, in fact, are urgent requests of the Bush administration, and indeed, the Bush administration does have a criticism to make of the pace with which we are doing this. They think it is too slow. 
   Well, Members on the other side, some of them have complained that we're moving too rapidly. The Secretary of the Treasury has been a little frustrated that we were moving so  slowly. Clearly, we have here an example of the classic situation in which the right hand does not know what the far right hand is doing. 
   We are dealing today with legislation that has, with one exception, already passed this House. As to the ability to amend and debate, one of the high priorities of this administration has been significantly increasing the regulatory structure for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal home loan banks. This House passed it last April of 2007. It was very much debated in committee, and it came to the floor of the House with many amendments. Well, that piece has already been debated on the floor of the House and amended, subject to a fairly open rule, not totally open. 
   We have the modernization of the Federal Housing Administration, another high priority of the Bush administration. Several months ago, the head of the FHA, the Bush appointee, Mr. Montgomery, the head of the FHA lamented the fact that we hadn't acted. Despite that, the senior Republican on the Financial Services Committee sent me a letter last week saying don't act on it. So we have the head of the FHA a couple of months ago complaining that we had not acted on this urgent administration priority, and then I get a letter from the senior Republican of this committee saying don't do that piece, leave that piece out. He talks about doing only 1 piece, that one's left out. 
   So we have the administration's request for GSE reform, already voted on and debated last year; FHA modernization, already voted on and debated by the House. This is a re-passage to accommodate, frankly, some of the problems we've had with the Senate. 
   We did have the FHA rescue plan that was voted on on the floor of the House, and that one was not amendable, and I acknowledge that. 
   All of the things I've talked about, by the way, these three pieces that have already been voted on, all passed the House by very large majorities. All had significant Republican support. All were fully debated in committee and amendments offered. This is a repackaging. 
   Now, the gentleman who preceded me said what are we afraid of. I guess I do have a certain fear of being caught in this Republican crossfire, with the administration telling us move more quickly and the Republican members of the committee saying how dare you move so quickly; and the Secretary of the Treasury saying we'll have confidence undermined in the market, and the Republicans saying we didn't have enough time to read the bill. 
   Again, almost everything in here has previously been debated in committee and voted on on the floor of the House. There's one new element, and I agree that did not go to committee. We didn't have a public hearing on it. The Secretary of the Treasury asked us not to have a public hearing, said he thought it would be damaging to the market if we had a public hearing. We have had a week and a half to talk about it, to discuss it, including in informal ways, and I've been open to discuss it with anyone who wanted to. But the Secretary of the Treasury did say that he thought the hearing would be a problem. 
   So what are we afraid of? Well, I had a certain fear of rebuffing the Secretary of the Treasury, President Bush's appointee, on the matter that he thought was so important as to how we handled it. So that's why we are here. 
   This is a balanced bill that includes a significant increase in the reform of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It does give to the administration the ability to make some loans to them or maybe buy shares with an instruction that they protect the taxpayer with various mechanisms and with a requirement that the compensation of the CEOs and the top officials of those agencies be strictly regulated.     
   But it doesn't do that in isolation. It does it only as part of a bill which significantly tightens the increase, that tightens and increases the regulatory structure.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. So just to summarize, this bill again responds to an urgent request by the Bush administration that we enacted in April, we passed it in the House in April. We tried to put it in the stimulus. The administration said not yet. That's already been voted on and debated. 
   It has the FHA modernization that's been voted on and debated. It has the FHA rescue plan, voted on and debated. All of those have already been in the bill, and three of these pieces in this bill are urgent requests of the Bush administration. 
   It does do some things for affordable housing, and I understand that many on the other side are ideologically opposed to that. But they were ideologically opposed to it when we debated it on the floor. And on the affordable housing trust fund, we have already voted about 10 times on the floor of the House.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I recognize myself for such time as I may consume. 
   Let me concur with the remarks of the gentleman from Louisiana. I don't like everything in this bill either. It is inconceivable to me that anybody would like everything in this bill, because it is the product of a very significant set of compromises. To some extent, frankly, the challenges the Congress faced and the administration faced in dealing with the housing crisis--remember, we are here in substantial part because of a terrible housing crisis that has affected the economy of the U.S. and the world. We are dealing with the consequences of bad decisions and inaction and malfeasance from years before. 
   Obviously it requires a joint effort. To some extent, this is a test of our ability as a self-governing people to govern. Because if everybody held off and said I am only going to support a bill with which I am in complete agreement, we would not be able effectively to respond to this crisis. 
   So I appreciate the President's policy statement saying I don't like everything in this bill, but I'm going to sign it and you should pass it quickly. I think that's true of all of us who have looked at this. 
   Now I do want to refute some of the myths. One, we heard reference to a $300 billion program. My colleague, the ranking member, sent out a Dear Colleague letter that said the part of the bill that tries to avoid mortgage foreclosure is a $300 billion program. In fact, it's a $1.7 billion program, according to CBO. 
   Yes, it's $300 billion, $300 billion is the total amount of mortgages that could be insured. It would cost $300 billion only if no one who had one of those mortgages ever made a payment of a penny and the houses were worth nothing. Obviously it's not a $300 billion program. That's why CBO said our version was $1.7 billion.  
   We also heard from some of the Republicans that it is a $5 trillion program. What they call a $5 trillion program, the stand-by authority that the President has asked us to give the Secretary of the Treasury, the Congressional Budget Office says is a $25 billion program but probably won't be spent. 
   So I think we need to understand conservative Republican arithmetic. It is the most inflationary arithmetic I ever heard. $1.7 billion of CBO becomes $300 billion. $25 billion from CBO becomes $5 trillion. I hope it will be very clear to people that these numbers that are being thrown around are simply inaccurate and misleading. 
   I also want to talk now to some of my friends on the left and others who have, I think, been misrepresenting what we are doing with regard to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac giving stand-by authority, saying this is bailing out the corporations, that this is welfare for the rich. 
   Let me read the list of people, organizations, who have specifically endorsed what this bill does with regard to stand-by authority to keep Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from collapsing: 
   The Consumer Federation of America, the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the Leadership Conference on Legal Rights, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, the National Association of Consumer Advocates, the National Council of La Raza, the National Urban League, the National Fair Housing Alliance, the National Low Income Housing Coalition. 
   Mr. Speaker, apparently there has been some infiltration. Apparently the corporate welfare advocates have taken over all the liberal organizations in America. We will probably have to investigate that, because all of the organizations with which I have worked for 28 years, who are the effective advocates for low-income housing, say pass this bill, please, and please specifically help Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.     
   So the amount of misinformation here is enormous. 
   Finally, I want to address the question of procedure. Everything in this bill, with the exception of the emergency request from the President for stand-by authority for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, has been fully debated in the Financial Services Committee and voted on and debated on the floor of this House. 
   We are repackaging a number of things. Sometimes it takes our friends in the Senate two, three and four tries to get something done, so we keep serving the ball to them. Everything in this bill, with the exception of the emergency stand-by authority, has been thoroughly debated and voted on the floor of the House, and no part of it got less than 260 votes. So we're hardly rushing through things for the first time.  
   July 17, 2008.  
   Statement on Recent Federal Action To Provide Stand-by Support to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 
   The undersigned consumer, civil rights and fair housing organizations commend U.S. Treasury Secretary Paulson, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Bernanke and leaders of the Senate Banking and House Financial Services Committees, for acting quickly to provide for stand-by support to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government sponsored housing enterprises (or GSEs). This support reaffirms the importance of the two companies in providing liquidity and stability to the housing market during this tumultuous period.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   I welcome the evolution in the gentleman's thinking. A week ago he sent me a letter saying we should not do the FHA modernization, so he has apparently expanded that, and I appreciate that. 
   There is one other myth, though, that I forgot to refute that he trotted out, namely, that this is going to force the FHA to take bad loans. That could not be further from the truth. This bill explicitly leaves the FHA in complete control of the decision to guarantee a loan or not. Nothing in this bill coerces the FHA. The lenders, to be eligible, would have to write down the loan by a significant percentage. An independent decision is then made by the FHA as to whether or not they want to guarantee it. 
   I now yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California, a major author of important parts of this bill.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 45 seconds to say that the gentleman from Alabama suggested that I was misrepresenting his letter. Here is the last paragraph: There is need for expedited legislation, and that action is a basic GSE reform bill that can be drafted, and taken to the floor with minimal preparation, since we have had hearings, not FHA modernization and not a tap standby authority. That's what he asked for a week ago, only GSE reform and not anything else. 
   Secondly, the minority leader has understated the administration's position. I'm sure that he wants to be accurate. They are not simply saying the President would sign the bill, the statement of administration policy urges the House to pass it expeditiously. So they are not simply going to sign it, they want us to pass it expeditiously. I know the minority leader wouldn't want to understate the position of the administration. 
   I now yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Marshall).

Nothing in this title changes existing Federal law with respect to the authority of the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's preemptive authority, and their right to regulate and oversee a depository institution's products and services marketing and distribution system, and they do obviously have definitional authority under this legislation.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. I now yield 1 1/2 minutes to the Chair of the Small Business Committee and a member of our committee, the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Vel&#225;zquez). 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Frank, Ms. Waters and the members of the minority who have worked in this important bipartisan bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, right now, this country needs swift effective action, and this legislation will do just that. Neighborhoods across the Nation are feeling the effects the growing number of abandoned and foreclosed properties. In my district alone, there are almost 700 homes in foreclosure. Home owners, even in strong housing markets, are watching their financial security disappear. What was once a robust growing market is now at the core of the current economic downturn. 
   H.R. 3221 will help reverse this, stabilize neighborhoods, and convert foreclosed properties into stable rental and home ownership opportunities for working families. 
   Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, it protects a basic need for millions of Americans, affordable housing. With the magnitude of the housing crisis and number of people struggling to keep their homes, the time to act is now. 
   When a family goes into foreclosure, they lose their economic stability and strain our already struggling economy. H.R. 3221 will restore investor confidence in the housing finance market while securing the American dream for working families. It not only addresses the immediate needs but installs safeguards so we can prevent a future housing downturn.     
   While access is essential, equally critical to the housing recovery is the ability of sound mortgages.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. All the debates I've heard about civil litigation have been concerned that plaintiffs' lawyers would initiate lawsuits. We're talking here, as the gentleman well knows, about citizens who are finding themselves as defendants in foreclosures, and I can't imagine that people meant to exclude the ability of lawyers to defend people when we've got a record of some of these foreclosure packages being abusive. 
   So I would agree with the gentleman, and if necessary, I would hope we could make that very clear that defending someone who's being foreclosed upon, when there have been inappropriate practices isn't what has generally been meant here by a stopping the initiation of civil litigation.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. We were able to postpone the deadline there of October 1. There is also an issue on risk-based pricing. I believe we will have both of those resolved in a more flexible way before October 1 so that seller financing and risk-based financing, appropriately done, will not go out of existence.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. The resemblance between reality and the rhetoric from New Jersey is even thinner at this point than it usually is. In fact, in 2003 and earlier, many of us were trying to do some reforms. 
   In 2005, I supported Michael Oxley, the former chairman of the committee and others, in enacting reform. The fact is very clear--Republican rule for 12 years, no Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac reform. We took office, and 3 months after the Democrats became the majority, the Financial Services Committee, under the Democrats, and this House, passed a bill that increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to the satisfaction of this administration. Twelve years of inaction under the Republicans, in 3 months----

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. No. 
   In 3 months we did it in the House, and it took the Senate, and there was, unfortunately, obstruction from Senate Republicans, but it finally got done. 
   Secondly, we have the myth of the $5 trillion, the silliest single misleading statistic I have ever heard. $5 trillion is the total value of mortgages held by people insured by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The gentleman from Texas said this could reach $5 trillion. It will reach the sky on a broomstick before that.

   Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. No. I ask the gentleman to stop harassing me. He had his time. I would like to conclude. We had equal time here. 
   The $5 trillion means that--in the first place, nothing in this bill assumes any responsibility for any of those mortgages. Zero. It is stand-by authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to make the loans. 
   As the gentleman from New Jersey acknowledged, the CBO said this might cost $25 billion. It will probably cost nothing. It might cost $25 billion. How did $25 billion become $5 trillion? By fantasy. In fact, what you have is if every single mortgage held by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were to pay zero, then you would have a $5 trillion problem, but it wouldn't be ours. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is not to the liking of any single individual in all of its aspects, but it shows our ability to govern, because every single organization that has been advocating for low-income housing, all of the organizations that are in the business of building and selling housing, the organizations concerned with the financial health of this country, and the mayors and the Governors all support the bill, the Financial Services Roundtable, the American Bankers Association, the Mortgage Bankers Association, the National Association of Realtors, the National Association of Home Builders, the United States Conference of Mayors, the National Governors Association, and all the advocacy groups, the National Association of Consumer Advocates, National Community Reinvestment Coalition, National Consumer Law Center, National Fair Housing Alliance, National Low Income Housing Coalition. 
   The point is this. If we had a bill that was perfect for any one of these groups, you wouldn't have this coalition. These are people who, unlike my conservative colleagues who think that their administration has suddenly lost all of its moorings and they think that the Realtors and the home builders and the Financial Services Roundtable and the Low Income Housing Coalition and the home builders, all of these people don't understand. That's because they know the difference between a $5 trillion fantasy and a $25 billion stand-by authority to prevent terrible economic damage. 
   Here is the final point. No solution to a problem could be more elegant than the problem. We are in this problem because of excessive deregulation that led to the subprime explosion. The gentleman from Alabama and I and other members of the committee, my two colleagues from North Carolina, tried several years ago to prevent it. I acknowledge that we worked together. We were overruled by higher political authority at the time under the Republican-controlled Congress. 
   We are suffering from the results of the subprime. As to Fannie and Freddie, yes. That's a hybrid form that none of us here created that we should look at, and we will look at. But to deny a emergency response until we do that would be inviting disaster.
