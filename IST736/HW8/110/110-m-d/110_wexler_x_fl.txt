<DOCNO>Mr. WEXLER. (BAIL BOND FAIRNESS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WEXLER. Mr. Speaker, I first and foremost want to thank Chairman Conyers for his cooperation and great support for H.R. 2286. I also want to thank Ranking Member LAMAR SMITH for working in such a bipartisan fashion. 
   I especially want to thank Congressman Keller, Mr. Forbes mentioned just a moment ago. Mr. Keller and I have worked hand in hand in pushing the Bail Bond Fairness Act, and I know very much that he wished to be here to speak this evening. 
   I also want to thank Mr. Forbes for his very kind words and his cooperation as well, as well as the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Scott of Virginia. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Bail Bond Fairness Act will ensure equality and fairness for all Federal defendants and will make it possible for bail agents to once again write bonds in Federal courts. This bill addresses a serious problem in the Federal bail bond system, created by requirements that bail agents not only ensure the appearance of defendants in court, but also guarantee other conditions beyond the agent's control, such as alcohol consumption and curfews. 
   As a result, bail bond agents have stopped writing bonds in Federal cases, and lower-income defendants have become unable to post bail while wealthier individuals do so easily. The result is that poor defendants can't afford bail and must, therefore, stay in jail at taxpayer expense. 
   H.R. 2286 would remedy these problems and allow professional bail agents to return to the Federal court system. The bill mandates that a bail bond may be forfeited only if a defendant fails to appear in court as ordered. 
   This legislation reaffirms the original purpose of a bail bond, to guarantee the defendant appears in court. Bail agents must be allowed to serve this purpose and cannot be expected to serve as full-time nannies for defendants whom judges determine are safe to be released. 
   It is important to note that the Bail Bond Fairness Act totally preserves the authority of the judge to grant or refuse bail. The judge, and the judge only, will continue to make a determination on flight risk and any possible threat to the community. 
   Judges will still have the discretion to determine who is eligible and who is not for pretrial release, what conditions accompany that release, and whether or not a suspected criminal is a flight risk. We all agree that if a suspected criminal is a threat to the society, to the community, he or she should stay in jail. 
   The bottom line is that bail bonds should guarantee appearance in court. Any other appropriate conditions set by the judge, such as alcohol or drug consumption, should not be tied to the bond. 
   This bill enjoys a great deal of bipartisan support, and I again want to thank Congressman Keller, my colleague from Florida, as one of the prime sponsors and again thank Chairman Conyers.

<DOCNO>Mr. WEXLER. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WEXLER. Thank you, Mr. Lantos. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I stand with the American people in support of this resolution and in opposition to the President's escalation of the Iraq war. I stand in opposition to a President that failed the American people by initiating an ill-conceived war; an administration that misled the Nation, vulnerable after 9/11, into believing that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction; an administration that invented links between Baghdad and al Qaeda; that ignored the views of the intelligence community, while convincing Americans that our brave soldiers would be greeted in Iraq as liberators; an administration that assured us that Iraqi oil money would pay for the reconstruction; and that through military force, rather than diplomacy, we would cultivate American values of freedom and democracy in Iraq. 
   The American people know that they have been taken down a false path by this administration, down a spiraling path of war under false pretenses into a quagmire with a President who will not change course, even in the face of a growing civil war. This resolution sends the President an unequivocal message that he must change direction of this war. 
   How did we arrive in this desperate situation? From the top down, the President, the Vice-President and the Secretary of State have manipulated evidence, broadcast half truths, and doctored intelligence through an orchestrated effort to smear and destroy those who have opposed their policies. Just last week, in a scathing report, the Defense Department's Inspector General concluded that the Pentagon took inappropriate action by advancing conclusions that were not backed up by the intelligence community. 
   The American people have judged the actions of this President, they see this war for what it is, and they spoke clearly in November, stating loudly that we must end our disastrous Iraq policy. Yet this administration continues its defiant disregard of the views of the American people. Not the voice of the American people nor the conclusions of the Iraq Study Group have  budged this administration from its stubborn and misguided path. And now, the President is doubling down on a bad bet that risks the lives of thousands more American soldiers on a misguided plan that ignores the recommendations of our military commanders on the ground.     
   Unbelievably, President Bush has already tried twice the strategy of escalation. It failed both times. To try again is to act in blind faith, ignoring the facts, ignoring the experts, ignoring the will of the American people, and, worst of all, ignoring the terrible sacrifices that will undoubtedly be endured by our soldiers and their families. 
   Mr. Speaker, our troops must be redeployed from Iraq. Instead of a surge of American troops entering Baghdad, there should be a surge of American soldiers back into every town and every city across our Nation. For our troops who have given so much in Iraq, for our military families whose lives have been shattered by this war, it is time to bring them home. 
   How do we honor our brave men and women? How do we honor over the 3,000 who died, and thousands more who have been maimed? Instead of an escalation, we should honor these soldiers by bringing them home and giving them the best health care, the best mental health support that they have justly earned. 
   I applaud Congress for taking a stand on this war. I only wish we were voting on a binding resolution that mandates a redeployment of troops and cuts off funding for this tragic escalation. Each month we remain in Iraq, 100 more American soldiers die, hundreds more are maimed, and $5.5 billion is spent. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have endured 4 years of a failed Iraq policy, longer than we were in World War II, longer than we were in the Korean War, and we can afford no more blank checks for this President. 
   Today I stand with the American people, our soldiers in Iraq, with my fellow Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle in strong opposition to the President's escalation in Iraq and in support of our redeploying our troops and reversing, most importantly, our Nation's failed strategy in Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. WEXLER. (CONDEMNING THE ONGOING PALESTINIAN ROCKET ATTACKS ON ISRAELI CIVILIANS -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WEXLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 951, condemning the ongoing Palestinian rocket attacks on Israeli civilians and unequivocally supporting Israel's right to defend its citizens against this continuous threat. 
   As you know, nearly a quarter of a million Israeli citizens living in Sderot, Ashkelon, and other cities and towns close to Gaza are under attack daily and are living in a constant state of fear. It is critical that Congress stand with Israelis who are under constant threat of rocket attacks perpetrated by Hamas. To that end, I am proud to stand with my colleagues as a sponsor of this resolution and as an unequivocal supporter of Israel's right to defend itself against this constant threat. 
   The international community must join with the United States in condemning the thousands of rockets that have been maliciously launched from Gaza by Hamas since Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza in 2005. It is unconscionable for the United Nations or any nation to chastise Israel while rockets reign down unabated. Instead of criticizing Israel, the United Nations and the international community should be condemning Hamas and their deadly attacks. The international community, which has been largely silent on these attacks, should publicly condemn Hamas, which is intentionally targeting civilian communities in Israel when it fires these rockets. These attacks have led to dozens of casualties, thousands of shock victims, and an uncountable number of children who have been traumatized and will live in fear for years to come. The international community should also support Israel's right to go on the offensive in Gaza in an effort to eliminate Hamas' terrorist infrastructure and destroy Hamas' ability to continue this campaign of terror. 
   Unfortunately, the rocket attacks continue, and the threat Hamas poses to Israelis with more sophisticated rockets still looms. As a close friend and ally of Israel and a staunch  defender of freedom around the world, America must stand with Israel in its efforts to end these attacks and defend Israel's right to live in peace free from rocket attacks. 
   The resolution we are debating today clearly expresses my support as well as that of my colleagues for Israel's right to defend itself against the deadly threat Hamas poses, and encourages Palestinians who reject Hamas and all forms of terrorism to denounce these attacks and dismantle the terrorist infrastructure in Gaza. This resolution also squarely places direct responsibility for these attacks on Hamas, and reaffirms the unyielding friendship between the governments and the people of Israel and the United States. As Israel faces the terrorist threat of Hamas, I will continue to encourage my colleagues in Congress to join me in supporting Israel's right to self defense. The plea of Israelis under this constant threat has been heard in Congress, and House Resolution 951 is a clear statement that Congress and the American people stand with the Israelis at this difficult time.

<DOCNO>Mr. WEXLER. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WEXLER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support for the Fiscal Year 2008 Budget Resolution, H. Con. Res. 99. For far too long, the former Republican leadership in Congress and the Bush Administration were complacent in allowing poor public policy and misguided spending priorities to become a driving force behind mounting Federal deficits and an ever increasing national debt. Additionally, trillions of dollars in tax cuts for the wealthy and billions of dollars for a deteriorating war in Iraq have resulted in the President proposing repeated cuts to vital domestic priorities such as healthcare, education, and the environment. 
   Today, the House of Representatives is finally considering a budget that meets the social and economic needs of the American people, while taking the necessary steps toward addressing the mounting fiscal hurdles facing the Federal Government. 
   Our Nation has been in a budgetary crisis for too long. According to the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, estimates, President Bush inherited an estimated 10-year budget surplus of $5.6 trillion when he arrived in office. Today, that same 10-year period (2002-2011) is projected to show a budget deficit of $3 trillion under the President's policies. The Democratic Budget Resolution will set the country's finances back on track by balancing the budget by 2012, and it does this without sacrificing programs vital to our national security, our economy, and most importantly to the social welfare of the American people. 
   This budget will provide the largest veterans' healthcare spending increase in our Nation's history, ensuring that the 1,788,496 veterans in Florida receive care worthy of their sacrifice. It will facilitate significant increases in healthcare funding to expand access to Florida's 733,000 uninsured children, and makes a firm commitment to support education and affordable housing programs. It  also promotes environmental protection and conservation, and accommodates important energy legislation aimed at investment in renewable resources that will move our country toward energy independence. 
   This budget resolution restores the fiscal responsibility and accountability that the American people deserve and reflects the values and priorities that the American people expect. It is time to put this country's finances back on track and truly invest in America's prosperity. I urge my colleague to support passage of this important resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. WEXLER. (EXPRESSING SENSE OF HOUSE REGARDING CREATION OF REFUGEE POPULATIONS -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WEXLER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 185, expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the creation of refugee populations in the Middle East, North Africa, and the Persian Gulf region as a result of unacceptable human rights violations and blatant anti-Semitism. 
   For over 2,500 years, Jewish communities have resided throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and the Gulf region in large numbers. Unfortunately these vibrant Jewish communities have often been considered second-class citizens under onerous rulers. In the 20th century, widespread persecution and mass violations of human rights against Jewish minorities in Arab countries became unfortunately commonplace. 
   Upon the declaration of the State of Israel's independence in 1948, the difficult status of Jewish minorities was greatly exacerbated as Arab nations declared war or supported the destruction of the nascent state. In response, many members of the Jewish community were forced to flee their countries of birth or faced becoming a political hostage. Jewish properties were unlawfully seized and confiscated without any compensation or just redress. While there were once nearly a million Jews living in these regions, today there are only a few thousand Jews remaining in these Arab countries. 
   Unconscionably, the story of the Jewish refugees from Arab countries has been neglected by the United Nations and the international community for far too long. While Palestinian refugees from Israel have been one of the focal points of the international community, Jewish refugees from Arab states have been forgotten, if not intentionally ignored. This resolution recognizes the over 850,000 Jewish refugees from Arab states and expresses the sense of Congress that the international community should acknowledge the Jewish refugee issue as a part of any settlement of the Middle East conflict. 
   It is clear that the violations of human rights against Jewish refugees from Arab countries have never been adequately addressed by the international community. As a cosponsor of H. Res. 185, I believe it is essential that Congress work with the administration to rectify this black mark on history. To this end, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution, which sheds light on the plight of Jewish refugees throughout the Middle East.

<DOCNO>Mr. WEXLER. (GEORGIA AND UKRAINE NATO MEMBERSHIP -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WEXLER. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 997, urging NATO to provide a Membership Action Plan to Ukraine and Georgia at the NATO summit in Bucharest which begins tomorrow. I want to especially thank Chairman Berman for his extraordinary leadership in moving this resolution forward, as well as his very thoughtful remarks in announcing his support for this resolution. I also want to thank my colleague and ranking member on the Europe Subcommittee, Congressman Gallegly, as well as Congresswoman Schwartz, who joined us in introducing H. Res. 997.     
   Madam Speaker, it is clear that NATO is at a crossroads given that important decisions are being made about further enlargement, Kosovo and renewed Balkans instability, and mounting difficulties in Afghanistan. 
   While tomorrow's summit will undoubtedly focus on these pressing issues, it is also a golden opportunity for the alliance to take steps forward to bolster transatlantic security and further entrench democracy, freedom, and the rule of law throughout Europe. 
   I believe it is in both America's and Europe's interest to further integrate Georgia and Ukraine into the West. Tblisi and Kiev have demonstrated their commitment to joining the United States and our allies in addressing security challenges from the Balkans to Iraq and to rebuilding Afghanistan. 
   As we debate this resolution, it is important to remember that the goal of NATO enlargement since the mid-1990s has been to achieve a broader, more secure Europe. Providing a membership action plan for Ukraine and Georgia would further consolidate democracy and stability in eastern Europe and the Caucuses region; and, is essential to fulfilling NATO's 1997 ``open door'' policy that ensures that any European nation that meets alliance standards and can contribute to Euro-Atlantic security be considered for membership. 
   Georgia and Ukraine have much to accomplish before they can be offered NATO membership. Since the MAP process will further require democratic and security reforms in Kiev and Tblisi, it is crucial for the Ukrainian and Georgian governments to know that their efforts and aspirations are supported by this Congress as well as all NATO members. 
   Madam Speaker, I was in Kiev just last month, and there was an extraordinary development in Kiev with the president, prime minister and speaker of their parliament all formally asking for the NATO membership action plan. It is an extraordinary statement of unity, and it is incredibly important that this House go on record in support of those pro-democratic politicians and officeholders in Kiev as well as in Georgia. 
   To that end, I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 997, and send a strong message to our NATO allies on the eve of the Bucharest Summit. And I thank Chairman Berman for his extraordinary leadership in this regard.

   Mr. WEXLER. Madam Speaker, no one is immune from accountability and the rule of law, not Harriet Miers or Josh Bolten, and especially not President Bush or Vice President Cheney. 
   It is high time to defend the Constitution and Congress as a coequal branch of government. Our liberty and freedoms as Americans are dependent upon the checks and balances that protect our Nation. Not since Watergate, not since Watergate has a President so openly disregarded the will of Congress. Josh Bolten and Harriet Miers have blatantly ignored congressional subpoenas, thumbing their nose at Congress and our obligation of legitimate oversight. 
   The power of the congressional subpoena safeguards our liberty. It protects against an all-powerful President. The Constitution demands that we hold these renegade officials in contempt of Congress. 
   Thank you, Madam Chairman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WEXLER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 854, highlighting the decision made by the member states of the International Commission of the International Tracing Service, ITS, to finally grant access to the vast Holocaust archives located in Bad Arolsen, Germany. 
   The recent decision to fully open the archives closed a frustrating chapter for Holocaust survivors whose requests for information, which numbered in the hundreds of thousands, were left unanswered.  
   As many of my colleagues are aware, for 63 years the most extensive collection of files documenting the horrors of the Holocaust were extensively closed to survivors, heirs, researchers and family members seeking to find out the true fate of their loved ones or to document the horrific atrocities committed by the Nazis. 
   The Bad Arolsen archives, with its 50 million documents chronicling the fate of over 17 million victims of the Holocaust, is a vital resource for the remaining Holocaust survivors and their families who are struggling to bring closure to this painful chapter of history. 
   Many Holocaust survivors have died without knowing the details of a family member's deportation, incarceration, or death. The opening of the Bad Arolsen archives will now enable survivors as well as second and third generation survivors to gain access to vital information about their family history. 
   There are many individuals and organizations that deserve credit for their efforts in fully opening Bad Arolsen. In Congress there was a strong bipartisan effort to raise awareness about the world's largest Holocaust archive that was for all intents and purposes closed. To that, I would like to thank my colleague from south Florida, Congressman Alcee Hastings, for his tireless work on this issue, as well as the many sponsors of this resolution, many of whom were also involved in efforts to reach out to the parliaments of the member states of the International Commission of the ITS to ensure the timely ratification of the amendments to the Bonn Accords. 
   Now that this vital archive has been made public, information unjustly denied to survivors and their families for the past 63 years can be brought to light. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WEXLER. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1024, a resolution expressing support for the 187th anniversary of Greek independence. 
   Madam Speaker, it was one year to the day that I joined my colleagues on the House Floor in paying tribute to one of America's most important allies, Greece. It was my honor at that time as it is today to pay tribute once again to Greek Independence Day and to offer my unwavering support for US-Greece bilateral relations. 
   As someone who cares deeply about the issues of importance to the Greek American community, I believe this is an especially important day--one that is a reminder of America's long and historic partnership with Greece but also a day to celebrate the countless contributions of the Greek American community to this Nation. 
   From the Balkans to Afghanistan to the war on terrorism, Greece has been a staunch ally of the United States and a leading advocate for democracy and the rule of law globally. To that end, it is critical over the coming weeks that the United States works closely with our NATO ally Greece and with officials in Skopje to find a mutually-acceptable official name for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. 
   I also strongly encourage the Bush administration to work with our partners in Athens to resolve the longstanding division on Cyprus. It is in the interests of the United States, European Union, Greece, Turkey as well as Greek and Turkish Cypriots that we build on the recent election of President Christofias who boldly pledged to ``extend a hand of friendship and cooperation to the Turkish Cypriots and their political leadership,'' and to ``invite them to work together towards our common goal for the good of Cyprus and its people.'' 
   Madam Speaker, Greece is known as the cradle of democracy. As Americans watch one of the most exciting elections in modern history, it is a reminder of what Greece gave to America and those nations seeking to perfect their democracy and civic society. These ideals crafted by Greek philosophers and put into practice both in Washington, Athens and globally have changed all of humankind. 
   As a member of Congress who proudly represents a large Greek American community, I am deeply pleased that we have this opportunity on the House Floor to discuss the contributions of millions of Greek Americans and to pass a resolution that rightfully recognizes five million extraordinary citizens.  
   Madam Speaker, I congratulate the Greek people on the 187th anniversary of their independence and strongly support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WEXLER. Madam Speaker, on November 7, 2007, this House voted to refer Congressman Kucinich's resolution of impeachment of Vice President Cheney to the House Judiciary Committee. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I now ask that we immediately begin impeachment hearings. 
   The issues at hand are far too serious to ignore. Dick Cheney faces credible allegations of abuse of power that if proven may well constitute high crimes and misdemeanors. 
   Did the Vice President manipulate intelligence to push this Nation into war based on false pretense? 
   Did the Vice President unmask a covert CIA agent for political purposes? 
   Did the Vice President order the illegal surveillance of Americans and the illegal use of torture? 
   These questions must be answered. 
   Just recently, former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan revealed that the Vice President and his staff purposely gave him false information to report to the American people, a clear obstruction of justice. 
   This administration has undermined the checks and balances of our government by brazenly ignoring congressional subpoenas and recklessly claiming executive privilege. Impeachment hearings are the only way to force the Bush administration to answer questions and tell the truth. 
   Congress must take the first step by enforcing the subpoenas against Harriet Miers and the President's Chief of Staff and hold them in contempt of Congress. In this time, at this moment, Congress must stand for the truth. If we fail to act, history may well judge us complicit in the alleged crimes of Vice President Cheney. 
   Madam Speaker, a growing chorus of Americans are calling for accountability. The response from Congress thus far has been silence and denial.

   Mr. WEXLER. Madam Speaker, not long ago I launched a Web site in support of my call for hearings. The people responded en masse. After only 4 weeks, over 189,000 Americans have registered their support for hearings, names I now hold in my hand. These frustrated and patriotic Americans come from all 50 States and share one common goal: accountability for the Bush-Cheney administration and a rebirth of Congress as an equal branch of government. 
   So many have been working on this cause before me. Groups like Democrats.com, AfterDowningStreet.org, CodePink, ImpeachBush.org, Impeach for Peace and others. All told, there have been well over 1 million signatures urging us to take action. 
   Tomorrow, I will deliver these names to my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee with a letter to my friend Chairman Conyers calling for hearings. I will ask my colleagues to sign this letter. In addition, tomorrow, and continuing every day for months, I will publish in the Congressional Record several thousand names of supporters who have signed up. 
   History demands that we take action, because the case against Vice President Cheney is far stronger than the illegalities surrounding Watergate. When compared to the partisan and petty allegations made against President Clinton by Ken Starr and the GOP Congress, the true gravity of the case against the Vice President appears in its devastating clarity. In fact, in the history of our Nation, we have never encountered a moment where the actions of a President or a Vice President have more strongly demanded the use of the power of impeachment. 
   I have heard the arguments that it is too late, that we have run out of time, and that we don't have the votes. While today there may not be enough votes to impeach, it is premature to think that such support would not exist after hearings. Let us remember that it wasn't until after hearings began that the Watergate tapes emerged. Who knows what facts will comfort when the full truth is told in this case? 
   Arguing that it is too late signals to future administrations that in the waning months in office they are immune from constitutional accountability. Hold hearings which will put the evidence on the table, and the evidence alone must determine the outcome.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WEXLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge ``Cover the Uninsured Week.'' We must recognize the tragic reality that 47 million Americans, including 9 million children, are uninsured in America. In my home State of Florida, the figures are even more striking, with 20 percent of Floridians lacking health insurance. Millions of hard-working Americans with full-time jobs lack affordable health care options. 
   For example, a woman in my district, Florianne, has worked as a housekeeper for a local hospital for 3 years and is uninsured. She cannot afford to pay for health insurance for her children despite having a full-time job. In 2004, when Florianne worked directly for the hospital, she received health benefits. Today, the hospital subcontracts its housekeeping operations, causing her to lose her health insurance. With rent, food, gas, and utilities eating up her $692 biweekly paycheck, there is not a dollar to spare for her son's glasses or basic checkups, let alone a $768 monthly premium. 
   I wish Florianne's predicament was unique. All across Palm Beach County, the State of Florida and throughout the United States, children like Florianne's miss doctor's appointments, forego needed prescriptions, and are denied adequate health care. Their parents work hard but still cannot afford health care for their families. This is totally unacceptable in the wealthiest nation on Earth. 
   In Congress, I have sponsored legislation to fund insurance for millions of children across the country, introduced legislation to make Medicare more affordable for seniors, and voted to increase funding for community health centers willing to treat uninsured individuals. I am also a sponsor of the U.S. National Health Insurance Act (H.R. 676), which would reform our health care system and provide health insurance for every man, woman, and child. Unfortunately, many of these proposals have been shot down by the Bush administration. 
   ``Cover the Uninsured Week'' reminds us all that America desperately needs leadership in the White House and in Congress to work together to achieve the affordable health care that all Americans deserve.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WEXLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would first like to thank my good friend and colleague, Congresswoman CAROLYN MCCARTHY of New York, who has been a passionate and tireless advocate for peace and justice in Northern Ireland throughout her distinguished career in Congress. 
   Over the past several years, the peace process in Northern Ireland has taken many twists and turns. The Good Friday Agreement, designed to bring an end to the conflict in Northern Ireland, has been declared dead time and again. The Northern Ireland Assembly and the Executive established by the Good Friday Agreement have been suspended since 2002. 
   During the past few months, however, we have witnessed incredibly promising developments in our efforts to fully implement the Good Friday Agreement, which was signed almost 9 years ago on April 10, 1998. 
   The St. Andrews Agreement of October 2006 established a firm timetable for the restoration of the government in Northern Ireland. In the agreement itself and in subsequent declarations, both sides of the conflict committed themselves to the rule of law, effective policing, and a strong criminal justice system. Most importantly, the elections called for by the St. Andrews Agreement were carried out successfully just last week. 
   Now the hard work begins, Mr. Speaker. Over the next 2 weeks, Northern Ireland's political parties must agree to share power according to the democratic mandate of the Good Friday Agreement. A failure to reach a power sharing deal will lead to the dissolution of the Northern Ireland Assembly, a development which would be profoundly damaging to the long-term prospects for peace in Northern Ireland. With passage of this resolution, Congress urges Northern Ireland's political leaders to make the tough compromises necessary to bring about a power sharing arrangement. With such a deal, the great promise of the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement can come to fruition. 
   The resolution before the House is designed to support the forward movement towards peace and to help pave the way to a time when the conflict in Northern Ireland is only a subject for the history books. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this timely resolution, and reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WEXLER. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor for me to pay tribute on Greek Independence Day to one of America's most important European allies, Greece, and one that holds immeasurable importance to millions of Americans. 
   I would also like to thank my good friend from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), who has been a leading supporter of U.S.-Greek relations in Congress. 
   Western civilization as we know it today is undeniably connected to Greece. For every American, Greece is known as the cradle of democracy. As a nation that still seeks to perfect its democracy in civic society, America looks to Greece and its universally known philosophers and leaders for political inspiration and wisdom. In fact, the very word ``democracy'' is a Greek word. The history of Greek independence is inspiring, especially given America's own history and drive for independence from tyranny and oppression. Greeks have been willing to fight for independence, sacrifice for the sake of freedom, and have stirred others to do the same. 
   As a Member of Congress with a large Greek-American community, I am especially pleased that we are passing this resolution today, which also highlights the extraordinary contributions of a community that has contributed greatly to the shared prosperity of our Nation. Today, the Greek-American community remains the bedrock in the unbreakable bond between the United States and our ally, Greece. As ambassadors of goodwill between the United States and Greece, Greek Americans have for decades shaped this long-standing friendship, creating a partnership based on freedom, democracy and peace. 
   Today, some 5 million Americans claim Greek ancestry, with understandable pride. Greece is one of less than a handful of nations that have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the United States in every major war of the 20th century. Our close relations became even closer after World War II. The Truman Doctrine helped save Greece from communism, indeed helped save it for the Western world, and the Marshall Plan helped pave the way for economic success. 
   In 1952, Greece joined NATO, formalizing the deep mutual commitment of Greece and the rest of the western world to protecting freedom. Now, as an integral member of the EU for two decades, Greece has become increasingly prosperous, a democratic role model for the nations of the world. 
   Greece remains a critical strategic partner in today's post-Cold War world. We cooperate closely in promoting peace and stability in the Balkans. Athens has supported efforts to settle the Cyprus problem and to end the divide on the island. And I am especially supportive of Greece's critical efforts in recent years to resolve historic differences with its neighbor, Turkey, including supporting that country's membership in the EU. 
   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Greek people on the 186th anniversary of their independence and strongly support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WEXLER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H.

<DOCNO>Mr. WEXLER. (RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TREATY OF ROME -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WEXLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 230, and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I first want to thank Chairman Lantos for introducing this resolution with me. If there is anyone in Congress who fully understands the significance of this moment, it is Congressman Lantos, who has been an unwavering supporter of the transatlantic alliance and the creation of the European Union. 
   In addition, I want to thank the ranking member of the Europe Subcommittee, Mr. Gallegly, for his efforts in bringing this resolution to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, on March 25, 1957, in an attempt to recover from destruction caused by two devastating world wars, six European nations, France, Italy, Belgium, The Netherlands, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Luxembourg, joined together in common interest to form the foundations of a new economic and political community. The resulting Treaty of Rome laid the framework to promote an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe. 
   At that time, the Treaty of Rome provided for the establishment of a common market, a customs union and common policies, expanding on the unity already established in the European Coal and Steel Community. The founding members, keen on ensuring the past was not to be repeated, were particularly interested in the idea of creating a community of peace and stability through economic ties. 
   The success of the European Economic Community inspired other countries to apply for membership, making it the first concrete step toward the creation of the European Union. The Treaty of Rome established the basic institutions and decision-making mechanisms still in place today. The European Union, now comprised of 27 countries and over 450 million people, is a unique and a historic example of nation-states transcending their former divisions, deciding to come together for the sake of freedom, peace and prosperity, and resolving their differences in the interest of the common good and rule of law. 
   The success of the EU over the past 50 years has also benefited greatly the United States. Today, the United States and Europe enjoy a mutually beneficial relationship that has a long and established history. 
   As the world's most important alliance, the U.S. and the EU are intimately intertwined, cooperating on regional conflicts, collaborating to address global challenges, and sharing strong trade and investment relations. 
   It is clear that the strongest possible relationship between the United States and Europe is a prerequisite for addressing the challenges of the 21st century. The U.S. and EU are working closely to promote reform and peace in the Middle East, rebuild and enhance security in Afghanistan, support the goals of democratization and prosperity in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, Balkans and Central Asia, prevent genocide in Darfur and end the violence and terrorism in Lebanon. 
   The anniversary of the Rome Treaty is a reminder of the importance of the transatlantic alliance in an increasingly difficult global environment. However, the 50-year EU experiment is an example of the enduring possibilities of democratic transformation and a brighter future for millions. 
   It is my hope that the EU will continue to keep its doors open and remain a beacon of hope to the citizens of Europe who aspire to obtain the peace and prosperity that have blossomed over the past 50 years. 
   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in recognizing the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, and strongly urge the passage of H. Res. 230. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. WEXLER. (RECOGNIZING ANNIVERSARIES OF MASS MOVEMENT FOR SOVIET JEWISH FREEDOM AND FREEDOM SUNDAY RALLY FOR SOVIET JEWRY -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WEXLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 40th anniversary of the Mass Movement for Soviet Jewish Freedom and the 20th anniversary of the Freedom Sunday Rally for Soviet Jewry on the Mall here in Washington. This mass advocacy movement formed following the anti-Zionist campaign launched by the Soviet government in 1967 and worked tirelessly for over two decades to gain Soviet Jews the freedom to emigrate from the Soviet Union, where they had been held as virtual prisoners since World War II. 
   In 1987, on the eve of the Reagan-Gorbachev summit, more than 250,000 people gathered in Washington to rally for the plight of Soviet Jews. This event was a major turning point in compelling the soviet government to open its doors for millions of Soviet Jewish &#233;migr&#233;s who were being held prisoner in their own country. Finally in 1991, the Supreme Soviet passed a law codifying the right of every Soviet citizen to emigrate, leading to a massive emigration by Jews from the Soviet Union, mostly to Israel and the United States. 
   As a sponsor of House Resolution 759, I want to recognize these two anniversaries and praise the efforts of all the organizations involved in this important movement, including the American Jewish Conference on Soviet Jewry, the Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry, and the Congressional Coalition for Soviet Jews. These and many other organizations  were integral in securing freedom for Soviet Jews, and their work serves as an example for all who are seeking religious and political freedom around the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, these two anniversaries are also a reminder about the ongoing struggle for religious freedom and the need to continue to battle against anti-Semitism, bigotry and discrimination wherever it occurs. The United States as the world's only superpower and oldest democracy has an obligation and a responsibility to continue to advocate for those individuals suffering at the hands of oppressive governments--whether it is in Darfur, Sudan or in Burma. Today, millions around the globe cling to the hope that one day they will be liberated and freed from oppression. To this end, Congress and the American people must remain steadfast in our determination to protect religious and human rights matching the willpower and vigilance of those who fought so hard for decades to liberate Soviet Jewry from the yoke of tyranny and repression.

<DOCNO>Mr. WEXLER. (RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE MODERN STATE OF ISRAEL -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WEXLER. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to join my colleagues in marking Israel's 60th anniversary. I want to express my strong support for House Concurrent Resolution 322, which recognizes the 60th anniversary of the founding of the modern State of Israel, and reaffirms the bonds of close friendship and cooperation between the United States and Israel. 
   On this historic day for Israelis and Jewish communities around the globe, it is imperative that Congress recognizes this important event and once again reaffirms America's ironclad commitment to and friendship with the State of Israel. Given the difficulties facing Israelis in their efforts to secure lasting peace and security, it is essential that the United States and the American people stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel. 
   Since 1948, Israelis have created a thriving Jewish homeland, overcoming numerous obstacles and challenges. They have also displayed enormous courage and fortitude in the face of unconscionable terrorism, violence and threats to their very existence. In six decades, a democratic and free state, Israel, has risen from the ashes of the Holocaust and developed into one of the most technologically advanced and innovative nations on Earth. 
   Through all of the hardships, Israel has persevered and joined the United States and our democratic allies by creating a nation based on freedom, justice and human rights. To that end, I join my colleagues in praising the Israeli people, whose nation has become a shinning bastion of democracy in a region rife with dictators, extremists and hate. 
   While Israelis celebrate 60 years of independence, their freedom and security continues to be challenged by terrorist groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah as well as by the leading state sponsors of terrorism Syria and Iran. Unfortunately, Israelis know intimately the challenges that come with protecting their people, understanding that terrorism knows no borders and cannot be justified, qualified or ignored. 
   As a Member of Congress deeply concerned about the threats posed to Israelis by terrorist attacks, I believe it is critical that the United States support Israel's right to self defense. In that vein, I cosponsored House Resolution 951, declaring America's solidarity with Israelis as they face continuous rocket attacks from Hamas in Gaza. These rocket attacks are a daily reminder to Israelis and their friends in America of the struggles Israel continues to face. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is no greater threat to the well-being of Israel and the United States than a nuclear Iran, and America must use every tool at its disposal to prevent Tehran from developing and acquiring these weapons. To that end, I will continue to be a staunch advocate for Congressional initiatives that enhance American-Israeli cooperation and strengthen Israel's defensive capabilities. 
   In the post-9/11 world, Americans and Israelis are forever linked by the common threats we face from terrorism and in our effort to confront extremists. More importantly, our two nations share a deep commitment to human rights, civil society, freedom and democracy. 
   These shared values have created an unbreakable bond of friendship, and I urge my colleagues to join me in pledging their commitment to further enhance American-Israeli relations for generations to come. 
   It is my most sincere wish that the vision of hope embodied in Israel's national anthem, Hatikva, may come to fruition and that Israel may soon find a genuine peace that will last I'dor v'dor, from one generation to the next. To that end, I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the 60th anniversary of Israel.

<DOCNO>Mr. WEXLER. (HOMEOWNERS' DEFENSE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WEXLER. Mr. Chairman, opponents of the Homeowners' Defense Act suggest we should not get caught up in the emotion of the moment. But, Mr. Chairman, our Nation is suffering from a property insurance crisis that desperately demands Federal action. 
   Millions of American homeowners are enduring the skyrocketing costs of homeowner insurance premiums at the same time that their coverage is reduced. And millions more in Florida and throughout the Nation have had their policies cancelled. Those fortunate enough to still have coverage have experienced 200 and 300 percent increases in premiums, even though they have not filed a single claim. This is a terrible situation. I applaud Congressmen Klein and Mahoney for leading this critical effort. 
   The insurance crisis is not a Florida-specific crisis, nor is it a coastal only crisis. Homeowners across the Nation are starting to see the same premium increases and cancellations that Floridians have endured for the past several years. 
   Let me be clear. This is a crisis that affects each and every State in our Nation. As we have tragically seen in recent weeks and months, all Americans are vulnerable to hurricanes, floods, fires and other natural disasters. The economic impact of these catastrophes do not recognize State borders. We must act together as Americans to end this insurance crisis. 
   This bill brings substantial savings to homeowners without degrading the private insurance market. It would be inexcusable for Congress to waste this golden opportunity to provide relief to millions of Americans suffering from the devastating combination of rising gas prices, health care costs, and homeowners insurance. Again, thank you to Mr. Klein, thank you to Mr. Mahoney, thank you for the time.

<DOCNO>Mr. WEXLER. (PATENT REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WEXLER. Mr. Chairman, a co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on Intellectual Property Promotion, I rise in strong support of this patent reform legislation because it is critical for the continued growth of American businesses and the creation of high-paying jobs in America. 
   This bill will nurture and protect inventors, thereby promoting future Alexander Graham Bells and tomorrow's Microsofts. 
   For more than 200 years, strong patent protection, along with timely examination of patent applications, has helped secure the economic success of the United States by empowering inventors and encouraging the development of American business both large and small.     
   Every day, Americans rely on the innovation that comes from our patent system. From new computer technologies to medicines for America's seniors, the American patent system provides the fuel for our most important technological accomplishments. 
   In America today, our capacity to come up with new ideas actually outstrips the value of the goods we make. The licensing of U.S. patents contributes approximately $150 billion to our annual economy, and intellectual property, including patents, is the only economic area where the United States maintains a solid trade surplus with the rest of the world. 
   A well-functioning patent system is vital to America's commercial and scientific entrepreneurs and preserves the incentives for innovation guaranteed under the United States Constitution. 
   This legislation will make America more competitive in the global marketplace, not less. We need to support Mr. Berman and Mr. Conyers in their effort to produce what I would respectfully suggest is the most important economic legislation that this House will pass. This is excellent for America's workers; it's excellent for America's universities and our economy at large.

<DOCNO>Mr. WEXLER. (EURASIA FOUNDATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WEXLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2949, authorizing 15 million dollars in appropriations to the Eurasia Foundation for Fiscal Years 2008 and 2009. This legislation will enable the Eurasia Foundation--which has been operating in the former Soviet Union since 1992--to continue to engage at the highest level in democracy building, civil society promotion and private sector expansion. 
   I wish to thank Chairman LANTOS and Ranking Member ROS-LEHTINEN for their support of this legislation, as well as Congressman GALLEGLY who was the lead sponsor of this legislation in the 109th Congress. All of these Members have been tireless advocates for providing critical aid and support to former Soviet countries. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation comes at a critical time in our relations with Eurasian states that are still in political, economic and social transition following the collapse of the Soviet Union. It is also coming at a time when U.S. aid to the region is unconscionably shrinking. To this end, organizations such as the Eurasia Foundation are critical components of our strategy to remain engaged at governmental and non-governmental levels in a region that stretches from Armenia to Uzbekistan and from Ukraine to Kazakhstan. 
   This legislation recognizes the important work being done by the Eurasia Foundation and its efforts to promote civil society, public administration and rule of law--in a region of the world that needs America's attention, assistance and support. Passage of H.R. 2949 today will provide the Eurasia Foundation--a partner of the U.S.--the funds it needs to continue to issue thousands of grants and operate programs in Eurasia that have proven to be effective over fourteen years. 
   Again, I want to thank Chairman Lantos and Ranking Member ROS-LEHTINEN for supporting this important legislation and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation when it comes to the floor for a vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. WEXLER. (LEONARD W. HERMAN POST OFFICE -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WEXLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a distinguished and decorated Jewish war veteran, Mr. Leonard Herman, by naming the postal facility at 601 Banyan Trail in Boca Raton, Florida, as the Leonard W. Herman Post Office. Mr. Herman signed up for two tours of duty during World War II, serving as First Lieutenant from December 12, 1942 through January 29, 1946. His courage during the war and the tenacity with which he fought, after the war, to change U.S. policy towards the survivors and displaced persons of concentration camps makes him a real American hero. 
   As a bombardier in the United States Army, Leonard Herman flew numerous combat missions over Germany and committed numerous acts of bravery that helped save countless lives. On October 8, 1943, he shot down an enemy fighter aircraft as it closed in on his plane. This courageous act saved his crewmen and earned him the Distinguished Flying Cross Award. In addition, the heroism he displayed during his tour won him several high honors, including an Air Medal, three Oak Leaf Clusters and the Purple Heart. 
   Perhaps one of Mr. Herman's greatest achievements was his contribution to the efforts of a few young soldiers, including his brother Edward Herman, who sought to save the lives of thousands of ``survivors'' of German concentration camps who continued to die because of the lack of adequate food, clothing and medical supplies. According to the accounts of Professor Robert L. Hilliard, ``Lt. Leonard Herman took it upon himself to advise and seek the help from many of our government leaders regarding the plight of the survivors. His efforts were instrumental in President Truman's learning about the Displaced Persons situation in U.S. occupied Germany. The President changed U.S. policy and issued orders to provide the assistance and material needed by the Holocaust survivors. Lt. Herman played an important role in saving thousands of their lives.'' 
   It is my greatest honor to sponsor this legislation that will recognize Mr. Leonard Herman for his bravery and service to this country. The Post Office designation is a fitting and long overdue tribute. I urge Members of the Committee to support this bill.  
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WEXLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4, which mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate lower drug prices for seniors. America's seniors deserve the best possible health care that this government can offer. Unfortunately, we have failed to live up to this expectation under the new Medicare Part D program. 
   It is unconscionable that the Republicans who drafted the Medicare drug bill actually prohibited the Secretary from obtaining lower prices for seniors. In fact, under Medicare Part D, seniors are paying as much as 10 times more for the most commonly prescribed drugs than patients being treated by the Veterans Administration, and drug prices have consistently risen since the bill's enactment. Community pharmacists, who have witnessed first hand the difficulties seniors face with ever increasing drug prices, endorse this important legislation. 
   Today, Congress has the opportunity to empower the Secretary to act in the best interest of America's seniors. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WEXLER. Thank you, Mr. Lantos. 
   Mr. Speaker, President Bush stubbornly refuses to end the war in Iraq. It is up to Congress to step forward and mandate that our troops return home. Congress must deliver to the American people what they voted for in November. It is Congress that must end this disastrous war. At long last, this legislation delivers a responsible withdrawal of American troops. 
   The stark reality is that the President's escalation strategy has been an utter failure. Instead of a successful surge, the President's policy in Iraq has regressed, and the death toll of American troops and Iraqi civilians has mounted. 
   This President is unwilling to change course, despite overwhelming American opposition to the war, despite failing to meet political, economic and security benchmarks, and despite calls by Senate Republicans urging a change in course. The President is in denial, and it is time for Congress to deliver a reality check. 
   Our troops have sacrificed enough. Our military families have suffered enough. American taxpayers have spent enough. Congress must bring our troops home, and this bill does it.
