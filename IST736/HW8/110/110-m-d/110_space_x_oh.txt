<DOCNO>Mr. SPACE. (THE 34TH COMMEMORATION OF THE TURKISH INVASION OF CYPRUS -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPACE. Mr. Speaker, 34 years ago, on July 20, 1974, Turkish troops illegally invaded Cyprus in violation of international law. Thirty-four years have passed since 200,000 Greek Cypriots were expelled from their homes and 5,000 Greek Cypriots were murdered. More than 1,400 still remain missing today. Thirty-four years later, Turkish troops continue to occupy nearly 37 percent of Cypriot territory. There are approximately 43,000 Turkish troops on Cyprus. That's about one Turkish soldier for every two Turkish Cypriots. 
   The situation remains untenable after 34 years with Greek Cypriots whose homes were taken--the homes where they were raised, where their children were raised, where their parents and grandparents were raised, and where they were never compensated for these homes. 
   The desecration of the Greek Orthodox churches remains ongoing, many now serving as bars, nightclubs, casinos or hotels. Icons, artifacts and frescoes have been destroyed, looted, vandalized, and sold illegally. Here we are 34 years later, and the situation remains, once again, untenable. 
   In spite of all of this, the Greek Cypriots have continued to promote peace for 34 years. The Cypriot President is committed to working toward a bicommunal and bizonal federation with a single sovereignty citizenship and international standing. 
   Indeed, Turkish Cypriots have shown a like commitment. Turkey, however, must show a commitment to this same solution. At a time of increased global destabilization, it is in the best interest of the international community to see that this problem of Cyprus, the injustice in Cyprus, is rectified. 
   A resolution of this ongoing injustice would, indeed, constitute a reflection of respect for human rights, of the rule of law, of peace and prosperity, of all of these things, which are values that we in this country cherish.     
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to recognize the importance of this injustice and the need to rectify the same, and I urge the Turkish people to do the same. It is my hope that the need to recognize the anniversary of the invasion, which we do yet again for the 34th time, is someday replaced with a cause to recognize the agreement and reunification of Cyprus.

<DOCNO>Mr. SPACE. (ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPACE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am offering this bipartisan amendment with Congressman Aderholt to restore funding for the ARC, Appalachian Regional Commission, to $65 million in this bill. This amendment brings the Commission's funding up so that it's equal to the President's request in the previous year's funding level. 
   The Appalachian Regional Commission is very important to my district and many other districts from New York to Mississippi. The Appalachian Regional Commission is a model for Federal economic development initiatives, and has been a responsible steward of the Federal funds it has received over the years. For example, in fiscal year 2006, across all investment areas, each dollar of ARC funding was matched by $3.14 in non-ARC public project funding, and each ARC dollar invested leveraged $11.55 in private investment in ARC projects over time. This restoration of funds will be offset by a $30 million reduction to the Department of Energy's administrative account. 
   I understand that the Appropriations Committee must make difficult decisions this year. However, over the last 10 years, funding for the ARC has remained level, at around $65 million, and the region continues to receive less Federal assistance per capita than the rest of the country. Additionally, the House of Representatives had voted to authorize the ARC at levels much higher than $65 million. 
   The 410-county region still faces a complex set of economic and social challenges, and will need continued support from Congress. Without basic infrastructure, economic development and improvements in the overall quality of life, the Appalachian region will continue to lag well behind the rest of the Nation. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment to restore funding for the commission to levels equal with the President's request and the current funding level for this program. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt).

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPACE. Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose this amendment. 
   For four decades now, the Appalachian Regional Commission has worked to bring Appalachia to economic parity with the rest of the country. 
   The statistics are devastating. Twenty percent of Appalachian households still do not have access to community water systems. Sixty-two percent of Appalachian counties have a higher unemployment rate than the national average. 
   I want to make one thing clear. The Commission's programs are NOT duplicative. They complement Federal activities and extend the reach of those programs into the most challenging parts of Appalachia. 
   The Commission acts as a key financial partner in attracting private and non-profit investment to the region. In Fiscal Year 2006, every dollar of ARC funding leveraged $3.14 in other public funding and $11.55 in private investment. 
   The modest amount of money we spend on this program is fiscally responsible and enormously beneficial to the taxpayer. The President's own Budget requests that the Commission's funding level continue at $65 million. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.

   Mr. SPACE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for her leadership on this issue. 
   I rise today in support of S. 5. In January, I stood before this body to pledge my support for embryonic stem cell research; and I also shared with the House the story of my son, Nicholas, who is now 16 and has battled juvenile diabetes for 10 years. 
   I asked my colleagues to put aside the differences that they have from a political perspective to support this research that offers the promise of a better quality of life for millions of Americans like my son. When the House passed H.R. 3, I was optimistic. I believed in the power of the government to do good for this Nation and its citizen. I believed we could put politics  aside for a cause of such great importance, but, Mr. Speaker, I was wrong. The administration, even many Members of this body, have succumbed to the vices of the game of politics. They put sound bites ahead of their own citizens. 
   In the last Congress, my colleagues in both Chambers worked together to craft legislation that would advance the promise of stem cell research. It was a good, bipartisan bill with broad support. Unfortunately, the President saw fit to veto their hard work, nullifying the opportunity that it offered. 
   Here we are again in the 110th Congress, Mr. Speaker, in exactly the same position we stood 2 years ago. And what has happened in the interim, thousands of children have died from terrible illnesses, and families have been torn apart. In the face of all this, we are having a debate that we have already had. With this enormous opportunity before us, I am saddened and, frankly, frustrated. 
   Today must be a day to start fulfilling our promise to the people of this country and be leaders on this great issue of importance. The future of our children and loved ones simply cannot wait.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPACE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2560. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am a fervent supporter of the promise and optimism of embryonic stem cell research. As the father of a child who suffers from juvenile diabetes, I know full well the importance of stem cell research in developing a cure for life threatening diseases. For millions of Americans like my son, stem cell research represents promising hope of a cure within their lifetime. 
   Unfortunately, many Americans confuse embryonic stem cell research as human cloning, a practice which I adamantly oppose. 
   While technological advances continue to give scientists opportunities to explore beyond our horizons, we have an obligation to pursue our goals responsibly. The pursuit of science cannot go unchecked; occasionally, Congress must intervene. 
   The artificial creation of human life through cloning challenges the ethical foundations of this Nation. The development of human life is a natural process that cannot be replaced by scientists in a laboratory. I cannot in good conscience support a world where the chance and wonder of the birth of a child is eliminated in favor of a cold, sterile process. 
   Embryonic stem cell research differs from cloning by developing embryos that might otherwise be destroyed for specific functions. The goal of this practice is not to create new human life, but rather to sustain existing human life by replacing failing parts of the human anatomy. 
   I will always support saving an American life. I cannot support artificially engineering one. 
   The importance of this distinction is critical. I hope that my colleagues in the House will join me in educating the public on the differences between these practices.

<DOCNO>Mr. SPACE. (45TH ANNIVERSARY OF JOHN HERSCHEL GLENN, JR. BECOMING FIRST U.S. ASTRONAUT TO ORBIT EARTH -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPACE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 252, a resolution commemorating the 45th anniversary of John Herschel Glenn, Jr.'s historic first orbit around the Earth. 
   John Glenn's accomplishments and service to his country made him an inspiration to a generation of young men and women like me. He was a source of pride for our Nation. His contributions to space exploration helped to change our Nation's way of thinking about the new frontier and taught a generation of Americans to dream big. I am honored that this true American hero was born, raised and educated in Ohio's 18th District. 
   Born in 1921 in Cambridge, Ohio, and raised in nearby New Concord, John Glenn attended New Concord High School and earned a bachelor of science degree from Muskingum College in New Concord. 
   John Glenn began his distinguished military career by enlisting in the Naval Aviation Cadet Program, going on to become a Marine pilot, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross on six occasions and the Air Medal with 18 clusters. After leaving the military, John Glenn became a test pilot for the Naval Air Test Center. In 1957 he set a speed record by flying from Los Angeles to New York in 3 hours 23 minutes. 
   While these achievements are without question remarkable and cause for celebration, Madam Speaker, they are not what bring us here today. We are here to appreciate John Glenn's accomplishments in a space flight that revolutionized how Americans viewed space exploration. 
   In the 1950s, the concept of sending a man into space was foreign to most Americans. A mere 50 years after the Wright brothers made their first brief attempts at manned flight, the prospect of propelling a human being into outer space was daunting. 
   In 1959, John Glenn volunteered to become one of the original seven astronauts in the Mercury program, the first manned space flight program in the United States. Several years later, John Glenn embarked on his mission. In February of 1962, he became the first man to orbit the Earth, completing that feat three times over. 
   Madam Speaker, I understand that Senator Glenn knew there was a significant chance he would not survive the flight. I had the pleasure of a conversation with Senator Glenn recently where he told me that he chose to go on the mission because it was the right thing to do, knowing full well he may not return. And it was the right thing to do not for himself, but for America. 
   A year earlier than that, President Kennedy announced a bold new mission to place a man on the Moon. The success of John Glenn's flight helped bring credence and merit to President Kennedy's goal.     
   Americans saw that what was once impossible was now possible. The possibilities suddenly seemed endless. 
   Following the end of his career in aeronautics, Ohio was the fortunate benefactor of John Glenn's public service when he became a United States Senator. He served the State with dignity and honor for 28 years before retiring. 
   Of course, space exploration was never far from his heart. After retiring from the Senate, he joined the crew of the Space Shuttle Discovery and became the oldest man to ever venture into space. 
   Madam Speaker, I have had the privilege of meeting this American hero. I am struck by his humility and his passion for service to his country. Time and again, he risked his life for the benefit of the American people. He prioritized the good of the whole over the good of the one, and for that I will always admire him. 
   As a freshman Member of Congress, I often look for examples to follow. For me, John Glenn, along with his beautiful wife, Annie, represent the absolute best this country has to offer. They have shown courage in the face of adversity and selflessness for the sake of making our country better pride. They have instilled in all of us the hope and inspiration and pride that swells the heart and enriches our world. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution to commemorate an achievement that was the catalyst for space exploration and scientific advancement in the United States.

   Mr. SPACE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Altmire-Carney amendment before us. This amendment is necessary to ensure that the underlying bill protects the rights of sportsmen across the Nation. The amendment does this by making clear that in no way will the measure affect the ability of the States to regulate fish and wildlife under State laws. It also makes clear that nothing in the bill will limit access for hunting, fishing, trapping or recreational shooting. 
   As a gun owner, a member of the NRA, and as a member of the Sportsmen's Caucus, this amendment is incredibly important to our second amendment rights. And as my colleague from the great State of Pennsylvania indicated just a few moments ago, Mr. Carney, that is important to our way of life. 
   I'm proud to advocate for this amendment on behalf of my fellow sportsmen and women in Ohio's 18th District, and I strongly urge passage of this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPACE. I thank my friend from Arkansas. 
   Madam Speaker, I am honored to be a part of this group that places such a high priority on fiscal responsibility, the Blue Dogs. 
   I really believe that we live in a crossroads of history and that there are several seminal issues of our day that in and of themselves would be considered the seminal issue of virtually any other era, whether you're talking about the war in Iraq, the war on terror, the challenges posed by globalization, the challenges facing our environment, all very important issues, and indeed, seminal. But yet another seminal issue, one which is much more insidious and not so readily identifiable, but nonetheless serious, is that posed by our national debt. $9.17 trillion, a number that by any account is virtually incomprehensible; $236 billion a year being paid in interest on that debt. I have not done the math, but I suspect that if you broke that  down for every one of the 435 congressional districts in our country, you would find that each Member of Congress, each congressional district could use several hundred million dollars a year from that figure to build roads, repair bridges, cure diseases, educate children and do the kinds of things that make us a strong Nation. 
   This debt is sapping us of vital resources, and it is, in the words of my colleague earlier today, the gentleman from Tennessee, one of our leaders, John Tanner, making us a weaker Nation. 
   PAYGO, a simple concept, one that, again, my colleague from Tennessee referenced as something we expect of our government in the same way that we expect it from our families, live within our means. The alternative minimum tax is poised to draw in 23 million Americans who were never intended to be the victims of that tax. We need to fix it. We must fix it. This House has voted to fix it in a fiscally responsible way, in a way that is paid for. 
   Now, the Blue Dogs stand for the proposition that we stand behind that and that we don't irresponsibly fix the tax, we do it in a responsible fashion. Back home in Ohio's 18th District, in towns like Chillicothe and Zanesville and New Philadelphia, Ohio, we can't understand what $9.1 trillion is. I certainly don't get it. It's incomprehensible. But we do understand the need, the pressing need of this Nation to once again engage in fiscal responsibility, acting in a way that we expect our citizens to act. 
   And with that, I am very proud to be a member of this organization and will continue to stand behind that basic and fundamental principle of fiscal responsibility.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPACE. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank my colleague for yielding the time. 
   I'm a first-year lawmaker here in Washington and came in with this new majority in a very partisan time in American political history, a time where too often we're preoccupied with political bickering, a time when we needed more people like PAUL GILLMOR on this floor. 
   PAUL befriended me. We, by chance, both flew out of the Columbus Airport to and from Washington, so we had a chance to sit and talk about nonlegislative matters, about our families, about some of the nonpolitical aspects of this job. And PAUL was one to give advice, despite the fact that we're on the opposite sides of the aisle. He provided me, as a good man would, with the wisdom he's obtained, and as a freshman, I was very grateful to him for his help. 
   I didn't know PAUL before being elected to the House last November, but we share many mutual friends. Harry Mishel is a dear friend of mine, a former president of the Ohio senate, was a good friend of PAUL'S and spoke very highly of PAUL. And I think it's a testament to the kind of person he is that he would engender that kind of friendship and support, regardless of where one stands on the political aisle. 
   One other small anecdote that I think sums PAUL up. A very good friend of mine worked in the Ohio caucus 20 years ago when PAUL was with the Ohio senate, and recently, this friend returned to Columbus and ran into PAUL who was there while on break here. And after 20 years, PAUL still remembered this man, not just his last name, but his first name, and greeted him as a friend after 20 years. 
   That's the kind of man PAUL GILLMOR was. That's the kind of man I will remember, and my deepest and heartfelt condolences from not just me but the many good folks of Ohio's 18th District go out to PAUL and his family. He and they are in our prayers.

   I would like to preface my remarks with my condolences to the family of Paul Gillmor as well, an Ohioan and a good man who will be missed. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3052, legislation to rename the post office in Cambridge, Ohio, after John Glenn. 
   I appreciate the bipartisan support the Ohio delegation has shown for passage of this legislation, and am excited to see this bill honoring a true American hero. 
   John Glenn was born in Cambridge, Ohio, a very small town in the beautiful rolling hills of Guernsey County. At a very young age, he moved to nearby New Concord, where he attended both high school and college. 
   After graduating from Muskingum College, John Glenn answered the call to military service. As a naval pilot, he served in both World War II and the Korean conflict, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross on six occasions and the Air Medal with 18 Clusters. 
   After leaving the military, John Glenn became a test pilot for the Naval Air Test Center. In 1957, he set a speed record by flying from Los Angeles to New York in 3 hours and 23 minutes. 
   It was his experience as a pilot that led to his most celebrated accomplishments in aeronautics. In 1959, John Glenn volunteered to become one of the original seven Mercury astronauts, the first manned space flight program in the United States. 
   Several years later, John Glenn embarked on his famous mission. In February of 1962, he became first man to orbit the Earth, completing that feat three times over. 
   John Glenn's marvels were not merely limited to aeronautical achievements. Following the end of his career in aeronautics, Ohio was the fortunate benefactor of John Glenn's public service. He served as a United States Senator with dignity and honor for 28 years before retiring. 
   As a freshman Member of Congress, I often look to examples to follow. I have had the good fortune of getting to know Senator Glenn in these last few months. 
   As an example of his courage and character, he tells a story of what he was feeling when he was about to be blasted into space 45 years ago.     
   I asked him, were you afraid? And he very candidly offered his response of yes, he was, but he did it because it was the right thing to do. He and his lovely wife, Annie, discussed the fact that there was a very good chance that he would not come back, and they did it anyway. He did it with courage and honor. He did it because it was right for this country. And at this time, in our history, I think it would serve all of us very well, Madam Speaker, to follow the example that John Glenn presented for us, the trails that he blazed. He is, in fact, the best that this country has to offer. He has shown courage in the face of adversity. He has shown selflessness for the sake of making our country a better place.  
   The Cambridge post office is one that has stood the test of time. For the better part of a century it has stood as a landmark in one of the central towns in my district. Moreover, the Cambridge post office serves the folks in the small town where John Glenn was born, and it's the same building in which John Glenn's distinguished military career began so many years ago when he registered for enlistment and service to his country. From this point onward it will bear a name of one that has brought much inspiration to the daily lives of Ohioans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPACE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Filner, as well as Ranking Member Buyer, for their cosponsorship on this legislation as well as for their work in bringing H.R. 3819, the Veterans Emergency Care Fairness Act, to the floor today. 
   This legislation has been about a year in the making. Last March, I received a letter from Terry Carson, CEO of Harrison Community Hospital in Cadiz, Ohio, a small town in the 18th Congressional District for the State of Ohio. Mr. Carson wrote to me about a problem he was experiencing in his 25-bed rural hospital when providing emergency care for veterans. 
   Currently, the VA reimburses non-VA hospitals for emergency care provided to veterans up to the point of stabilization. Once the patient is deemed stable enough to transfer, he or she is moved to a VA hospital. The problem that Mr. Carson brought to my attention is that oftentimes, veterans experience a waiting period for a bed in the VA hospital. During this limbo time, the VA is not required to reimburse the community hospital for care. Meanwhile, people like Mr. Carson feel morally obligated to continue care despite the fact that they cannot count on reimbursement. Worse even than non-VA hospitals footing the bill is the case of veterans who are paying out of pocket. 
   The Veterans Emergency Care Fairness Act closes this loophole by requiring the VA to cover the cost of care while the transfer to a VA hospital is pending and if the community hospital can document attempts to transfer the patient. 
   I believe this legislation is the best solution for the VA, community hospitals, and, most importantly, our Nation's veterans. To that end, this legislation is supported by the American Legion, the Disabled American Veterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Vietnam Veterans of America, the Ohio Hospital Association, the Air Force Sergeants Association, the Military Order of the Purple Heart, the Veterans Administration itself, and a bipartisan group of our colleagues here in the House. 
   This bill is a perfect example of how our system is supposed to work: a constituent contacts his Member of Congress, the Member listens, and an appropriate commonsense legislative fix is found. I'm proud to have had a chance to advocate for Mr. Carson, to advocate for the veterans he treats, and to advocate for the veterans across the country. 
   Once again, I would like to thank all of my colleagues in this bipartisan effort, and I urge all of those who have not joined thus far in supporting H.R. 3819.

   Mr. SPACE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1252, the Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act. 
   My district is currently experiencing some of the highest gas prices in its history. In several towns in my district, my constituents are paying prices as high as $3.49 per gallon to fill their tanks. 
   The price of gas is a crippling figure for the people of Southeastern Ohio who depend on their cars and trucks for transportation. Working families frequently commute long distances to reach their places of employment. For these families, the rise in gas prices is essentially an undeserved pay cut. 
   The farmers in my district also face the challenge of fueling their equipment on which they depend to make their modest profits. 
   I fear most for the fate of my district's retired and elderly populations. Most of these individuals are on a fixed income that already limits their ability to pay for the prescription drugs and medical visits they need. The rising price of gas places them only further into a bind and forces them to make decisions that no American should ever face. 
   I co-sponsored H.R. 1252 because I believe it is time for Congress to intervene on behalf of working Americans. This common-sense legislation simply ensures that oil companies play by the rules and offer consumers a fair price for gas, not one that takes advantage of circumstances. 
   I am a firm believer in the power of the marketplace to deliver the best possible services to American consumers. Free markets drive our economy and make it the most powerful in the world. However, when companies don't play by the rules, they must be punished because it is the consumer that ultimately suffers. 
   I believe that passage of this legislation offers important protections to the people of my district in their daily battle with the price of gas. I encourage my colleagues to lend their support as well.

   Currently, vocational rehabilitation benefits provided by the VA are not available to veterans until after they have been discharged from military service. This bill extends eligibility for vocational rehabilitation benefits to current members of the armed forces who are hospitalized or are undergoing out-patient medical care, who have a disability of at least 10 percent incurred or aggravated while on active duty, and who are likely to be discharged from service due to that disability. 
   As a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I am dedicated to providing our Nation's veterans with every service that they have earned and that they were promised. Access to vocational rehabilitation is part of what our Nation's heroes are entitled to, and this bill is a step in the right direction. 
   By supporting this bill, we are ensuring that wounded servicemembers can access rehabilitational benefits more quickly without having to wait for their paperwork to catch up to them. This bill will get our wounded vets back on their feet and reintegrated into the workforce sooner than is currently possible by providing them with vocational benefits while they are awaiting military discharge. Reintegration into the workforce is a key part of easing stability back into the lives of our servicemembers who have often spent months in incredibly tense and mentally-exhausting environments. Re-establishing a ``normal'' working routine at a pace that better suits our servicemembers is beneficial to all parties involved. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2239 because the bill provides our Nation's veterans with more timely access to a promised service as they transition back to civilian life.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPACE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 612, the Returning Servicemember VA Healthcare Insurance Act. 
   This bill extends the eligibility period for receipt of VA hospital care, medical services, and nursing home care for veterans who served in combat during--or after--the Persian Gulf War. 
   Currently, the eligibility period for these VA services is two years. This bill lengthens that two year time frame to five years from a veteran's date of discharge or release from service. 
   As we learn more and more about what are increasingly being referred to as the signature wounds of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom--Traumatic Brain Injury and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder--I believe that this extension of VA care is essential to this Congress' mission to provide comprehensive care to our nation's heroes. 
   Often, a servicemember's battle scars run deeper than what is visible to an outsider. While many bodily injuries sustained are apparent to the naked eye, TBI, PTSD, and other conditions are not easily observed. Diagnosis of these conditions may require lengthy, detailed evaluations by specialists over the course of time. Furthermore, some psychological disorders take months or even years to develop following a servicemember's release from duty. Some chronic physical conditions also take time to peak and subsequently diagnose. 
   By extending eligibility to VA care to five years, we are helping to ensure that fewer physical and mental wounds go undiagnosed and untreated. We are helping to ensure that the care that veterans seek out and receive is more complete by enabling the VA to address more of servicemembers' health needs. Most importantly, we are offering another way to better care for our nation's wounded warriors who have sacrificed the best years of their lives. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 612 because it is an improvement upon the current system.

Troops deployed in Iraq, specifically, encounter the widespread use of IEDs, which can cause Traumatic Brain Injury. Extended deployments put our troops at risk for longer periods of time. 
   H.R. 2199 brings together solutions to begin addressing the needs of our wounded warriors who have been diagnosed with TBI. The bill requires the VA to establish five centers for TBI research, education, and clinical activities. It also instructs the VA to establish a TBI screening program that would provide critical information to Congress regarding the number of veterans screened, the prevalence of TBI symptoms, and recommendations for improving care. H.R. 2199 dictates that the VA should create a comprehensive program for the long-term care and rehabilitation for veterans who suffer from TBI. The bill also requires the VA to create a Traumatic Brain Injury Veterans Health Registry to generate a list of those who served in Iraq and/or Afghanistan, who have symptoms of TBI, and who apply for VA medical care or file a disability claim. The VA can then notify those on the registry of significant developments in research on health consequences of serving in Iraq and/or Afghanistan. 
   Additionally, this bill authorizes funding for a pilot program of mobile VA centers for rural areas. These mobile VA centers would improve access to readjustment benefits as well as mental health services. The mobile centers would also assist veterans in making disability claims. 
   I represent a rural district comprised of small towns and villages. I know that my rural veterans' constituency desperately needs better access to VA services and care, and these mobile VA centers could be part of the solution. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill because it makes great strides in providing comprehensive care for our Nation's wounded warriors suffering from Traumatic Brain Injury.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPACE. Mr. Speaker, today this House will debate legislation that will help us fulfill our commitment to this Nation's service men and women, their families and our veterans. The Military Construction bill that comes to the floor today was unanimously approved out of the House Appropriations Committee last week. Not one Democrat or Republican opposed the measure. 
   That is because it provides the largest increase in funding for veterans health care in the 77-year history of the Veterans Administration and includes other historic funding increases designed to meet the changing need of our Armed Forces. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill unanimously passed out of the Appropriations Committee for a reason: it is a good bill and deserves the support of every Member of this House.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPACE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask support for the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007. I hail from Ohio's 18th Congressional District, a district of proud, hardworking people who understand the virtues of personal responsibility, a district whose constituency was betrayed in years past by a Member of this body who crossed a line. My predecessor is now in prison and he has been imprisoned for having, once again, betrayed his constituents and sold his vote. He became mired in and then consumed by a scandal involving lobbyists. This legislation helps further break the link that exists between lobbyists, legislators and the wealthy clients that lobbyists represent. It represents yet another positive step forward. It's not the end. It represents more of the beginning of a process whereby bribery will become deinstitutionalized from this body. It represents a process whereby we can make decisions in this body on an informed, rational basis designed specifically to benefit the good people who put us here. 
   Early on in this Congress, we banned trips and gifts and meals from lobbyists, a good first step. Now we are bringing transparency to the system. But it can't stop here. My colleague from Connecticut raises the prospect of an independent organization to review potential breaches of law, something that I associate myself with, but we need yet to go beyond even that with aggressive and comprehensive campaign finance reform. I support this measure because I think it represents a good first step along that process, but again I urge my colleagues to give serious consideration to taking it yet farther, and that is again with the deinstitutionalization of bribery through comprehensive campaign finance reform.

<DOCNO>Mr. SPACE. (EFFECTS OF TROOP DEPLOYMENTS -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPACE. I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for taking the lead on this initiative. 
   In assessing the cost of war, all too often we resort to cold, hard numbers. And we return to things like the financial cost of this war, how much is it costing this Nation or how many lives have we lost. Those are important considerations, obviously; but in assessing the cost of this war, I think it is important that we as a body, as an institution, point out that there are other costs. For example, the loss of international goodwill, the cost of veterans' care is a part of the cost of war, and what we are talking about tonight, the strain and the effect that the war has had on families. 
   As I see it, there are a lot of different ways to measure that. The most immediate and obvious is the trauma of deployment. Many families in this country today are uneasy as we speak, praying and worrying about their loved ones who are in a strange and foreign land subjected to hostile conditions. 
   The financial strain on these families is enormous. The marital strain is significant. The cost to a child who doesn't even know their parent, it affects entire families. 
   I, too, have a loved one serving now in his second tour of duty in Iraq. Zack  Space is his name as well, my cousin. I had the pleasure of spending some time with his folks Sunday in Ohio for Greek Orthodox Easter. We gathered as a family very mindful of little Zack's absence, and prayed for him. To see the concern and worry in his mother's eyes is moving and very visceral. 
   A second way of evaluating the cost and strain that this war has had on families is to look at the loss that those families have occasioned. We have heard some testimony today from some very able folks talking about the realities of war and those who are returning from war, the suicide rates, homelessness, drug and alcohol addiction, even the breakdown of the traditional family unit. They are all affected by the rigors of war. 
   And many of these attributes are due to post-traumatic disorder or traumatic brain injury that my colleagues have talked about today, lifelong conditions that will forever plague these families. 
   I would like to talk if I could for a moment about a couple of folks back home and some others that have had a really profound effect on me and my impressions of this war. One of them is Army Corporal Keith Nepsa, who at the age of 22 years was killed in June of 2007 from wounds sustained when an IED detonated near his vehicle in Iraq. Keith was from New Philadelphia, Ohio, in Tuscarawas County, and I know his father. I went to his funeral and again saw the look in their eyes as they laid their son to rest. They will forever be plagued by this war. Their lives will never be the same. 
   Another young man from my region, Marine Gunnery Sergeant Joshua Heck who was grievously injured on the battlefield last year, and I went to visit him in Walter Reed not long after his return to the States, a return of a shattered man who had lost limbs, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and doomed to a life much different than that which he took with him to Iraq. 
   I had the pleasure of meeting his wife, Brooke, and his mother who were at his side at Walter Reed bearing much of this burden. As a side note, Joshua, in his hospital bed when I went to visit him, it was at a time when we were debating the course of action that this Congress should take on the war. I asked him what he thought we should do. Having been there, I felt he was qualified to make that assessment and I welcomed his input. 
   When I asked him that question his response was: Sir, that's not for me to say. You tell me to fight, I fight. I'm a soldier. You tell me to stop and I stop. 
   And despite his broken body, his love for this country remained as strong as ever. I found it very moving and touching. 
   Under the leadership of Chairman Filner, our Veterans' Affairs Committee earlier this year held an Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee hearing on the care of the seriously injured after inpatient care. And at this hearing we received testimony from Sarah Wade, not of my district, but who came to testify on behalf of her husband, Sergeant Ted Wade, who had sustained traumatic brain injury.     
   And Sarah has been left with a completely different life than that which she had before her husband went off to war. He, and she, and their family, will forever be plagued by these injuries. 
   When young men and women are killed in this war, or come back grievously wounded, it's not just the soldier that suffers, it's their family. And it's not just the family that suffers, it's their community. Their communities grieve. 
   I'm blessed with a special district. Ohio's 18 district is one wonderful small town after another. The largest city I have in my district has about 25,000 people. And there are a lot of great things about living in a district like that. We're very community-oriented. There's a strong sense of personal responsibility. When good things happen to us, we celebrate together. When bad things happen, like the loss of a heroic soldier, like Corporal Nepsa, we grieve together as a community. Our community continues to grieve for him, as well as the 15 other young men who went to this war and will never come home. 
   This war has spread its tentacles in many different directions within our culture. As a Member of Congress, I'm sure I share this sentiment with all of those colleagues who are here with me today. We have a sacred obligation to make sure that we protect them while at war to the extent that we're able. But we also have an obligation to bring them home to their families and to their communities as soon as we are able. 
   I yield back.

   It is absolutely unacceptable that 50 percent of all family members of those who are deployed feel that they're not receiving the support they deserve. I thank the gentlewoman for bringing attention to it and beginning to address that problem.

<DOCNO>Mr. SPACE. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPACE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask you to support this historic rules package. The winds of change have brought me here. I don't think it is too much to say that my very presence before you constitutes a message to this body, a message sent from the good people of Ohio's 18th District. By these presence, I wish to deliver this message on behalf of my constituents. 
   The message is that the legislative process is broken. Rather than serving the needs of working families, this Congress has shown through past actions a preference for serving interests of the privileged few. Nowhere has this been more clear than in the influence wielded by lobbyists. The influence of lobbyists has compromised the reputation and even the health of this body. 
   In order to restore the integrity to this Chamber and restore America's faith in its elected officials, we must undertake substantial ethics reform. Our actions today will not only enhance the most fundamental principles of a democratic society; they will remind our constituents that we are a body of the people and not above the people. 
   The package before you will breach the circle of deceit between lobbyists, their wealthy clients, and this body. It represents long overdue real ethics reform. It bans House Members and their employees from accepting gifts from lobbyists and the organizations that hire them. It prohibits lobbyists from paying for or organizing Member travel, and it eliminates the all-too-common practice of legislative jet-setting. In short, the ethics package is the first step toward restoring integrity and beginning the process necessary to restore faith in our system of government. 
   Coming from a district whose previous Congressman became mired, and then consumed, by scandal, my fellow district residents and I understand all too intimately the perils associated with weak and loosely monitored ethics regulations. 
   We have suffered the frustration, disappointment, and anger associated with betrayal. We have suffered from not having a Member of Congress available to attend to the needs of the citizens of our district. But we are not alone. Other districts have suffered similar letdowns. That is inexcusable, and it is unconscionable. 
   At a moment in time when our Nation needs truly heroic leadership, as the challenges of the changing world continue to grow, this body has failed to step up and lead. The institution of Congress has failed to make clear its commitment to the principles of democracy; and it has frustrated, disappointed, and angered the American public. 
   The winds of change have, indeed, blown many among us into this Chamber, and there is much work to do. 
   We cannot begin our work in good faith without this declaration today that we are of, and not above, the American people. The time to act is now. We have an extraordinary burden to prove to those who have given us this honor. We must make clear to them that we are representing their interests, not bartering legislative favors in order to gain gifts and trips. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this important ethics reform package.

   Mr. SPACE. Madam Speaker, both high-ranking Pentagon officials and the White House have said that they were shocked to learn of the shoddy treatment wounded soldiers were receiving at Walter Reed. They say the first time they heard about this treatment was from The Washington Post investigation last month. 
   Madam Speaker, there is simply no way that the Bush administration did not know that this was a problem before the Post report. Several GAO reports have been conducted at the urging of Congress, and the findings of those reports back up exactly what we are now seeing at Walter Reed. 
   The Washington Post was also not the first media outlet to highlight this problem. Salon magazine reported on the mistreatment of soldiers at Walter Reed 2 years ago. 
   And yet the Bush administration continues to claim that it knew nothing about this until the Washington Post investigation last month. The administration is either completely out of touch or it simply does not believe taking care of our wounded military personnel is a top priority. Either way, it should be a top concern for this Congress and the American people.

   Mr. SPACE. I thank my colleague from Ohio for yielding time. 
   I would like to thank my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano) for his diligent work under very difficult circumstances for months on end. It was difficult for Mr. Capuano because many Members of this House did not believe that this resolution is necessary, despite what Mr. Capuano has referred to tonight as a problem with  public perception and a lack of transparency. The Members of this House, many of them, still do not get it. 
   Our current ethics process is filled with flaws: the conflicts of interest exist; only Members can file complaints; the public is left in the dark regarding investigations. We haven't been very good at policing ourselves. This resolution is necessary because, as Mr. Capuano mentions, the American public has lost faith in the institution of Congress, and we ignore that loss of faith at our own peril. 
   I come from one of those districts that has been referenced as one that sent a freshman here on the backs of public discontent. The people that I represent back in Ohio's 18th understand all too well the perils of public betrayal. 
   We have an obligation to restore the public trust. We started that last January with ethics legislation that helped sever the link between lobbyists and legislators. We need to continue with that movement today by looking at ourselves, by looking inward and creating a system that is nonpartisan, but is independent, and that will vet, initiate, and conduct investigations. This resolution does that. It represents a good start. I am proud to have worked on it with my fellow freshman colleagues, Mr. Hodes as well as Mr. Murphy, who will be offering support today, as well as many others. 
   Quite simply, Mr. Speaker, the public is fed up with the status quo. They want Members who break the rules to be investigated and brought to justice. My esteemed colleague from California today referenced that none of what we do matters if we do not have the trust of the public. This resolution helps restore that trust. I urge its support.

   Mr. SPACE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask you to support Federal funding of embryonic stem cell research. My remarks today are made, Mr. Speaker, both as a legislator and as a father. 
   My wife, Mary, and I are the proud parents of two beautiful children. My youngest child, my son, Nicholas is 16 years old. He is a great kid, typical in so many ways. He loves football, argues with his sister and struggles with the awkward challenges of adolescence. But Nicholas also suffers from juvenile diabetes. 
   For the last 10 years, he has waged a battle against this devastating disease, undergoing thousands of injections and blood tests. He has done so without complaint and without self pity as his parents, my wife and I, are extraordinarily proud. 
   As Nicholas approaches adulthood, Mr. Speaker, our family fears for what the future brings. For as difficult as this disease is to live with on a daily basis, most troubling of all is what potentially awaits someone who suffers from this disease: amputations, blindness, kidney failure, even premature death. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have before us not simply an opportunity to help my son and the millions of other Americans who depend upon the promise of this science; we have an obligation. This research represents the only meaningful hope for a cure in my son's lifetime. 
   While this measure is likely to pass, our President is likely to veto it. I am addressing my remarks not to the cameras, not to those who are inclined to vote for this legislation, but to those of you who do not have the will to stand up to a Presidential veto. We as a Congress must be resolute in making life better for our citizens. We are compelled to promote a society where the value of life rules supreme, where compassion prevails and where light overcomes darkness. 
   The measure before you does not destroy life; it potentially gives life to those who need it, and it affords purpose to embryos that are otherwise destined for destruction. There is no time to wait. For every hour we debate, lives are being lost. This is no Golden Dancer. This is indeed a golden opportunity.

   Mr. SPACE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Space-Hare-Welch-Altmire amendment to H.R. 1429. 
   Mr. Chairman, I believe that Head Start is critical for our Nation's working families. We are a Nation founded on equality and opportunity for all. All of our Nation's children deserve the opportunity to participate in early childhood development programs regardless as to the financial standing of their families. 
   Head Start programs in rural areas face many unique challenges in delivering services. The January 2007 report from the National Advisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services confirms the unfortunate reality that rural Head Start programs are, in many ways, disadvantaged. 
   Simply put, in rural and geographically isolated areas the distance between Head Start providers and participants is a significant mountain to climb. Especially as gas prices continue to stretch both program and household budgets, the cost of transportation can be prohibitive. These distances can also impede Head Start programs from reaching out to families eligible to participate. It is certainly a tragedy when families can't enjoy the opportunities offered by Head Start programs because they didn't know about them, not because they weren't there. 
   I am particularly concerned about barriers to parental involvement. I believe that parental involvement fostered by Head Start programs is incredibly important. There is no responsibility of our society more sacred or profound than raising our children. Bringing parents together to share in this experience strengthens our communities, creating bonds that can bring them closer together. 
   In rural areas, parental involvement is again a challenge. The realities of less advantaged areas can keep parents away from these programs. This is simply a missed opportunity to build our communities. 
   I believe that H.R. 1429 offers significant improvements to rural Head Start programs, and I applaud the work of my colleagues on the Committee on Education and Labor for making assistance to these areas a priority. 
   In particular, I wish to thank my colleague from Illinois (Mr. Hare) for his amendment in committee that draws attention to the challenges of teacher retention and the recruitment of new participants in our Nation's rural areas. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

This bill will help bridge the gap that exists between rural America and urban and suburban America.

   We have heard about distance learning and the affect that it has on the educational process. We have heard about telemedicine and the ability to deliver quality health care. Certainly it affects the ability of our first responders to coordinate efforts in the event of disasters or emergencies.

   I rise today to remember a dear friend and dedicated legislator, Stephanie Tubbs Jones. She was a tireless advocate for justice, a dedicated mother, and a terrific legislator and a fighter for the people of Ohio. 
   It will be very difficult for me to match the eloquence of someone like Chairman Rangel, certainly the gentlelady from Toledo, the gentleman from Canton, or my friend Mr. Kucinich from Cleveland. But Dennis said something during his presentation that struck me as being extraordinarily accurate. 
   Stephanie did represent this magical, political persona that was meddled between her keen legal mind and her street sense. She had compassion, knowledge. She was just a great person and a great legislator. She was a trail blazer, as those from the Ohio delegation have pointed out, in many respects. 
   But something that many might not know is that Stephanie actually had an effect on the people in congressional district, which is, while sharing the same State of Ohio, a very long way from east Cleveland. Stephanie served as an inspiration for women in politics, as well as our African American community there as well. She fought for justice and equality at every turn in her career, and this was a tragic loss for the people of Congress and the people of Ohio.

This legislation will complete a long-overdue reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, bringing the promise of opportunity to countless young Americans. I commend Chairman MILLER and Ranking Member MCKEON for their work on this critical legislation. 
   In particular, I wish to thank Chairman MILLER and Ranking Member MCKEON for including in this conference report provisions from legislation I introduced, H.R. 4139, the College and University Rural Education Act. This legislation will help to foster new opportunities and a higher quality of life for residents of rural America. 
   The provisions that I mention authorize grants to rural serving institutions to improve access to higher education in rural America, and also to create employment pipelines that benefit the community. These grants can be used by rural-serving institutions to collaborate with regional school districts to improve access to higher education for high school graduates in rural America, where participation lags. Additionally, these grants can be used to create other outreach programs that will bring more nontraditional students back into the classroom. 
   These grants can also be used to create new employment pipelines for professions of need in the region. By providing support for the development of new training programs for high-need occupations, as well as opportunities for students to attain professional development in these occupations, this legislation goes a long way towards improving the quality of life in rural America. 
   Again, I wish to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for all their hard work on this crucial legislation. I also want to thank Congressmen HARE and LOEBSACK for their original cosponsorship for the legislation and support throughout the process. Finally, I want to offer my thanks to all the staff on the Committee for their tireless efforts to improve opportunities for residents of rural areas.

<DOCNO>Mr. SPACE. (HOPEWELL CULTURE NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPACE. Mr. Speaker, it is with great excitement that I share my support for H.R. 2197, the Hopewell Culture National Historical Park Boundary Adjustment Act, with the House today. Passage of this legislation will help to ensure the protection of a national archaeological treasure in Ohio's 18th Congressional District. 
   I would like to begin by offering my thanks to Chairmen RAHALL and GRIJALVA for their gracious assistance in assuring this legislation was heard both by the Committee and the House of Representatives. The House is fortunate to have the service of both of these Members. 
   H.R. 2197 permits the expansion of the boundaries of Hopewell Culture National Historical Park in two areas. Hopewell Culture National Historical Park is home to historical remains of the Hopewell Culture, a culture of Native Americans that thrived between the years of 200 BC and 500 AD. This culture was known for the creation of large enclosures characterized by earthen walls, many of which still stand today. 
   The proposed border expansion is not an arbitrary one. Earlier this year, a parcel of land known as Spruce Hill became available for sale. Spruce Hill is home to many archaeological remains of interest to historians and archaeologists, and significant natural phenomena that piqued the interest of the environmental community. In fact, legislation passed by Congress in 1980 ordered the Department of the Interior to perform a study on the relevance of Spruce Hill to the Hopewell culture for the purposes of a possible expansion. The report, released in 1998, found that Spruce Hill is an ``outstanding example of a particular class of Hopewellian monumental architecture,'' confirming the importance of adding this land to the Park. 
   Spruce Hill was scheduled for public auction by the owner last June. I, like many of the residents of Ross County, were concerned that this land might be transferred to an owner uninterested in preserving its historical treasures. Fortunately, a land trust created by a group of concerned citizens and other interested parties were successful in raising enough funds to purchase the land before it was put up for auction. I am pleased to say that the land is currently in safe hands. 
   H.R. 2197 will allow the federal government to expand the borders of Hopewell Culture National Historical Park to include Spruce Hill, ensuring it takes it proper place within the boundaries of a park meant to commemorate an important chapter in the history of America. 
   Historians will tell you that the Hopewell culture is a chapter of American history in need of further exploration. Dr. Brad Lepper of the Ohio Historical Society testified before the Subcommittee on National Parks in June that Spruce Hill was an untapped resource that could offer answers to many historical questions about this culture, and even raise new questions of interest. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in passage of H.R. 2197 today. Its passage is both timely and critical to the protection of our culture.

   Mr. SPACE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great pride in congratulating Chillicothe, Ohio, our great State's first capital, in being named Ohio's Best Hometown in the November issue of Ohio Magazine. 
   A small town rich in history and nestled within the beautiful foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in southern Ohio, Chillicothe represents the very embodiment of everything that's right about middle America. 
   In recent years, the city has gone through an impressive transformation. It has completed a large expansion of its high school. Adena Hospital is consistently ranked as one of the top rural hospitals in the country. And the OU-Chillicothe campus has grown by over 25 percent in the last 2 years. 
   More and more people are discovering what we have known for a long time, that southeastern Ohio and southern Ohio and towns like Chillicothe offer a great place to live and a great place to raise a family. 
   I would like to congratulate Mayor Joe Sulzer and the rest of my friends in Chillicothe on this great honor.

<DOCNO>Mr. SPACE. (APPALACHIAN REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPACE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 496, as amended, a bill to authorize appropriations for the Appalachian Regional Commission for 5 years. 
   As we all know, the ARC was established to address the unique problems faced by the isolated Appalachian region that separates it from the economic mainstream. Although this small, well-organized, and well-run agency has accomplished a great deal over its 35-year existence, much more needs to be done. For this reason I enthusiastically support the legislation and the continuation of the ARC. 
   ARC programs affect 406 counties located in 13 States, including all of West Virginia and parts of Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. This region covers nearly 200,000 square miles and contains approximately 22 million people. Using criteria based on national averages for income, unemployment, and poverty rates, the ARC administers its programs. Currently of ARC's 406 counties, 114 are considered distressed. 
   ARC'S decision making and service delivery is so efficient that the ARC served as a model for the Delta Regional Authority. The partnership between the Federal Government and the States rests on true shared decision making between the Federal co-chair and the States with funding decisions devolving back to the States. The ARC is successful because it responds to identified and agreed-upon needs and is extremely flexible in its approach. This bill also authorizes the designation of at-risk counties and identifies the percentage of funds for which these counties are eligible. 
   The bill allows the ARC to continue its economic development activities. I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for including provisions I offered during the committee's markup to establish a new economic and energy development initiative. This provision authorizes $65 million over the next 5 years for  projects that increase the use of renewable energy resources in the region to promote alternative transportation fuels, electricity, and heat. 
   We all know that economies require energy and infrastructure to thrive. And I believe that alternative energy production will breathe life into the struggling areas of Appalachia. In addition to these potential alternative energy resources, the Appalachian region possesses an extensive industrial manufacturing base that is already engaged in some of these emerging energy technologies, particularly wind turbine components, solar components, photovoltaic panels, and biofuel plants. 
   This provision will enable ARC to fund projects that utilize the region's natural resources in a positive way and to promote the development of renewable energy. We will be invigorating the economies of our Appalachian counties while working to gain energy independence.     
   That is a principle that all of us agree is important. 
   Let me end by saying that what we're doing today is consistent with the forward-looking approach that President John Kennedy employed when he first created the Appalachian Regional Commission in the early 1960s. After witnessing firsthand an Appalachia that was home to, in his words, ``hungry children, old people who cannot pay their doctors' bills, families forced to give up their farms,'' President Kennedy vowed to create a bold, new approach to ridding the region of poverty. Today we're attempting to carry on that legacy. We are boldly seeking to employ 21st-century technologies to bring economic development to a region that for decades has been underserved. 
   I support this bill and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill because it goes a long way to enabling the ARC to fulfill its mission. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPACE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   This bill helps rectify some of the injustices and inequities that exist in this country with respect to rural America and in particular rural Appalachian America. We who live in Appalachian America understand all too well that we suffer from disadvantages, access to education, access to health care and access to technology put us at a distinct disadvantage. With the price of gas now at $4 plus per gallon, we don't generally have public transportation. We generally have to drive farther to where we need to be, work, school and the doctor. The price of gas has just made this discrepancy all the more onerous and difficult for the folks of Appalachia to bear. 
   Recently, I had the experience of visiting a food line in Zanesville, Ohio, and a food distribution line in Logan, Ohio, where lines of hungry people in Logan over 2 miles long, cars lined up on the side of the road waiting to participate in food drives. We're talking about people that have worked all their lives, senior citizens that can no longer afford to put food on the table. We're talking about young mothers who are working full time yet can't afford to feed their children. This bill will help address many of the inequities and injustice that John Kennedy identified in Appalachia in the early 1960s. 
   In many ways, those same injustices are still present, and these funds represent vital sources of funding for the people that we represent, ``we'' being those of us from Appalachia. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SPACE. (COIN MODERNIZATION AND TAXPAYER SAVINGS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPACE. Madam Speaker, I'd like to thank the gentleman from Illinois, Subcommittee Chairman Gutierrez, for his cooperation and assistance in this legislation. I would also like to thank the ranking member, Mr. Paul from Texas, as well. And I would further like to extend my gratitude to Chairman Frank and Ranking Member Bachus for their work in advancing this important piece of legislation that will, in fact, eliminate wasteful governmental spending, saving the taxpayers a billion dollars over the next 10 years. 
   Right now, our government is needlessly throwing away money in the production of coins. Estimates, as have been indicated, suggest that we're spending 1.7 cents or more per penny  produced in this country, as well as 9.5 cents per nickel. 
   The content of a penny, as it exists now, is roughly 97 1/2 percent zinc, with the balance copper. The content of a nickel is roughly 25 percent nickel and 75 percent copper. And during the last 5 years, we've seen huge increases in the price of copper, nickel and zinc. As Subcommittee Chairman Gutierrez indicated, that is attributable to excess demand throughout the world on those metals, along with speculation in the market. This legislation is designed with an eye toward common sense to save, again, roughly $100 million per year over the next 10 years. 
   Wasteful spending is especially egregious at a time when Americans are facing the pitfalls of an economic downturn. This legislation will begin the process of eliminating this wasteful spending by mandating changes in the content of the penny and the nickel and giving the Treasury a louder voice in the process. 
   Based on production numbers, again I want to emphasize these changes will save taxpayers $1 billion over the next 10 years. The legislation will also help Congress be more responsive to market changes in the value of different metals over time, helping it to be more efficient and precise in its expenditures. 
   The savings can be spent to put money into our schools, improve our infrastructure, increase access to health care, all the things that many Americans--certainly Americans I represent back in Ohio's 18th District--desperately need. 
   As a Congress, we have a responsibility to use our funds in a responsible fashion. This legislation is a step toward more responsible spending and represents a bipartisan effort to work together on a measure that encompasses a high degree of common sense. Refreshing.

<DOCNO>Mr. SPACE. (MEDICARE, MEDICAID, AND SCHIP EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPACE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the legislation before us that will help both seniors and children alike receive the health care that they deserve, and continue our national investment in combating chronic disease. 
   I am particularly pleased to see that the legislation includes an extension of the Special Diabetes Program, which affords critical research funding to research into type one diabetes. Every year, thousands of parents receive the tragic news that their child will have to bear the burden of juvenile diabetes. With this news comes the realities of a life permanently changed by a disease for which we currently have no cure. 
   As I have shared with the House before, I am one of these parents. Nearly a decade ago, my wife and I learned that my son Nick would have to face the challenge of type one diabetes. We have been blessed and fortunate that Nick has lived an active and normal life. His successes are in large part thanks to the insulin pump he wears and other innovations that help type one diabetes patients manage their disease. 
   While Nick and so many other children have been able to manage their disease, they still worry about their future. It is the obligation of Congress to work towards finding a cure. The Special Diabetes Program provides the guarantee of continued, groundbreaking research into this disease. The yields of this research hold unquestioned promise for a better future. 
   I am disappointed that the extension of the program prescribed in this legislation is only one year. An overwhelming bipartisan group of my colleague in both the House and Senate expressed support for a longer extension of the program. Unfortunately, those who carry the weight of type one diabetes were casualties of partisan warfare over other, unrelated issues. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues next year to ensure a longer renewal of this legislation. Congress has an obligation to lead the charge against this disease. I know that we can meet this challenge if we work together.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPACE. I thank the gentleman from Oregon. 
   Home foreclosures are, unfortunately, something that Ohioans face far too frequently. Ohio ranks near the top in the Nation in foreclosures. In this year alone, approximately 61,000 families will have their homes foreclosed upon. These are families who have fallen victim to unscrupulous subprime lending brokers, who have fallen victim to failing health, and who have fallen victim to a changing economy, one where we have seen our manufacturing base eroded, our cost of the living through gas and utilities increasing, and stagnant wages. The phantom tax on forgiven debt adds injury to insult, especially to working families who have undergone the trauma of a foreclosure. 
   I am very grateful for Chairman Rangel's leadership on this issue and thankful that our leadership as the Democratic Party has taken up this cause as well. And, furthermore, I am gratified at the bipartisan support that this body has demonstrated in its commitment to tax relief for middle-class and working families.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPACE. I thank the gentleman from California for yielding his time. I would like to thank our chairman, COLLIN PETERSON, and Ranking Member Goodlatte for their hard work on this good, bipartisan piece of legislation that does a lot of good things. 
   It enhances conservation. It provides a safety net that our farmers need to do the work that is so important to this country. It does some very exciting things with energy. And in the end, it allows these small family farms that make up most of southern and eastern Ohio to meet their margins in a very difficult profession. But it does something more than that. It helps meet the growing needs associated with poverty; rising food prices, a diminishing manufacturing base, rising costs of living. 
   Seventy-five percent of this bill is devoted toward nutrition, being mindful of the fact that most of those who will be fed pursuant to the nutritional programs of this bill constitute the working poor. In my district many of the counties have poverty rates exceeding 20 percent and unemployment rates at 6 or 7 percent. This means that thousands of people in my district alone are working full-time but can't afford to feed their families. This bill will help mitigate that crisis. 
   This bill is good for farmers. It helps diminish the effects of poverty and fight the ever-growing fight against poverty in this country and will allow for the farmers of this country to continue to provide the safest, cheapest  and most abundant source of agriculture on the planet.

   Mr. SPACE. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007. For me, reform isn't a political talking point. As the successor of Bob Ney and, to a certain degree, to the illegal actions of Jack Abramoff, it is an absolute necessity. 
   I campaigned on the promise that I would do everything in my power to clean up Washington. This Congress has begun to do that. Earlier this year  we enacted a sweeping set of reforms banning gifts, travel and meals from lobbyists. By passing this ban, we made serious inroads into breaking that link that exists between lobbyists and legislators. 
   Now, today, we broaden our campaign to let the sun shine in on a broad scope of lobbyist activities. It is what the American people have demanded, and it is what they deserve.     
   If nothing unethical is taking place, then these requirements will reassure the American public, which is itself a worthy endeavor. But if inappropriate actions are happening, then we have a responsibility, no, an obligation, to crack down on those activities. 
   This bill is not perfect. We have a long way to go in our efforts to restore credibility in this body, but it reflects our serious effort to create transparency, honesty and leadership on this issue. 
   My constituents have been betrayed before, and I will not let that happen again.

   Mr. SPACE. Madam Chairman, I rise today in opposition to the Kind amendment, and I do so on behalf of the farmers of Ohio's 18th Congressional District. They are a very diverse bunch, but one thing they all have in common is that they are small, family-run operations. 
   They asked for several things in this farm bill: conservation, energy, and a safety net. This bill as it has come out of committee provides those things that will allow those farmers to continue to do business. Those farmers operate on extremely narrow margins, and without a safety net that mitigates their risks, they can no longer do business. 
   Madam Chairman, the people of this country are already experiencing increased rates for gasoline, for utilities, for health care. The last thing that we can afford in this country is to see a spike in the price of food. 
   Madam Chairman, I rise once again in opposition to the Kind amendment and in favor of the bill as it has come out of the committee.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPACE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the SCHIP bill that we will, again, today, be passing with bipartisan support. This is a bill which is not intended to be a handout. This is not a form of welfare. This is legislation that will provide assistance to working families, specifically 10 million children of working families who have had a very difficult time in today's economy, a difficult time with high gas prices, high prices of natural gas, electricity, struggling to make ends meet. 
   In Ohio we lead the Nation in foreclosures or are near the top. We're near the top in bankruptcy. In Ohio's 18th district there's an air of desperation, given the loss of manufacturing jobs. 
   The working families of this country need help. And this is a chance to give it to them. To call this a magnet for illegal immigration, to classify this legislation as Washington, D.C.-based health care is a gross misstatement of the facts, and nothing more than a red herring. 
   The truth is this legislation will enhance the lives, the quality of lives of 10 million young Americans. We have an obligation as a government to do that. 
   I thank those Republicans with the courage to vote to override the almost certain looming dark cloud of a Presidential veto and urge those with the foresight and courage to do so again as we proceed on this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPACE. Madam Chairman, the steel industry has a proud tradition in this country. For over 150 years, steel production has been an important symbol of American strength and a critical source of American jobs. 
   In recent decades, the American steel industry has faced an increasingly difficult landscape. Short-sighted free-trade agreements and illegal dumping policies set in place by foreign countries have placed American steel on an uneven playing field with foreign competitors. Facilities have been forced to close, at the expense of countless American jobs. 
   In no place is this change in the industry more apparent than in my home of Ohio. Both my father and my grandfather found gainful employment in steel mills that now lie vacant and unused. Without question, Appalachian Ohio has felt the burden of global shifts in the economy, and I worry about the future of the jobs that remain. 
   This amendment will ensure that American taxpayer dollars are used to support American industries and jobs. At a time when other countries like China are using questionable policies to develop an unfair advantage, there must be a mandate to use American steel with any federal funds. I am proud to lend my support to this amendment and the American steel industry.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SPACE. Mr. Chairman, I would like to begin by thanking Chairman GEORGE MILLER for his work on behalf of rural communities in H.R. 4137. Specifically, I would like to thank Chairman MILLER for including provisions from H.R. 4139, the Colleges and Universities Rural Education (CURE) Act, in this important bill. 
   I would also like to extend my thanks to Ranking Member MCKEON for his hard work on the legislation, as well as the staff of the Committee on Education and Labor. 
   Rural communities face a unique set of challenges in developing a highly-skilled workforce. Limited access to higher education makes advanced training more difficult to attain for the millions of Americans living in rural areas around the country. While we all should take pride in the work of our nation's public schools and teachers in providing a quality education to American children, the need for training beyond a basic high school diploma is clearly critical. 
   I see this deficit every day in southeastern Ohio. Some communities struggle to fill critical professions, particularly in the medical community, due to the rural nature of their district and the lack of training opportunities in a reasonable proximity. 
   To rectify this deficit, I introduced H.R. 4139, the CURE Act. This important legislation authorizes grants to the colleges serving rural America to create partnerships with rural school districts to improve access to higher education for rural high school graduates. These grants will provide important access to financial aid opportunities as well as programs on college campuses that will help to encourage students to pursue higher education when they might otherwise not. 
   Additionally, this legislation authorizes grants for rural colleges to develop training programs in needed professions, and develop partnerships with employers in the area to develop employment pipelines. These grants will help rural communities struggling to fill the positions needed to maintain a quality of life, such as doctors and teachers. 
   Again, I wish to commend Chairman Miller for his willingness to see the challenges facing rural America and work to improve the quality of life for those communities. On behalf of my colleagues and I who represent rural America, I extend my truest and utmost thanks.

<DOCNO>Mr. SPACE. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SPACE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share with you my belief that we, as a people, are at a crossroads unlike any in our history. We have seen our manufacturing-based economy assaulted by the forces of globalization, the challenges of the ensuing revolution and energy production squarely upon us, and we are at the dawning of a new understanding, the fragileness of our environment. All of these things are, in their own right, seminal concerns of a profound scale, but in spite of the gravity and import of these issues, there is perhaps no more compelling matter before us than that of the war in Iraq. 
   My colleagues on both sides of the aisle are distressed by the tragic turns that this war has taken. I do not, at this moment, nor do my colleagues, I presume, wish to draw upon the motivations or lack of candor exhibited by our President in letting slip the dogs of war. But I do long for leadership, leadership seasoned and honest enough to admit when a mistake has been made, leadership that has a vision for the future, leadership able to meld the inherent wisdom of man with the realities of the modern world. 
   Under our form of government, it is the President who is singularly endowed with this leadership; yet at this critical historical moment, our call for leadership and inspiration has been unmet. As a result, Mr. Speaker, I today voice my opposition to the President's plan to deploy additional troops to Iraq. 
   The crisis that Iraq has become will not be resolved merely with more, more, more, more troops, more tours and deployment extensions, more injuries, more deaths. Simply providing more without a blueprint is not enough. Without a clear plan and a clear objective, a troop increase will not help our Iraq policy. In fact, it will only deepen the disaster that Iraq has become. 
   I do not utter these thoughts lightly. I share these sentiments, knowing that all of the people that I represent will not necessarily agree with me. I fear that my remarks will be misconstrued as reflecting something less than a full commitment to the brave men and women who have served or are serving their country in uniform, or to those heroes who have given their very lives for this cause. 
   Let there be no mistake, Mr. Speaker, I have at the very heart of my motivation for these remarks a sincere appreciation for the sacrifice of our brothers and sisters who have been dispatched to fight this war. They, and their families by extension, have been called into action under trying circumstances, and I am profoundly moved by their sense of courage and dedication to country. In fact, it is my admiration and respect for our brave warriors that motivate my decision to express my dissatisfaction with the President's plan to subject more of them to the ravages of war. 
   To date, over 3,000 Americans have fallen in this war. All of them loved  their country enough to place themselves in harm's way in her defense. All of them left behind their families, who will never stop grieving. All of them have been deprived of the pleasures and privileges of a full life, just as we who remain have been deprived of the contributions to our society that each would have given. 
   Fifteen young men from Ohio's district have died in this war, all of them were loved dearly. They are fathers, sons, brothers, and husbands. Ohio's 18th is exclusively rural in makeup, dotted by one small town and village after another. Our people are decent, hardworking, and imbued with a strong sense of personal responsibility. Our community is close knit and supportive. The death of each one of these brave soldiers was met with a deep sense of communal grief. 
   This resolution stresses a message that many believed in. We support our troops, we support their commitment to and sacrifice for our Nation, we support their families and those of the fallen in their silent and eternal heartache. We cannot fully understand their pain, but perhaps we can learn from it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I cannot support a troop surge without real answers as to how it will bring success in Iraq. I cannot support escalation without regard to diplomacy, without regard to the political realities of the region, and without regard to the underlying dynamics of this conflict. 
   There is an unspoken pledge between a soldier of war and the mechanisms of power. That warrior unquestioningly serves, defends and, if need be, dies. In consideration, he expects his government to only place him in harm's way when need be, and only through a painstakingly thought-out plan for victory. 
   Our troops have fulfilled their pledge to our country. It is time that our country fulfill its pledge to our troops.
