<DOCNO>Mr. CARDOZA. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1528, NEW ENGLAND NATIONAL SCENIC TRAIL DESIGNATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, House Resolution 940 provides for consideration of H.R. 1528, the New England National Scenic Trail Designation Act, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate, equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Natural Resources. The rule makes in order two Republican amendments submitted to the Rules Committee by the ranking member of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands, Mr. Bishop of Utah. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except for clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. Finally, the rule provides one motion to recommit, with or without instructions. 
   Madam Speaker, the bill before us today, H.R. 1528, amends the National Trails System Act to designate most of the MMM Trail System as the New England National Scenic Trail. 
   The MMM Trail System extends from the Massachusetts border with New Hampshire through western Massachusetts and Connecticut toward the Long Island Sound. The highly popular trail system has existed for over 50 years and is predominantly managed and maintained by volunteers. 
   The trail system travels through important historical landmarks and harbors a range of diverse ecosystems and natural resources, including mountain summits, waterfalls, and critical habitats for endangered species. 
   In a recent feasibility study, the National Park Service recommended that the trail system be designated as a national scenic trail, with some adjustments and rerouting for a total of 220 miles. However, this study has been out since the spring of 2006; and while no changes are expected, it has been trapped in a giant morass of bureaucratic red tape that has not been finalized. 
   H.R. 1528 is simply about cutting through this red tape and getting Federal recognition and administrative support for a trail that is already extremely popular and well managed. 
   H.R. 1528 includes specific language protecting private property rights, and landowner cooperation in the national scenic trail designation is entirely voluntary. All landowners affected by the trail have the opportunity to have the trail rerouted around their property. 
   Furthermore, since no Federal land is involved, Federal designation of the land has no impact on State or local laws currently in place, including those governing hunting, fishing, or trapping or local zoning or other land use issues. 
   Madam Speaker, this designation is widely supported. It is supported by  the administration and the local communities across New England, and it has bipartisan congressional support, including the Representatives of all affected districts in Connecticut and Massachusetts. 
   In closing, I'd like to thank Chairman Rahall, Chairman Grijalva, and Mr. Olver for their hard work in bringing this legislation to the floor today so we can ensure that America's most treasured resources are protected for future generations. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for his kind words that he opened his statement with. 
   He mentioned throughout the statement that we might not be here if we were under suspension. I feel that under suspension of the rules, we would not be able to hear any of the debate that Mr. Bishop is going to offer on his two amendments. So, we are actually, in fact, allowing Mr. Bishop to make his amendments before the House of Representatives.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Reclaiming my time, Madam Speaker, the gentleman did make that offer in Rules. However, it should be noted that Mr. Bishop is the ranking member of his subcommittee. He had an opportunity to amend this bill in committee. He did not choose to offer but one amendment in committee, is my understanding, and then he came to the Rules Committee at the last minute with seven amendments. 
   The Rules Committee is allowing two amendments to be offered on the floor today. I think that's a fair hearing for the gentleman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. I would like to just get through a few of my points, if I may. 
   The gentleman also brought up the issue of whether or not this bill has any effect on eminent domain. And I can tell you that there is absolutely no authority in H.R. 1528 for the National Park Service to take land by eminent domain, nor does the Service have any authority in local zoning issues that might affect national scenic trails. 
   Further, H.R. 1528 explicitly states that ``the United States does not acquire for trail any land or interest in land without the consent of the owner.'' In fact, this bill is an opt-in bill; you have to agree to have your land put into this act and used in this way. 
   The second part of the gentleman's statement with regard to earmarks, I'd like to just refer the gentleman to the committee report, page 7, the earmark statement. And in the committee report it states that ``H.R. 1528 does not contain any congressional earmarks.'' This is an authorization bill, not an appropriation bill. Further, the report states that it does not contain any limited tax benefits or limited tariff benefits as defined in clause 9(d), 9(e), or 9(f) of rule XXI.'' It states that very clearly in the committee report. 
   Finally, the bill does allow two private groups that manage the trail currently, and this is the entire point of the bill, to receive Federal technical assistance. And that is in the way of educational experience or technical assistance to manage the trail, not resources to manage the trail. 
   So, I would say that there is no earmark whatsoever in this legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I agree totally with one statement that Mr. Dreier, my colleague and friend from California, said, and that is that Mr. Bishop often comes up with brilliant ideas. Today we are allowing two of those brilliant ideas to be debated on the floor. 
   With regard to some of the other issues that were raised, I already read into the Record the fact that the committee has certified that there are no earmarks in this bill. Mr. Bishop says, well, there's a potential to have grants later on down the road. My understanding of grants is that they come from the administration, not from Congress. And if we start talking about every grant that is given by the Federal Government or the U.S. Government to the myriad of people who receive them throughout this country, that is a process that Congress has set up for a number of years. That has never before been the definition of an earmark, to my knowledge. So if that's the new definition of earmarks, that's news to me. 
   But I don't believe, based on the committee's certification, what I have heard, the testimony I have heard, there are any earmarks in this bill. That is what has been reported in the report, and I believe that to be the case. 
   Secondly, as I have previously stated as well, this bill is a voluntary measure where landowners have the absolute right to opt in or out. And so I can't see where there is coercion. There is agreement among the delegations in the affected regions, our House colleagues. 
   I believe that this is a good measure and it should go forward, and I would encourage my colleagues to support the rule. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his debate today. I disagree vehemently that his rendition of the earmark process is an accurate one. I don't believe that last Congress's rules on earmarks were stricter and more transparent than this Congress's. In fact, I believe that the country knows that the earmark process has gotten more transparent under the Democrats and that we have far fewer earmarks in the current process than we had previously. I think voters spoke about that in the last election. 
   I would just go on to say, Madam Speaker, that 40 years ago, the National Trails System Act was established to provide a system of trails for outdoor recreation and the enjoyment of scenic, historic, and naturally significant areas. H.R. 1528 adheres to these very long-established values. It ensures that the sweeping, natural landscapes across New England remain protected and untouched so they may be enjoyed by our children and grandchildren for years to come. It deserves strong support by all Members on the floor today, and I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and a ``yes'' vote on the previous question.

   Mr. CARDOZA. I thank my friend and gentleman from Florida. 
   Madam Speaker, as a fiscally conservative Blue Dog Democrat, I rise in strong support of reinstating pay-as-you-go budgeting and the rules that accompany it. 
   As Blue Dogs, we believe, as do the American people, that restoring fiscal responsibility in Washington is an urgent national priority. For far too long now under the previous leadership of this Congress and of the current White House, we have seen reckless fiscal policies that have undermined the future of America's economy. Now the time has come to take our country in a new and responsible direction. 
   PAYGO rules are the centerpiece of the Blue Dog 12-point reform plan for putting an end to deficit spending. We know PAYGO rules work because they have in the past. During the 1990s, with PAYGO rules in place, the massive deficits that we were seeing at that time were converted into record surpluses. We saw the greatest period of economic growth and prosperity in American history. We can do that again, and we must. This will do, in fact, that.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARDOZA. (HONORING THE LIFE OF ERNEST GALLO -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in full support of House Concurrent Resolution 88, honoring the life and many achievements of Ernest Gallo. 
   I am proud to say that Ernest Gallo was not only a constituent of mine but he was also a dear friend. Over the years I served in the California State legislature and here in Congress, Ernest's deep commitment to California and to winemaking was a constant presence that guided many of my legislative efforts. 
   Decades ago Ernest Gallo, along with his brother Julio, recognized the great potential of the San Joaquin Valley, with its temperate weather and its extraordinary fertile soil, to foster the growth of a strong domestic wine industry. They cultivated the Gallo Winery from a small plot of land with just a few grape varieties to a multinational beverage company that ranks as the second largest in the world. 
   My district, California's 18th Congressional District, grows nearly 250 different crops, from asparagus to sweet potatoes, and is home to a number of agricultural businesses, some small and some quite large. But not one business has had more impact on the rich tapestry of the valley than Gallo Winery. 
   The Gallo Winery provides hundreds of my constituents with high-skill employment opportunities and serves as a solid foundation for continued growth in the region. The Gallo family has contributed to countless community projects throughout the valley and to medical research projects devoted to curbing alcoholism. 
   Ernest Gallo and the Gallo Winery revolutionized the U.S. wine industry. But what was once a boutique industry reserved for the upper crust of society is now a billion dollar business that equalizes social classes by allowing the masses to participate in wine drinking and winemaking. 
   In his youth, Ernest and his brother Julio recognized an unmet need in the wine industry. Demonstrating his acute business skills, Ernest quickly capitalized on the market gap and set about to create inexpensive wines for the enjoyment of all citizens. The trend of affordable wines caught on, and quickly Gallo Winery became one of the most respected companies in the business. 
   For agriculture, the impact has been just as immense. The success of the Gallo Winery was one of the catalysts to bringing much-needed attention to the other side of American agriculture, that which was taking place outside of the traditional farming that was done in the Midwest. 
   Furthermore, Gallo's commitment to environmentally sustainable farming permeates the wine grape growing industry even today and will surely be the standard for years to come. 
   Ernest and the entire Gallo family have long partnered with the surrounding community, especially with the city of Modesto, to give back in a number of generous ways. For instance, the Gallo Arts Center in Modesto, which is under construction now, once completed will attract quality arts and entertainment performances where there had been virtually none before. For the first time, valley residents can participate in the cultural experiences on par with our urban neighbors. 
   However, above all, beyond Ernest's commitments and achievements in his professional life, he must also be lauded for his personal story. He was the son of Italian immigrants who  started out with nothing and, armed with little else than a brochure in winemaking from the local library, he grew the Gallo Winery empire. 
   Ernest Gallo is one of the finest examples of an American success story. Our culture praises individuals like Ernest, and rightly so. It is what we teach our children and our children's children, that you can take nothing for granted, that you always must take what you are given, and in Ernest's case it was his keen business sense, and turn that gift into something substantial. 
   I am proud to have represented Ernest Gallo all these years and even more proud to have called him my friend. He will be remembered fondly for his contributions to the industry, to agriculture, and to the community. 
   I thank my colleagues for their consideration.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARDOZA. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 502, LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, House Resolution 502 provides for consideration of H.R. 2771, the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act of 2008, under a structured rule. 
   The rule provides H.R. 2771 with 1 hour of general debate, equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations. 
   The rule waives all points of order against the bill and its consideration except for those arising under clause 9  or 10 of rule XXI. The rule also waives points of order against provisions of the bill for failure to comply with clause 2 of rule XXI. 
   The rule makes in order and provides appropriate waivers for three amendments, two offered by Republican Members and one bipartisan amendment. 
   Finally, the rule provides for one motion to recommit, with or without instructions. 
   Madam Speaker, the legislation we will consider today, H.R. 2771, funds the legislative branch of our government. This includes funding for the House of Representatives so Members of Congress have the resources we need to serve our constituents. 
   It includes funding for the Capitol Police, the Congressional Budget Office, the Government Accountability Office, the Office of Compliance and other government agencies.     
   The bill also takes a bold step forward and begins implementing the Speaker's Green the Capitol Initiative. For the first time ever, the House of Representatives will take steps to address the threats of global warming by ensuring the House operates in a carbon-neutral manner. 
   The bill provides initial funding to Green the Capitol by switching to 100 percent renewable wind energy for the House's electricity needs, increasing the use of cleaner-burning fuels, and making congressional offices more energy efficient. 
   This is necessary as Members of Congress must set an example for our constituents by being as environmentally friendly as possible, especially as we ask them to do the same in their own homes. 
   Most importantly, however, this bill shows the Democratic majority's commitment to change the way our government is run. This bill demonstrates a commitment to fiscal responsibility, increased oversight and increased accountability. 
   Madam Speaker, as my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have attested to, this bill is fiscally responsible. It provides an increase of only $122 million, or 4.1 percent over the 2007 enacted level. This is significantly lower than the 13 percent increase requested by the President. And much of the increase is attributable to unavoidable expenses that come in a Presidential election year. 
   Reducing the President's budget request by nearly one-quarter of a billion dollars shows that the Democrats are committed to holding the line on unnecessary spending, while ensuring that government is still able to deliver services to the American taxpayer. 
   While funding is increased by 4.1 percent over the 2007 enacted level, the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee chose to invest heavily in critical life and safety and security measures for the Capitol complex. 
   The world changed on September 11, and we now know that the United States Capitol will forever be a target of a terrorist attack. 
   We owe it to our staff members, our visitors, our constituents, our distinguished guests, and to ourselves to ensure that the Capitol complex is as safe and secure as possible. 
   In a post-9/11 world, we cannot be too lax when it comes to securing the Capitol complex. Security enhancements are no longer an option. They are a necessity. 
   The Legislative Branch appropriations bill provides almost $50 million for security and lifesaving projects, including $5 million for new, interoperable police radios, $275,000 for utility, tunnel, health and safety process, $1.2 million for visitors escape hoods, $16 million for building security enhancements, $1 million for emergency exit signs and lighting in the Capitol, and $4.4 million in emergency lighting upgrades for the Rayburn Building. 
   The bill also provides a 7.7 percent increase for the Capitol Police Department and a 23 percent increase for the Office of Compliance so they can ensure health and safety of the Capitol complex. 
   Finally, Madam Speaker, one of the defining traits of the Democratic Congress has been increased government oversight. As such, this bill provides the tools Congress needs to hold the government accountable to the American taxpayer. 
   The Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee is determined to crack down on unnecessary spending by government agencies. The subcommittee held 11 agency budget hearings and is requiring government agencies to reexamine their needs based on priority, cost effectiveness, and fiscal responsibility. 
   The bill provides for additional staff at the Government Accountability Office to enable the GAO to better support congressional oversight efforts and address important issues such as health care, changing security threats, education, and continued audit work on the war in Iraq. 
   The Congressional Budget Office receives an increase in funding to better advise Congress on controlling runaway health care spending. 
   Chairwoman Wasserman Schultz and I discussed CBO staffing in a colloquy during a Rules Committee hearing on Wednesday. We both agree that the current funding staff levels are insufficient to meet our needs. We'll work together with CBO Director Orzag to address the staffing and enhance this important agency's efforts in the future. 
   The bill increases support for the Inspector General overseeing the Capitol Police Department. It also establishes a statutory Inspector General at the Architect of the Capitol. It is absolutely essential that there is stringent oversight of the Architect's office to improve its financial and management practices. 
   The subcommittee is 100 percent committed to improving the oversight and completion of the Capitol Visitors Center. I have personally toured the Visitors Center, and it is a beautiful addition that, when finished, we will all be proud of. However, no Member of Congress is proud of how this edifice has been produced. The project has spiraled out of control due to an inexplicable lack of oversight and accountability in prior Congresses, resulting in unnecessary delays and massive cost overruns. This bill assures that there will no longer be a blank check and no questions asked. 
   The subcommittee has held, and will continue to hold, monthly hearings, and the Architect will be required to submit a detailed plan to the House and Senate before one cent can be spent. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill delivers on the promises that Democrats made. It's fiscally responsible. It focuses on life, safety, and security measures, and provides much needed accountability to the process. 
   I would like to thank Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee and the full Appropriations Committee for all their hard work and thoughtful work that went into this legislation. 
   In particular, I want to thank the gentlelady from Florida, Chairwoman Wasserman Schultz. She has been a true champion for the Democratic majority's efforts to bring efficiency, fiscal responsibility, accountability to the Federal Government, and to this Chamber. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill is well thought out, well crafted, and sets the right priorities. I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, I enjoy the comments and the colloquy that my colleague from Texas and I and the rest of the committee engage in. We seem to have this conversation quite a bit these days. 
   I'd like to remind the gentleman that, while it's true that we have made three amendments in order this year, two Republican and one bipartisan, last year there were four Democratic amendments made in order on this particular appropriations bill. The prior year, however, there were 11 amendments offered in committee, and only one Democratic amendment was offered in this bill. 
   Why I raise this number, I want to point out that this is not unusual for this Legislative Branch appropriations bill to be a structured rule in prior years. And, in fact, there's good reason for that. My distinguished colleague from California, Mr. Dreier, mentioned in committee yesterday, in fact, that there is potential for demagoguery on both sides of the aisle on this Legislative Branch appropriations bill, and that he has agreed in the past, and this year, on a structured rule. 
   Now, honorable men and women can disagree on the merit and the substance of particular amendments, the number of which are not as important as the fact that we are arguing about substantive language, about health and safety, about meeting our constituents' needs. And I think it's important that we talk about that substance, rather than just the number on the bill. 
   And so, Madam Speaker, I think that we've done a good job producing a fiscally accountable bill for the Congress. In fact, the President asked for $275 million more than our subcommittee is providing under this legislation. The President asked for a 15 percent increase in this appropriation, and Congress saw fit to only offer 4.1 percent. I think the subcommittee has done a good job crafting this legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, the gentleman from California and I agree on one thing absolutely, and that is that Mr. Cleaver is a great Member of Congress and offers thoughtful amendments. 
   The problem with his amendment was that it was simply unworkable. It required that vehicles be E85 ethanol-compliant. And, for example, in California, in Mr. Dreier's and my own State, there are only two gas stations that provide E85 fuel. 
   I drive a hybrid. I think it is an important thing for Members of Congress to lead on this issue, but the fact is that the amendment was unworkable. We discussed that in Rules Committee yesterday. I discussed that with Mr. Cleaver, and, in fact, the committee did see fit not to make that amendment in order. 
   The gentleman raises a number of other points, but I would like to talk about the $16 million and the FDA building that the gentleman raised and the fact that the appropriations subcommittee is, in fact, bringing fiscal accountability and better standards to the construction process of the Capitol, and that this proposal that the gentleman from California refers to was actually initially brought to the House by former Speaker Hastert. And, in fact, we are continuing the prior administration's priority in this area. 
   The subcommittee has changed the way this building will be managed and procured in that the GSA will manage the construction and retrofit of this new building that is being acquired in order to provide swing space and allow the operations of Congress to continue as we revamp other buildings here in the Capitol complex. The $16 million in security enhancements this bill provides for the FDA building are critical if we are to use the building for additional House office space. The project was originally approved, as I said, by former Speaker Hastert and is now being carried forward in this bill. It is critical so that we can get the swing space ready for the House to use when we begin the badly needed renovations to the Cannon Building, which is nearly 100 years old, and to the Longworth Building, which is nearly 75 years old. We need flex space to move offices while those buildings are being renovated. The FDA building fits the bill. 
   GSA is ready to invest $150 million in the renovations of this building. This additional funding is to bring security from the generic government building level up to meet the requirements of congressional office space. This is a long-term investment. If we don't put  this money into getting the FDA building ready now, we will have to delay much-needed renovations to our existing buildings. 
   I would also say that I believe it is important for our staff to get the same kind of security that we would get as Members. We know that in the post-9/11 world, as we have talked about many times on the floor before, Members of Congress and this Capitol complex are targets, and it is imperative that we provide our staff with the same security that we ourselves demand.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, I will say that it seems ironic to me that they blame the Democrats for everything, yet this proposal that is being put forward by the gentleman from Georgia was originated under the speakership of Mr. Hastert and was planned during that period of time. And, frankly, it was a good idea. It's something that needs to be done. 
   The other point I would just like to make at the outset of my discussion here.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Thank you, Madam Speaker.  
   I also want to point out that Mr. Kingston is talking about immigration and the lack of accountability with regard to illegal workers on government projects. I would like to remind the gentleman that it is his President that is in charge of enforcement, it is the administrative branch of government that is in charge of adjudicating and prosecuting illegal aliens, and that it is their Department that is awarding the contracts. And so if the gentleman is concerned about this, he should talk to his President down the street. And with a single conversation, he should be able to get the administration to do what he wants, since he is of the same party. 
   With regard to this building that we're talking about, when we had the anthrax scare here in Congress, I am aware that they actually had to displace Federal workers to house congressional employees in that building. That was only for a couple of weeks. To do this for months on end while a building is being renovated is simply unacceptable. 
   Further, Mr. Kingston's amendment was argued in the subcommittee and it was put forward in the subcommittee and it was rejected by the subcommittee on a bipartisan basis. We need this swing space to be able to do the renovation. And I think this goes back to a very simple thing that Mr. Dreier said, that this can be demagogued. 
   Clearly, we can have disagreements, but we need to do the right thing by the American people to provide for the safety of Congress. This $16 million appropriation is for Capitol security. Either you support security for Members, for the staff and for the general public, or you don't. You either support security or you don't. And I say that the bipartisan workings of the committee were the correct action and that the amendment that the gentleman offered was previously rejected in committee. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, I would just like to respond to the gentleman from Georgia by saying that, in fact, the Rules Committee did offer Mr. Jordan's amendment from Ohio that one-ups the gentleman from Georgia. In fact, the gentleman from Georgia said he wanted to cut overall the entire operations in Congress and legislative branch by 1 percent. Mr. Jordan offers a 4 percent cut. And so we made that in order so that the Congress can have the debate that Mr. Price from Georgia has indicated that he wants to have on the House floor. 
   It is a very open process. And, in fact, I will tell you that this is a very bipartisan bill. Mr. Wamp and Ms. Wasserman Schultz came to the Rules Committee and indicated absolutely that they had worked on a bipartisan basis on this bill and that they thought that they had done a good job working on a bipartisan basis. 
   We have, in fact, offered the debate. We will, in fact, have a debate on cutting overall administration. In fact, this is a responsible bill in that we have cut $275 million from the President's request, 11 percent less than the administration asked for the operations of the legislative branch. This is a fiscally responsible bill. The committee has worked together to craft it in a bipartisan way, and I think that we in fact have a very good piece of legislation before the Congress today.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARDOZA. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 502, LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, I would just like to remind my friend, the gentleman from California, that I, in fact, did yield to him earlier in the debate for quite some period of time and let him speak on my time prior. So, with that, I think we have, in fact, worked on a bipartisan basis. I am also willing to work and discuss with my colleagues. 
   But, in fact, as the gentleman said, this legislative branch appropriations bill is one where you can, in fact, have shenanigans, or I think his word was ``demagoguery,'' and, in fact, we have a structured rule so that we limit that. We are, in fact, trying to have the most open process. I think we have succeeded in doing a better job than happened in the prior Congresses. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, there were several misstatements of fact in the last statements that were made here on the floor by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. 
   This bill actually does not provide $4 billion for legislative branch appropriations, as the gentleman indicated, but $3.1 billion for the legislative branch. The actual spending for fiscal year 2007, including the supplemental but not rescissions, this bill is a $122 million increase, which is 4 percent of that amount. If the $50 million rescission in the fiscal year 2007 CR is included, the bill is only $73 million, or 2.4 percent, above the prior year. 
   We have provided in this measure fiscal responsibility, accountability, and security and life safety for the Members of Congress, for the general public and for our staff. 
   I would also like to make a point that this bill represents a $276 million reduction from the Republican administration's request on this matter. 
   Madam Speaker, three principles guided the development of the underlying legislation: fiscal responsibility, security and life safety, and accountability. 
   This bill makes smart decisions with taxpayer dollars. It provides the necessary resources for Congress to carry out its constitutional oversight responsibilities, something we saw sorely lacking in the last Congress. It ensures the Capitol complex is safe and secure. Most importantly, it allows Members of Congress to represent and serve our constituents in the most efficient and effective manner possible. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and on the previous question.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Chairman, I intended to offer an amendment with regard to sea turtles. I would like to engage in that discussion for a bit. I will not offer that amendment; I would like to discuss it with the chairman of this Appropriations Committee. 
   There are currently six species of sea turtles, the green, the hawksbill, the Kemp's Ridley, the leatherback, the loggerhead and the Olive Ridley sea turtle. All six are listed as threatened or endangered species under the Endangered Species Act. 
   Sea turtles face a range of threats from land and sea. Their nesting beaches are under constant attack from pollution, trash, debris, predators and vehicles driving on the dunes. 
   Once out of the nest, sea turtle hatchlings use light cues to find the sea. Artificial lighting near the beach can disorient hatchlings, leading to dehydration and death. 
   In the water, sea turtles face even more serious threats. Every year, thousands of sea turtles are injured or die after becoming entangled in discarded fishing gear and other marine debris, from ingesting plastic bags or oil and tar, from being crushed by dredges, and by being accidentally caught by U.S. commercial fishing operations. The latter is one of the most serious threats facing sea turtles. 
   Sea turtles are accidentally caught in gill nets, trawls, long-lines and dredges, subjecting them to severe injury, crushing, or drowning.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Again we have worked with the chairman. There was an amendment that I was going to offer with regard to the CASA, Court Appointed Special Advocates, program. This is an issue I am very passionate about as two of my children are adopted. They were into the foster care system and into adoptive placement because of a CASA volunteer seeing the desperate situation they were both in. 
   The current CASA funding only allows for 50 percent of the children who are under court supervision, under court custody to receive the assistance of a CASA volunteer. The program is underfunded. 
   I had originally intended to fully increase this funding so that every child could have a child advocate and a CASA. That is not authorized under the authorization, so we have withdrawn the amendment at this time, but I will work with the gentleman in the future to make sure that we do the right authorizing legislation so this appropriation can be dealt with in the appropriate way in the future. 
   I thank the gentleman for his advice and leadership in helping me work on this issue.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   House Resolution 763 provides for consideration of H.R. 1011, the Virginia Ridge and Valley Act of 2007, under a structured rule. The rule provides for 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Natural Resources. 
   The rule makes in order the substitute reported by the Committee on Natural Resources and makes in order the amendment from the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), the only amendment which was submitted to the Committee on Rules for consideration on this rule. 
   The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill, except for clause 9 and 10 of rule XXI. Finally, the rule provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
   The bill before us today, H.R. 1011, designates 43,000 acres as wilderness and nearly 12,000 acres as national scenic areas in the Jefferson National Forest in southwestern Virginia. The areas in the Jefferson National Forest that are protected by this bill are some of the most beautiful areas of the country. The areas offer numerous recreational activities, including fishing, hunting, hiking, camping, canoeing, horseback riding and skiing. These areas are virtually priceless and provide much-needed opportunities for visitors and families to spend time in the great outdoors and enjoying America's natural beauty. 
   H.R. 1011 ensures that critical habitat for bears, song birds, wild turkeys, brook trout, and other species, in addition to preserving countless stands of old growth, a 45-foot cascading waterfall, and breathtaking scenic views that encompass wide areas. Preserving this habitat is also critical for the economy, as tourism is the fattest growing industry in the region. 
   Each of these areas contained in H.R. 1011 were either recommended as part of the Jefferson National Forest plan or have been endorsed by the relevant county boards of supervisors in the local areas. The bill has broad bipartisan support from five other Representatives from Virginia, both Virginia Senators, Governor Tim Kaine and four county boards of supervisors. Local businesses and State organizations, faith groups, the International Mountain Bicycling Association and local bear hunters also support this bill. 
   Finally, I would like to thank Chairman Rahall and Mr. Boucher for their dedication and hard work in bringing this legislation to the floor today so that we can ensure that America's most treasured resources are protected once again for future generations. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I would like to say that I share the comments of our prior speakers. Both the Speaker of the House and the gentleman from California spoke eloquently about the disasters that are happening in our home State. It is certainly a time of great need and a great need for us to come together to figure out how we proceed from here to battle this rage. 
   I see Mr. Lewis in the audience, and I have been to his district at a hearing about this very topic, and I know the serious nature of some of the forest management issues that are around his district and we have discussed it on numerous occasions. And our sympathies are with you and those of your constituents, Mr. Lewis. 
   At this time, Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Moran).

   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I just wish to again give my deepest condolences to the folks who have lost their property in your district, Mr. Lewis. As you have said, we have traveled there and had hearings, and, frankly, with all the dry timber that was left behind there, we were fearful that that would have happened a couple of years ago, and I understand it's happening as we speak. And hopefully we will not lose any more lives. And our hopes and prayers are with the people that habitat that region in and around Lake Arrowhead. 
   With regard to the bill at hand, H.R. 1011, I would just like to say, as has been said before, that this measure is supported by the members of the Virginia delegation. We will be offering, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), the only amendment that was proposed under this rule. It's supported by all the local boards of supervisors as well as Senator Warner, Governor Kaine. 
   And, in fact, we have listened to the community. And Mr. Sessions is right. The local officials and local community leaders, citizens of a region should be consulted when we designate one of these wilderness areas. And, in fact, this bill does incorporate those suggestions and comments of the local community. They desire this wilderness designation for their area. And it is truly going to be a national treasure. It already is, and it will be preserved for our children and for their children. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to start by saying that I couldn't disagree more with the gentleman's last comments. What I heard just does not even make any sense to me, having spent the last 5 years of my life sitting here watching this House debate veterans issues. 
   The first 4 years that I was here, we saw the Republican Congress that was in power at that time refuse to take up a number of measures that were brought forward by the Democratic minority at that time. In fact, there were several discharge petitions that laid languishing at that desk for weeks and weeks on end until they finally died at the end of the session because they never got the attention of the Republican majority at that time. In fact, this year, since we have taken back the House and we have become a Democratic majority, we have been champions of veterans issues. And to say that they want to now lay letters upon the table that they're demanding of the Speaker's attention, we have been putting attention on this issue for a number of years. And not only are we taking care of our veterans now for the  first time in 12 years, but we are taking care of it in a way that would surprise them. And our Nation's veterans are very grateful that we are finally giving them the respect they deserve. 
   And I will tell you that this House, by a vote of 409-2, passed the Veterans appropriations bill. And, yes, we do need to go to conference; but we will do that when the conferees are appointed in the Senate, when it is appropriate to do it. We have passed, this year, an additional appropriation of $3.4 billion to take care of our Nation's veterans. We will, in fact, make sure that all the veterans are taken care of. In fact, on November 11 of this year we will celebrate tremendous respect for our Nation's veterans and will, in fact, do everything that we have promised to do, and more. 
   We just saw today three bills taken up by the Veterans' Committee to, in fact, take care of the needs of our Nation's veterans. And I am highly offended by the insinuation that we are in some way acting in a partisan way not to take care of our Nation's veterans. 
   Mr. Speaker, with regard to H.R. 1011, this bill is, in fact, an important bill to protect the natural resources of the State of Virginia, a vital area for our country. Mr. Boucher and the delegation from Virginia have done a fabulous job in crafting this proposal. It is a bill that preserves tens of thousands of acres of pristine wilderness in Jefferson National Forest. It is necessary that these beautiful, natural landscapes remain protected and untouched so that they may be enjoyed by our children and our grandchildren for years to come. It deserves the strong support of all the Members on the floor today. 
   That is the bill that we will be moving the previous question on. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and on the previous question.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARDOZA. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. I would like to thank the chairman for recognizing me and yielding to me. I also want to thank Mr. Ross for being such a leader on this issue and for being a leader on so many of the Blue Dog causes that he brings to the floor every week. And there is no question, Mr. Ross, that there is no issue that's more important to the Blue Dogs than this issue of PAYGO. 
   Madam Speaker, passing PAYGO rules at the beginning of the 110th Congress fulfilled an absolute pledge to the American people that this new Congress was going to spend taxpayers' dollars and money responsibly and without continuing to run up the deficit. It was a very important initial step when we passed the House rules this year. Waiving this rule now would break that pledge to pay for the alternative minimum tax and would be a rollback in what we've committed to do for the American people. And I believe that breaking the PAYGO rules would return us to the disastrous fiscal policies of the past Congresses under the Republican administration of this House and would be a terrible mistake. 
   After allowing the PAYGO rules to expire, the Republicans enacted legislation increasing the national debt by nearly $1.4 trillion over 6 years. Twenty-one percent of all individual income taxes of the year 2008 will go towards paying the interest on the national  debt. They won't help cure a sick child, they won't help educate one of our bright young people in this country, your tax dollars, 21 percent of which will go strictly to pay interest on the $9 trillion that have been run up in the national debt. 
   This ``debt tax,'' as we call it, is a direct consequence of the reckless fiscal policies that have happened, for the most part, over the last 6 years. The President and the Republican majority have put us on a fiscally unsustainable path, and the Blue Dogs are unwilling to pass this undue burden onto future generations of Americans. 
   The Blue Dogs demanded a new rule, as we talked about earlier, that put PAYGO back into place. And when we took over the Congress, the Democrats restored the PAYGO rules to ensure that the government spends within its means, just like American families have to do. 
   In complying with the PAYGO rules, this House has overwhelmingly relied on spending cuts to offset increases in higher priority programs. Over 80 percent of the increases in spending for priority programs passed by this House have been offset by cuts in lower priority or wasteful spending programs. 
   The Blue Dogs are committed to addressing this country's long-term fiscal challenges, and that is why we have insisted that PAYGO rules be applied to all mandatory spending increases. 
   This Democratic Congress has made great strides to get our fiscal house back in order. If we want to continue down this path towards fiscal sanity, we must ensure that every piece of legislation we consider, including the AMT bill that we're going to be considering this week, comply with the PAYGO rules. 
   Mr. Chairman, again, I very much appreciate your leadership, and I thank you for recognizing me and yielding me time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, it is clear that President Bush is out of touch with today's consumer. First, he refused to accept that the economy was heading in a downturn. Now, it takes a reporter's question for him to realize that gas prices in this country will soon reach $4 a gallon at the pump. Despite being reported in newspapers around the Nation, President Bush has told reporters last week that he didn't realize that $4 gas was possible. The President's energy record leaves a  great deal to be desired. Since he took office, gas prices have doubled, and home heating costs have tripled. 
   While President Bush remains out of touch, House Democrats acted last week to ease some of that burden. We passed legislation that repeals unnecessary tax subsidies to big oil companies, which reported record profits last year and last month. Instead, the subsidies will go towards tax incentives for clean, renewable energy. 
   Mr. Speaker, President Bush should recognize that his energy policy has failed the American people, and that he should join us in supporting legislation that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 682 provides for consideration of H.R. 3567, the Small Business Investment Expansion Act of 2007, under a structured rule. As the Clerk reported, the rule provides for 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Small Business. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except for clause 9 and 10 of rule XXI. The rule makes in order all three amendments that were submitted for consideration that are printed in the Rules Committee report accompanying this resolution. Finally, the rule provides for one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Small Business Administration states that it ``helps Americans start, build, and grow businesses.'' Lately, however, the Small Business Administration's actions have spoken louder than their words. And, unfortunately, SBA's actions have not spurred innovation and development but stifled them. 
   Given the high cost of purchasing additional capital assets, small businesses are dependent upon financing, which typically comes in the form of venture capital or angel investments. Despite the SBA's intent, its investment programs have fallen short and the needs of small business have gone unmet. In fact, due to SBA's ineffective investment programs, small businesses are now faced with more than $60 billion in unmet capital needs. 
   This is a tragedy. Small businesses form the backbone of our economic growth. In fact, they are responsible for creating three out of every four jobs in the United States. Imagine how many businesses could grow and how many jobs could be created if we could deliver even a fraction of that unmet need. 
   Small businesses are vital to our economy, and we cannot afford for our budding entrepreneurs to be denied the opportunity to succeed. By making the SBA an efficient partner in business development, small businesses will have better and more widespread access to venture capital and angel investments that they need. 
   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today, H.R. 3567, has strong bipartisan support. It passed the Small Business Committee by a voice vote. 
   Among other things, H.R. 3567 streamlines the Small Business Investment Company program. Last year this public/private partnership leveraged more than $21 billion to over 2,000 small businesses. However, the current leverage limits are overly complex and the heavy reliance on debt-based lending programs has hampered the investment in veteran-, minority-, and women-owned businesses. H.R. 3567 will simplify how leverage caps are calculated and revise the limitations on aggregate investments to increase small business investment opportunities. In addition, it provides incentives to target veteran-, minority-, and women-owned businesses. 
   Second, the bill updates the New Markets Venture Capital program. This program was established specifically to address the unmet equity needs of low-income communities. However, this program has been woefully underfunded, and as a result, investment in low-income communities has suffered. H.R. 3567 expands the New Markets Venture Capital program and provides additional incentives for small manufacturing companies in low-income areas. This will be especially important to areas like those in my district in Merced County. 
   Third, the bill establishes a new Office of Angel Investment to focus on increasing equity investments in small businesses. Angel investors are high net-worth individuals who invest in and support start-up businesses in their early stages of growth and currently account for the creation of more than 51,000 new businesses every year. 
   H.R. 3567 promotes this crucial source of financing for entrepreneurs through the creation of an Angel Investment program within SBA's investment division. This new program provides matching financing leverage to eligible angel groups with 10 or more investors. The bill also directs the SBA to create a Federal angel network, a searchable directory of angel groups on the SBA Web site to better match up angel investors with small businesses seeking financing. 
   The bill also addresses many deficiencies in the Surety Bond program to assist small businesses in obtaining the backing they need to compete for construction contracts. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill reflects Democrats' commitment to providing real solutions to remove the obstacles facing America's small business owners, innovators, and entrepreneurs. I would like to thank the Small Business Committee for their hard work and thoughtful work in bringing this legislation to the floor today. In particular, I extend my thanks to my good friend from Pennsylvania (Mr. Altmire) and Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez. 
   Mr. Speaker, we all recognize the importance of small business to our economy, and we must act on this bipartisan bill without further delay.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman discusses the question of an open rule. In fact, we adopted every amendment that was presented to the Rules Committee and brought it to the floor today. There were three amendments offered. All three amendments will be before the House today. 
   And the question on a Small Business Committee bill that deals with the wide diversity that small businesses can impact really allows, under the House rules, under the germaneness rules, that almost any measure, not related to this bill, but almost any measure could be brought to the floor under an open rule. It's much more appropriate for the Rules Committee to manage the debate and the time spent on this House floor by asking all Members to submit their amendments that they might want to put forward on this particular bill and debate them in an orderly fashion on the floor. And that is why the committee adopted the rule that it did, a structured rule, to manage the rule in an appropriate rule way. 
   The second question is on the question of earmarks that the gentleman raised. And I would just like to refer to page 24 of the report submitted to the House that accompanies this bill, and title XIV is a statement of no earmarks. I should read that to the House at this time. 
   It says: ``Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XXI, H.R. 3567 does not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined in clause 9(d), 9(e), or 9(f) of rule XXI.'' The statement is very clear that there are no earmarks in this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Democrats believe that small businesses are a fundamental part of our Nation's economic growth and that government has a responsibility to provide increased investment opportunities to ensure their long-term successes. H.R. 3567 creates a renewed focus on minority-owned small businesses and small businesses in low-income areas, both of which have been traditionally faced with difficulty in gaining access to equity investment. It also paves the way to better serve thousands of small businesses and give a much-needed jolt to our economy. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must continue to shepherd our small businesses to give them every opportunity to succeed for today and for tomorrows yet to come. This bill will move us in that direction, and small businesses will be that much closer to making their dreams of prosperity a reality with the passage of this bill. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and on the previous question.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARDOZA. (FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 1/2 minutes. 
   I rise today in strong support of this amendment to H.R. 3121, the Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2007. I thank the chairman of the committee, Mr. Frank, for his leadership on this issue. I would also be remiss if I did not mention that Congressman Hinojosa was very instrumental in helping me bring this amendment to the floor today, and his name was left off the list of coauthors although he was certainly instrumental, as well as Mrs. Lois Capps, our colleague from California who has a problem in the Santa Maria area and is also a supporter of this bill. 
   I fully understand, Mr. Chairman, and appreciate the need to reform and modernize the National Flood Insurance Program. As we all know, the recent devastating hurricanes, Katrina, Rita and Wilma, not only ruined thousands of people's lives, but displaced tens of thousands of people and laid waste to millions of homes, causing billions of dollars in property damage, and they were exposed to the fragility of the National Flood Insurance Program. Mr. Taylor will speak later to that problem. 
   At the same time, FEMA began a remapping of flood plains across the country. And while I agree that people should know whether they live in a protected area or not, FEMA's process has been terribly flawed from the beginning, and my constituents stand to suffer as a result. 
   As we make the necessary reforms to the system, we must be cognizant of the impact this legislation could have on unsuspecting residents. FEMA's current plans to update the floodplain maps will force many people in my district and across the country to have to purchase flood insurance who are currently not required to purchase it. To add insult to injury, many of these people are low-income earners, and have no idea that this expense is looming. 
   I commend the bill for recognizing this problem and taking some steps to address it; however, we must do more to help low-income people who will be affected. Our amendment addresses these concerns and blunts the impact the remapping process will have on low-income residents. 
   This amendment says that people forced to purchase flood insurance as a result of a new map who live in an area that was previously certified and now have been decertified under the new FEMA process will have a grace period of 5 years in which they will be entitled to a 50 percent reduction in their flood insurance premium. The goal is that, during those 5 years, necessary upgrades will be made to the levees to bring them into compliance, thereby eliminating the mandatory requirement to purchase flood insurance. 
   This amendment will have a huge impact on my district and many other parts of the country as well. It is simply unfair to, while requiring communities to upgrade their levees, also require them to purchase flood insurance at the same time. Many of these people are still paying on the levees that had initially protected them in the first place. 
   By giving those who most need assistance a grace period, we are acknowledging the plight of these communities and taking action. This is the right thing to do. Moreover, given the volatile housing markets, we need to do everything possible to ensure people on the precipice remain in their homes. In my district, we have nearly 20,000 people who are currently facing foreclosure due to the subprime loan problem. Saddling these same people with more expenses when they can least afford it is counterproductive and contrary to the shared goal of promoting ownership. Let's help these people bring some balance to the flood insurance program and FEMA's remapping process. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CARDOZA. This amendment's intent is to cover folks who are in flood areas now that are currently covered by levees that, through no fault of their own, FEMA's come in and decertified. They had regulations 2 years ago that said they were fine. They've changed regulations on these folks.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARDOZA. (SENSE OF HOUSE REGARDING FOSTER PARENTS -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my colleague, Mr. McDermott, and urge the support of H. Res. 1185. Since being elected to public office, I have been in advocate for children in foster care; in part because 8 years ago my wife and I adopted two of our children from foster care. 
   As a result, we became intimately aware of the status of America's foster care system. This resolution commends the hard work and sacrifice of the thousands of American families who care for foster children. As an adoptive foster parent, I know the joy these children bring. I also know that caring for children who, in some cases, have survived atrocious abuse and neglect can be extremely challenging. Many foster parents open their hearts and homes to children with the trauma and pain of a broken past. Many times these caregivers receive little or no support from the Federal government as they take in our Nation's most vulnerable young people. 
   Despite record food prices, foster families across America stretch their budgets to feed additional children that they have welcomed into their homes. Despite rising gas prices; foster families do their best to drive children to schools, take them to doctor's appointments, and attend little league games--because they know that's the kind of support these children have never had. They do a great service for America, Mr. Speaker, and deserve to be commended for their efforts. 
   While we recognize and commend their service, we need to do more to ensure a better future for these children when they leave foster homes. We need to do more to heal the minds and bodies of these children, so that the investment that foster parents have made in their lives is not lost to homelessness, drug addiction, and gang involvement that so many of these children turn to when they are abandoned again as they exit foster care. 
   The public may not be aware that on the night of their 18th birthday, most states terminate all services for foster children. Parents know that most children in our society are not self-sufficient the day they turn 18. For example: we don't expect our children to afford health coverage when they turn 18. In fact, most parents retain their children under a family policy until age 23. Yet for the 26,000 vulnerable young Americans who age out of the foster care system, we eliminate their healthcare coverage the moment they turn 18. Mr. Speaker, we need to do better. We need to extend healthcare coverage for children in foster care to age 21. The pathway to extend coverage already exists in current law, but only 17 states have implemented this option and I believe it is a moral and societal imperative to make this the standard across our Nation. Without proper healthcare many of these youth end up another sad statistic. 
   I know my good friend from Washington, Mr. McDermott, and I see eye-to-eye on this issue. Both he and I have introduced legislation that would make these necessary changes to healthcare coverage for foster children. Mr. Speaker, I urge the rest of my colleagues to support this resolution and to do better for America's foster children.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 263, a resolution recognizing May, this month, as the National Foster Care Month. 
   I want to begin my statement today by thanking subcommittee chairman, Mr. McDermott from Washington, for his outstanding support and work with us to bring this resolution to the floor. Chairman McDermott has dedicated virtually his entire life to the work of helping children that have been disadvantaged, and he deserves great praise and thanks for the hard work he continues to do in this Congress. 
   I also want to recognize Mr. Weller for cooperating with us today in bringing this resolution to the floor, and also for his thoughtful comments that he just prepared. 
   However, this resolution has a long and tortuous path to reaching the floor today. My staff's been working tirelessly with both the majority and the minority staffs of the Ways and Means  and Judiciary Committees. Before this bill was able to reach the floor under suspension, I was forced to make substantive changes which severely, in my opinion, gut the force of this resolution. 
   Specifically, my original resolution, drawing upon the recommendations of the respected Pew Charitable Trust, made clear that we need more funds for the CASA Program, that we need more funds to better ensure that we have trained personnel working with foster children, and that we provide more resources to State agencies that deal with foster children. 
   In the interest of comity, I was forced to withdraw all these recommendations. Unfortunately, while of course I still support the thrust of the current resolution, without sufficient resources we will never fully tackle this problem. 
   I'd also like to just point out, and it's important history for us all to remember, that in the previous majority in the last Congress, we took, in my mind, unconscionable measures to reduce the funding to foster children. 
   On February 8, 2006, President Bush signed the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The CBO estimates that this measure cut funds of $1.3 billion over 10 years to foster care and $2.1 billion over 10 years to Medicaid that would affect these children. 
   I stood up on the House floor on that day in December when it was being debated in this institution and fought against those cuts. I, at that time, called it ``Scroogenomics,'' because we were cutting the money for foster kids right before the Christmas holiday. And those concerns went for nought. The bill was passed anyway and signed into law, and foster kids continue to suffer because of that act. 
   I won't belabor the point too much at this point because I really want to focus on the needs today. But, Madam Speaker, I speak passionately about foster children because I have a very personal interest in this issue. Seven years ago I adopted two foster children. In fact, Madam Speaker, as an aside, I'm doing this resolution because they asked me to do it today. 
   Since then, I have advocated on their behalf and on the behalf of the adoption of foster children in the California State Assembly and now here in Congress. 
   The need is tremendous and the statistics are sobering. It is estimated that there are 800,000 children in foster care at some point during any given year. Moreover, children of color are disproportionately represented in foster care. African American children make up about 16 percent of the Nation's children, but make up 35 percent of the children in foster care. These children enter foster care at higher rates and remain in care longer, for longer periods than white children. 
   Too many children in foster care sit waiting for permanent families. There are about 118,000 children in foster care waiting to be adopted, and numerous barriers keep them in limbo. Children often bounce from one system to another, from child welfare to juvenile justice to mental health as their needs intensify. 
   Each year, about 20,000 children age out of the foster care system without ever being adopted, placed with grandparents or any other supportive adult. Oftentimes, these children have no connection whatsoever to any adult. 
   Several studies released in 2005 documented the special challenges facing these youths, especially in the area of mental health, education and employment. They are especially poorly prepared to be self-sufficient young adults. 
   These children are waiting. Speaking from personal experience, there is no greater joy in life than helping a child. My wife and I can attest to this every day. 
   Every child, no matter what their situation that they may be born to, deserves a chance to be raised in a stable and loving home. Innocent children should not be forced to bear the mistakes of their parents. We have a moral obligation to ensure that these children, no matter what background they come from, have a shot that is equal to the shot that every American has to the American dream. 
   This is a big problem that will require bold solutions. In order to save the next generation of children, we must rededicate ourselves to their welfare and to pledge to do whatever is necessary to nurture and protect them. 
   This resolution, by highlighting attention to their problems, is a necessary first step. But, Madam Speaker, other dramatic actions need to be taken. That is why I have introduced legislation to expand Medicaid coverage to children who age out of the foster care system, and I'm considering legislation to ensure that every foster child has a CASA representative, a court-appointed special advocate, the same type of court-appointed special advocate that saved my children. 
   These are urgent problems. They require bold solutions. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Weller. I know he cares passionately about these children, and while we sometimes disagree on the specifics, I know that all Members in this institution care passionately about foster children. 
   But the time to act is now. We need to do more to work on behalf of these children to eliminate the barriers that prohibit them from leading positive lives in society. 
   We must extend health care coverage to these young people until the age of 21. It's currently a voluntary program. Thirty-three States in this country do not offer health care all the way to the age of majority. We must, in fact, do more. And it is imperative. And frankly, if we can keep these young people out of a life of crime, out of falling into trouble, assisting them into becoming productive citizens, instead of the current situation where nearly 50 percent of children who age out of the foster care system end up homeless after 1 year, we can do better for our citizens and we can, frankly, probably save money to the taxpayers of the United States. 
   So, Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of this resolution. I urge my colleagues here today within earshot of my voice to redouble their efforts in helping this population of our citizenry that has become disadvantaged.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARDOZA. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to the Republican budget alternative and in strong support of the Democratic budget. 
   I applaud my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for bringing forward a budget alternative, which is no small feat, so we can have a thorough debate about our Nation's priorities. 
   I would also like to add that I support their commitment to reforming mandatory spending programs. It is a significant problem on the horizon that Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, former Fed Chairman Greenspan, the Comptroller General, and others have forewarned us about. While I support their concept of reigning in mandatory spending, I suspect we differ in how to go about that. 
   What bothers me more about this process is not that we have disagreements, because we are going to have disagreements on where we spend the money and who pays for it. Those are legitimate arguments that should be vigorously debated. But the rhetoric that we use that surrounds it I think is unfair on both sides of the aisle. 
   I was not here in 2001, but I voted for about half of the 2003 tax cuts because I thought it was the right policy for this country. However, I did not agree with other budget policies. I don't believe that Republican budgets addressed critical health care and education priorities, or met the needs of our veterans. And the policies added staggering amounts to our Nation's debt. Regardless of how we got here, I think we ought to not fool ourselves about where we actually are. This is a train wreck that we find ourselves in, that the former Republican majority could not right. It was such a train wreck that Republicans could not pass a budget and could not finish the appropriations process last year. Democrats had to do a continuing resolution when we assumed the majority this year to clean up the mess that was left behind. 
   According to the Bush Administration's own numbers, the policies of President Bush and the Republican Congress put us on pace to increase the federal debt by well over $4 trillion by 2008. By comparison, it took the first 41 presidents combined to accumulate a total of $4 trillion in debt. 
   The debt and deficits we have racked up are not sustainable over time. They undermine America's economic strength by driving up interest rates and reducing investment. They force us to become increasingly beholden to foreign nations, as three-fourths of all new federal borrowing has come from foreign investors such as China and Japan. And they mortgage our children's future, forcing them to pay back the mountains of debt we are incurring today. We should be investing in our children's future, not borrowing from it. 
   We have a responsibility to begin cleaning up the fiscal mess that we inherited. The  Democratic budget does just that and promises a new direction for our country. What we are trying to do with the Democratic budget is to take tow trucks to this train wreck and pull those cars off the track. Then, somehow, we have got to straighten out the track. It is going to be a lot of tough work and a lot of hammering on those tracks to get them back in line. And then we have got to set those railcars back up on the railroad track and somehow get this train moving again. 
   Correcting the fiscal course of our country cannot be achieved overnight, but I believe that this budget is a good first step. It addresses our Nation's priorities. It institutes tough spending control measures and fiscal discipline. It provides for responsible tax relief. And it brings our budget back to balance within five years. 
   The gentleman from South Carolina, Mr. SPRATT, should be commended for helping to right this train. The budget may not be perfect, but he deserves a tremendous amount of credit for what he has done and the Blue Dog Coalition certainly appreciates his efforts. We think we are headed in the right direction and are on the right track.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my friend from Massachusetts for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, as a subcommittee chairman on the House Agriculture Committee and as a member of the Rules Committee, I am pleased to rise in support of the Agriculture appropriations bill before us today. 
   One of the reasons the farm bill that we just passed last week was so hard to put together was over the past years the Republican appropriators had repeatedly chipped millions and millions of dollars out of mandatory farm bill programs, specifically in the area of research, and research is an area that has been woefully inadequately funded in previous years. As a result, the rest of the world has been catching up, and we have been struggling to maintain our preeminence in agriculture in the last few years. 
   We used to have a $30 billion trade surplus in agriculture, and now, like in everything else, we are falling behind and having that traded away. If we aren't careful, we are going to become a net importer of agriculture for the first time in the history of the United States. It is bad enough that countries like China, Japan and Saudi Arabia are already our bankers. We cannot afford to let them become our farmers, too. 
   This bill represents a stark difference from the drastic cuts we have seen in recent years. Members of the Agriculture Committee and the Appropriations Committee were vigilant to ensure that we met the promises we made, especially in the areas of research, food safety and nutrition. 
   I do have some concerns, however, about the horse slaughter transportation language contained in the bill which could have unintended consequences on the horse racing industry, an industry I have strongly supported since my time in the California legislature.     
   I am hearing from a lot of my constituents back home that have serious  problems with the potential workability and practicality of some of that language. My good friend from California (Mr. Costa) and I are working with Mr. Chandler and Chairwoman DeLauro to correct this problem. 
   Madam Speaker, this is a good bill. It follows through on our commitments, reinvests in rural America, improves nutrition for millions of Americans, and puts us on the right track by making sound investment in research, and will help us maintain our standing in the world as undisputed agricultural leaders. 
   I also want to thank and say something about our wonderful chairwoman, Ms. DeLauro. Without her help, we would not have been able to write the farm bill we wrote last week. She is a tireless advocate for her concerns in specialty crops and farmers markets and nutrition and making sure that our young people eat nutritious food, and also food safety. With her leadership, we got the farm bill done. With the leadership of Collin Peterson, we got the farm bill done. And with the leadership of Speaker Pelosi, we were able to write a good farm bill for America. 
   I want to thank the chairwoman and all those who helped. She has done an unbelievable job shepherding this bill through her committee and to the House floor. I thank her and congratulate her on meeting the needs of America's farmers.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARDOZA. (MAKING TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS TO THE FEDERAL INSECTICIDE, FUNGICIDE, AND RODENTICIDE ACT -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Senate bill 2571 provides a technical correction to the reauthorization of the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act approved by the House and the Senate and that was signed by the President on October 9, 2007. 
   As my colleagues know, EPA is currently responsible for regulating the sale, use, and distribution of pesticides. In order to facilitate and expedite the approval process, pesticide manufacturers and other registrants have supplemented EPA's annual budget for a number of years. It's a win-win process for both the manufacturer and the end user and a clear example of good government at its best. 
   Unfortunately, EPA has interpreted the PRIA reauthorization approved by Congress to collect fees for chemicals that are not part of the Interregional Project Number 4, a popular research program that assesses tolerance levels for pest management chemicals applied on specialty crops. These IR-4 chemicals have historically been exempt from fees prior to the enactment of the PRIA reauthorization, and it was not the intention of the House nor the Senate to suddenly assess fees on all these chemicals. 
   This bill will simply restore the status quo for these particular products and reassert congressional intent. 
   Because the program fees are being assessed on IR-4 chemicals as we speak, it is vitally important to address this situation immediately. While the farm bill would be the natural vehicle to make this technical correction, EPA is currently unable to process any registration applications without these fees being paid. Therefore, while this fix is not controversial, it is extremely time sensitive, and the uncertainty of the farm bill process dictates that Congress must take action now. 
   Restoring congressional intent by passing this technical correction to PRIA will prevent delays and backups of applications and stop EPA from collecting and then reimbursing the fees for these chemicals. 
   It is important that we continue to encourage the type of public-private partnerships envisioned in PRIA. I urge my colleagues to support this technical fix and the underlying goals of the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, H. Res. 1491 authorizes the Speaker to entertain motions that the House suspend the rules at any time on the legislative day of Thursday, September 25, 2008, on 44 separate measures. This rule is necessary because under clause 1(a) of rule XV, the Speaker may entertain motions to suspend the rules only on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday of each week. In order for suspensions to be considered on other days, the Rules Committee must authorize consideration of these motions. 
   This is not unusual. In fact, in the 109th Congress, my friends on the other side of the aisle reported at least six rules that provided for additional suspension days. This bill limits the suspension of rules only to those measures listed in the rule itself so Members on both sides of the aisle are aware of exactly what bills may be considered under this suspension of the rules. 
   This is standard procedure at the end of the legislative session and includes both House bills that we will send to the Senate for consideration and Senate-passed bills that are ready to become law once they pass the House. 
   I would remind my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that bills considered under suspension of the rules must receive strong bipartisan support in order to pass the House. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this rule which will simply help us move important, noncontroversial legislation before we adjourn that is important to our constituents and  that will receive overwhelmingly bipartisan support and that will hopefully become law. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, my friend from Florida has raised several issues with regard to the procedures of the House for the last 2 years. The gentleman is correct that there have been a number of closed rules this year. But I would like to just say, in response to that, that we have had to try and manage this House with a very obstinate Republican minority in the Senate. 
   There has been a record number of filibusters that have been put forward this year to try and stop everything that we have tried to accomplish in this body. In fact, there has been an absolute stonewalling on the number of conference committees, breaking down the bipartisan process, breaking down the comity that engages both Houses, so that we can get something done for the American people. By refusing to go to conference, this has gummed up the arteries of this body, and it, frankly, is the Republican minority in the other body that has really made this a very difficult House and institution to manage. 
   Madam Speaker, I would also say that the gentleman mentioned that this is--well, first of all, he acknowledged that we are telling everyone today the 44 bills that we are, in fact, bringing forward in this rule. Six times the gentleman's party, in the last Congress, did not tell us what they were bringing forward in a rule. And I can cite the dates. We have the information. 
   The reality is that this is not an uncommon practice at the end of the session. We would like to, as we are doing in this rule, do it every time, but sometimes it's possible at the end of the session we're simply running out of time. 
   So, Madam Speaker, as I said, this is a standard procedure at the end of the legislative session that will simply  help us move important, noncontroversial legislation before we adjourn that will receive overwhelming bipartisan support. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and on the previous question, Madam Speaker. 
   I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. 
   The previous question was ordered. 
   The resolution was agreed to.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 2 1/2 minutes. 
   I rise in support of this amendment, Madam Chairman. And I wish to begin by thanking Chairman Frank for bringing this much-needed legislation to the floor, and for all his efforts to help the reeling housing industry in my area, and the country in general. 
   As we have heard from countless media reports, we are facing a growing mortgage crisis. Sadly, I represent an area that is particularly hard hit by this crisis. The community of Stockton has acquired the distinction of having the highest foreclosure rate of any U.S. city in the country, and there one in 20 households are in jeopardy of foreclosure at this time. In fact, Stockton has had 8,000 foreclosures so far in 2007. 
   This morning, the Modesto Bee reported that central California and central valley homeowners were six times more likely to be in mortgage default for last year than the national average. In addition, home values have plunged 15 to 20 percent so far this year. 
   This amendment will address this problem and help ameliorate the harsh effects of the credit crunch. First, the amendment raises the FHA loan limit to the lower of, A, 125 percent of the local median home price or, B, 175 percent of the national GSE conforming loan limit. 
   The biggest impact of this will be to make FHA loans available in low- and moderately income priced home markets. By raising the local loan limit up to 125 percent of the local median home price, FHA will be able to serve currently neglected populations and ensure loans in this vast and middle-market area. In addition, the amendment will have the effect of serving high-cost areas as well. By raising this artificial cap to 175 percent of the GSE conforming loan limit, the amendment will allow FHA to serve high-cost areas. 
   California has some of the highest priced real estate anywhere in the country. This amendment, by expanding FHA's reach to high-priced areas, will finally bring the benefits of FHA to millions of deserving Californians. 
   In addition, there are other areas of the country where this will have a monumental impact. Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut and other areas are all high-cost areas and will benefit tremendously from raising the loan limit. Raising loan limits and enhancing the ability of FHA to serve currently neglected populations will have the effect of generating more liquidity  in the market and enhancing lender confidence. This will enable more borrowers who are facing loan resets to refinance their mortgages on more favorable terms. 
   This amendment has strong support of the National Association of Realtors, the National Association of Home Builders, and others on the front lines of the housing industry. They know the needs of this industry, and they know that this bill will help.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1218 provides for the further consideration of H.R. 5658, the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009, under a structured rule, without further general debate. 
   The rule makes in order 58 amendments submitted to the Rules Committee for consideration under this rule. The rule waives all points of order against the amendments printed in the committee report and amendments en bloc except those arising under clause 9 or 10 of rule XXI. The rule provides for one motion to recommit with or without instructions. The rule also provides that in the engrossment of H.R. 5658, the text of H.R. 6048, as passed by the House, shall be added at the end of H.R. 5658. 
   Finally, the rule allows the Speaker to entertain motions to suspend the rules through the legislative day of Thursday, May 22, 2008, relating to any measure pertaining to agricultural programs. 
   Mr. Speaker, this rule will allow the House to finish consideration of H.R. 5658, the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009. General debate on this measure concluded last night. This two-part process has been used over the years to ensure that the Rules Committee has ample time to consider amendments submitted to the committee. This year, 121 amendments were submitted for consideration. 
   As my friend from Florida (Mr. Hastings) said on the floor yesterday, the defense authorization bill is one of the most comprehensive and important pieces of legislation this House considers each year. 
   I salute the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Skelton, and Ranking Member Hunter for their hard work and cooperative effort in bringing this piece of legislation to the floor. Their bill passed the Armed Services Committee by a vote of 61-0, a testament to their bipartisan efforts and desire to ensure our Armed Forces have all the tools they need to maintain our national security and to provide our servicemembers in harm's way with the best gear and force protection possible. 
   America has the finest military in the world, Mr. Speaker. Unfortunately, the Bush administration's policies in Iraq have depleted our great military, put a tremendous strain on our troops, and dropped the Army's readiness to unprecedented levels. 
   H.R. 5658 takes us in a new direction. It will help restore our Nation's military readiness and protect our troops in harm's way. This bill supports our troops and their families by giving the military a pay raise larger than was requested by the President and prohibiting TRICARE fee increases. It focuses on the war in Afghanistan. It also includes Iraq policy provisions that ban permanent bases in Iraq and require the Iraqi Government to pay its fair share of reconstruction costs. 
   In the spirit of maintaining the committee agreement and the overwhelming bipartisan support for this bill and to further ensure that our military is fully prepared and our troops get the benefits they deserve, the Rules Committee has made in order 58 amendments for consideration on the floor today. These are amendments that the Rules Committee and the Armed Services Committee determined would not disrupt the bill's carefully negotiated content and warranted further consideration. 
   In addition, this rule also allows the Speaker to bring up under suspension of the rules any measure pertaining to agricultural programs. 
   As we all know and we heard on the floor yesterday, an unintentional clerical error occurred prior to the enrollment of the farm bill. As a result, the President did not receive the full bill. The distinguished majority leader, Mr. Hoyer, has been working to remedy this situation so the President may receive the full bill for his consideration. 
   As a result, if a resolution is reached, and I do not know the status of the negotiations between Mr. Hoyer and Mr. Boehner, the resulting end product will be brought to the floor without further delay so that we may complete nearly 2 years of effort and deliver once and for all on the promises we made long ago to America's farmers and ranchers. 
   In the meantime I must remind our colleagues that the current farm bill extension is set to expire unless we act today. Whether a resolution is reached in the coming days or how we resolve this clerical error, we must, Mr. Speaker, extend the current farm bill and this rule will simply allow that to occur.     
   Much will be made of this rule by my friends on the other side of the aisle, but I will remind them that any farm bill measure that may come before the House today will come up under suspension of the rules. That means that two-thirds of the House must support any suspension bill in order for it to pass the House. That further means that there will be no political gamesmanship and we must have a strong bipartisan vote in order to pass any bill that reaches the floor. 
   The farm bill conference report has overwhelming bipartisan support. It passed this House with 318 votes. It passed the Senate with 81 votes. It represents the tireless effort of many Members, including myself, and is far too important to fail, Mr. Speaker, especially in light of what was an unintended clerical error. 
   This rule ensures swift passage of a bipartisan defense bill and a remedy to our already passed bipartisan farm bill, and I demand that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle support the rule. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. I would just like to say to my friend and the gentleman from Washington State that his claim that it was never brought before the House is simply not the facts. I was on the floor. I heard Mr. Peterson announce to the floor that in fact there had been an error yesterday during the debate for the override. In fact, Mr. Peterson said that he had been discussing with Mr. Goodlatte the situation and how to remedy it. In fact, Mr. Hoyer acknowledged it on the floor. 
   There has been no glossing over this. Mr. Hoyer readily acknowledged on the floor last night that there was a clerical error about this. Certainly we are concerned about how to remedy this. That is why we are bringing this rule to the floor. We are also concerned that the farm bill expires. We have brought a resolution to the floor that allows for a bipartisan compromise that would fix that situation. 
   We are trying to solve problems here today. We are trying to do right by our military, we are trying to do right by our farmers, and we are doing it in a manner that would require, with regard to the farmers, at least, a two-thirds vote of this House to resolve the problem. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I would submit that we are doing everything possible to remedy this situation, and we are doing it in a bipartisan manner. 
   With that, I would like to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui), a member of the Rules Committee, a leader in the farm bill debate, and a great friend.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, with regard to the comments we just heard from our distinguished former chairman of the committee, while a lot of us have sympathy for the amendment that the gentleman put forward, it is my understanding that no defense contractor currently can meet the requirements of that 85 percent. So that is an issue that is bigger than just simply this bill. It probably needs to be dealt with in the Armed Services Committee so they can decide the proper course of action, and it was not ruled in order for that reason.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I will let the numbers speak for themselves. 
   The bipartisan defense bill passed through the committee by a vote of 61-0. Fifty-eight amendments were made in order in the spirit of maintaining that bipartisan vote. The bipartisanship that was exhibited on the farm bill and the farm bill vote was 318 ayes, and 81 in the Senate voted ``aye.'' 
   However you look at it, the facts remain that these overwhelmingly bipartisan measures deserve and demand our strongest support. I encourage the House to vote in the affirmative. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and on the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Arkansas for his leadership on the Blue Dog Coalition. I know you are talking tonight about the Blue Dog 12-point plan for fiscal responsibility. I am just so grateful to the gentleman from Arkansas for all his work on this. 
   I want to report to the House and to the country and to all of my colleagues in the Blue Dog Coalition that today in the Rules Committee for the first time we dealt with some issues. Actually, the PAYGO discussion came up, since our Speaker and the House reinstated PAYGO and the Democrats took over the Congress. In fact, today, we are going to be in just a few minutes having a reportable rule that will talk about the reduction and the interest rates that Americans will be soon paying on student loans. 
   In that discussion, it was ironic, because in the opening session where we debated the PAYGO rules, the Republican Members of Congress, or a number of them, criticized the Democrats saying we were not doing real PAYGO. Today in the Rules Committee, when the PAYGO rules in fact capped some of what we would like to do, we will not be able to do everything we want to do for student loans right out of the chute, but we will do a significant amount; but we did it under the PAYGO rules and we are doing what we can do under the PAYGO rules. 
   There was criticism that we weren't doing enough, that we should have done more, and we really didn't need to pay for it. We live by the spirit and the letter of the law of the PAYGO rules that we put in place on day one. In fact, we will have a good bill tomorrow that will limit the PAYGO rules. So it is ironic on day one they were criticizing us that we were not going to do real PAYGO. Then we live by the spirit and the letter of the law and they criticize us that we should have done more and not pay for it.     
   So, Mr. Speaker, I just came down here to point out that irony; to talk about how effective the PAYGO rules are that are already being put in place and how I think it is a tremendous testament to the work of all the Blue Dogs in the coalition that we have made this impact on the Congress, and we will continue to do so. 
   I yield back to my colleague from Arkansas, and thank him again for his work.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and the underlying bill. 
   It is the responsibility of this Congress, ladies and gentlemen, to demand accountability from this President and insist on concrete results from the Iraqi Government. Ladies and gentlemen, our troops are laying their lives on the line every single day. The least we can do is demand and require Iraqi accountability. This bill embraces that responsibility and sets the stage for handing over control of security of Iraq to the Iraqis. 
   It is also the responsibility of this Congress to provide our troops with the resources they need to do their jobs. And let there be no confusion. This bill provides full funding for our men and women in uniform, who continue to serve the country with great courage and dedication. 
   This bill also provides $1.7 billion in new funding for veterans' health care, something that is direly needed. The state of veterans' health care in America is in crisis, and our troops deserve better. 
   In addition, this bill will help us refocus our efforts on those who attacked us on September 11 by increasing funding for the war against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. 
   It is deeply troubling to me that this war in Iraq has undermined our efforts to address the urgent threats in the war on terror. After failing to kill Osama bin Laden when we had the chance at Tora Bora, the administration turned its attention to Iraq, allowing the Taliban to regain lost ground in Afghanistan. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, our goals in Iraq must reflect reality. For far too long Congress served as nothing more than a rubber stamp for this President's disastrous policy in Iraq. Those days, Mr. Speaker, are over. Iraq has descended into a bloody civil war that cannot be resolved by the American military. Even our military commander in Iraq, General Petraeus, has said there is no military solution to this conflict. 
   The Sunni-Shia divide goes back 1,400 years. America alone cannot reverse 14 centuries of division and hate. 
   I support the rule, and I support the underlying bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this conference report and want to single out one provision that is vital if we are going to protect our children. 
   I want to thank Chairman OBEY for including language in this conference report adopted by the Senate which includs $500,000 for a feasibility study for a National Registry of Substantiated Cases of Child Abuse or Neglect, as described in the Adam Walsh Child Protection Act. I also want to thank my home state colleague, Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN, who was instrumental in getting the Senate to adopt this important provision. 
   The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act was signed into law in July of 2006. This landmark piece of legislation served to reform the Federal standards for sex offender registration, enhances criminal penalties for sex offenders, creates and amends various grant programs to protect children, and called for the creation of a National Child Abuse Registry to further protect America's children. 
   Unfortunately, child abuse is a huge problem and the statistics tell a troubling story. Each week, child protective services, CPS, agencies throughout the United States receive more than 50,000 reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. In 2002, 2.6 million reports concerning the welfare of approximately 4.5 million children were made. 
   In over two-thirds of these cases, an assessment or investigation followed. As a result of these investigations, approximately 896,000 children were found to have been victims of abuse or neglect--an average of more than 2,450 children per day. 
   As the parent of two children adopted from foster care, I am particularly concerned about the number of children in the foster care system who have been physically abused. 
   People who work in the foster care system estimate that the percentages of boys and girls in foster care who have been physically abused is as high as 75 percent. Many came into foster care initally because of physical abuse and others are children who were revictimized while in foster care. 
   This is unconscionable. All children, no matter what their background, deserve to grow up in a stable and loving home. 
   The Adam Walsh Act addresses this problem by directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish the National Registry which would be available to child protection authorities for use as a resource in tracking previous instances of child maltreatment in order to enable child protection workers to be better equipped with relevant information in assessing cases. 
   Each State already collects information on substantiated cases of abuse and neglect, but once an investigation is under way, adult perpetrators need only to move to another State to escape detection and punishment. This National Registry will address this loophole and ensure that violators, no matter where they live, can be brought to justice.  
   Unfortunately, the Registry has not come to fruition. This legislation would require the Department of Health and Human Services to complete the study on the feasibility of establishing the Registry within a year of enactment. 
   The President should sign this conference report and enact this vital provision. We must do a better job of protecting our Nation's most vital resource, our children, and this money will help us in that effort.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness that I rise today to honor the late Jose Rivera, a correctional officer at the Federal penitentiary in Atwater, California. 
   Officer Rivera's life was taken by two inmates on Friday, June 20, 2008. He was 22 years old. He is survived by his mother, Terry, by his sisters Teresa, Martha and Angelica and by his brother, Daniel. 
   After graduating from Le Grand High School, he served for 4 years in the Navy, completing two tours of duty in Iraq, and he began his career as a correctional officer on August 5, 2007. His life of service was cut tragically short. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have long voiced my concerns, most recently in a letter I sent in April to the director of the Bureau of Prisons, about the lack of sufficient resources and staff to safely operate our Federal prisons. 
   The fact is that staffing levels are decreasing while inmate populations are increasing. The Atwater Penitentiary is operating at 85 percent of the staffing level and is at 25 percent overcapacity for inmate levels. 
   As we honor Officer Rivera's legacy of commitment and service to our country, his senseless death is a reminder that we must provide adequate funds to keep our prisons and our communities safe.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in full support of officially recognizing October 8, 2008, as 4-H National Youth Science Day. 
   To show its commitment to providing a quality science education, 4-H National Youth Science Day will take place during National 4-H Week and features a ``National Science Experiment''--a designated science activity that will engage youth across the country in environmental issues relating to water conservation and groundwater contamination. 
   Over 100 years ago, 4-H began with the creation of agriculture projects geared at ensuring the future of our Nation's rural youth. Today, with a membership of 6 million young people, 4-H is America's largest youth organization and is an essential tool to engage and educate our future generations of scientists and inventors at a young age. 
   My own daughter Brittany had a very positive experience with 4-H in California learning  how to sew and quilt and raising her heifer named Lucy. 
   4-H's efforts to make science education enjoyable and interesting are noteworthy as barely 18 percent of 12th grade students in the United States are currently performing at or above the proficient level in science. 
   Similarly, only 32.4 percent of undergraduates in America are leaving college with a bachelor's degree in science or engineering, and a majority of scientists believe that the United States is falling behind in science and innovation. 
   In response to these sobering statistics, the National Academy of Sciences issued the timely report Rising Above the Gathering Storm, calling for an ambitious national program to address the need for increased math and science education. 
   According to the report, two important factors that America depends on to compete successfully in the global marketplace are: (1) a well-trained and technically competent workforce; and (2) the production of scientific and technological innovations. 
   Recognizing and promoting these goals is critical if America is going to remain a competitive leader in the global economy, and assistance from programs like 4-H will be vital in this effort. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in my support for H. Res. 1390 to officially recognize October 8, 2008, as 4-H National Youth Science Day and encourage young people of all ages and backgrounds to pursue their interest in science and innovation.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARDOZA. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe in a robust military and a strong national defense; however, I oppose this escalation, because I do not believe that it will make America safer or improve security in Iraq. 
   At this hour, sending more American forces cannot reasonably be expected to resolve a civil war rooted in over 14 centuries of deep-seated historical division. I oppose the escalation because I believe that we must recognize Iraq for what it is, not what we want it to be. 
   Our best hope lies not with increasing Iraqi dependence on us, but rather in handing over responsibility to them. This ultimate success or failure is the endeavor that now lies in the hands of them, not us.     
   Our goal in Iraq must reflect reality. Our objective should be to protect the ethnic minorities and religious minorities from further oppression and genocide, and to maintain a strong deterrent against the spread of a broader war in the Middle East. None of these ends is served, however, by simply escalating the failed strategy that has gotten us to this point today. 
   Like most Americans, I am deeply dismayed by this administration's inept prosecution of this war. At almost every turn, the President and his team have been intolerant and dismissive to outside advice, the consequences of which have been dire. The President sent our men and women into battle absent a real plan and lacking the tools they need to protect themselves. By pushing our allies aside, the President has isolated America from the world. We are now bearing the burden of this war virtually alone. It did not have to come to this. 
   From the beginning, responsible critics who genuinely desire success in Iraq have offered the President and his team sensible strategies for changing course. Almost 3 years ago, I proposed a plan to the President that offered a responsible path forward. I am still waiting to this day for a response. 
   President Roosevelt during World War II, President Truman during Korea and the dawn of the Cold War, President Kennedy during the Cuban missile crisis, and President Reagan at the twilight of the Cold War all successfully guided the ship of state through the roughest of seas. That caliber of leadership has been sorely lacking during this challenging time for our Nation. This President's inability to admit and correct mistakes has not served our Nation or our troops well. Now Iraq has descended into a bloody civil war that cannot be resolved by the American military. The Sunni-Shia divide goes back 1,400 years. Twenty thousand more American troops cannot reverse 14 centuries of division and hate in that country. 
   According to a recent poll, 71 percent of Iraqis want us to leave. Sixty-one percent of Iraqis support attacking U.S. troops. To argue that increasing our presence in Iraq will lessen the violence defies common sense. The American people and our military did not sign up for refereeing a civil war halfway across our planet. History has taught us that outside powers are ill-equipped to influence or resolve civil wars in foreign lands. 
   I am also deeply troubled that the war in Iraq has undermined our efforts to address urgent threats in the war on terrorism, note notably in Afghanistan. After failing to kill Osama bin Laden at Tora Bora, the administration turned its attention to Iraq, allowing the Taliban to regain lost ground. 
   I believe we must refocus our efforts on the following objectives: 
   Stopping the spread of a wider war in the Middle East. 
   Preventing a humanitarian crisis in Iraq. 
   Protecting the ethnic and religious groups, such as Assyrian Christians, who are vulnerable to persecution. 
   And we must redouble our efforts to snuff out the Taliban in Afghanistan. 
   Let me close, Mr. Speaker, by paying homage to our men and women in uniform. Some have alleged that this debate is inconsistent with support for our troops. Those who insist that Congress should remain silent on this issue are very familiar with that word ``silence.'' Many have remained silent when it comes time to supporting care for our veterans and their families as well. Many have stood idly by for years as our troops went into battle lacking the equipment and body armor they needed. Most of all, far too many have been invisible when it comes to genuinely supporting our servicemen and women by insisting on an effective plan to conclude and win this conflict. Simply repeating the word ``victory'' does not equal a plan, or support for our men and women in uniform. 
   I want to conclude by thanking those serving in harm's way. These brave men and women are America's finest. They have done everything that has been asked of them and more. Let us honor them by thanking them for a job well done and pursuing a policy that is worthy of their sacrifice.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARDOZA. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3056, TAX COLLECTION RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 719 provides for consideration of H.R. 3056, the Tax Collection Responsibility Act of 2007 under the traditional closed rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Ways and Means. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except for clause 9 and 10 of rule XXI. Finally, the rule provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today, H.R. 3056, implements several measures to protect the interest of taxpayers and the integrity of our tax system. First, it would once and for all repeal the IRS's authority to contract with private debt collection companies. The collection of Federal income taxes is inherently a governmental function and at the crux of what governmental responsibilities should be. This was stated as early as 1819 by Chief Justice Marshall. It was reaffirmed by Congress in 1874, when the Ways and Means Committee said that ``any system of farming the collection of any portion of the revenue of the government is fundamentally wrong.'' 
   Tax farming, giving a private entity the right to collect taxes on a commission basis, has created modern-day bounty hunters who have no regard for the taxpayer, only regard for their company's bottom line. 
   Taxpayers are heavily pressured to reveal their Social Security numbers, last known address, date of birth, and other confidential information over the telephone to private contractors working on commissions of up to 25 percent of their take. 
   In this modern day and age where identity theft runs rampant, why would we want to turn over people's Social Security numbers and who knows what other confidential information to someone who is only out to protect their own bottom line? Noted Princeton economist Paul Krugman recently penned in the New York Times, ``Tax farming went out with the French Revolution; now the tax farmers are back.'' How right he is. 
   The irony is that we tried this private tax collection scheme in 1996 and promptly abandoned it. Why? Because the IRS's Inspector General found that private contractors regularly violated our own Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, threatened the confidentiality of taxpayers' personal information, and on top of all that, cost the government a net revenue loss of $17 million. 
   Despite this past history, the Republican Congress renewed this authority in 2004. What has happened since that renewal? Well, the Federal Government has spent an additional $71 million of taxpayers' hard-earned money and they have collected a grand total of $20 million in tax revenue. That is right, Mr. Speaker; we have lost another $50 million on an inefficient program that experts readily admit does not work. Even more absurd is that had the IRS been given that money, the $71 million, instead, it would have collected almost $1.5 billion. 
   The House has long recognized that this program simply does not work. In fact, language to stop private debt collection has passed on a strong bipartisan basis twice but has not made it into law. But don't just take my word for it. The National Taxpayer Advocate, appointed by the Treasury Secretary, reported to Congress that ``the money spent on the IRS Private Debt Collection initiative is an inefficient use of government dollars.'' Even past and present IRS Commissioners have repeatedly admitted before Congress that IRS employees could perform this task at far less cost than the private agencies. 
   I firmly believe that when the government actually does something better than the private sector, cheaper and more efficiently than the private sector, then the government should do that job. The reality, Mr. Speaker, is that IRS employees are better trained, better equipped and better prepared to handle these important responsibilities. They also protect American citizens' privacy. 
   H.R. 3056 recognizes this reality and restores this fundamental responsibility to the Federal Government, as our Founding Fathers intended. Second, H.R. 3056 includes language based on legislation introduced by my friend and colleague from Florida (Mr. Meek), which provides tax relief to small businesses and administrative relief to local jurisdictions by delaying implementation of an onerous tax burden. 
   Section 511 of the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005, passed by the then-Republican Congress to raise revenue, requires tax withholding of 3 percent on payments to vendors providing property or services to the government beginning in January of 2011. The 3 percent withholding requirement presents a number of administrative and practical challenges for businesses, including reducing the cash flow they need to meet operating expenses, pay suppliers or subcontractors, or meet payroll. They also present several problems for governments, including how State and local governments will be able to comply with this law, much less how the IRS will be able to afford and administer such a requirement. 
   H.R. 3056 takes a commonsense approach to this issue and delays the implementation of the 3 percent withholding requirement for 1 year. It further calls on the Department of the Treasury to study the compliance issues confronting businesses and government and report the findings to Congress. This measure is supported by State and local governments and a broad array of business organizations, including the United States Chamber of Commerce, the Financial Services Roundtable, the American Bankers Association, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Federation of Independent Business, among others. 
   H.R. 3056 also clarifies that U.S. citizens who claim to be bona fide residents of the U.S. Virgin Islands receive the same procedural and administrative rights afforded to other U.S. taxpayers. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3056 strictly adheres to the House PAYGO rule. This bill is paid for primarily by eliminating a tax loophole that currently allows wealthy individuals to avoid paying U.S. taxes simply by renouncing their citizenship or terminating their U.S. residency. Despite what you may hear today, let me be clear, closing this loophole has broad, bipartisan support and has been supported by my Republican colleagues. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Rangel, Mr. Van Hollen, Mr. Meek, and the Ways and Means Committee members for their hard work in bringing this legislation to the floor today. 
   Mr. Speaker, this commonsense bill protects taxpayers, preserves the integrity of our tax system, and makes our tax system fairer for all. It deserves strong support of all the Members of this House floor today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we said in our opening statement, tax bills are traditionally closed due to their complexity. Under Democrats, before 1994, they were closed. Under Mr. Dreier's administration in the House Rules Committee under the Republican leadership, they were traditionally closed. Now we continue to maintain that practice. Because tax laws are so complex, late amendments that have not been fully vetted and analyzed are simply too complex to insert into the Tax Code without knowing their full ramifications. 
   Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Sessions, my colleague from Texas, mentioned that the McCrery substitute was not made in order. He is correct about that. It was not made in order because it violates the PAYGO provisions of our House rules. I have a copy of it right here. It simply does not meet the PAYGO statutory requirements of the House rules. 
   Finally, the Republican privatization bill that had passed in a prior Congress, when it was implemented it spent $71 million to collect $20 million. That is a loss of $50 million. Even with the creative accounting of the Republican ``voodoo math,'' I cannot believe that they are advocating continuation of this program that has lost money. 
   Further, the use of private contractors to collect Federal taxes violates a confidential and fundamental relationship between American taxpayers and the Federal Government. IRS employees have access to a taxpayer's complete tax history, including personal information that is ready identifiable. That should be restricted only to IRS employees. By prohibiting the IRS from hiring private debt collectors, this bill will ensure that the privacy rights of Americans and other confidential information of taxpayers is protected from bounty hunters working on commissions of up to 25 percent. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, my colleague from California is a very skilled orator, and I appreciate his speaking ability. I will tell you, however, one of the great tools that people use when they are as talented as Mr. Dreier is, when they don't want to talk about the bill at hand, they talk about everything else around it. 
   The reality is that the bill at hand, the rule that we are trying to move forward to bring a bill to the House floor today, eliminates privatization of tax collection. 
   Now, my Republican colleagues on the other side of the aisle love privatization. They love it in Iraq where it has not worked and our military is struggling under the burden of having privatization and contractors, war contractors not doing what they should be doing and charging four times what they should be charging to do it. We see all of the problems that have happened there. 
   We have seen the same thing happen here in the United States where Federal contracts have been let. Mr. Waxman's committee has done incredible work rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in the private contractor system. 
   And then they want to turn over the collection system of the IRS to private hands, putting at risk all Americans' private information and documents. They like privatization; they just don't like protecting your privacy. 
   The gentleman from California talked about all kinds of issues but he didn't talk about the root problem that we are trying to address here, and that is stopping bounty hunters from harassing American taxpayers. 
   Finally, Mr. Dreier talked at great length about the McCrery substitute and the fact that Mr. McCrery has not gotten a substitute this year. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is the second time this year that I have managed a rule where the Republican substitute has violated the House rules. I am a member of the Blue Dog Coalition as well as being a member of the Rules Committee. I am very proud that for the whole time I have been here as a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, we advocated for advancement of the PAYGO rule. We believe in fiscal responsibility. We believe we need to pay our debts. So we got, when we took over the majority, inserted into the House rules a clause that says we have to pay as we go. We have to do it like every American taxpayer has to run their own home. We have to run this House in a fiscally responsible way. And so we mandated the PAYGO rules. 
   The substitute put forward by the Republicans, for the second time that I have managed a rule anyway, has violated those PAYGO rules. When you don't follow the House rules, you can't expect your amendment to be made in order, Mr. Speaker. I encourage my colleagues to abide by those rules and honor the process. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I wish to commend my colleague Mr. English. He is a very thoughtful individual and a very good legislator, and I would just say that while his amendment was PAYGO compliant, we were not aware of that until this morning when the tax tables were submitted to the Ways and Means Committee. So last night when the Rules Committee was dealing with this issue, we had no way of knowing whether his substitute was, in fact, PAYGO compliant or not. 
   With regard to Mr. McCrery's substitute, I have it here with me. The substitute that was submitted by Mr. McCrery was, in fact, not PAYGO compliant. Now, Mr. Sessions says that he made the motion to allow it to be PAYGO compliant, but the bill before us at that point in the Rules Committee was not. 
   I would like to say, also, that Mr. English's substitute doesn't deal with the base bill, which is to stop the privatization of tax collection, and that is what the majority is trying to get at today. 
   Now, certainly there are other issues that are worthy of consideration in this institution. AMT is certainly one of them. But in this provision today, the majority wants to bring forward a bill that would stop American taxpayers from being harassed by private bounty hunters. That's the issue before us today. And all the other issues that people are trying to discuss one way or another, they have nothing to do with this base bill and really don't apply to the debate we want to have in the next hour. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close. 
   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today, the Tax Collection Responsibility Act of 2007, stops wasting taxpayer money on programs that cost too much, gives away confidential taxpayer information, and results in taxpayer harassment by bounty hunters and simply never has and never will work. It didn't work in the early 1800s, it didn't work in the late 1800s, and it doesn't work in the year 2007. 
   Mr. Sessions mentioned that there are these Republican best practices that would enhance our collection methods. Well, let's talk about that. 
   The Republican bill spent $71 million to collect $20 million, resulting in a $51 million loss. If Mr. Sessions wants to claim those as Republican best practices, he can do that. However, if the Federal Government employees, the traditional men and women who have served our country honorably, if they had had the ability to use that same $71 million, they would have collected $1.5 billion in taxes owed to this Treasury, $1.5 billion that could be used to, well, maybe fund SCHIP so that our poor young children could get the health care they deserve. 
   Mr. Sessions talks about that this bill only has 11 cosponsors. Well, this bill is a compilation of bills that was put together in the last few weeks, and, in fact, the base bills that this bill is based upon, Mr. Van Hollen's bill has 156 coauthors and Mr. Meek of Florida's bill has over 100. So there is wide support for this bill. The public should not believe that there are just a few folks thinking this is a good idea. This has wide support. It has had a number of hearings in the Ways and Means Committee, and there has been great testimony with regard to the fact that the current program put in by the Republicans in the last few years has not and will not work and should not continue to be allowed as the law of the land. 
   H.R. 3056 does something very fundamental. It protects taxpayers and ensures their privacy. It addresses withholding concerns raised by business and local government. It cracks down on yet another tax loophole for the wealthy that has been left open under the prior Congresses for far too long, and, most importantly, it continues to make our taxes fair for all. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. It deserves this House's strong support. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and on the previous question.  
   Mr. HERGER Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Rule on H.R. 3056, the Tax Collection Responsibility Act. This rule, on legislation to halt collection of previously uncollected tax debts, wrongly prohibits any Republican amendments. An Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute by Ways and Means Ranking Member JIM MCCRERY, would have allowed for consideration of full repeal of the 3 percent withholding burden, which is so important to thousands of U.S. businesses. This was rejected by the Rules Committee on Tuesday evening. This rule stifles debate and is counter-productive to the bipartisanship we've worked for this year on the 3 percent withholding repeal. I urge my colleagues to reject the rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Chairman, I support this legislation, and believe that it will improve accountability in Federal contracting and increase the amount of information provided to the public and to Congress about Federal contracts. However, I believe that more needs to be done. 
   I am particularly concerned about overuse of exemption four of the Freedom of Information Act--the exemption that protects trade secrets and business confidential information. Too often, this exemption is used to withhold information about Federal contracts that should be made public. 
   With minimal exceptions for proprietary information, the public should have access to information submitted to the Federal Government in application for Federal contracts. And agencies should release information to the public regarding questionable performance of Federal contractors. The public should be able to easily access through FOIA information relating to whether a contractor actually performed the work required under the terms of the contract as well as information that indicates the use of substandard materials or work practices in performing the contract. 
   Waste, fraud, and abuse in contracting is all to common. Contractors should not be able to hide behind a FOIA exemption in order to keep their poor performance out of the public eye. 
   I have spoken to Chairman WAXMAN and he has pledged to jointly request that GAO conduct an examination of this issue and clarify what legitimately qualifies as an exemption for confidential business information. I appreciate Mr. WAXMAN's interest in this issue and look forward to working with him.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, House Resolution 861 provides for consideration of H.R. 4351, the Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2007, under a closed rule. The rule provides for 1 hour of general debate, equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except for clause 9 and clause 10 of rule XXI. Finally, the rule provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
   Madam Speaker, the Democratic philosophy is simple: We believe in pay-as-you-go. In other words, we believe that you should live within your financial means. Every family that makes these choices around the kitchen table every month in order to live within its budget understands that simple fact of life. The Federal Government used to understand this, too. In fact, the Clinton administration and the Democratic Congress worked with Republicans on a bipartisan basis and turned decades of exploding budget deficits into 4 straight years of budget surpluses through the use of pay-as-you-go or PAYGO rules in this House. 
   The use of PAYGO through the 1990s and early 2000s helped lead us to the first Federal budget surpluses in over 30 years at that time, and we saw record economic growth during that period which resulted in the addition of 22 million American jobs. And in that time, America actually began to pay down the national debt to foreign nations. Despite the proven success of PAYGO, President Bush and the Republican Congress abandoned the PAYGO rules in the year 2002, allowing it to expire with no interest in reinstating it. 
   According to the Bush administration's own numbers, President Bush's policies are on track to increase the Federal debt by over $4 trillion by the year 2008. 
   It took, Madam Speaker, 41 Presidents combined to accumulate the total of $4 trillion in debt. This means that the debt America incurred over the first 200 plus years of our Nation will be doubled in only 8 years under the Bush administration. 
   Worse, Madam Speaker, about 80 cents of every dollar of new debt since the year 2001 has been financed by foreign investors, including foreign governments, especially China. This has resulted in 50 percent of our Nation's debt now being owned by the following countries: China, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. 
   At the start of the 110th Congress, Democrats provided real choices and a new direction for America. We made good on our commitment to PAYGO and did what 6 years of Republican Congresses before us refused to do: We restored PAYGO rules to make sure that we do not spend more money than we have. 
   Once again, the Democratic leadership brings to the floor H.R. 4351, the Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2007, that provides millions of middle-class families with tax cuts to help grow our economy without increasing our national debt. H.R. 4351 prevents 23 million families from being hit by the AMT, and it helps 12 million children by expanding their child tax credit. 
   The Republicans will surely say that this bill raises taxes, but that is far from the truth. Let me set the record straight right from the beginning. This bill closes tax loopholes that allows a privileged few on Wall Street to pay a lower tax rate on their income than other hardworking Americans, such as school teachers, police officers, firefighters, and our Nation's veterans. This bill stops hedge fund managers from making hundreds of millions of dollars by using offshore tax havens to avoid paying income tax while other middle-class families play by the rules and pay their fair share. 
   It also prevents multinational companies from shifting their income to offshore entities and from creating sham corporations in tax-friendly jurisdictions to avoid Federal taxation. We would all love not to have to pay our taxes. Why should we allow these big corporations to go offshore to avoid paying their fair share? 
   It seems only fair that if hardworking American middle-class families play by the rules and pay their fair share that the wealthy and huge multinational corporations that are gaming the system should pay their fair share as well. 
   Madam Speaker, this Congress has made great strides to get our fiscal house in order. If we want to continue down the path towards fiscal sanity, we must make sure that every piece of legislation that we consider, including this bill, fixing the AMT, complies with the PAYGO rules. The Blue Dogs and the House Democratic leadership are standing strong behind our commitment to fiscal responsibility through PAYGO. I would like to thank Speaker Pelosi, Leader Hoyer and Chairman Rangel for their unwavering commitment to sticking with the PAYGO rules. I would also like to reiterate to the other body that our leadership is committed to abiding by the PAYGO rules and not considering any AMT bill on the House floor that is not fully paid for. 
   Madam Speaker, the $9.1 trillion debt that our country has irresponsibly racked up, nearly half of which has happened in the last 6 years, must be paid back, and it will be paid back by our children and our grandchildren if not by us. We need to adhere to the old adage that we should provide a better  life for our children than the ones that we found ourselves. Quite simply, we should be investing in our children's future and not borrowing from it. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make the right choice today, to stand by PAYGO today, to stand by PAYGO tomorrow, and support this commonsense legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, the Republicans have said that this bill raises taxes, but that's far from the truth. Let me again, as I did in my opening, set the record straight. This bill closes tax loopholes that allow a privileged few on Wall Street to pay a lower tax rate on their income than the average hardworking American does on their income. That includes school teachers, police officers, firefighters, our Nation's veterans, and, frankly, even us privileged that are able to serve here as Members of Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Republicans need to make a choice today. Are they going to stand with tax cheats and hedge fund managers, or are they going to stand with the 23 million hardworking Americans who will be affected by this policy? 
   Mr. Speaker, the House of Representatives is united in our commitment to fiscal discipline and ensuring that government lives within its means. The Democratic Congress pledged to exercise spending restraint and to stop shouldering our country's needs on the backs of our children and grandchildren. We strongly urge the other body, Democrats and Republicans, to have the courage and good sense to keep the promise they made to the American people to be good stewards of their taxpayer dollars. We can't pick and choose when we comply with PAYGO rules if we want to reverse the irresponsible fiscal policy of the Bush administration and the prior Republican Congresses. 
   By restoring budget discipline and getting back on the path to budget surpluses, we ensure America is economically strong and that we are not beholden to foreign nations such as China, Japan, Iran and Saudi Arabia whom we are borrowing this money from; that we are protecting our Social Security and Medicare programs; and that paying down the national debt is not a burden that we are going to put on the backs of our children and generations to come. 
   With this, Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and a ``yes'' vote on the previous question.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this rule and the underlying bill, H.R. 976, The Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2007. 
   This bill provides $1.3 billion in tax breaks for small business owners and is one of the final steps toward raising the federal minimum wage from $5.15 per hour to $7.25 per hour. 
   It has been 9 1/2 years since the last minimum wage increase despite widespread support across the country and within the U.S. Congress. And why? Because of partisan politics, and special interests coming before the people's interests. 
   The Democratic Congress promised a change in priorities. And as one of our first measures of business, Democrats brought a minimum wage increase to the House floor, which received overwhelming bipartisan support. The other body has followed suit and we must work to resolve our differences, which is why we bring this bill before the House today. 
   A recent poll showed that 89 percent of Americans favor raising the minimum wage. The American public deserves--and has demanded--that raise. With our immediate consideration of this bill, we will heed that call. Hard-working Americans have waited far too long to receive an honest day's pay for an honest day's work. 
   The people's time has come. We have pledged to act in the public's best interests and we must do so without further delay. Passage of this rule and H.R. 976 will speed enactment of the long overdue increase in the minimum wage. 
   The Democratic Congress also pledged to reach across the aisle in a bipartisan manner and address the priorities of all Americans. Our bipartisan effort resulted in the carefully constructed compromise that we have before us today. This bill isn't about partisan politics, it's just good policy. 
   H.R. 976 will help give hard-working families the pay increase they so richly deserve, and ensure small business owners have every opportunity to succeed and prosper. And it will do so in a fiscally responsible manner that will avoid adding to the legacy of debt being left to our children and grandchildren. 
   Simply stated, this bill is good for taxpayers, good for business, good for people, and is just good policy.

   Republican Senator Roberts of Kansas said, ``I'm not for excessive spending and I strongly oppose the federalization of health care. And if the administration's concerns about this bill were accurate, I would support a veto. But, bluntly, they are not.'' 
   And Republican Senator Hatch from Utah thinks the President ``has been sold a bill of goods'' on this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARDOZA. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3867, SMALL BUSINESS CONTRACTING PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, House Resolution 773 provides for the consideration of H.R. 3867, the Small Business Contracting Program Improvements Act, under a structured rule. 
   As the Clerk reported, the rule provides 1 hour of general debate, equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Small Business. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except for clause 9 and 10 of rule XXI. 
   Ten amendments that were submitted to the Rules Committee for consideration were made in order. All four Republican amendments that were submitted and six Democratic amendments that were submitted were all  made in order. Finally, the rule provides for one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
   Through a series of laws and procurement requirements, Congress established a benchmark for the SBA to give small businesses every opportunity to compete fairly for the award of Federal contracts. Despite a clear mandate that has been in existence for more than 50 years, small businesses have not received their fair share of Federal Government contracts. This is especially true regarding the service-disabled veterans, men and women, and minority-owned businesses. 
   In 2006 alone, the Federal Government spent over $417 billion on goods and services, but small businesses have been continuously losing out on contracting opportunities. This is a tragedy. Small businesses are the engines of our economy; and securing a Federal contract is a major financial boon for these entrepreneurs, especially veterans, women, and businesses in low-income areas. 
   We cannot afford for our budding entrepreneurs to be shut out of what should be an open market and be denied opportunities to succeed, not when their existence is so vital to our economy, especially. H.R. 3867 takes several critical steps to assist small businesses' participation in Federal procurement by updating and expanding the SBA's procurement programs. 
   First, it improves contracting opportunities for service-disabled veteran businesses. Today only 0.87 percent of Federal contracts are granted to service-disabled veteran businesses, a far cry from the 3 percent goal that was enacted in 1999. 
   H.R. 3867 gives service-disabled veteran businesses priority for Federal contracts, providing more opportunities for our Nation's veterans to become successful entrepreneurs. 
   It also codifies President Bush's executive order directing agencies to provide veterans resources and assistance they need to participate in Federal contracting processes. 
   Second, H.R. 3867 aids women-owned businesses with Federal procurement processes. The Women's Procurement Program was enacted 7 years ago to increase the number of contracts awarded to businesses owned by women. 
   However, the SBA has been dragging its feet in implementing the program, costing women tens of billions of dollars in lost contracting opportunities. H.R. 3867 fully implements the Women's Procurement Program, giving women-owned businesses greater access to the Federal marketplace. 
   The bill also takes the first step in modernizing the 8(a) program, which helps minority-owned businesses secure Federal contracts; but it has not been updated in over 20 years. The bill updates the 8(a) program to reflect today's economy so that minority-owned businesses have time to grow and graduate from the initiative.     
   Finally, H.R. 3867 continues the Democrats' commitment to combating fraud and eliminate wasting taxpayer dollars. 
   The bill enhances business integrity standards to ensure that taxpayer dollars only go to reputable individuals. It promotes self-policing to allow small businesses to challenge individual program awards. It protects disabled veterans by penalizing firms that falsely represent themselves as service-disabled veteran businesses, and it requires on-site reviews by SBA personnel before HUBZone contracts are awarded. 
   Madam Speaker, the bill before us today, H.R. 3867, has extremely strong bipartisan support. It passed the Small Business Committee by a vote of 21-4. 
   Among other organizations, it is supported by the National Federation of Independent Business, the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the National Black Chamber of Commerce, the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce, the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars. 
   I would like to thank Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez and members of the Small Business Committee for their hard work that went into this piece of legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, we all recognize the importance of small businesses to our economy. It is imperative that we follow through on our commitments to small business and give them every opportunity we can to succeed. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Madam Speaker, I would respond to my friend from Florida by saying that it is the hard copy being received in Rules Committee that needs to be done by the time that has been specified by the Rules Committee. Timely filed amendments were all made in order on the Republican side for this measure. We certainly look forward to our Republican colleagues filing amendments in committee when we've called for amendments to a bill, and encourage them to file on time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, the gentleman from Florida, my friend, has indicated that we are not adequately funding our Nation's veterans. I would like to remind the gentleman, my good friend, that the recent Republican-led Congress shortchanged veterans funding by failing to provide sufficient increases to keep up with VA's growing number of patients and the rising cost of health care while they were in charge. 
   In the summer of 2005, the VA confronted a $1.5 billion shortfall as they significantly underestimated the health care needs of the new veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. This year the VA expects to treat 5.8 million patients, 1.6 million more than in 2001. 
   The new Congress, under the Democratic majority, committed to taking the country in a new direction. For 2007, the Democratic-held Congress increased veterans funding by $5.2 billion, and the Congress is proposing an additional increase of $3.8 billion more than the President in fiscal year 2008. That is the largest increase in veterans funding in 77 years. 
   The Democratic Congress once again is bringing to the floor a bill that provides real solutions to the obstacles facing America's small business owners, innovators, and entrepreneurs. H.R. 3867 ensures that veterans, women, and minority-owned businesses and other underrepresented entrepreneurs receive the assistance they need to thrive in the Federal marketplace. It also paves the way for them to develop their companies, create jobs, and give a much-needed jolt to our economy. 
   Madam Speaker, securing a Federal contract is a major boon for entrepreneurs, especially those owned by minority and veteran small businesses. This bill is yet another step towards ensuring that these businesses are not, in fact, left behind, but rather given every opportunity to succeed. 
   I appreciate the debate with my friend from Florida, and I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and on the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, I thank him for his leadership and for allowing us to write this bill the way we did, including specialty crops. And I rise in strong support of overriding the misguided Presidential veto on the Farm, Conservation and Energy Act. 
   It is extremely unfortunate that we must go through this exercise on legislation that is so critically important to both rural and urban America alike. The bipartisan conference report on the 2008 farm bill represents the blood, sweat, and tears of many members on this floor and of the other body of the agriculture committees and including myself. We have made significant reforms, preserved the safety net for American farmers, and dramatically increased domestic nutrition assistance. And for the first time in history we have given specialty crops a seat at the table. We did all of this, and we complied with the PAYGO rules of this House. 
   It is not a perfect bill. There are some who would have preferred more conservation spending or more reforms. However, the 2008 farm bill is the product of hard work and compromise, and should not be discounted simply because we could not meet the unrealistic, impractical, and unworkable benchmarks set by the administration. 
   I take particularly strong exception to the President's repeated insistence in the farm bill that it must be vetoed in the name of international trade agreements. Meeting our global trade obligations should never trump critical domestic priorities. Our farmers have the capacity for immeasurable innovation and success, and they deserve our commitment and our support, and it is done in this farm bill. 
   The President has let down American agriculture today, and that is just a shame. But I am confident that, together with the Senate, we can override this veto today and make good on our promise to protect American farmers and ranchers. I strongly urge my colleagues to override this veto.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my concern for the devastating toll the housing crisis is taking on the neighborhoods of my district and throughout the country. 
   A report issued this week identified three cities in my district as having the highest rates of foreclosure in the entire Nation. In Stockton, Merced and Modesto, California, families are struggling to make increasing mortgage payments. Homeowners have lost over 40 percent of their homes' equity and communities are burdened with vacant, deteriorating housing. These vacant properties lower home values, attract vandalism and pests and contribute to overall neighborhood decline, as well as disrupting the family unit. At this rate, my district and communities across the country will be recovering from the foreclosure epidemic for years to come. 
   Borrowers and lenders have a duty to their country to help us overcome this housing crisis. Homeowners should try to work with banks instead of abandoning their homes. And financial institutions must restructure mortgages whenever feasible. 
   During the Great Depression, families and banks worked together to help America through these tough times. I urge us to get back to that attitude.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARDOZA. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 363, SOWING THE SEEDS THROUGH SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, House Resolution 318 provides for consideration of H.R. 363, the Sowing the Seeds through Science and Engineering Research Act, under a structured rule. 
   The rule provides for 1 hour of general debate, equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Science and Technology. 
   The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except for clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. The bill shall be considered as read. 
   The rule makes in order and provides appropriate waivers for all three amendments that were submitted for consideration. The first amendment to be debated on the floor will be that of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hall), the ranking member of the Science and Technology Committee. 
   Finally, the rule provides for one motion to recommit, with or without instructions. 
   Madam Speaker, the talent, intellect and entrepreneurial spirit of the American people have made this Nation the leader in economic and technological advancements. In fact, high-tech industries drive economic growth around the world. 
   Every day, however, my constituents tell me the United States has fallen further and further behind our competitors in Europe and Asia. The United States continues to lead the world in many statistical categories such as R&D spending and the number of scientists and engineers; however, the rest of the world is increasing its capacity, its R&D investments, and its will to catch up with us. 
   Other countries such as China and India are pouring resources into their scientific and technological infrastructure at staggering rates, which is increasing their ability to compete with us in the global economy. 
   For example, in South Korea, 38 percent of undergraduates received their degrees in science or engineering. In France, the figure is 47 percent. In China, it is 50 percent, and in Singapore, it is 67 percent. In the United States, only 15 percent of undergraduates receive a degree in science or engineering. More telling is the fact that approximately one-third of U.S. students intending to major in engineering switch majors to something else before graduating. 
   Madam Speaker, the warning signs could not be any clearer. Our leadership in the race to discovery is being challenged at unparalleled levels around the world. We cannot ignore this challenge, and we cannot afford to ignore this challenge. 
   Our society has always depended on innovation and discovery. It has depended on pioneers who push themselves to their intellectual and physical limits to find the hidden paths that lead to that discovery. Over 125 years ago, Thomas Edison who famously quipped that he had not failed but instead had found 10,000 different ways that would not work invented the light bulb, and it was Albert Einstein who once said, ``I never came upon any of my discoveries through the process of rational thinking.'' 
   My point, Madam Speaker, is that our advancement as a society depends on leading the search for the unknown. Americans must continue to research, we must continue to develop, and we must continue to innovate in order to create new and thriving industries that will produce millions of good jobs and a better future for our children. To do that, however, we must continue to reinvigorate America's commitment to this discovery process. 
   The National Academy of Sciences recently released a report, ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm.'' The report outlines specific recommendations to enhance the scientific building blocks in the United States. The bill we have today before us, H.R. 363, the Sowing the Seeds through Science and Engineering Research Act, draws directly from several of those recommendations. 
   To paraphrase the report, the report recommends that we strengthen our Nation's commitment to research to maintain the flow of new ideas that fuel the economy, provide security and enhance our quality of life. In that regard, H.R. 363 seeks to improve Federal support for scientific research and education in order to maintain our position as the unequivocal global leader in innovation. 
   H.R. 363 creates a program at the National Science Foundation to award grants to scientists and engineers at the early stage of their careers at colleges, universities and research institutions across the country. Young researchers are eligible to receive up to $80,000 per year for 5 years. 
   The awards are granted on a competitive basis and are based on intellectual merit of their work, the innovative or transformative nature of the proposed research, and the researcher's potential for leadership at the frontiers of knowledge. 
   The bill requires that the National Science Foundation director allocate at least 3.5 percent of its research funding for this grant program. The bill also creates a similar program in the Department of Energy for which $25 million is authorized. 
   H.R. 363 directs NSF to allocate at least 1.5 percent of its research funds  to an integrated graduate education and research training program. This program provides support to those scientists and engineers who will pursue careers in research and education. 
   Just this week, Madam Speaker, the president of my alma mater from the University of Maryland, Dr. Mote, came by to describe some of the challenges for young researchers in just this area. It is so appropriate that Congress is taking this action at this time. 
   This bill establishes the Presidential Innovation Award, an award which will recognize scientists and engineers who develop unique innovations in the national interests. The bill creates a national coordination office within the Office of Science and Technology Policy to better coordinate research efforts, and, finally, H.R. 363 directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology to provide a report to Congress on the efforts to attract and retain young researchers. 
   But this bill goes far beyond the long-lasting impacts of development and innovation. It goes far beyond our ability to create jobs and compete in a global economy. It will plant the seeds of hope for a better tomorrow in communities across this country. 
   I know firsthand what research funding will be able to do. The University of California in Merced, my hometown in my district, is on the cutting edge of several research projects where additional funding could spur the next big breakthrough. UC Merced is a leader in solar concentration technologies, just one of the many of our ongoing projects. To date, this research has largely been supported through public and private partnerships. However, increased research funding could potentially improve the efficiencies of solar power and solar thermal technologies; and if efficiency and affordability are within our grasp, we can decrease the carbon emissions and reduce our dependence on foreign oil, certainly worthy goals for this Congress. This is but one example of many research efforts across our country that has the potential to define and shape tomorrow. 
   It is this type of project that would benefit from the funding of this bill, but how many more ideas could become reality if our researchers only had the tools that they sorely need? How many more concepts, how many more ideas are out there on the horizon waiting to be discovered? 
   Madam Speaker, it is our duty and our responsibility as legislators to help make those dreams and ideas become a reality. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, before I turn it over and yield to my colleague from Texas, I just want to respond to the gentleman and say, on an ongoing basis, we have heard the same drumbeat that we are somehow trampling on the rights of the minority. It is true that this is a structured rule, but it is also true, as it was with the last bill, that every amendment that has been offered has been granted. Certainly that is in the spirit of collegiality and cooperation that this House deserves. We have gone far beyond what is required. This is not an open rule, but certainly we have done more open rules in this committee than was done in the past Congress already in the first few months. We are doing everything we can to accommodate the minority in both spirit and practice. 
   So I say to my colleague, my good friend from the State of Washington, that he has had the opportunity, every Member, I have heard no one who is clamoring for an amendment to this bill. In fact, all three amendments that were offered to the committee were, in fact, granted, and it seems to me that we are offering cooperation on a silver platter. We just need our colleagues to say ``yes'' and agree that we have done that.

Where there is research to be done, we must undertake it. There is opportunity to be pursued. This country has always pursued the opportunities presented. We have been an innovator in the last 225 years that we have been in existence, and we must continue to pursue it.

   Since 1909, the NAACP has been a leader in advancing civil rights and has sought to remove all barriers of racial discrimination through their use of legal and moral persuasion. 
   This organization has provided communities around the United States with strong and passionate leaders who have fought for social change. Among these organizations, it is an honor to note that California is home to 72 branches and youth units, each providing inspiration to their respective communities. 
   As we celebrate the accomplishments of the NAACP, we must also honor the values upon which it was founded, for there is much work left to be done, and the same tireless dedication and clarity of purpose will be required to continue onward. 
   I commend the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People for being champions of social justice and for their tireless efforts for almost a century. I look forward to celebrating their centennial in two years.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas, and I appreciate him yielding. 
   Today I rise because on Monday I reintroduced a bill the Blue Dogs had endorsed last year, H.R. 2402, the Public Official Accountability Act. 
   The Blue Dogs just aren't fiscally responsible, Mr. Speaker, but we're responsible in a number of other ways, and one is accountability of the Members of this institution to make sure that we uphold the public trust. 
   H.R. 2402 gives judges the discretion to increase the sentence for public officials convicted of certain enumerated crimes that violate the public trust. If a public official has been convicted of bribery, fraud, extortion or theft of public funds greater than $10,000, a sentencing judge should have the discretion to double the length of a sentence up to 2 years for those public officials convicted of such ethical violations. 
   Unfortunately, recent scandals have somewhat tarnished the reputation of this great institution and have stretched the bonds of trust between the public and their government. This bill signals that breaches of the public trust will not be condoned and, therefore, will help to restore the bonds of trust that have been frayed. 
   The 110th Congress has already taken steps to ensure that public officials adhere to the highest ethical standards and are more accountable for their actions. Banning meals, constricting congressional travel, and 
   tightening the lobbying rules are all important first steps that have already been taken; however, much more needs to be done. It will take a concerted effort and some time to overcome the spate of negative examples of public officials abusing the trust conferred upon them. 
   For government to function effectively, the public must be able to trust the people making decisions in this institution. My bill will help restore that bond of trust between public officials and the people they represent. By holding ourselves to the highest ethical standards, we are making clear that we have heard the message of the people who are demanding honesty and accountability of their leaders. 
   I urge my colleagues to support me in this effort and to become cosponsors of my bill. A number of Members have already signed on, and I hope the rest of my colleagues will join them. Let's pass this bill and restore the faith that our constituents have in their public institutions. 
   As we're talking about accountability, you've raised the Blue Dog Coalition debt poster that we have in front of our offices. I'm disturbed, as we always are, that every single day that poster goes up. We've done a lot of work as Blue Dogs to restore accountability in the fiscal side. We have put into the House rules PAYGO rules that say you have to pay as you go. We need to work on statutory PAYGO yet some more. There's some more things that we need to do. We're not finished with this, but clearly we have been heard in this House, and we are changing the culture. 
   This bill that I've brought forward today during our Blue Dog hour will also change the culture. It will send an important message that don't commit the crime if you can't do the time. We say that to common burglars and drug offenders all throughout our society. We also should say it to those same common criminals that perpetrate their crimes in the halls of Congress. 
   So, today, I stand with my Blue Dog colleagues, as we always do during this Blue Dog hour, to ask for accountability in this Congress, accountability in our country, accountability with our finances. I'm just so proud to be a member of this organization. 
   Thank you for yielding to me, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to get this bill inserted into the ethics bill that's going through the House this week or as a stand-alone measure later in the Congress.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARDOZA. (NATIONAL FOSTER PARENTS DAY -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 179, a resolution declaring the sense of the House that a National Foster Parents Day should be established. 
   I have a very personal interest in this issue. Seven years ago, I adopted two foster children. Since then, I have advocated on behalf of adoption and foster children in the California Assembly and in Congress. 
   Our Nation's foster care system was created as a temporary safe haven for abused and neglected children. Sadly, it has become a way of life for too many of our youth. On average, foster children spend nearly 3 years in the system, and move as many times from one placement to another and from school to school. Far too many spend much longer in the system, with as many as 24,000 young adults expected to ``age out'' of the system this year, cut loose with no family and little support. Several studies released in 2005 documented the special challenges facing these youths, especially in the areas of mental health, education and employment. They are especially poorly prepared to be self-sufficient.  
   Despite the sometimes valiant efforts and good intentions of social workers, judges, foster parents and others, day-to-day life for children in foster care is often filled with emotional hardship. Each year, thousands of children entering foster care will be separated from their brothers and sisters, some losing touch with each other for years to come. The trauma of foster care takes its toll on young children. Over one-third will neither earn a high school diploma nor a GED. One in four children in foster care will be incarcerated within the first 2 years after leaving the system, and over 20 percent will become homeless at some time after they turn 18. 
   These children are waiting. Speaking from personal experience, there is no greater joy in life than helping a child. 
   Every child, no matter what station they may be born to, deserves a chance to be raised in a stable and loving home. Innocent children should not be forced to bear the mistakes of others. 
   This is a big problem that will require bold solutions. In order to save the next generation of children, we must re-dedicate ourselves to their welfare and pledge to do whatever necessary to nurture and protect them. 
   This resolution, by highlighting attention to the problem, is a necessary first step. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 703 provides for consideration of H.R. 3648, the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 under the traditional closed rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Ways and Means. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except for clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. Finally, the rule provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we have heard from countless media reports and I have seen in my own congressional district, the housing market is in crisis. Subprime mortgages and predatory lending practices are more prominent than ever. Home values have plunged 15 to 20 percent this year and foreclosures in the first 6 months of this year alone have surged 55 percent over the same period in 2006. 
   Sadly, Mr. Speaker, I know these situations all too well. I represent communities that have been dubbed the Foreclosure Capital of the United States of America by the national media because of foreclosure rates of about one in 27 homes. I have seen the joy in families' eyes when they have been able to purchase their first home and achieve the American Dream. I have seen the tears when they struggle to make their payments and their dream is taken away. 
   Mr. Speaker, losing your home to foreclosure is an unthinkable ordeal. The way I see it, if you are unfortunate enough to lose your home to foreclosure because you are struggling, you have suffered enough. You shouldn't be punished further by being taxed on what you no longer own. But that's exactly what's happening. Under current tax law, the IRS counts as income the amount of the mortgage debt that you have been forgiven by a lender as it is considered a ``gift'' and therefore subject to tax. This means that when many Americans lose their home to foreclosure, they are slapped with a tax bill when a lender discharges the debt on their home. Families are shocked--and frankly so am I--when they receive a tax bill for something they no longer own simply because of phantom income that is created when the so-called gift is forgiven. This double whammy, as Chairman Rangel likes to say, of someone losing their home to foreclosure, often because of circumstances beyond their control, and then facing a tax bill on top of that is neither fair nor equitable, and it has to stop. 
   The bill before us today, H.R. 3648, addresses this very issue. The bill is quite simple. First, it exempts forgiven mortgage debt from being counted as income for tax purposes. This will prevent countless Americans from receiving a tax bill after they have lost their home to foreclosure. Second, H.R. 3648 provides for a 7-year extension of the tax deduction for private mortgage insurance, which is scheduled to end at the end of 2007. The deduction for PMI, as it is most commonly known, is critical to many low- and moderate-income families and first-time homebuyers who lack the traditional down payment. The PMI deduction allows them to purchase a home at lower cost while avoiding risky subprime or predatory second loans that would need to be made for them to make a down payment. Third, the bill makes it easier for owners of co-op housing units to qualify as a cooperative housing institution. H.R. 3648 also addresses a tax loophole regarding capital gains treatment from the sale of certain homes. Closing this unintended loophole will prevent people from switching back and forth between a primary and secondary residence to get a double tax benefit that was never intended. 
   Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan bill before us today, H.R. 3648, was unanimously approved by the Ways and Means Committee, and it has the strong support of organizations such as the National Association of Home Builders, the Mortgage Bankers Association and the National Association of Realtors. I would like to thank Chairman Rangel and the Ways and Means Committee for their hard and thoughtful work in bringing this legislation to the floor today. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill provides more opportunities for people to buy a home, more options for families to keep their home, and eliminates an unfair tax bill should they in fact lose their home through unfortunate circumstances. I am proud to join many organizations and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in supporting this commonsense legislation today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I would just like to correct my colleague, the gentleman from Florida, my friend and great colleague on the committee, that on page 19 of the committee report issued after the bill was written, I would like to read section G, which reads: ``Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XXI of the rules of the House of Representatives, the Ways and Means Committee has determined that the bill as reported contains no congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits within the meaning of that rule.'' 
   Further, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman has mentioned that Mr. McCrery had offered a substitute and that the majority had denied the minority the ability to bring that substitute up. That's correct, for good cause. The substitute was not paid for under the House PAYGO rules, and in fact violated the House PAYGO rules, and so was not deemed appropriate to be brought to the floor. 
   Finally, that same substitute only made these very important tax loophole corrections and changes enabled for 3 years. We believe that this particular provision needs to be permanent in Federal law and that homeowners need to be protected if they lose their homes permanently. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, we did not make Mr. McCrery's substitute in order. And, in fact, it has been the tradition that tax bills come to the floor under closed rules, even when Mr. Dreier and the Republicans were in charge, because of the complexity of tax law. If you amend that bill on the floor, we don't know how it will affect other clauses within that bill. So it has been the tradition, because of tax law complexity, that bills coming to the floor that deal with the Federal Tax Code do, in fact, come under closed rules.     
   Mr. Speaker, declining property values and rapid increases in the number of foreclosures are causing a national housing and mortgage crisis. This is a commonsense bill. It is a bill that takes key steps in stabilizing the housing market. H.R. 3648 eliminates the double whammy of someone losing their home to foreclosure and then facing an additional tax bill right when they are down on their knees anyway. It reduces mortgage costs, making it easier for families to purchase a home while avoiding high-risk loans. Most importantly, it will help countless families avoid foreclosure and to stay in their homes.  
   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today, H.R. 3648, the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007, is a necessary bill. Once again, it shows that the Democratic Congress is committed to addressing the mortgage crisis sweeping across our Nation. I want to thank Mr. Rangel and his committee for bringing this bill to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and on the previous question.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARDOZA. (FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Chairman, shortly into my tenure as a Member of Congress in 2003 the General Services Administration, the GSA, notified me that my office space at the Bell Station in Merced, California, which I shared with the post office and the IRS would no longer be available for lease. 
   My office was in an historic building, and, most importantly, I was conveniently located downtown for my constituents. Despite my vigorous protests, I was literally kicked out of the Federal building. 
   If that wasn't enough of a slap in the face to my constituents and myself, 2 years later the GSA declared the Bell Station post office to be surplus property. The GSA closed the post office with no rhyme or reason and started to dispose of it, with no community input and no plan to replace our post office. 
   The GSA's handling of this situation was deplorable. The GSA turned a deaf ear to my constituents and ignored the needs of a local community. 
   In my 4 1/2 years in Congress, nothing has elicited as many phone calls and letters and editorials to my local paper than the GSA's handling of post office closure in my hometown. 
   The GSA's blatant disregard for a community's needs hasn't only occurred in my district. This has been repeated with reckless abandon in districts across the country. 
   Make no mistake about it. This can happen to any Member of this Congress, and every community across America is at risk. 
   Three local entities in my home county attempted to obtain a historic building from GSA for public benefit use. 
   However, in the blink of an eye, and without advance notice to the applicants, the GSA reversed course. The GSA indicated it would put the building out for public auction and sell it to the highest bidder. 
   I have confirmed with the GSA experts that the GSA's activities are not only inconsistent with its mission, but are also well outside proper protocol. 
   I have made countless efforts to work with the GSA to rectify this situation in my district so that local communities can obtain the building. My repeated requests have been ignored. The GSA even refused to respond to a simple letter I wrote until I submitted amendments to this bill that would cut the GSA budget by 10 percent. 
   After panic set in at GSA, GSA sent a useless response that doesn't address a single one of my concerns, and leaves just enough wiggle room to back out of any promise of working with the original applicants. The GSA then delivered to a letter to other Capitol Hill offices, not to my own. When I was told that GSA representatives were in the Cannon Building today, they didn't even have the common courtesy to speak to me or my staff. 
   Mr. Chairman, this reeks of mismanagement. It shows a lack of oversight and accountability at GSA. 
   My amendment is very simple. It provides an additional $6 million to GSA's Office of the Inspector General. It is paid for by cutting the GSA's policy and operations account, including the Office of the Administrator and the Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs.     
   The Inspector General will ensure that the agency is operating in the best interest of taxpayers and is not beholden to the political process or to special interests. 
   It is absolutely critical that the Inspector General's office has the tools and resources it needs to hold the agency accountable for its actions. And it is critical that we, as Members of Congress, ensure that government is meeting the needs of our communities. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This point of order is about whether or not to consider the rule and ultimately the underlying conference report. In my opinion, it is simply an effort to try to kill this bill without any debate, without an up-or-down vote on the conference report itself. It is nothing more than procedural roadblocks, something the other side has been using a fair amount recently. I don't believe it will work. 
   The gentleman has talked about the fact that he is not able to speak in opposition. The gentleman had an hour's worth of debate the other day on a motion to recommit. It is also my understanding that the chairman is working with the opposition to allow them time to discuss the bill within the rules that were set up. 
   This conference report is far too important, Mr. Speaker, to be blocked by a parliamentary tactic. We have worked on this bill for nearly 2 years and have accomplished what many of us thought was an impossible feat by bringing it to the floor. 
   Make no mistake about it. The Republican obstruction will ensure that a farm bill will not pass during this Congress. So despite whatever roadblocks the other side tries to use to stop this bill, we will stand up for America's hardworking farmers, for the hungry and for the millions of other Americans who will benefit from this farm bill. 
   We must consider this rule, and we must pass this important conference report without further delay. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding I have the right to close. But in the end, I will urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' to consider this rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to respond to my friend from Arizona with regard to the PAYGO issue, even though that is going to be addressed in the rule and not in this motion that he has brought forward now. 
   I didn't raise a point of order in your motion so you can have plenty of time to speak. 
   Let me tell you also that the chairman and the ranking member have, in my understanding, provided 10 minutes to both the Republic and Democratic opposition to this bill out of their time today. So we will be complying with the rules of the House. It is my understanding there will be 20 minutes in opposition. 
   With regard to PAYGO, the Senate and the House have adopted different rules. In the 1990s when the House and Senate had statutory PAYGO, both Chambers had the same rules with regard to PAYGO. The House rules talk about one issue with PAYGO. The Senate rules with another. 
   In this rule, we have tried to reconcile, we started this bill and actually passed it in a conference report, or we passed it out in chief from the Agriculture Committee to this floor and to a conference committee in 2007. That work was not completed in 2007, and thus we have this bill on the floor today. 
   There are many reasons why this bill didn't get finished in 2007. But because we have different rules in the House and Senate, we have decided that in order to make this bill work and achieve a conference report that we can bring to this floor that we will be discussing this further as we discussed the rule. But we have dealt with that in the rule. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I would like to say that we will deal in the debate on the bill chiefly with regard to what the level of reforms is. 
   I would just like to tell my colleagues and my friends from both Arizona and Wisconsin that there are, in fact, significant reforms. In fact, if you take the ratio when this bill was first brought up in 2002, you have a situation where the nutrition part of this bill, versus commodities, was by a ratio of 2-1, $2 for nutrition for every dollar of commodity payments. 
   In this particular act that we are going to be bringing to the floor later today, it is my understanding, and my work with regard to the reforms, that there have been so many reforms put into this bill that the nutrition title versus the commodity payments is actually a 5-1 ratio at this point. I would say that indicates, as just one of many indicators, that you will see as we conduct this debate the significant reform that has happened in this bill. 
   I believe this is good work. I am very proud to be a part of bringing this bill to the floor. I believe it complies with the House Rules, and, I, again, want to urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this motion to consider, so that we can pass this important piece of legislation today.

This point of order today is just another effort, in my opinion, by the other side of the aisle to block this critical legislation that we have worked on for nearly 2 years. 
   They don't want to debate, and they don't want to vote on this conference report. They simply want to obstruct through a parliamentary tactic. 
   I want to make it very clear that the farm bill fully complies with the earmark disclosure rules contained in clause 9 of rule XXI. I would suggest to those raising the point of order that they look in the statement of managers, and they will see a list of the earmarks. If they can't find that list, we will be happy to provide it for them.

   I would just remind the gentleman that in the time he has taken on these  two points of order, he will probably have discussed this bill more than any other Member on the floor, even after we agreed to give him 20 minutes of debate on this topic.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1189 provides for consideration of H.R. 2419, the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, the continuation of the Farm, Nutrition and Bioenergy Act of 2007 which we passed off this floor in September of 2007. 
   Mr. Speaker, the conference report rule waives all points of order against the conference report and against its consideration and provides that the conference report shall be considered as read. 
   The rule provides for 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Agriculture, and it also provides one motion to recommit. 
   It should also be noted that despite the blanket waiver, the conference report does not violate clause 9 of rule XXI. 
   Furthermore, I want to point out that the conference report uses the CBO 2007 baseline, the year in which the bill passed both the House and the Senate, and under that baseline, CBO has determined that this conference report will not increase the deficit in either of the years 2008 through 2012 or in the years 2008 through 2017 scoring window. 
   Therefore, while there is a technical violation of clause 10 of rule XXI, this  conference report complies with the rule by remaining budget neutral with no net increase in direct spending. In other words, Mr. Speaker, this bill does not increase the deficit and it is PAYGO compliant. 
   Mr. Speaker, as chairman of a subcommittee on the House Agriculture Committee, and as a member of the Rules Committee, I'm pleased to offer the Farm, Conservation, and Energy Act conference report for consideration today. This bipartisan conference report represents the blood, sweat and tears of many Members of the House and Senate Agriculture Committees, including myself. I would be remiss if I did not single out a few individuals at this time. 
   First, I must recognize Chairman COLLIN PETERSON, without whom this farm bill would have never been completed. His unwavering dedication to seeing this bill through to completion should be an example to us all, and I am indeed grateful for his commitment, especially in the face of tremendous adversity. 
   I also want to thank Ranking Member Goodlatte, Leader Hoyer, and certainly, not least, our Speaker of the House, Ms. Pelosi, for their steadfast commitment to creating a farm bill that we can all be proud of and to stand behind, and because of her leadership, there is, in fact, significant reform in this bill. 
   It is hard to believe, but we actually started this process nearly 2 years ago, starting with traveling to nearly every corner of this country to hear directly from farmers and ranchers from all walks of life about what they needed in a modern farm bill. We took these wide-ranging comments to heart and crafted a fiscally responsible, equitable and unparalleled farm bill. 
   I wish I could say that it was all a walk in the park. The House and the Senate passed their respective bills in 2007, and since January of this year, Members of the House and the Senate have been hammering out a compromise. There have been many battles, but in the end, this conference report is something I believe this House should be very proud of. 
   While people didn't get everything they wanted, the country got what it needed. That speaks volumes about the quality of this bill and tells me we ended up in exactly the right place. 
   The Farm, Conservation, and Energy Act builds upon the past successes of Federal farm policy by maintaining the farm bill's safety net, while at the same time providing for substantial increases in conservation, nutrition and energy. 
   However, I'm most proud of the $2.3 billion in new Federal investments for specialty crops, an industry that has been uniformly neglected in previous farm bills despite comprising nearly 50 percent of total farm gate value. 
   Furthermore, this farm bill contains unprecedented reforms to commodity programs by revising program eligibility and strengthening payment limitations. 
   Through major changes to the crop insurance program, we have also increased government efficiency and reduced the waste, fraud and abuse identified in the current farm programs. 
   More importantly, this bill is completely paid for. Through PAYGO, Democrats are fulfilling our promise to live within our means like every household in America is forced to do, and I believe the PAYGO rules, Mr. Speaker, made this a leaner, meaner and better bill, despite the complexities that the new rules presented at times. 
   We pledged to stop writing blank checks with reckless abandon and shouldering our country's needs on the backs of our children and grandchildren. Make no mistake about it, Mr. Speaker, this legislation adheres to the spirit of PAYGO, proving that it can be done. 
   Mr. Speaker, our farmers have the capacity for immeasurable innovation and success, and they deserve the Federal Government's commitment that's included in this bill by supporting this farm bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to telling my constituents of the 18th District of California that the United States Congress has accomplished what many thought was an impossible feat in coming to an agreement on a farm bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly and wholeheartedly urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Unfortunately, recent scandals have somewhat tarnished the reputation of Congress and stretched the bonds of trust between the public and their government. My amendment is quite simple and will help to restore that bond between public officials and the people that we represent. 
   My amendment gives Federal judges discretion to increase criminal sentences in cases where public confidence in government has been violated. If a public official has been convicted of bribery, fraud, extortion, or theft of public funds greater than $10,000, a sentencing judge has within his discretion to double the length of the sentence up to 2 years for those public officials convicted of ethics violations.     
   The 110th Congress has already taken steps to ensure that public officials adhere to the highest ethical standards and are more accountable for their actions. Banning meals, restricting congressional travel, and tightening the lobbying rules are all important first steps that we have already taken. However, more needs to be done. 
   With public faith in government officials weakened by scandals, we need to ensure that those who break these laws are punished appropriately. Beyond breaking the law, the perpetrators of these crimes violate the public trust by defying their fiduciary responsibility to our Constitution. For government to function effectively, the public must be able to trust the people making the decisions, and as public officials, we must hold ourselves to a higher standard. 
   This amendment signals that breaches of the public trust will not be condoned. I hope my colleagues will support this amendment and join me in providing a deterrent to illegal behavior in the future and helping rebuild public trust in government officials. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CARDOZA. I want to start off by thanking Chairman McDermott for doing a fabulous job on this bill on behalf of foster kids generally. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6307, the Fostering Connections to Success Act. Many of my colleagues already know that I care deeply about foster care, in part because 8 years ago, my wife and I adopted two of our children from foster care. 
   We didn't know much about foster care back then, but we certainly are intimately familiar with it at this point, and familiar with the plight of foster kids in America. These children who come into foster care through no fault of their own face a number of inequalities compared to children who have not endured the type of abuse that typically places a foster child in care. 
   While foster parents receive Federal assistance to care for kids in their home, family members, many of whom would willingly care for their nieces and nephews, only if they had a little help to do so, are denied foster care payments. This legislation will end that misguided policy and provide that assistance to family members. 
   While biological children count on health insurance policies of their parents until the age of 25, foster children's health care coverage is often terminated on the night of their 18th birthday. Mr. Speaker, I want to believe that all children are self-sufficient on the day they turn 18, but as a father, both of us know better than that. 
   Earlier this year, I introduced legislation that would require health care coverage for children in foster care until the age of 21. Chairman McDermott lent his support to my bill, and I understand there is a similar provision in his bill to provide States with the option of extending health care coverage. 
   I hope that all States will exercise this option because parents don't walk out on their kids at 18, and neither should we.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Thank you, Mr. McDermott. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, this bill will improve the oversight of health care needs for our children in foster care. My wife is a family doctor, and she has been taken aback by the lack of oversight in the medical treatment of foster kids. The committee heard testimony from foster children who have been over-prescribed or mis-prescribed numerous medications. I know personally that my children received several rounds of immunizations, when they only needed one set. 
   It's about time we raise the standards for continuity of health care, medical records, and prescription drugs, and this legislation will in fact accomplish that. I will continue to work with my colleagues and fight on the behalf of abused and neglected children in America. I thank the gentleman who has authored this bill for doing the same, and I thank him for bringing this legislation to the floor.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of the bill.  
   Mr. Chairman, I'm proud to stand with you, on the House floor, at this historic moment in the development of U.S. farm and food policy. 
   For the first time in the history of the farm bill, this year our farm policies will put fruit and vegetable growers on an equal playing field with commodity farmers. Fruits and vegetables are a growing and important component of American agricultural output. 
   In 2006, U.S. production of specialty crops--fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits and nursery crops--accounted for $53 billion, or 44 percent of total U.S. crop receipts. 
   The fruit and vegetable industry benefits from marketing, research, and educational programs, rather than traditional crop subsidies, to manage the challenges of increased global trade and foreign competition. These challenges include increasing domestic consumption, reviving export growth, aggressively managing food safety, and mitigating pest and disease problems. 
   The 2007 Farm Bill addresses these challenges by providing $365 million in new mandatory funding for the specialty crop block grant program. Block grants are vital for ensuring that solutions to these myriad challenges are flexible and locally driven. 
   This bill also responds to the pest and disease management needs of the specialty crop industry by establishing a comprehensive early pest detection and surveillance program. The bill provides $200 million in mandatory funding for this new program to work in cooperation with State departments of Agriculture. 
   The needs of America's nurseries are addressed by directing USDA to collaborate with nursery industry organizations as it develops, tests, and disseminates new systems of nursery pest and disease management. 
   It also establishes within USDA a program for a National clean plant network. This network will provide a sustainable source of pest and disease free horticulture stocks.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I have stood here for the better part of an hour as we debated this rule, and I frankly cannot believe what I am hearing. 
   It sounds to me like the Republican caucus of this body is actually considering voting against the thousands of farmers, their families, and the millions of people throughout this country that rely on farming for their livelihood in favor of a few wealthy international companies who are deliberately evading U.S. tax law and big oil companies that have been gouging Americans at the pump. 
   The truth is that the Ways and Means Committee has taken the advice of the Bush administration and closed a loophole for tax cheats in order to pay for lifesaving nutrition programs for millions of Americans. This energy offset comes from reducing taxpayer subsidies for multinational oil and gas companies that have enjoyed a free ride from this Congress for far too long. 
   The price of oil today in New York was $75 a barrel. Is that not enough for Americans to pay? So enough with this song and dance. This is about closing loopholes for tax cheats, a loophole that your Republican administration has been advocating. This is closing a loophole for tax cheats, a loophole that this administration has been advocating being closed for years, as it is reducing windfall profits for Big Oil. 
   I urge my colleagues to make the right choice here and stop playing politics with the American public. 
   We used to have a $30 billion trade surplus in agriculture. Like everything else, we are trading that away. If we aren't careful, we are going to become an importer of agricultural goods for the first time in the history of the United States. That won't happen on our watch. 
   It's bad enough that countries like China, Japan, and Saudi Arabia are our bankers. Let us not make them our farmers, too. That is not the way this country was built, and I assure you this new Democratic Congress will not abandon our farm community. 
   This is a once-in-a-lifetime bill that will meet our country's needs. Every major group, the commodities, the specialty crops, the nutrition groups, the conservationists and others support this bill. 
   A ``yes'' vote on this rule and the underlying bill is a vote for the hungry, a vote for the environment, a vote for energy independence, but, most importantly, a vote to deliver on our long-standing commitment to rural America. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and on the previous question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 574 provides for consideration of H.R. 2419, the Farm, Nutrition, and Bioenergy Act of 2007 under a structured rule. 
   The rule provides for 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Agriculture. 
   The rule waives all points of order against the bill and its consideration except for those arising under clause 9 or clause 10 of rule XXI. 
   The rule makes in order 31 amendments. 
   Finally, the rule provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, as the subcommittee chairman on the House Agriculture Committee, and as a member of the Rules Committee, I am pleased to offer this progressive Federal farm policy act for consideration today. 
   Over the past year, the Agriculture Committee members have traveled across this country, from north to south, from east to west, hearing directly from farmers and ranchers about the state of agriculture in our country. Across rural America we have heard from farmers and ranchers from all walks of life talking about the promise of American agriculture, the immeasurable innovation and success and commitment to sustainable farming. 
   The 2007 farm bill builds on past successes of Federal farm policy by providing a reliable safety net for commodity crops, expanding access to conservation programs, increasing participation in domestic nutrition programs, and, perhaps most of all, most near to my heart, this bill dwarfs any previous Federal investment in specialty crops, which account for nearly 50 percent of American agricultural production. 
   Chairman Peterson, Ranking Member Goodlatte, and the entire Agriculture Committee were able to craft an equitable, fiscally sound farm bill that preserved the farm safety net while including critical funding for important new programs. 
   Furthermore, the 2007 farm bill contains unprecedented reforms to payment limitations and crop insurance programs that will reduce waste, fraud, and abuse so often identified with the farm program. 
   More importantly, this bill is completely paid for. During the past election, Democrats promised to live within our means like every household in America is forced to do and stop writing blank checks with reckless abandon. We pledged to exercise spending restraint to stop shouldering our Nation's needs on the backs of our children and grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say that we were able to do exactly that. 
   You will hear a lot of talk from the other side of the aisle about this bill raising taxes, but this is simply a scare tactic in an attempt to score political points. This is completely untrue. 
   Let me set the record straight before we even begin. This bill does not raise taxes. The 2007 farm bill closes tax loopholes that just 5 years ago the Bush administration and its own Treasury Department identified as tax abuse. In a policy paper issued by the Office of Tax Policy in May of 2002, the Bush administration identified how corporations headquartered in tax havens use this loophole, and a June 18, 2002, New York Times article stated that Republicans in Congress also thought that this tax loophole needed to be fixed. These are the facts. 
   Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I must take a moment to thank Chairman Peterson, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Hoyer, and the entire leadership team for their tenacity and sincerity in creating a farm bill that we can all be proud of and stand behind. 
   Not everyone got everything they wanted, and, frankly, they shouldn't. The farm bill should never be a place to line up at the trough and recklessly suck up needed resources. In the end, while people didn't get everything they wanted, everyone got what they needed. That speaks volumes about the quality of this bill and tells me we ended up in exactly the right place. 
   I have never been more proud of a piece of legislation, Mr. Speaker, and I look forward to telling my constituents in the 18th District of California that the United States Congress has  accomplished what was thought to be an impossible feat. I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I would like to set the record straight. The gentleman would like to say that this is the first time we have had a structured rule. That is absolutely not the case. 
   In 1996, the farm bill that year, when the Republicans were in charge, allowed 16 amendments. It was a structured rule. This rule allows 31 amendments. 
   Further, Mr. Ryan accused us of busting the budget because of timing shifts. Let me just point out that the 2002 farm bill had $2.6 billion in timing shifts, and the 2006 budget resolution had $1.5 billion in shifts, with a total of $4.1 billion in timing shifts on their watch. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to yield 2 1/2 minutes to the chairwoman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies, the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).

<DOCNO>Mr. CARDOZA. (RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF CONNECTING FOSTER YOUTH TO THE WORKFORCE THROUGH INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Illinois for his gracious management of this issue, and also my colleague from Minnesota, who spoke so graciously in support of it. 
   I rise today in support of House Resolution 1332, the Fostering Employment Opportunities Act. 
   I also want to thank Chairman McDermott who is in the House Chamber at this time, and Congressman Fattah, both of whom join me as co-authors of this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, there are over a half a million children who have been abused or abandoned, through no fault of their own, who end up in the United States foster care system. While in foster care, many of them experience multiple placements and find it difficult to establish a community. 
   Madam Speaker, every year, 26,000 young people are discharged from foster care on the midnight of their 18th birthday with few resources to start their own lives. Their health care coverage is terminated in a vast number of States, and with little or no family support, many of them end up homeless or unemployed or in jail. 
   I have met a number of these youth, and they are remarkable survivors. They have the same hopes and dreams as all other children in America. They want to be mechanics and doctors. They want to serve our country as soldiers and policemen. But they have a harder path to realizing their dream. 
   Despite their resilience and their other unique qualities that make these youth ideal candidates for employment, statistically, foster youth are the most likely to be unemployed, and comprise 27 percent of the Nation's homeless population. Part of it has to do with the impact of the instability of their younger years. And part is the result of the negative and unjustified stereotypes placed on this population that may cause employers to look past this pool of qualified candidates. 
   Another part is that many young people today are connected to the workforce through internships, often arranged by their parents, with business or social associates and connections. However, foster youth tend to lack a stable environment due to the number of foster home placements that they have over the course of their lives, and have limited family or community connections. As such, foster youth are not afforded the same opportunities and are often left behind. 
   This resolution is simple. It encourages employers to look twice at these remarkable young people who are highly qualified, in many cases, and equally deserving. 
   Madam Speaker, I speak to you today as a father as well as an author of this resolution. A father of two foster children who I am so lucky, my wife and I are so lucky to have adopted, one of whom is with me today, my daughter, Elaina. She, luckily has a home now. It is a permanent home. That wasn't always the case for her. We are just looking to offer the same kinds of opportunities that this country will offer Elaina now, to every foster youth in the country. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Vermont for yielding me the time and for his able leadership on this rule.     
   I rise in full support of the rule on H.R. 547. 
   As a new Member of the House Rules Committee, I am very pleased that we were able to have an open rule so quickly in the 110th Congress. This rule will allow an open and honest debate on one of the most important issues facing our country: energy independence. 
   H.R. 547, the Advanced Fuels Infrastructure Research and Development Act, addresses an extremely important, however often overlooked, component to our emerging domestic biofuels industry: pipeline and storage infrastructure. 
   When ethanol and other biofuel additives are mixed with traditional fuels, it can cause disruptions to the pipeline infrastructure through corrosion and contamination, even clogging. These small obstacles should not be impediments to the full development of the biofuels industry, but they are still issues that must be addressed in order to move forward. 
   This important legislation we are considering today would authorize funds to EPA and the Department of Energy to develop a program for alternative bio-based fuels and low-sulfur diesel fuels to be more compatible with existing infrastructure used to store and deliver petroleum-based fuels to the point of final sale. 
   In California's San Joaquin Valley, we are watching the development and progression of our domestic biofuel industry with a particularly close eye. We have some of the most fertile agricultural land in the country. My district alone grows over 200 different kinds of crops, contributing over $5 billion of the $30 billion agriculture industry of our State. 
   But as we are blessed with our soil, we are similarly blessed and cursed by our geography. The steep mountains on both sides of the valley create a trap for air which in turn creates some of the worst air quality problems in the entire Nation. We are currently in a severe ozone non-attainment area and quickly moving towards an extreme level for both ozone and particulate matter. Limited emissions from ethanol blends and other biofuels have the potential to contribute to our increasingly dangerous air quality levels. 
   My colleague Ms. ANNA ESHOO and I will be offering an amendment during general debate on H.R. 547 to expand the current areas of research covered under this legislation to include strategies to minimize potential impacts of volatile emissions from biofuels. Our amendment exemplifies the importance of this open rule. Neither Ms. Eshoo nor I sit on the Science Committee; however, through this open rule, we are able to weigh in on important legislation on behalf of our constituents. 
   While I realize that the bill may have passed by unanimous consent last year, clearly numerous Members are interested in offering amendments, and I am pleased that our leadership has provided this opportunity to Members on both sides of the aisle. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this open rule.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from California, and while I support my colleague from Texas' effort to address emissions concerns, I cannot support his amendment. 
   Mr. Burgess' amendment simply directs the EPA and the Department of Energy to study the effect of increased emissions from biofuels. We need to do more than study this problem; and, in fact, both the California Air Resources Board and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources have studies which show increased rates of VOC emissions from ethanol-blended fuels and fuel tanks and pipelines. 
   We must develop strategies to minimize these emissions from biofuels now so that we can accelerate the use of biofuels nationwide in the future. 
   The Eshoo-Cardoza amendment does exactly what needs to be done in law to make that possible.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker and Mr. Ross, tomorrow night, when the President of the United States delivers his State of the Union Address, the Nation will listen carefully as he lays out his agenda for the final 2 years of office. And there is no question our Nation faces many great challenges. The one issue, however, that weighs most heavily on the minds of the American people is, of course, the war in Iraq. The  President is now moving forward with a plan to escalate the war, despite bipartisan opposition. I have grave doubts about the wisdom of this action, as do most of my colleagues. 
   Regardless of one's views on the right way to move forward in Iraq, we should be able to agree on one thing: Fraud and abuse and flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars that we have seen throughout this war have got to stop. It is bleeding our Treasury dry, and it is further undermining our security in Iraq. 
   Some estimates suggest the war in Iraq will cost the American people $2 trillion when all is said and done, and that is truly a staggering figure. That is why the Blue Dogs are putting forward this resolution asking for accountability. We can't afford another $2 trillion in debt piled on to what Mr. Ross has already said, $8.710 and change trillion. 
   So Mr. Speaker, I am not going to take up a lot of time. We have two distinguished colleagues that have waited here to speak to you tonight. But I will say that I applaud the Blue Dogs, and I am proud of being a member of the Blue Dogs. I am proud to be here with you again, Mr. Ross, and I just believe it is high time that the American people have a full accounting of what this war is costing, and how the contractors have misspent American Treasury in the process.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, it is with great sadness that I rise today to speak on the passing of an esteemed colleague and a true friend, former Congressman Tom Lantos. 
   Tom's dedication, passion, and fervent commitment to human rights will be deeply missed by our Nation and, indeed, around the world. As the only Holocaust survivor ever elected to Congress, Tom fought every day to give voice to the voiceless and make true our commitment to the words ``never again.'' Only 16 when he was rounded up in his native Hungary by the Nazis where he saw most of his family perish, Tom was a living embodiment to the ideals of courage and human rights. 
   First elected to Congress in 1980 after a distinguished career in academia, Tom was a tireless advocate on behalf of his constituents and a fine public servant. Representing parts of San Francisco as well as his hometown, San Mateo, Tom zealously represented the interests of his District and, speaking as a Member of the California delegation, I was proud to serve with him and call him friend. 
   While Tom had a remarkable career of over a quarter of a century in Congress, it was his last year as chairman of his beloved House Foreign Affairs Committee that he seemed to relish the most. From that perch, he was able to advance the cause of human rights and to shine a light on long ignored parts of the globe. 
   Tom is survived by his loving wife Annette, by his two daughters, Annette and Katrina; by 17 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   House Resolution 1276 provides for consideration of H.R. 5876, the Stop Child Abuse in Residential Programs for Teens Act of 2008, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and Labor. 
   The rule makes in order two amendments that were submitted for consideration and are printed in the Rules Committee report, including a bipartisan manager's amendment. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill, except for clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. Finally, the rule provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
   The bill before us today, the Stop Child Abuse in Residential Programs for Teens Act, responds to an urgent need to protect our Nation's vulnerable children. An estimated 20 to 30,000 U.S. teenagers attend private residential programs, including therapeutic boarding schools, wilderness camps, boot camps, and behavioral modification facilities. These residential facilities are intended to help treat children with behavioral, emotional or mental health problems. 
   However, many of these facilities are loosely regulated, if they are even regulated at all. As a result, some of the very facilities that are supposed to be providing a safe environment for our Nation's vulnerable children have, instead, provided us with some of the most shocking accounts of child abuse and neglect we have ever been witness to. 
   A comprehensive report by the Government Accountability Office recently uncovered thousands of allegations of child abuse and neglect at private residential programs for teens. Tragically, in a number of these cases, this abuse and neglect led to the child's death. 
   I won't describe the horrifying stories, but I will say that they go far beyond simple maltreatment. The stories are deplorable. They are inexcusable, and they are inhumane. 
   This bill, H.R. 5876, will keep children safe by imposing new national standards for residential treatment programs. These standards include prohibitions on denying children food, water, clothing, shelter or medical care for any reason, including as a form of punishment. 
   The bill upholds core moral values by specifically prohibiting programs from engaging in practices that physically, sexually or mentally abuse or torment children in their care. 
   It requires programs to train staff in understanding what constitutes child abuse and neglect and how to report it, and it requires programs to have emergency medical care plans in place. 
   The bill also includes several other provisions, such as requiring programs to disclose to parents the qualifications of staff, notifying parents of substantiated reports of abuse, and providing grant money to States if they develop their own standards that are at least as strong as the national ones. 
   On a personal note, I would like to say that my wife, Kathie, and I are proud parents of three children, two of which we adopted from foster care. I can tell you from my own personal experience that nothing is more important to a child's life than having a secure home. 
   No child should ever be subject to abuse or neglect, especially when in the care of those who are supposed to be providing treatment. 
   I commend Chairman Miller for his tireless efforts on behalf of our Nation's children. I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this commonsense legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Thank you, Mr. Diaz-Balart. 
   But I will tell you, however much I praise his efforts there, with regard to the seven amendments that he talked about, the seven Republican amendments submitted in the Rules Committee, they were disposed of in I believe a very fair and equitable manner. 
   Two were withdrawn by the authors. One was addressed in the manager's amendment. The amendment of the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop) was addressed in the manager's amendment. Two amendments amended portions of the bill that were deleted by the manager's amendment and thus are moot; and two dealt with earmarks that are not in the bill. So frankly, all of the amendments were dealt with in a fair and evenhanded manner. I believe this truly is a bipartisan bill. 
   It is with that spirit, Madam Speaker, that I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. McCarthy), the chairman of the Healthy Families Subcommittee and a champion for children.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, in closing, I'd like to remind my friend and colleague from Florida that it has been the other body, the Republicans in the other body and the White House who have stymied the Democratic efforts to actually reduce gas prices and provide alternative energy for this country. Certainly, it is a problem, and certainly, the American people are very frustrated at paying $4 or more, in my State it's much more for a gallon of gas. But had we at least moved in a new direction, we could be heading in that direction. But we have been totally stymied by the White House and the Senate on these questions. 
   Madam Speaker, today's bill deals with children, and there is an urgent problem in many residential treatment facilities that have gone unchecked for far too long and must be addressed. H.R. 5876 will go a long way towards ensuring the safety of our Nation's children who depend on these treatment facilities. 
   Again, I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this commonsense legislation to protect our kids in these treatment facilities. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and on the previous question.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARDOZA. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1873, SMALL BUSINESS FAIRNESS IN CONTRACTING ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such times as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 383 provides for consideration of H.R. 1873, the Small Business Fairness in Contracting Act, under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Small Business. The rule makes in order the substitute reported by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform as original text for the purpose of amendment. The substitute shall be considered as read. 
   The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except for clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. The rule makes in order eight amendments that were submitted for consideration that are printed in the Rules Committee report on this accompanying resolution. 
   Finally, the rule provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Small Business Fairness in Contracting Act, H.R. 1873, amends key sections of the Small Business Act to assist small businesses in participation in Federal procurement. 
   The predecessors to the Small Business Administration can be traced back to World War II and efforts by President Roosevelt and President Truman. In fact, during World War II, it was found to be in our national interest to ensure a strong and diverse industrial base. 
   Through a series of laws and procurement requirements, Congress established a benchmark to give small business every opportunity to compete fairly for the awarding of Federal contracts. Despite this clear mandate in existence for more than 50 years, small businesses, however, have not received their fair share of Federal Government contracts. 
   For example, in 2006, the Federal Government spent over $417 billion on goods and services in 8.3 million separate contract actions. Small businesses won approximately $80 billion in contracts, approximately 21.5 percent of these contracts. This was the sixth straight year that the government has failed to meet its 23 percent small business contracting goal. This cost entrepreneurs an estimated $4.5 billion in lost contracting opportunities last year alone. 
   Small businesses suffered this massive loss, despite their importance to our national economy. Small businesses are the engine of our economy. In fact, they are responsible for creating three out of every four jobs in the United States. We cannot afford our budding entrepreneurs to be shut out of what would be an open market and be denied the opportunity to succeed. Not when their existence is so vital to our national economy. 
   We should not be shutting them out. Instead, we should be opening doors and shepherding their growth to ensure continued prosperity. 
   There are many reasons for the failure to break the stranglehold on Federal contracting process. In response, H.R. 1873 takes several necessary steps to address some key causes. H.R. 1873 seeks to break down the barriers for countless entrepreneurs and small businesses that are on the road to opportunity. 
   First, the bill bans contract bundling. Past practice has been to combine two or more smaller contracts into a single, larger package. While this bundling may be administratively convenient, it reduces competition and opportunity for small businesses. 
   Bundling squeezes small businesses out of the contract competition, benefiting larger, full-scale businesses in the process; and when there is less competition, there is also higher cost on the taxpayer. 
   To add insult to injury, Federal agencies are skewing the data with respect to small businesses. To give the impression that 23 percent of small business contracting goals are being met, agencies are using contracts awarded to larger companies and including them towards their small business contracting goals. H.R. 1873 seeks to reverse these trends and make it easier for small businesses to compete in the Federal marketplace. 
   Second, the bill makes an appeals process more accessible. Under current law, small businesses are only allowed to protest the award of a contract if they are directly harmed by it, but they are unlikely to do so given the costs involved in the process. Under the bill, small businesses and trade associations acting on their behalf that are adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by a proposed procurement can now request that the SBA appeal the procurement on their behalf. 
   H.R. 1873 increases the procurement goals for small businesses. It increases the government-wide goal for the number of contracts awarded to small businesses from 23 to 25 percent, a goal which has not been raised in over 10 years. It also increases from 5 percent to 8 percent the government-wide contracting goals for both disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses. 
   The bill raises the threshold for small business contract set-asides to the simplified acquisition threshold. It also requires that an independent audit of the Central Contracting Registry be conducted on a biannual basis to ensure that large firms are not misrepresenting themselves as small businesses.  
   Mr. Speaker, the opportunity for open competition for Federal contracts is immensely important to small businesses. This bill has strong bipartisan support. It passed the Small Business Committee by a voice vote, and it was sequentially referred to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform where it also passed by a voice vote. 
   I would like to thank both committees for their hard and thoughtful work in bringing this legislation to the floor today. In particular, I extend my thanks to Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez, the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Braley, and Chairman Waxman. 
   Mr. Speaker, we all recognize the importance of small businesses to our economy, and we must act on this bill without further delay. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would just like to respond to the gentleman and my good friend from Florida who serves with me on the Rules Committee. I would like to remind him that while it is true that no Republican amendments by themselves were in order, there certainly was made in order Ranking Member Mr. Chabot's suggested return of amendments the way it was in the Small Business Committee. He paired with Congresswoman Bean of Illinois, with Congressman Shuler of North Carolina and with Mr. Sestak of Pennsylvania in coauthoring three amendments that were, in fact, made in order. 
   So to say that no Republican suggestions were made in order was simply not totally accurate. In fact, Mr. Speaker, three Democratic amendments and four Republican amendments were not made in order, but a significant number of them are going to be considered today. 
   We believe that this is, in fact, a very good use of the time of the Members of this House. The Committee on Government Reform is the watchdog committee for this House. They had some issues that they wanted to clarify in the legislation, and I think that the Rules Committee felt that their suggestions had merit in at least two cases. 
   I also want to make the point, Mr. Speaker, that this legislation is supported by the NFIB, the National Federation of Independent Business; the Women's Chamber of Commerce; the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce; the Women Impacting Public Policy; the National Small Business Association; and the Associated General Contractors of America.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the last Congress, in both sessions, the Rules Committee reported a grand total of three open rules that were not appropriation rules. Two of them were open rules with a preprinting requirement. In this session, the new majority, we have already done seven open rules, six with preprinting requirements. And that is just in over 4 months. 
   Say what you want, we have already had a fairer and far more open process than happened in just the last 2 years of the prior majority's rule, when their party ran this place. 
   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Price from Georgia indicated that he has proposed a rule to get our fiscal house in order, an amendment that would do that. Yet, he has offered that same amendment several times in other pieces of legislation. Every time when it was allowed and came to the floor, his amendment failed. 
   Further, I would like to just mention the fact that the current majority has, in fact, instigated PAYGO rules in the House of Representatives, and so we have made that the law of the House. We, in fact, are bringing fiscal responsibility to this House on a daily basis, something that the prior party in charge was not able to do over 14 years while they were in charge. In fact, the deficit went up at an astounding rate while they were in control of this institution, and it has been the Democrats who have come back to power and are instigating PAYGO rules and fiscal responsibility in the House of Congress.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I reclaim my time. The point of my claim was the gentleman's amendment had failed because we have already instituted the PAYGO rules in our rules of the House of Representatives, and we do that on a daily basis. 
   When the gentleman's party was in power for a number of years, we saw the largest deficit increases in the history of our country, more foreign debt that they piled on to our Nation, and in fact, we are reversing the course that they set out in their prior control of Congress.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I would just like to respond to my good friend from Texas and state the committee considered his amendment, proposed amendment, and rejected it for a large reason, because we feel that it is important to make companies certify that they are, in fact, small businesses, that there have been mistakes made in the past, that companies have gotten beyond the threshold and have won contracts that they may not be authorized to do. 
   Just because the Small Business Administration periodically will go and check that, we don't believe that that is enough of a cause to require that other small businesses be shut out of the process because companies that grow beyond the requirements are allowed special treatment.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, in my close, I just want to assure the Members of Congress that we are, in fact, running the most open process in this Congress, that, in fact, we have provided seven open rules. 
   Now those rules may have a pre-printing requirement, as Mr. Diaz-Balart mentioned, the gentleman from Florida. In fact, though, requiring a pre-printing requirement allows every Member who desires to put forward an idea to come and have their ideas presented to the House. That is much more than what happened in the prior Congress, when they were in charge. We are keeping our commitment to running an open process. 
   As I mentioned, this legislation is very worthy of this rule and of passage. As I mentioned, small businesses have not received their fair share of Federal Government contracts, despite their importance to our economy. The bill before us today, H.R. 1873, addresses some of the key causes. 
   By making a few targeted reforms to the procurement process, we can help thousands of small businesses and give a much-needed jolt to our national economy. We must continue to shepherd our small businesses to give them every opportunity to succeed for today and for tomorrows yet to come. This bill will move us in that direction, and a small business will be that much closer to making their dreams of prosperity a reality. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and on the previous question 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARDOZA. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is a simple sense of Congress stressing the importance of interoperability in emergency communications. 
   We all know the importance of overcoming interoperability problems, which have been prevalent for years but only brought to light due to the 9/11 tragedy. 
   In this day and age, Mr. Chairman, it is critical that our first responders be able to communicate with each other in the field. The reality, however, is that firefighters, police and other emergency responders simply cannot communicate during times of emergency. 
   For example, police chiefs in my district have informed me that officers are forced to communicate on their cell phones literally from across the street because their radios cannot operate on the same frequency; and, recently, radio communications were ineffective and created an extremely dangerous situation in the 2006 canyon fire that devastated 34,000 acres in the western portion of Stanislaus County. 
   The need for improved emergency communications is not new. Whether we are talking about wilderness, wildfires, hurricanes or other disaster, or even day-to-day events, the same interoperability problems exist for the large communities as they do for the smallest. 
   Large cities are receiving the bulk of homeland security funding for interoperable communications. In many instances, that is rightly the case. But interoperability is a problem that permeates across the country and also affects our smaller communities. Smaller communities face the exact same problems, yet only receive a fraction of the funding and the attention that they need. As a result, smaller communities are left behind and are forced to do the best they can with what they've got. 
   In Stanislaus County, for example, the county was able to build the architecture for one channel through which all responders in the field can communicate. However, only one person can talk at a time. We can and need, Mr. Chairman, to do better. 
   The point of this amendment is simply to stress the importance of achieving local, regional and national interoperability plans and the impacts they have on the ongoing efforts in communities across the country. 
   Simply stated, localities and smaller communities matter as well, and their efforts to address interoperability should not be ignored by the Department of Homeland Security. 
   I want to make one other statement, Mr. Chairman. In the year 2000, FEMA issued a report that outlined the three greatest disaster scenarios that might befall the United States: a terror attack in New York, a hurricane that would hit New Orleans, and an earthquake on the Hayward fault in the east bay of California that would affect the California delta and flood massive lands near my area. 
   Well, the first two scenarios have, in fact, taken place, as we all know, and the third is still a very grave possibility. If, in fact, we have an earthquake on the Hayward fault in Northern California, the evacuation area would very likely be my area. Another area affected would be the San Joaquin delta in San Joaquin County. 
   All of this needs to be addressed, Mr. Chairman, and interoperability is the third awaiting disaster that could hit us anytime with an earthquake. 
   Mr. Chairman, I ask that we adopt this amendment and that Homeland Security help prepare California for the third disaster that FEMA's already noted could befall the United States at any time. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from New York and also the gentleman from Texas for their support. 
   This is an important amendment. It needs to state clearly, this bill needs to  state clearly that the Congress supports finding a resolution to interoperability conflicts that we have been besieged with. This is a very specific problem, as outlined in the FEMA report. 
   I thank Chairman Dingell and Chairman Thompson for both appearing before my constituents and hearing this problem and also agreeing to shepherd this resolution through the House. 
   I encourage adoption of my amendment.  
   Mr. DOYLE, Madam Chairman, My colleagues who were with us last year, and frankly, I'm glad we have so many new faces, but my colleagues who were with us last year will recall my commitment to protecting local telecommunications resources and making sure decisions are made where they are best made. 
   That's why I'm glad to talk about this important issue. Spectrum itself is nearly infinite. But in terms of what's usable, what's worth investing in is much more limited. 
   Which is why we must challenge everyone who uses our airwaves to do so in the most efficient way possible. And that's why efforts to make public safety's communications interoperable, redundant and more effective are so critical to our Nation's first responders, and ultimately the American public. The days when government hands money over to people who don't understand technology to make choices between inefficient and expensive dead-end radios should be long gone. 
   My time is short, but we must take the best of what we have learned from the commercial space like interoperability and cost-effective technology and merge it with the best of public safety's communications legacy such as rock-solid dependability. 
   By passing this amendment today, Congress will be saying that we support innovative, forward-looking, technologically-neutral solutions, including IP-Based solutions. 
   And I believe we are saying that the Department of Homeland Security should follow all of the recommendations that the Government Accountability Office made earlier this year, and especially the one that the administration rejected--that first responders need to have the flexibility to take advantage of technological innovations that could advance the state of interoperability. 
   We need accountability and measurable goals from any and all programs that fund interoperability so that we can ensure that the money is being spent wisely. The Department of Homeland Security has told us we need to wait 15 years to get interoperability--it's clear to me that we need to get interoperable communications by any means necessary, even if it means relying on expertise outside Homeland Security and within other agencies like the National Telecommunications and Information Administration.  
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. All time for the amendment having expired, the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Cardoza). 
   The amendment was agreed to.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Chairman, I understand that the CBO has determined that my amendment violates the PAYGO rules. As such, I would like to engage the chairman of the Agriculture Committee and the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee in a colloquy. 
   As you both well know, buried within the authorization of the Homeland Security Department was a little-known provision that mandated the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's 1,800 agricultural inspectors move from USDA to the newly created Department of Homeland Security Customs and Border Protection Division. 
   This move was made in order to consolidate custom and border enforcement into one agency, a decision I'm sure was made with all good intentions in mind. However, as the GAO has recently reported, since the transfer of these USDA employees, Customs and Border Protection has not developed sufficient performance measures to take into account the agency's expanded mission or to consider all pathways by which prohibited agricultural items or foreign pests may enter the country. 
   Mr. Chairman, this deficiency in our border security cannot and should not be tolerated. Stopping foreign pests and prohibited agricultural products from entering the United States might not be as sexy as stopping terrorists, weapons, or drugs, but it is certainly as important. 
   These are six-legged terrorists, Mr. Chairman, that can wreak havoc on our Nation's agricultural industry, costing billions of taxpayer dollars in eradication efforts and decimate our ability to access new export markets. 
   I would like your assurances that by withdrawing this amendment I have the commitment from both of you to work with me on this issue. 
   While I certainly would prefer to see these employees moved immediately back to USDA, where I believe they belong, my greater concern is that wherever they are right now, they must certainly have the tools and resources at their disposal to do their job effectively and efficiently. 
   I would like to have a hearing on the staffing, training and morale problems that persist within the agency. I also believe that we should direct USDA and the Department of Homeland Security to develop standardized, reputable  training programs that properly identify and assess the major threats posed by foreign agricultural pests and disease. 
   I believe USDA and Homeland Security should be required to fully and accurately account for all agricultural quarantine inspection fees. But perhaps most importantly, I want this issue to have the attention it deserves from both Agriculture and Homeland Security Committees. 
   Preventing pest and disease infestation is a paramount concern to all of American agriculture, but primarily to our specialty crop industry. I have vowed to fight for them on this issue and would appreciate your help in ensuring their concerns are met.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, House Resolution 1317 provides for consideration of H.R. 1286, the Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route National Historic Trail Designation Act, under a structured rule. 
   The rule provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Natural Resources. 
   The rule makes in order two germane Republican amendments that were submitted for consideration and are printed in the Rules Committee report. 
   The rule also provides for the adoption of a germane Rules Committee amendment printed in part A of the Rules Committee report to clarify that the bill does not in any way limit access for hunting, fishing, trapping, or recreational shooting along the trail. 
   The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill, except for clauses 9 and 10 of rule XXI. 
   And, finally, the rule provides for one motion to recommit, with or without instructions. 
   Madam Speaker, the bill before us today, H.R. 1286, amends the National Trails System Act to designate the Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route National Historic Trail. 
   The trail extends approximately 600 miles, spanning nine States and the District of Columbia, tracing the routes taken by the armies under the command of General George Washington and French Count Rochambeau on their march from Newport, Rhode Island, to face the British forces under General Cornwallis at Yorktown, Virginia. 
   After meeting in Philipsburg, New York, the combined armies traveled through New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and the future District of Columbia before arriving in Virginia. 
   With a French fleet blocking the Chesapeake, barring British reinforcements from New York or a sea escape for Cornwallis' troops, the combined Continental and French armies' 3-week siege at Yorktown ended with General Cornwallis' surrender to General Washington on October 19, 1781. 
   Historians regard the Battle of Yorktown as one of the most decisive events in bringing an end to the American Revolution and the beginning of a new and independent Nation known as America. 
   H.R. 1286 is the carefully considered result of years of study by the National Park Service, which found that the trail is suitable and feasible for designation as a national historic trail. 
   I would add that H.R. 1286 includes specific language protecting private property rights, prohibiting the Federal Government from acquiring any land or interest in land without the consent of the owner. 
   In fact, the Park Service study found that ``no Federal acquisition of lands or interests in lands is proposed or anticipated.'' 
   H.R. 1286 also states that nothing shall prohibit or hinder the development, conveyance, or transmission of energy along the trail. 
   Finally, there is a Rules Committee amendment to the bill that would clarify that Federal designation of the trail has no impact on State and local laws governing hunting, fishing, or trapping, or recreational shooting. This language is nearly identical to language that has already overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives. 
   I would like to commend Chairman Rahall and Mr. Hinchey for bringing this widely supported legislation to the floor today so we can ensure that America's history is protected for future generations. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, my good friend, my colleague from Washington State, has once again leveled a litany of accusations and, as usual, the rhetoric does not equate with the reality that we see. 
   Let's take the attacks one by one. There were a total of five amendments submitted to this rule, all by Republicans. Three amendments were submitted by Mr. Bishop of Utah, one by Mr. Flake of Arizona, and one by Mr. Pearce of New Mexico. Two amendments were made in order, Bishop No. 1 and Pearce No. 4. Two amendments were not germane to the bill and ruled out of order by the Parliamentarian, Bishop No. 3 and Flake No. 5. The subject matter contained in amendment No. 2 by Representative Bishop was already being addressed by a self-executing provision in the rule which was based on language previously adopted in this House by a vote of 416-5, rollcall vote 171, with all Republicans, including my good friend from Washington, voting in favor of the amendment. 
   Let me take this opportunity to clear up what must be a further misunderstanding on the part of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. 
   Contrary to what my good friend, the gentleman from Washington, would have us believe, the amendment was not the modified Bishop amendment. And I can assure you that the Rules Committee did not hijack any portion of the amendment submitted by our good friend and former member of the Rules Committee, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop). The provision in the rule was based on language passed on April 9, 2008 during consideration of H.R. 2016, the National Landscape Conservation System Act, and it was done to address a concern that a number of Members had about the bill. The amendment was offered by Mr. Altmire of Pennsylvania, was adopted with an overwhelming rollcall vote, as I said before, with every Republican voting in favor of the amendment. If you don't take my word for it, I would be happy to share the Rules Committee report from that bill, which contains the text of the amendment. And I have copies of the section of the Congressional Record that contain the debate and the vote on the Altmire amendment. 
   I also want to point out that the self-executing language in the rule is not an unusual or unprecedented procedure. It was done numerous times when the other side was in the majority, as my good friend from California (Mr. Dreier) alluded to in committee testimony on Tuesday. It's a legitimate tool available to address concerns in a bill. 
   The amendment that we are self-executing is nearly identical to the Altmire language. The Rules Committee believes that this language improves the bill. And it is entirely reasonable to self-execute language with a track record of overwhelming bipartisan support in the House. Those Members who don't like the language are perfectly able to vote against the rule. 
   Now the question of gas prices. Certainly this is an important issue that has been addressed by this House a number of times. We have seen oil climb to record $145 a barrel, and we have also seen big oil companies continue to post record profits. Let's go over a few of the points that have happened in the past years. 
   The President signed into law legislation including landmark provisions to make cars and trucks more fuel efficient and to promote more affordable American biofuels. That all happened because we passed it in this House and provided leadership on this. The new fuel standards will reduce our oil consumption by 1.1 million barrels a day in 2020, one-half of the current U.S. imports from the Persian Gulf, and will save American families $700 to $1,000 per year at the pump. 
   The House also passed legislation to suspend the filling of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And just this week, the Speaker called on the President to unilaterally start releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in order to try and bring down the cost of oil on the world market, a very responsible proposal. 
   We have also voted to invest in home-grown American biofuels in the farm bill. We voted to provide tax incentives for renewable energies and energy efficiency and plug-in vehicles, and creating hundreds and thousands of green jobs. We further voted to reduce public transit fares for commuters pinched by the pump. We voted to crack down on oil price gouging, and in fact we're looking into more of that. We've directed the CFTC to use its full authority to curtail excessive speculation in the markets and other practices which may be distorting the energy market. In fact, the Ag Committee, as we speak, is meeting to look into this matter and plans another hearing tomorrow. We have voted to hold OPEC accountable for oil price fixing, and we have called on the repeal of subsidies to profit-rich Big Oil so we can invest in renewable energy futures. 
   Further, I think it's important for us, as Members, to look at who, in fact, is moving to block the lowering of our prices at the pump. A general blanket statement that we can make, that I have observed, is you put oil people in the White House and you can expect oil prices to go up. President Bush and Republicans have blocked virtually every step that we have tried to make to lower gas prices for the American people. Some of these steps have been: 
   Cracking down on oil price gouging, which was opposed by 140 Republicans the first time and 145 Republicans the second time, including all the Republican leadership. 
   The Democrats in the House proposed ``use it or lose it'' for oil companies holding permits and not drilling. There are 68 million acres that are available for lease right now and to be drilled upon. That use-it-or-lose-it provision that was sponsored by House Democrats was opposed by 176 Republicans. 
   The motion to hold OPEC accountable was opposed by 67 Republicans the first time and by 82 Republicans the second time, including most of the Republican leadership. 
   The proposal repealing subsidies to profit-rich oil companies and investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency was opposed by 174 Republicans, including every member of the Republican leadership. 
   Increasing Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversight authority to prevent manipulation of energy prices, which was in the farm bill, was opposed by 94 Republicans. 
   The Bush administration has vetoed or threatened to veto each and every one of these price control bills. 
   In addition, the Republicans have initially opposed suspending the Strategic Oil Petroleum Reserve. And while the President signed it into law, it was only after issuing veto threats. 
   The President vetoed the farm bill twice, which included the CFTC provisions and the historic investment in American biofuels. 
   I mention all these in the context of my good friend from Washington bringing up that Mr. Clinton vetoed in 1995 a bill that was put forward on energy. The Republican Party in this House is  still blaming President Clinton for problems 13 years after the fact when they have been in control of this House and the Presidency for the last 7 1/2 years for the Presidency and almost 14 for this House before we took over in 2006. I think it's time for us to understand who truly has culpability with this energy crisis that is at hand today. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, I would love to point out to the gentleman that there were a number of self-executing provisions put into bills while the current minority was in the majority in the 109th Congress. There were a total of 44 rules with self-executing provisions. 
   Let me read just a few examples of the self-executing rules that the Republicans did when they were in the majority just to show that this is not a unique practice: 
   H. Res. 75, the rule on H.R. 418, the REAL ID bill, self-executed major changes in the bill to gain votes on the bill and the rule. 
   H. Res. 151, the rule for an Iraq/Afghanistan/tsunami relief bill, self-executed the totally unrelated REAL ID bill to the supplemental after final passage. 
   H. Res. 248, a rule on the budget resolution conference report, self-executed a new budget point of order against appropriations bills in order to get the conservative Republicans to vote for the conference report. 
   H. Res. 258, a rule on the conference report on the Iraq/Afghanistan/tsunami emergency supplemental, contained a self-executing provision that authorized the Judiciary Committee to file a supplemental report on an extremely controversial report that had grossly mischaracterized votes taking place in the Judiciary Committee markup. 
   H. Res. 351, one rule, provided for separate consideration of four OSHA bills, each under a closed rule, and then self-executed language for two of the bills adopting the committee-reported substitutes. The rule also had a self-executing provision that combined all four bills into one text after passage of each bill separately. 
   H. Res. 365, a State Department authorization rule, self-executed an amendment that struck a section of the bill. 
   H. Res. 369, the PATRIOT Act reauthorization rule, made in order an entirely new substitute as base text. 
   H. Res. 387, a China trade rights enforcement rule, self-executed a new text that was considered under a closed rule.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Madam Speaker, I would just like to observe once again that this Congress has approved and authorized 66 million acres for exploration and leasing throughout this country. Now, that may be hard for some folks to visualize that amount of property, so let's talk about it in something that people understand, the size of States. 
   Sixty-six million acres is virtually the size of New England, including New Jersey and Maryland and Delaware. That is the size of land that we have opened up to exploration. Can we do more? Possibly. Are there other alternatives? Absolutely. The Speaker this week proposed trying to bring down prices by opening up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That might actually bring down the cost of oil, and all we've gotten from the White House is a blanket ``absolutely not.'' 
   Madam Speaker, there are a number of measures that this House has moved to try and bring down oil prices and bring relief to the American people. We started in our 6 for '06 with H.R. 6 that tried to bring down oil prices before it was ever even a crisis because we anticipated that this might be a problem. I would also suggest that it has been said that over 90 percent of the Bush-Cheney oil energy policy has been implemented by the prior 109th Congress and the Republican Congresses before that. Mr. Bush got 90 percent of what he wanted for American energy and we have this crisis. I submit to you what we need is a change at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to try and regain energy independence and with a change there we may just do that. 
   I will reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CARDOZA. I would just like to clarify for my colleague from Washington. Once again, he sort of mischaracterized what is happening in the House of Representatives with regard to the work that we are doing to lower gas prices. 
   I would invite the gentleman to join me in the Ag Committee as I leave this chamber today and go to hearings that will be going on all afternoon in the Ag Committee to get to the bottom of the trading issues that might be leading to increased speculatory problems that are possibly causing increased gas prices and the hearings that we are going to have in the Ag Committee all day tomorrow with regard to the same subject. There are a number of us that will be working very hard the next 2 days to try and resolve to get to the bottom of this crisis. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to refer back to the bill at hand. We have gotten way far afield of what the topic was of discussion for this rule, and that is the National Trail System Act. That act was put in place 40 years ago to provide for the conservation of historic and culturally significant areas. 
   I think there is no more deserving historic designation than the one commemorating our Nation's struggle for independence. The bill that we are talking about deserves strong support by all Members of the floor. It's a good bill done by the Natural Resources Committee and chairman, Mr. Rahall, bringing it to the floor. I would urge that we support it heartily. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and on the previous question.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlelady from New York for her work with me on this. 
   Mr. Chairman, by way of brief background, there is a strong and vibrant minority community of Christians in Iraq. Some the oldest Christians in th e world are these various sects: The Assyrian Church of the East, the Assyrian Church of the East Ancient, the Assyrian Evangelical, the Syriac Orthodox, the Syriac Catholic, the Coptic Church, the Armenian Catholic, the Armenian Evangelical, the Armenian Orthodox, and the Chaldean have their origins in Iraq and other Middle Eastern countries such as Iran, Turkey and Syria. 
   Like other ethnic minorities residing in the Middle East, throughout their history these various sects have been used as pawns by m ajor powers in the region. Unfortunately, their Christian faith has made them targets and they frequently have been subjected to harassment and violence throughout the region. 
   In particular, the regime of Saddam Hussein was particularly brutal in their treatment of Christians. Because of their religion and because the majority of Christians opposed Saddam's regime, many of their leaders were assassinated and subjected to arbitrary detention. 
   The war in Iraq exacerbated this situation and further end angers the faith of this group. It is estimated that as many as 40,000 Iraqi Christians, 5 percent of the faithful, have left the country since the war has begun. While Iraqi Christians make up just 3 percent of the overall population, reports are that Christians make up more than 20 percent of the refugee exodus to Syria, and there are mounting fears that if Iraq becomes an Islamic theocracy, the exodus will accelerate. 
   My congressional district, the 18th District of California, happens to be home to a large Assyrian population. I have heard the horror stories from some in my district, and I am committed to ensuring that the interests of the Assyrians and the broader Christian community are well protected in the new Iraq. 
   I have taken numerous steps to protect the rights of the minority. In particular I have written a letter on the subject to Secretary Rice and have implored her to use all means available to ensure that the rights of this group are respected. 
   To further enhance our ability to pro tect these people, it is my understanding that there is report language in this bill which urges that $10 million in the recently enacted supplemental be targeted towards helping the Christian community in Iraq. I want to work with the chairwoman and the rest of the members of the committee to ensure that this money goes for its intended purpose of protecting this community and does not get diverted to other issues.

   Mr. CARDOZA. If the gentleman would yield briefly, I would say I did look for the gentleman on the floor yesterday as well, but we must have missed each other in our search. I thank the gentleman for his comments in the Rules Committee where I raised this issue initially. I look forward to working with the gentleman in the future. I will look for opportunities, together we will look for opportunities, to send a continuing message that this population i s important, not just to the Middle East, but to this country as well, and it is important for us to assist and invest in this community.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARDOZA. (DRUG ENDANGERED CHILDREN ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank my colleague from Virginia who's been a tremendous supporter and assistance on this piece of legislation. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 1199, the Drug Endangered Children's Act. And let me also thank, as well as my colleague from Virginia, my colleague, Mr. Conyers, who's the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who also assisted us in bringing this legislation to the floor. I appreciate both their efforts on behalf of our Nation's children. 
   Drug trafficking and abuse have a devastating impact on the children of this country and contribute to domestic violence, abuse and neglect. According to a recent study, Health and Human Services has said that over 1.6 million children live in a home where at least one parent abuses illicit drugs, including cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin or prescription drugs. 
   In my district in the central valley of California, I have seen the harmful effects of methamphetamine on children's lives. While visiting schools in my area, I've been told by teachers and administrators and, frankly, by the students themselves, that a significant portion of the students have a parent or relative who abuses methamphetamine. Sadly, I know that I'm not alone, as similar stories could be told in other parts the country where illicit drugs are prevalent. 
   I'm particularly concerned about the impact of this drug epidemic and what it's having on our foster care system. According to the National Association of Counties, 40 percent of child welfare officials nationwide report an increase in child welfare cases caused by methamphetamine. 
   This issue strikes close to home for me. In my home county of Merced, California, between 67 and 75 percent of foster care cases are methamphetamine-related.     
   As a father of two adopted children, I have seen firsthand the damaging impact of drug abuse on the foster care system. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, we must do more to help these children in need. Methamphetamine is an extremely dangerous drug for children not only because meth addicts are more likely to abuse and abandon their children but also because meth-addicted parents often set up meth labs in their homes. These labs are highly toxic and susceptible to fire and explosions and therefore place innocent children in physical danger. In my district, children have been found at labs with burns from spilled ingredients from the methamphetamine production process. In addition, there is a high risk of lasting health damage from toxic fume inhalation. Tragically, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, children are found present at 20 percent of all meth labs that are seized. 
   H.R. 1199, the Drug Endangered Children Act, will address the challenges facing children abandoned, neglected, or abused by parents addicted to illicit drugs. The legislation would authorize the Department of Justice to make $20 million in grants available for drug-endangered children for fiscal years 2008 and 2009. The grants are designed to improve coordination among law enforcement, prosecutors, children protection services, social service agencies, and health care providers to help transition drug-endangered children into safe residential environments. 
   The Drug Endangered Children program would build on the successful Federal, State, and local partnerships of the COPS program and the Edward Byrne Memorial Grant program. By funding coordination across jurisdictions and among several different types of government agencies, the Drug Endangered Children program would foster cooperative efforts to address the needs of children affected by drug abuse. These grants would leverage the Federal Government's investment by offering an incentive for local government to invest their own money in confronting this important problem. 
   It's time to pass this vital piece of legislation. The 1.6 million children across this country impacted by parental drug abuse need our help. Let us help these children by passing the Drug Endangered Children Act and rid ourselves of the scourge of drug abuse. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 1199.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the Senate bill (S. 1983) to amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act to renew and amend the provisions for the enhanced review of covered pesticide products, to authorize fees for certain pesticide products, to extend and improve the collection of maintenance fees, and for other purposes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I come before the House today to encourage passage of S. 1983, the Pesticide Registration Improvement Renewal Act. This reauthorization will ensure continued, stable EPA funding for pesticide registration programs, provide predictable timelines for industry, and support the introduction of new and safer products for consumers that are better for the environment. 
   This legislation received extensive input and strong support from a unique alliance of the pesticides industry and the environmental community. S. 1983 builds on the success of the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 and deserves to be passed with the unanimous consent of this Chamber. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are a few points I would like to clarify regarding the text of this legislation. Regarding section 5, the summaries of acute toxicity studies shall be based on real data to further protect public health and the environment, and acute toxicity studies shall be conducted in a manner which accomplishes that goal. The summaries of the acute toxicity studies are intended to supplement the full submission of data from the registrants, not to replace that data. Registrants must still provide a full submission of acute toxicity data in their registration application. 
   There are three errors in the chart printed in the Congressional Record of July 31, 2007: The registration service fee for new category No. 133 should be $78,750, rather than $278,250; the decision time for new category No. 47 in fiscal year 3 should be 12 months; and the action description for the new category No. 61 should read: ``Non-food use; outdoor; FIFRA, subsection 2(mm) uses (1).'' 
   And lastly, section 3 of S. 1983 amends FIFRA to add, among other provisions, a new section that is intended to reflect EPA's current practice of identifying in the docket any information claimed, but not necessarily substantiated, as confidential business information. The language in this new section is not intended to change EPA's responsibilities or practices, pursuant to other statutes, regarding the docketing of information claimed as confidential under FIFRA. 
   With this legislation, EPA will continue to have the resources to review each pesticide product using the best scientific practices in a more predictable timeframe. The pesticide registration program is a model of good government because it includes systemized  stakeholder involvement and furthers the openness and transparency for which all Federal Government programs should strive. 
   I strongly encourage the passage of this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I come before the House today to encourage passage of House Resolution 79, recognizing the establishment of Hunters for the Hungry programs across the United States and recognizing the contributions of those programs to decrease hunger and help feed those in need. 
   Hunters for the Hungry is a unique and innovative program that addresses hunger in communities nationwide. Hunters can donate their game and  fowl to Hunters for the Hungry which processes the meat and provides it to food banks and other feeding programs. This cooperative effort between hunters, processors, and the hunger community is an innovative example of how groups can work together toward a single worthy goal. 
   This legislation received unanimous support in the House Agriculture Committee, and I strongly encourage passage of this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARDOZA. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 700, HEALTHY COMMUNITIES WATER SUPPLY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 215 provides for the consideration of H.R. 700, the Healthy Communities Water Supply Act of 2007, under an open rule with a preprinting requirement. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill except for clause 9 and 10 of rule XXI. The bill shall be considered as read. 
   The rule provides that any amendment to the bill must be printed in the Congressional Record prior to consideration of the bill. Finally, the rule provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions. 
   Mr. Speaker, simply stated, maintaining an adequate water supply is critical to the health and livelihood of our agricultural industry, our economy, and our environment. 
   However, as critical as water is to sustaining our way of life, all too often we take it for granted. Water does not come in an infinite supply. It is, in fact, a very, very scarce resource, particularly in my region of the country. 
   There are significant water supply issues in my home district of California's Central Valley. The valley faces water shortages as various interests compete for this scarce resource. 
   The Central Valley is not unique. Water scarcity is occurring across the country and is becoming more widespread due to several factors. Population is on the rise. Pollution is a constant threat. Growth and development are expanding. And drought can strike us at any time. 
   Despite these pressing needs, we are severely lacking in programs that address the looming shortage. The Environmental Protection Agency, the Congressional Budget Office, and other organizations have estimated that $400 billion is needed for programs to maintain existing and build new water infrastructure. The EPA has also estimated that programs to address sewer overflows need in excess of $140 billion. 
   However, even meeting the needs of these programs has been challenging as this administration has constantly cut funding. Moreover, these programs deal exclusively with protecting our water quality and do not address scarcity or shortages. 
   While these programs are just as important, it doesn't make sense to have a one-track mind. Improving the quality of water is just one part of the equation. We also have to find innovative ways to reuse and recycle water that we have so it will be there to meet our needs as well as the needs of future generations. The rule and the bill we have before us today will begin to address this problem. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Healthy Communities Water Supply Act of 2007, H.R. 700, is quite simple. H.R. 700 extends a critical pilot program for alternative water source projects. Alternative water source projects allow local communities to develop innovative ways to reuse and recycle water, thereby saving money and expanding water use options for the entire country. This pilot program was initially created in 2002, but the program has expired. 
   The bill authorizes $125 million to help communities finance pilot projects to recycle or reuse water or to develop alternative water sources. It is not an excessive investment. Given the scarcity and challenges we face, this is just a start, but this funding is absolutely critical and is a step in the right direction. This will help spur technological development so that individuals, agriculture, and industry have access to the water they need. The bill is also fiscally responsible as it provides a 50 percent matching requirement. 
   Many should be recognized for their interest in ensuring that the future water supply will meet future water demands. I would like to commend my colleagues Mr. McNerney, Mrs. Tauscher, and Mr. Kagen for introducing this important bill. I would also like to thank Mr. Oberstar and Mr. Mica for their leadership in bringing this legislation to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. This is a necessary bill. And this is a critically important investment for people today and for generations to come. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CARDOZA. Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, maintaining an adequate water  supply is critical to the health and livelihood of our agricultural industry, our economy and our environment. Water is not an infinite supply, and water scarcity is occurring across the country and becoming more widespread. We have to find innovative ways to reuse and recycle the water that we have so it will be there to meet our needs, as well as the needs of future generations, and we have to provide the means to make that happen. This bill does just that. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and on the previous question. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. 
   The previous question was ordered. 
   The resolution was agreed to.
