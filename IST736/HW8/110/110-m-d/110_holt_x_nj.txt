<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (EXTENDING PROTECT AMERICA ACT UNNECESSARY -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, the House made a serious mistake last August when it passed the Protect America Act. I opposed the legislation at the time because it authorized a massive, unregulated electronic fishing expedition, an approach guaranteed to ensnare innocent Americans and a sloppy, inefficient way to collect intelligence. It lacks the basic standard of court review of the government's actions. 
   If we have learned anything, it is when officials must establish before an independent court that they know what they are doing when they collect communications, we get better intelligence than we do through indiscriminate collection and fishing expeditions. 
   Extending the PAA is unnecessary because existing orders issued under it will continue for a year and are broad enough in scope to deal with any contingencies that may arise. 
   In November we passed in this body a good bill to replace the PAA. Congress should never pass legislation under duress brought on by propaganda, misinformation, and fear-mongering. I urge my colleagues to remember this when we debate the topic today.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (CLIMATE CHANGE -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, for the past 20 years, my colleagues in the scientific community have been issuing warnings that the release of greenhouse gases is altering the Earth's climate in ways that are expensive and deadly. It is well established in the scientific community that the climate change of recent decades can be attributed to the way we produce and use energy. In fact, the greatest insult to our planet is the way we produce and use energy. 
   As an energy scientist, I know how much can be done technically to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and to slow the rate of global climate change. In fact, many countries around the world are taking those steps. Today, here in the House of Representatives, we have passed historic legislation which will finally take the long overdue first steps toward addressing global climate change and addressing our long-term energy needs. I am proud to have worked with my colleagues on this comprehensive bill which will move us toward reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and will spur the economic growth and will create new jobs and stave off further damage to our environment and our climate. This is one of the principle subjects that I have spoken about and worked on since I first ran for Congress, and it is one of the reasons, I believe, that my constituents sent me to Congress. 
   There are some excellent provisions in this bill that will drastically reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. This includes increasing the average automobile fuel economy to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. It will require the nationwide implementation of renewable portfolio standards requiring 15 percent of the Nation's energy in power generation to come from renewable sources. And these two provisions alone will save consumers as much as $40 billion in a dozen years and will decrease our annual greenhouse gas emissions by up to 324 million tons. 
   H.R. 6 will reverse many of the environmental detrimental policies that this administration and this country have implemented over the past 6 years. It will repeal the $23 billion in tax subsidies and royalty relief provisions for fabulously wealthy oil companies. 
   It will use this money to invest in renewable energy research and extend existing tax credits for the production of renewable energy. My home State of New Jersey has led the way on these issues. New Jersey has already implemented a renewable portfolio standard that requires 20 percent of the State's energy to come from renewable sources by 2020. New Jersey is the second leading State in solar energy production, with over 2,400 solar installations in place, and I am told it is the fastest growing market for solar energy in the United States. 
   The legislation passed here today will require our appliances and buildings to be more energy efficient, it will provide job training to help workers become part of the green economy, it will require the United States to re-enter into the debate on global climate change, it will provide historic investment in renewable energy and biofuels research. 
   Of course, this bill is not enough. If it becomes law, it will be a start, a very good start. Having passed this bill, we will be able to consider other alternative energy and climate change legislation, and I am confident that we will.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Chairman, I thank my friend for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, this is not really about secret ballots or any of the other kinds of red herrings that are being dragged across here. It is about whether we want an even playing field so workers will have the opportunity to protect their rights and interests and advance the American economy. It should be obvious that an individual worker is in a position of lesser influence relative to the employer. Going back now 70 years, the labor relations laws were put together so that there would be an even playing field. Now we need some adjustment in that because there is still not an even playing field. 
   The track record of unions is clear. Unions help lift working men and women and, in fact, the entire economy. Union members earn median wages that are higher. They have more employer-provided health insurance than nonunion members do. They have better defined benefit pension plans. 
   Unions benefit workers and benefit society. That is what this is about.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (CONDEMNING BURMESE REGIME'S UNDEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTION -- (House of Representatives - May 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady. 
   Today all of our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Burma. The deaths and destruction caused by the cyclone Nargis which hit Burma over the weekend are still being discovered. Recent reports indicate that maybe 10,000 were killed and hundreds of thousands left without shelter and clean water. Yet despite this horrific natural disaster, the Burmese junta has announced it will go ahead with the scheduled sham constitutional referendum this Saturday. 
   Today, we are considering our resolution to condemn the Burmese regime's undemocratic constitution and the scheduled sham referendum to legitimize that constitution. As the sponsor of H. Con. Res. 317, I want to thank Chairman Berman and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen, who are both lead sponsors of the resolution, for their support in helping to move this. 
   We sometimes ask, and our constituents sometimes ask, whether governments are relevant to our daily lives, to their daily lives. Well, certainly here we see a negative example of what a difference a government can make. The ruling junta did not warn the people, so I understand, of the oncoming cyclone. They have done little to provide humanitarian assistance. 
   I strongly encourage our State Department to heed the calls of the international community and provide whatever emergency humanitarian assistance the Government of Burma will accept. I do recall visiting Burma several decades ago following an earthquake that devastated Pagan, and the willful unwillingness of the military dictatorship then to accept international help. 
   I have long been interested in Burma and the future of the Burmese people. I first traveled there some decades ago, and I was struck by the amazing damage and destruction that a despotic antidemocratic government can inflict on an economy, on a country and on the people. 
   Under military rule since 1962, Burma was once called the ``rice bowl of Asia'' because of its rich resources, its fertile land and its productive people. But with the ruling junta, its promise and its potential have steadily declined. This promising country's resources have been channeled into supporting the military, and it is now one  of the most impoverished countries in the world. 
   Prior to this week's scheduled sham constitutional referendum, the junta has allowed an election once before. In 1990 the National League For Democracy, the NLD, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, won an election landslide. Yet despite the NLD winning four out of every five parliamentary seats, the regime locked up the NLD winners, and to this day Aung San Suu Kyi remains under arrest. For her bravery, courage and her fight for true democracy in her home country, she has been awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace. Yet 18 years later, this Nobel laureate remains locked away. 
   Those are among the reasons that this House today is considering, and should pass, this resolution to condemn the Burmese regime's undemocratic constitution and the sham referendum to legitimize it. 
   The Burmese people are determined to enjoy the same rights and freedoms that so many across the world, take for granted. The heroic efforts of the opposition leader and Peace Prize winner and others have given hope to victims of terrible oppression, and they deserve our support. This resolution sends a strong signal to the people of Burma that we stand with them in their struggle for democracy. The resolution denounces the one-sided totalitarian and illegal act by the junta to try to legitimize military rule through their unilaterally drafted constitution. 
   The monks who were detained following the September Saffron Revolution and all other political prisoners and prisoners of conscience should be released. The resolution urges President Bush to call on the world community not to accept or recognize the junta's constitution. 
   When several of us Members of Congress held a meeting here of the Human Rights Caucus on the Saffron Revolution to hear testimony from the monks who stood up in a nonviolent way to one of the most despotic regimes in the world, the monks told a gripping and heart-rending tale. They called on Congress to approve this resolution as soon as possible, and today the House answers that call. 
   Earlier this year, for a joint session of Congress, I invited a young man, Richard Chio, a refugee from Burma and a resident of my congressional district, to sit as my guest here in the gallery of this House. He sat and watched the State of the Union address, having resettled only months before in the United States with the help of Lutheran Social Services of New Jersey. He told me that this day in Washington ``was like living in a dream.'' It was the most amazing day in his life to see that a government like ours could exist, because he knew nothing like that in Burma. 
   Richard's story and the countless others remind us of why now, more than ever, especially following the devastation of this cyclone in Burma, the people of the United States need to stand with the people of Burma and oppose the junta. 
   This referendum later this week would be a sham, a fake, pretend; it would be bogus, fraudulent, spurious, phony. Use whatever word you want. But it would not be democratic. It would not be to the benefit of the people of Burma who want a true democracy. 
   I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their support and the many cosponsors of this resolution. I also want to thank Eric Richardson with Mr. Berman and Dennis Halpin with the ranking member for their assistance in preparing this resolution. I also want to thank the U.S. Campaign for Burma and Jen Quigley for the excellent work they do every day and have done year in and year out to promote democracy in Burma. 
   I urge passage of this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, in countries all over the world, journalists are assisted, in fact, often dependent on local assistance, such as Dith Pran was to Sydney Schanberg, who was working for The New York Times. Such assistance often goes unrecognized. 
   But Dith Pran did not go unrecognized. His life would be noteworthy if only because of his survival. After the foreign military forces left southeast Asia, and horrific genocide and slaughter enveloped Cambodia, Dith Pran faced a situation that is hard to believe. He would be noteworthy also because of his excellent work as a photographer and photojournalist, but he is most noteworthy and truly admirable because of his work to bring the horrors of the genocide of Cambodia and of genocide anywhere in the world to the attention of the public. It was my honor and good fortune to know Dith Pran. 
   He covered stories and events in the New Jersey and New York area, and I saw him fairly often. He even accomplished the challenging achievement of sometimes making me look good on film. He was hardly a movie star, but he was always cheerful. In his daily contacts, looking through those smiling eyes, it would be hard to imagine the horrors that were back in his mind. 
   For months each year, after hours, on weekends, before students, before policymakers, before any audience that would listen, he used his experiences effectively to teach the horrors that humans can do to humans and to work for justice, truth and reconciliation in Cambodia and other countries around the world. 
   After each mass murder and genocide in history, some have said ``Never again.'' After the Nazi death camps, after Rwanda, after each genocide, we say never again. 
   Let us all hope, that the example of Dith Pran and his story will help us take action so that truly never again we will see the kind of horror that Dith Pran saw.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (HONORING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INTERNATIONAL GEOPHYSICAL YEAR -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, the first International Geophysical Year was held from July 1957 to December 1958, and this year marks its 50th anniversary. The International Geophysical Year was modeled after the successful International Polar Year of 1882 and its 50th anniversary in 1932. The International Geophysical Year allowed over 60,000 scientists from 67 countries around the world to take part in a series of coordinated observations of various geophysical phenomena. 
   I remember the International Geophysical Year well because, as a youngster, it was reading about it that sparked my interest in science and set me toward the career in physics which I pursued before coming to Congress. 
   The scientific activities spanned the globe from the North to the South Poles. For example, the research in the Antarctic yielded new estimates of the Earth's total ice content--a number of importance given today's melting of major glaciers due to global warming. In addition, radiation detectors to record cosmic rays, spectroscopes to analyze the aurorae, and balloons were put to use to explore the upper reaches of the atmosphere and the formation of thunderstorms. Finally, post-World War II developments in rocketry made possible the exploration of space, employing the exciting new technology of artificial satellites. 
   Today, almost 50 years after Sputnik was launched, it is crucial that we reflect on how we responded to scientific challenges in the Geophysical Year and how we proceeded to invest in research and education in subsequent years. Today, we are falling behind other nations in many measurable ways, particularly in math and science education. Unlike 50 years ago with the launch of Sputnik, we are unlikely to have a sharp wake-up call before we find ourselves unable to maintain the leadership role and quality of life to which we are accustomed. 
   Investment in education and research, as prescribed by, for example, the Democratic Innovation Agenda, would be a good idea in any year. It is particularly apparent that we should make these investments as we reflect today on the path we followed when Sputnik was a recent stimulus and the findings of the International Geophysical Year were so inspiring.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (COMMEMORATING THE 85TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE AMERICAN HELLENIC EDUCATIONAL PROGRESSIVE ASSOCIATION -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 71 which commemorates the 85th anniversary of the founding of the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association, AHEPA. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this resolution to pay tribute to AHEPA, which is a leading association for the 1.3 million American citizens of Greek ancestry. 
   AHEPA was founded on June 26, 1922. Since that day, AHEPA remained true to its mission to promote Hellenism, education, philanthropy, civic responsibility, and family and individual excellence. 
   AHEPA, has helped its members gain a richer understanding of Hellenic heritage and awareness of its contributions to democratic principles in the United States and across the globe. 
   AHEPA members have served in our Nation's Armed Forces, helped raise funds for United States War Bonds during World War II, helped in the restoration of the Statue of Liberty, and performed many other acts to help foster American patriotism. 
   As a member of the Hellenic Caucus, I rise to honor the AHEPA and all American citizens of Greek ancestry for their ongoing contributions to our country. 
   When establishing our democratic Nation, our founding fathers drew a great deal from the ancient Greeks. Our democratic system, that is founded on the principals of popular representation, was introduced by the ancient Athenians who were the first to create a civilization based on the rule of the people. Our founding fathers continued the Greek tradition of debating how best to govern and pursued a government that would provide liberty and justice for all. Our dual experiments in democratic government will forever link the United States and Greece. 
   Not only can we trace the origins of our democratic government to Greece, but also the foundation of science. As some of the first philosophers, the Greeks explored the fields of mathematics, logic, astronomy, physics and biology. The Greeks focused on thinking and understanding, rather than the practical use of their findings in science. Through Aristotle's concepts we built the foundations for the modern scientific method. Our basic understanding of the Earth and its place in the solar system came from the studies of Ancient Greeks.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF CAMPUS FIRE SAFETY MONTH -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express support for the goals and ideals of Campus Fire Safety Month, introduced by the representative from Ohio, Mrs. STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES. Campus fire safety is an important issue for students all over the country. Since January of 2000, at least 113 young people have died in student housing fires. These unfortunate deaths may have been prevented by better education of fire safety measures and implementation of effective prevention systems. 
   In my own State of New Jersey, early on January 19, 2000, a fire killed three students and injured 58 others at Seton Hall University. Over 75 percent of these fatalities around the country have occurred in off-campus housing. It should be a priority to make sure that all students are aware of fire safety information, especially those students who do not live in on-campus housing. Fire safety training should be a continuing process so that our Nation's young people practice fire safety throughout their lives. 
   As we send our Nation's students off to campuses this month to further their education, it is essential that they are in safe environments. Simple steps such as testing smoke detectors and having a working and accessible fire extinguisher can help keep our students safe. By recognizing September as Campus Fire Safety Month, this resolution will help bring awareness to such simple and critical measures to protect students from fire hazards. 
   Mr. Speaker, the knowledge and skills learned through fire safety training are invaluable for everyone. I would like to encourage administrators and municipalities across the country to provide educational programs to all students during September and throughout the school year. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE IN NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL MOCK TRIAL CHAMPIONSHIP -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 25, a resolution that calls on the National High School Mock Trial Championship board of directors to make provisions in the championship schedule to accommodate the religious faiths of all potential students and participants. This legislation was introduced by Mr. Rothman, my colleague from New Jersey, who has worked diligently on this issue to see that fairness and tolerance prevails. 
   The National High School Mock Trial Championship is a competition between winning high schools on a national level designed to showcase bright and talented high school students. The event requires intense preparation, skill and dedication for those who reach the high level of competition. The current championship takes place on weekends. There are two rounds on Friday, two rounds on Saturday, and a championship round that occurs later on Saturday. 
   In 2005, just a couple of years ago, this schedule caused an imposition to a team in that competition. The Torah Academy of Teaneck, New Jersey was scheduled to participate after winning the 2005 New Jersey State Bar Foundation high school tournament. Now, this school, without proper accommodation, would not have been able to compete because of their orthodox religious practice to observe the Sabbath from sundown on Friday until sundown on Saturday. In that instance, the board of the competition made a proper accommodation for the students' religious faiths. The team was able to compete in May of that year. Those who took part in that competition recognized that the adjustment made by the board showed fairness and tolerance, and it was a good way to approach a problem. All participating applauded the board for doing so. However, the board later voted to refuse any future accommodations for students who observe the Sabbath on Friday or Saturday. The vote carried and signified a rejection of participation for all future participants with religious prohibitions, religious practices that may require accommodation. 
   Well, a number of legal organizations then withdrew their participation and support for the National High School Mock Trial Championship pointing to this act of the board of directors that quite clearly undermines free religious spirit, the kind of spirit on which this country was based. It is not without irony that this was applied in a competition that is intended for legal and constitutional education. 
   The resolution before us today from Mr. Rothman and cosponsored by a number of us calls on the mock trial championship to recognize the diverse religious views and practices in this country and to restore its rules in order to accommodate excellent students of all faiths. I commend Mr. Rothman for pursuing this. We hope that this can be resolved in a way that is most inclusive and in the spirit, the constitutional spirit, of equality of religious practice in this country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   No one said that the freedoms we cherish need be convenient. They do require from each of us, from time to time, accommodation, even inconvenience. This is a teachable moment, an important lesson in tolerance, equality and, yes, accommodation.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (IRAN COUNTER-PROLIFERATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a cosponsor and strong supporter of the Iran Counter-Proliferation Act of 2007, H.R. 1400. It is appropriate that we are debating this bill today while Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad addresses the United Nations General Assembly. 
   The current regime in Iran poses troubling security challenges to the community nations and our allies in the Middle East. The hateful and threatening comments made by the President of Iran against Israel cannot be tolerated. Further, the provocative actions taken by Iran to further their nuclear weapons program are not acceptable. A nuclear Iran would destabilize the region and threaten the United States and our allies. Iran must alter its dangerous course, and the United States needs to be fully involved to help bring this about. 
   My commitment to ending Iran's nuclear weapons program is one of the reasons I was an early cosponsor of the Iran Counter Proliferation Act of 2007. H.R. 1400 is important legislation that would prevent nuclear cooperation between the United States and any country that provides nuclear assistance to Iran as well as support diplomatic and economic means to resolve the Iranian nuclear problem. It would also expand bilateral sanctions against Iran by severely limiting the export of U.S. items to Iran and by prohibiting all imports. Additionally, H.R. 1400 calls for enhanced UN Security Council efforts in response to Iran's continued defiance of the  international community. Finally, it is important to note that the bill specifically states that the administration cannot interpret anything in the legislation as a congressional authorization of a military strike on Iran. 
   Earlier this year, the House passed the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act of 2007, H.R. 2347. This legislation which I also supported would authorize State and local governments to divest from, and prevent investment in, companies with financial ties to Iran's energy sector, or that sell arms to the Government of Iran, and financial institutions that extend credit to the Government of Iran. 
   H.R. 1400 is logical next step to ensure that the United States does everything in our power to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear state and further destabilizing the Middle East. I urge my colleagues to support this vital legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 6003, the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008, legislation that would authorize $14.9 billion in funding for Amtrak over the next 5 years. 
   Rail service has integrated small communities with large cities across the country providing opportunity for economic expansion, increased mobility, and environmentally sound transit. Since Amtrak was founded in 1971, our country has benefited from organized, reliable and safe service to individuals commuting to and from work and individuals using rail service for extended travel. With the skyrocketing costs of airline flights and gas prices at over $4 a gallon, individuals are relying more and more on rail service. 
   It is no exaggeration to say that rail service is the lifeline from which New Jersey's state economy draws nourishment. Our region's employers--small, medium, and large--depend upon an integrated rail operation to enable many of their employees to get to and from work. Clients, potential clients, and business partners use the train to come to New Jersey. Our local entrepreneurs use Amtrak to pitch their ideas and sell their products outside of our home state. 
   For the last 12 years, Amtrak has been suffering from a lack of federal support and for the last 6 years it has been operating without Congressional authorization. In order to keep from going out of business, Amtrak was forced to delay necessary repairs and security improvements, freeze the salaries of its employees, rescind on employee pensions and go billions of dollars into debt. The legislation before us today would authorize the funding necessary to improve Amtrak's operations throughout the country and bring our country's rail service into the 21st Century. 
   H.R. 6003 authorizes $14.9 billion for Amtrak over the next 5 years. $4.3 billion of which would be used for capital grants to help Amtrak afford to make necessary repairs and upgrades to the Northeast Corridor. It would also allow Amtrak to procure new rolling stock, rehabilitate existing bridges, as well as make additional capital improvements and maintenance over its entire network. 
   As a regular Amtrak rider, I appreciate the professionalism and service that customers enjoy every day. Amtrak's hard working employees, including the over 1,300 employed in New Jersey, have continued to provide high quality service despite Amtrak's payroll freezes and pension problems. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act would provide Amtrak with $3 billion in operating grants, which would help Amtrak make good on its promises to these employees. A portion of these funds would be used to pay employees salaries, health costs, and overtime pay. It would also help Amtrak pay for increasing fuel costs, facilities, maintenance and train operations. 
   This legislation would also create a new State Capital Grant program to provide grants for States for intercity passenger rail capital projects. In New Jersey the demand for public transportation has skyrocketed, with NJ Transit providing 900,000 trips per weekday on its trains, buses and light-rail vehicles. H.R. 6003 would authorize over $2.5 billion in grants to states over the next 5 years to help organizations like NJ Transit pay for the capital costs  of facilities and the equipment necessary to provide new or improved intercity passenger rail. 
   The Passenger Rail Investment Reauthorization Act would provide $1.7 billion annually to help Amtrak pay off the debt it incurred when Congress drastically cut its funding in 2000 and 2001. Amtrak has aggressively targeted this debt, paying down $600 million from 2002 through 2007. This bill would help Amtrak take further steps to reduce its debt, and allow Amtrak to focus its resources on improving existing services and making additional capital and operational improvements. 
   H.R. 6003 would bring American passenger rail into the 21st century, authorizing $1.7 billion for the construction of eleven high-speed rail network spanning the entire Nation. The first of which would be a high-speed rail corridor between Washington, D.C. and New York City. Countries like France, England and Japan have greatly improved the experience of commuters through the utilization of high speed corridors. This would lead to more efficient public transportation and help the over 1.5 million New Jerseyans who use Amtrak spend less time commuting and more time at home with their families. 
   Supporting public transportation especially passenger rail, should be a crucial element of our national effort to slow the rate of global climate change and reduce our dependence on foreign fuels. Passenger rail consumes 21 percent less energy per passenger mile than automobiles and 17 percent less than airplanes. It releases half the amount of greenhouse gases per passenger mile as both air and car travel. The continued operation of Amtrak is an essential component of easing traffic congestion, reducing wear and tear on roads, protecting our environment and preserving open space in New Jersey and across the country. 
   Rail service is a fundamental component of our Nation's continually growing transportation system, and Amtrak has demonstrated the capacity of integrated rail service to expand economic opportunity, commuter options, and make vital contributions to the fabric of our communities. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6003.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for this amendment and for yielding me time. He is very diligent in looking after the concerns of the people of his area in Pennsylvania, and in this amendment, I must say it also benefits--would benefit the people of New Jersey as well. 
   When you look at the numbers where Amtrak is setting record highs for numbers of users--25 million users last year--and look at how in New Jersey the State rail system is breaking ridership records for the 6th straight year with over 900,000 trips per weekday on its trains, buses, and light rails, and you match that with the increased costs of commuting by internal combustion cars, it should be apparent that Amtrak should do everything it can to attract riders on these underused routes; and that is exactly what the Murphy-Schwartz-Holt amendment seeks to do. 
   It would require Amtrak to re-examine the service cuts that it's made at two stations to see if it would be feasible to increase services at those stations. They can do this through service and pricing. I hear from my constituents about this. One constituent, John, who commutes from Princeton Junction, summed it up by saying Amtrak seems to be driving customers away.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman OBEY for his leadership in crafting this bill and bringing it before the House. In brief, I wanted to let my colleagues know that the Select Intelligence Oversight Panel, which I chair, has been involved in this process. Our role has been to ensure that any intelligence programs included for funding in this supplemental package have been reviewed for their appropriateness and value to our troops in the field. 
   While the Department of the Defense is focused on Iraq and Afghanistan, the professionals in the Intelligence Community are focused on threats there and elsewhere around the world. A good intelligence system can save lives by preventing war, or, should war come, by helping to win the war as quickly as possible. We must ensure that the troops in combat get the best real-time intelligence and at the same time that policymakers get solid, independent, insightful intelligence about countries, trends, and potential conflicts around the world. I look forward to providing another update on our work once the base DoD appropriations bill is completed later this spring. 
   Regarding Iraq, I recently returned from a trip to that deeply troubled country. American troops are performing superbly in Iraq under continually difficult conditions. While in Baghdad, I met with soldiers--including those from New Jersey--and told them they deserve not just our gratitude, but all of the support they need when they return to help them get on with their lives. The situation in Iraq, however, is not in the power of our soldiers to control, as events have repeatedly shown. 
   It is impossible to hide the fact that the limited security gains achieved since last fall have not been matched by political reconciliation on the part of the Iraqis. The uneven performance of the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) during the fighting with the Mahdi Army in late March 2008 has called into question the viability of the ISF as a national defense and police force, despite our having poured billions of dollars into the ISF. 
   Unfortunately, Iraq's central government continues to lack legitimacy in the eyes of its people, as the recent spasms of violence in Basra, Baghdad, and elsewhere in the country have clearly shown. No amount of American lives and money can erase that legitimacy gap. It is clear that the Iraqi government is unwilling or unable to take the steps necessary to reach a political settlement that will end the violence, and that is why I supported the amendment to this supplemental spending bill that would set a start date for our withdrawal from Iraq. It is important for us to take decisive action to end our combat involvement in Iraq and refocus our efforts on destroying al Qaeda and eliminating the conditions that breed international terrorism and refocusing our resources on pressing domestic and international needs. 
   While we continue our efforts to extricate our troops from Iraq, we must also prepare to help them once they return home and begin transitioning to the civilian world. I strongly support the provision in this bill that expands the education benefits veterans receive under the GI bill to restore the promise of a full, 4-year college education, and make the veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan part of an American economic recovery, just like the veterans of World War II were. 
   This bill also contains provisions to help America's most vulnerable citizens survive the current de facto recession our country is experiencing. The bill extends unemployment benefits for workers who have exhausted their benefits by up to 13 weeks in every State as well as an additional 13 weeks in States with high unemployment. Also included in this bill is the Protecting the Medicaid Safety Net Act of 2008 (H.R. 5613), which places a moratorium on seven Medicaid regulations that would cut services to seniors, families, and those with disabilities as well as cut payments to safety net providers. These are compassionate measures that are fully off-set, and I am glad they are in this bill. 
   However, I can't help but observe, Mr. Speaker, that these needs would have been met long ago if our country had not been forced to waste billions of dollars on a war of choice that should never have been fought. I will continue to do all I can to help end our involvement in Iraq and redirect our Nation's priorities and resources where they belong--on meeting the needs of our people.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, today, the House will again pass legislation to support humane and potentially life-saving embryonic stem cell research. I am a cosponsor of this essential legislation to increase the number of embryonic stem cell lines that can be used to conduct federally funded research to search for cures for a number of diseases such as diabetes, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, ALS, multiple sclerosis, and cancer. 
   The opponents of this legislation say that we should pursue alternative avenues for research, such as adult stem cells, cord blood cells, and amniotic fluid cells. And they are correct; we should investigate each one of them. Yet, that is not a compelling reason to block researchers from pursuing embryonic stem cell research, which experts agree holds the greatest potential because of the pluripotent nature of the cells. 
   As a research scientist, I understand that we will only understand the true value of each of these cell types when the research is done. That is why it is essential that we pass this bill and make more embryonic stem cell lines available for exploration. 
   My home state of New Jersey has demonstrated real national leadership on stem cell research. In 2005, New Jersey became the first state in the nation to award public funds for research on human embryonic stem cells. Just last month, Governor Corzine pledged an additional $10 million in public funds for stem cell research. And the state legislature recently approved $270 million for new stem cell research centers. New Jersey is taking the lead on this ground breaking research, but that can not be an excuse for inaction on the federal level. 
   It would be immoral for the federal government not to pursue this promising avenue of research, which holds the potential to revolutionize medical care for those afflicted with tragic diseases and conditions. 
   I implore President Bush to put his veto pen away--he must stop standing in the way of scientific progress that could benefit all Americans.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (DECEPTIVE PRACTICES AND VOTER INTIMIDATION PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished Chair, and I commend him for his work in this area, and I rise today to urge my colleagues to support the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act. 
   This important legislation, as you have heard, would make it a crime knowingly to communicate false information about an election with the intention of preventing another person from exercising the right to vote and would require the Department of Justice to take immediate corrective action on behalf of affected voters, as well as to refer such matters for appropriate prosecution. 
   It pains me deeply, as I think it does all here, that this is necessary still four decades after the enactment of the Voting Rights Act. It should pain us all that when the United States looks in the mirror, what we see staring back at us is an electoral system still rife with abuses. It embarrasses me to say this, but it is what we must do, take an honest look to begin to correct. 
   This legislation is essentially the legislation that I introduced in the previous Congress, along with a companion bill in the other body by Senator Obama. I am pleased that Representative Emanuel and Chairman Conyers and many others have joined to advocate this bill now. 
   Now, consider just a few examples. In the 2004 elections in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, fliers attributed to a nonexistent organization called the Milwaukee Black Voters League were distributed in minority neighborhoods warning residents that ``if anyone in your family has ever been found guilty of anything, even a traffic violation, you can't vote in the presidential election,'' and that ``if you violate any of these laws, you can get 10 years in prison.'' It sounds like nonsense, but to those voters, that was intimidation. 
   It was no better in 2006. In a documented case in Virginia, a registered voter received a telephone message from a caller claiming to be from the Virginia Board of Elections informing him that he was not registered, and that if he showed up at the polls to vote, he would be criminally prosecuted. Again, it is easy to dismiss that as nonsense, but it is coercion.     
   It is disenfranchisement, it is deception. 
   Now there is no way to know exactly how many voters were deterred or led astray by such deceptive practices, but such practices are no less criminal than outright threats or intimidation. 
   Now as you've heard from the chairman and others, this is not the be all and end all of election reform legislation. We still have to prevent disenfranchisement that results from the shortage of equipment, equipment inequitably distributed among precincts. We still have to prevent disenfranchisement by manipulation of the registration lists. We still need to require that provisional ballots be counted if they are legitimate because under the Help America Vote Act, they must be offered to voters who are not on the registration list, but if it turns out that the voter is a legitimate voter, the provisional ballot is not required under law to be counted. 
   We must make sure that tabulation of results after the polls close is more transparent. I have various legislation that would deal with these things, as well as legislation that would ensure that every voter has a voter-verified paper ballot and that audits would apply in every Federal election. Those are some of the things we need to do. 
   But this is an important step to beat back, to subdue the cynicism about our government. When I talk with students, I often ask them what they think is the most ingenious invention of humans. And they, knowing that I am a scientist, often come up with some technological answer. I would argue that it is our constitutionally democracy. It has transformed not just America but the world, demonstrating that peaceful and productive government by the consent of the governed is possible. 
   That consent, the very cornerstone of the system, is given by the vote. And the Supreme Court has held that the right to vote is the most fundamental right as it is the preservative of all others. The measure before us will criminalize knowing acts of deception designed to prevent voters from voting. 
   Our democratic government works only if the people believe it does. Think about that. If we are to let people work their will at the polling place, we must remove coercion, deception, distortion and disenfranchisement. Cynicism about the process, cynicism about our ability to governor ourselves is at a critically high level. By passing this legislation, we can help to reduce that cynicism and help to realize the promise of the genius of Philadelphia 220 years ago.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (SUPPLEMENTAL MINE IMPROVEMENT AND NEW EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, there's no question that mining has been a dangerous job. And today coal mining is rated among the most dangerous occupations in America. It does not have to be that way. 
   As a scientist, I've paid some attention to mine safety technology, but I also feel strongly about the concerns of those working in mines because I was born and raised in West Virginia, where my father, many years ago, as a member of the House of Delegates, and later  in the Senate, was known as one of the best friends the miner ever had. 
   As an original cosponsor of the S-MINER Act, I want to thank Chairman Miller and our staff for recognizing the importance of getting communications technology, currently existing, and that being developed, into the mines as quickly as possible. 
   This bill improves the work of the previous Congress by requiring that enhanced communications and miner tracking systems be installed immediately upon enactment. 
   I remain troubled that the Mine Safety and Health Administration and mine operators have delayed getting promising technology into the mines. It is really heartrending to share in the terror and tragedy of miners stranded without communication. 
   A year ago, NIOSH reached an agreement with the U.S. Army Communications and Electronics Research Center at Fort Monmouth in New Jersey to test and develop the KUTTA communications system because communications on the battlefield and in noisy environments subject to disruptions have lessons for communications in the mines. 
   Mr. Chairman, MSHA has not acted with the urgency needed to prevent future miner fatalities. Today Congress is acting. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation because, in the wake of the Sago and Darby and Crandall Canyon mine tragedies, we should not have to face more families who have faced these tragedies, and we should do everything we can to prevent such tragedies in the future.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (AFGHANISTAN FREEDOM AND SECURITY SUPPORT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this very important legislation. 
   During the first 6 months of 2007, this Congress has rightly spent a great deal of time debating and trying to reorient our policy in Iraq. It's important to remember that one of the chief reasons we need to leave Iraq is so that we can win the other war we've been fighting since 2001: the war against Al Qaeda and their Taliban allies in Afghanistan.  
   This bipartisan bill provides additional support for programs as diverse as assistance to women and girls, energy development and counter-narcotics. It authorizes $6.435 billion for fiscal years 2008 through 2010, of which $2.145 billion is authorized to be spent in fiscal year 2008. Let me comment on a couple of specific provisions that I think are particularly important. 
   This bill seeks to set standards, create performance metrics, and mandate a tightly coordinated interagency strategy for Afghanistan--the very kinds of measures that were absent in our effort in Iraq from the very beginning. Starting in December 2007 and every 6 months afterwards through September 30, 2010, this bill would require the President to submit detailed reports to Congress on the political, military, and economic progress being made--or not being made--in Afghanistan. It is long past time that Congress mandated such benchmarks so that we can know what is working in Afghanistan and make adjustments where things are not working. 
   This bill also mandates the creation of a special envoy to help more closely coordinate activities between those governments and the International Security Assistance Force in their joint efforts to interdict Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters who attempt to use Pakistani territory to launch attacks against civilian and military targets in Afghanistan. Pakistan's record in this area is at best mixed, and I am glad that the committee has recognized the need for our government to increase its effort to get both governments to make the borders no-go zones for insurgents. 
   Finally, this bill recognizes that the Taliban and Al Qaeda are not the only enemies of Afghanistan's fledgling democracy. The narcotics trade in Afghanistan is producing violence and corruption that threatens the people and government of Afghanistan just as much as the actions of the terrorists. Indeed, we know that in many cases the terrorists are using narco-trafficking to help fund their violent campaign to overthrow the Afghan government. 
   Weeding out potentially corrupt police who assist the drug lords and the terrorists is essential, and this bill would require that future assistance to the Afghan National Police include ``vetting procedures to adequately assess each Afghan National Police candidate's aptitude, professional skills, integrity, and other qualifications that are essential to law enforcement work.'' This is exactly the type of framework that we have lacked in Iraq to deal with police corruption in that country, and so I'm pleased that the committee is including such a vetting requirement for Afghan police in this bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, I look forward to the day when the people of Afghanistan are free of the fear and uncertainty that decades of war and civil strife have produced in that ancient country. Let us hasten the arrival of that day by reaffirming our partnership with them by passing this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will be brief. This is an important piece of all of the work that we have to do to improve our science, engineering, technology and mathematics capability here in the United States. Specifically, this bill establishes a complete database of all available scholarships from public and private sources, fellowships, and other programs of financial assistance for the study of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. 
   The Act, specifically known as the National STEM Scholarship Database Act, directs the Secretary of Education to establish and maintain a public Web site through which individuals may find a complete database of available scholarships, fellowships and financial assistance. 
   The Secretary of Education will also, under this legislation, disseminate information about the database to secondary schools and to colleges and universities, institutions of higher education. It will serve as a one-stop shop for financial aid information for those who want to study in the STEM fields. 
   Now, it may be surprising to my colleagues that this doesn't already exist. But it does not. Although there are many things that we need to do to improve science and math teaching in elementary and secondary schools and in higher education, and encourage students toward science and technology fields, this is one important thing we can accomplish today. 
   We all know that higher education is expensive. In fact, many students are deterred from studying these important fields because of the cost. 
   Yet, at the same time, some of the opportunities for financial assistance go unused, and, students, however motivated they may be, often don't know where to start to look for financial assistance. Certainly in high school, school counselors are overloaded with typically 400 students each, and as a college student is trying to decide on a major and a specific field of engineering, for example, it's hard to know where to turn for financial assistance. 
   This simple straightforward database available through a Web site will greatly, I think, facilitate the student's ability to go into these STEM fields. It will serve all students at all levels as they are thinking about going into college, as they are thinking about choosing a major in college, as they are thinking about going to graduate school, as they are thinking about whether or not to teach in a science or engineering or mathematics area. 
   This is an important and straightforward piece of legislation that will assist our nation's students in studying science and math, and will assist our country in our efforts to be more competitive internationally. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   As I said earlier, it may come as a surprise to my colleagues that this single database where any student who might be interested in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics could go might, they might be surprised that it doesn't already exist. In fact, it doesn't. 
   This is straightforward legislation that will make it easier for students to pursue a line of study or one of a number of lines of study that are critically important not only for their personal development, but for our economy and our society, our international competitiveness, indeed, the future of our country. 
   This is only one piece of the many things that we need to do that you have heard from other speakers about this morning. It is a straightforward, simple thing that we can do, that is not expensive. If we could, through this inexpensive method, encourage eight or ten or twelve more students to go into science, that would be wonderful. Instead, I expect we will get hundreds, if not thousands, who will find their way into these critical fields because of the existence of a database that gives them a place to start as they look to their future. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 1051, as amended.

   Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, 4 years ago, President Bush used soldiers and sailors as stage props to declare ``Major combat operations in Iraq have ended.'' Those combat operations indeed, should have ended, in fact, they should never have begun. This combat was constitutionally and strategically unjustifiable, operationally poorly executed with regard to armoring and deploying the troops, and politically and diplomatically disastrous. 
   This war is not making anyone safer or more free and it cannot be won militarily. As retired General Odom said, ``The challenge we face today is not how to win in Iraq; it is how to recover from a strategic mistake: invading Iraq in the first place.'' 
   The President continues to squander American influence, blood and treasure. The President's intransigence is why our Congress was forced to pass a spending bill that forces a change in course in Iraq. The President needs to know that the days of congressional blank checks in support of a failed policy are over.

   This week, the White House announced that it foresees American troops in Iraq into at least 2009, and the President has even gone so far as to suggest that our presence in Iraq may evolve to look like our presence in South Korea. We've had troops stationed in South Korea--on permanent bases--for over 50 years. This resolution says clearly to the President and the people of Iraq that we will not turn our temporary presence in Iraq into a permanent one. The Congress should take whatever additional measures are necessary to ensure that no funds are expended for the construction of permanent bases in that country, and to that end I urge my colleagues to vote for this measure.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill. 
   If the President of the United States were a rational decision maker, a bill of this kind would not be necessary in the first place. Unfortunately, the President continues to cling to the illusion that the situation in Iraq will improve if only we're willing to sacrifice still more American lives. But we cannot solve Iraq's civil war any more than we could solve Vietnam's civil war 40 years ago. 
   By unleashing forces he does not understand and cannot control, the President has put our military forces in an impossible situation. Our troops cannot referee Iraq's sectarian conflict. The longer our forces remain in Iraq, the more they become identified with a government that is seen as increasingly repressive, and incapable--or unwilling--to take the steps necessary to resolve Iraq's internal conflict politically and peacefully. It is for all these reasons that it is past time for Congress to take steps in forcing the President to change course and withdraw our combat troops. 
   This course correction is far slower and more difficult than I would like. I share the frustration of many of my colleagues that the President is not moving quickly enough or boldly enough to end our military involvement in Iraq. I for one do not expect the President to provide the Congress with accurate assessments of the readiness of our forces or of the Pentagon's ability to meet some key needs of the troops. 
   Existing DoD readiness assessments already show that our forces are overworked and overstretched. My friend from Pennsylvania, Mr. MURTHA, has included provisions in this bill that seek to limit the President's ability to deploy our ground forces to Iraq that are not truly ready and therefore less effective and more at risk. I believe zealous oversight of these provisions will be required if this bill becomes law. The President has shown he is willing to say or do anything to try to get his way when it comes to Iraq policy. He must not be allowed to politicize readiness assessments the way he has politicized intelligence assessments. 
   One bogus criticism of this measure is that setting a date certain for withdrawal is bad policy or micromanagement by the Congress. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been trotting this argument out frequently of late. Their position is undercut by the fact that they voted to impose time lines and benchmarks on President Clinton during our effort in the Balkans a decade ago. 
   By the way, I am pleased that this measure contains significantly increased funding for two critical areas of veterans health care: traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. We are only beginning to come to grips with the true costs of this conflict for our veterans, and we must take aggressive measures to ensure that they receive the follow up care they need to have the best possible chance of leading full, productive lives. 
   Mr. Speaker, we should be under no illusions regarding this bill. It is only the first concrete step in our effort to redirect our nation's policy in Iraq. Some weeks ago, we passed a non-binding resolution that pointed us in a  new direction with respect to the occupation and war in Iraq. That was the right thing to do, even though it was non-binding on the President. Similarly, this supplemental appropriation is beneficial, although the actual withdrawal of troops will require, I believe, additional forceful action by Congress to fulfill the provisions of this bill. 
   It is important to move forward with this measure now and force this President to make America's combat occupation of Iraq history rather than a limitless, open-ended future.

   Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, I rise to mark the passing this week of one of the most effective environmentalists in the State of New Jersey, indeed in the country, Dr. Ted Stiles. Perhaps not the most celebrated, he should be celebrated. He preserved thousands of acres, advanced the understanding of ecology, and improved the environment for millions of people for generations to come. To some of my colleagues from the western States, thousands of acres may not sound like much, but the significance of that preservation and the difficulty of doing it in the densely populated Northeast are great. 
   Dr. Stiles chaired and led boards of the Stony Brook Millstone Watershed Association, the Mercer County Open Space Preservation Board, the Friends of Hopewell Valley Open Space, the Municipal Land Use Center, the New Jersey Academy of Science, and the Hutchinson Memorial Forest. He served for many years on boards, including the Crossroads of the American Revolution Association; The Nature Conservancy, New Jersey chapter; and others. He continued all of this work through his illness and up to his death. 
   He showed creative approaches to locally based environmental decision-making, such as his creation of the Municipal Land Use Center; and he received awards from academia and regional and community organizations and the highest environmental award from the Governor of New Jersey. 
   What distinguished Dr. Stiles especially was his unparalleled, unmatched ability to make people want to do those things that contribute to the general good. He made landowners want to offer their land to preservation organizations, and he made people want to spend their money to purchase and preserve that land. He made volunteer board members want to give of their time and effort to build communities and to improve the environment. 
   He made grad students want to go to remote places around the world to do such things as measuring the size of fruits relative to the sizes of birds' beaks so we could better understand the relationship between communities of plants and communities of animals. 
   He made hundreds of local citizens want to spend a day twice a year cleaning up their town. And he made a politically interested scientist want to leave a research career to run for Congress. Yes, I am that scientist. Dr. Stiles' research students continue to make contributions to research, teaching, and public policy around the country. 
   Throughout his life, it is not an empty cliche to say, Dr. Stiles, through goodwill and good ideas and  leadership, made this country a better place.

   Mr. Speaker, it is important because of the tradition and because of the future. I know some people have said why does Congress even maintain the page program. We could privatize it. We could have messengers. Why does Congress even maintain a dormitory?     
   Because we contribute to the growth and the education of future leaders. 
   I speak as a former page, many decades past now, but I must count that as one of the formative experiences of my life. The pages learn the discipline of employment, they learn teamwork, but they also take to heart the democratic process, the representative government. They literally walk in the footsteps of some of the great figures of history. But we have a responsibility as Members of Congress not just for their education and growth, but also for their safety. 
   This legislation is important. I am pleased that the legislation mandates that the Page Board be composed of equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats, that it include a former page and a page parent, and mandates regular meetings of the board, so that the board is constantly aware and makes us in this body constantly aware of our responsibility for the welfare and the growth and the safety and the education of the pages. 
   The country is better off because of these pages, many of whom have gone on to important leadership positions and contributed in so many ways, in their hometowns, in their home States, and, in many cases, in the Federal Government. 
   As a former page and as a parent, I was offended and shocked at the breach of trust that occurred in the past year. But I am pleased that we are acting today to address systemic shortcomings and to prevent any such occurrence in the future, and, more to the point, working to make this a truly positive experience for all pages, all these young men and women, future leaders, and important employees and public servants even now.

   Mr. Speaker, this week I received an e-mail message from a constituent of mine in Lawrenceville, New Jersey. She said: ``Please help turn the tide by doing not a little but a lot to help solar, wind, hydrogen become the mainstream energy sources and turn oil into the alternative.'' 
   She is right. This legislation which will end the subsidies, renegotiate the leases, and use the revenues to develop sustainable energy technologies is a very good start. 
   There are any number of things. Take wind energy. The United States does not lead the world in total production of wind energy. We fall behind Spain, Germany, Denmark. It is because these governments have made commitments that we have not. We have lost some technological leads that we have had, and we won't lessen our addiction to foreign oil in the United States without making investment in these sustainable energy sources. Wind is just one example. Generating power from the oceans is another. This bill is not enough, but it is a good start.  
   I rise today in support of H.R. 6, the Creating Long-term Energy Alternatives for the Nation Act or the CLEAN Energy Act. This is an important step for our nation in reducing our dependence on foreign oil and I commend Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Rahall, and Chairman Rangel for including this legislation in the first 100 hours of legislative business in the 110th Congress. 
   We have already heard from our colleagues today about the three major tenets of this bill--ending subsidies for large oil companies, renegotiating leases for oil companies that have avoided paying royalties on leases they signed in 1998 and 1999, and creating the Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve. I would like to take some time to speak about the importance of the Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve. 
   The new sustainable energy reserve created in this legislation will be funded by repealing the tax breaks that have been provided to the large oil companies, who consistently reap excessive profits at the expense of the American consumer. There is a lot that is funding can be used for. It is my hope that we focus our attention on research and development of sustainable energy sources and invest in the technologies needed to wean ourselves from fossil fuels. 
   One example of a real investment is the wind industry. It was once the case that the wind industry was based-only in California. Production across the country has increased, and I commend the industry for the progress they have made. There is, of course, still more we can do. The United States does not lead the world in total production of wind energy--we fall behind Spain and Germany. These countries have a greater commitment to wind energy than we. And Denmark has made a turnaround in the past thirty years, moving away from relying solely on oil to relying a great deal on wind power for their electricity. This is because the government in Denmark made a real commitment to investing in this technology. The United States can and should be the leader on wind energy. With the proper investment from the government, it will be.  
   According to the American Wind Energy Association, 46 of our states have the potential to produce significant wind energy. We must harness this potential across our country and make a real commitment to wind power. We can start by including a long term extension of the production tax credit. We can also adopt a renewable portfolio standard, which over twenty states have already done on their own. 
   We will not lessen our addiction on foreign oil in the United States without making the investment in alternative energy sources now. Wind energy is not the only solution to our energy needs. Neither is generating power from the ocean. But investing in research and development in a variety of different sustainable energy sources will lead us on our 
   path to energy independence. But having a dedicated renewable energy reserve to fund this research and development is an important step. 
   Many of my constituents have written to me over the past few years passionately urging us in Congress to reverse our energy policy. Just last Friday, I received an email from a constituent of mine in Lawrenceville, New Jersey. She said ``Please help turn the tide by doing not a little, but a lot, to help solar, wind, and hydrogen [power] become the mainstream energy source[s]--and turn oil into the ``alternative''.'' She is right. We must do something drastic to change our energy policy and put our country back on a rational energy path. Making advancements in sustainable energy sources is a major component of where our energy policy should be. 
   Of course, this bill is not enough. But it is a start, and a very good start. Once we pass this bill, we will be able to consider other alternative energy legislation and I am confident that we will. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bill. 
   I'm pleased that for the second year in a row, the 110th Congress is providing the funding necessary to meet the housing requirements of our servicemembers and their families, as well as the money needed to care for our veterans. 
   Let me begin by thanking Chairman Edwards for including report language directing the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs to develop a plan to care for the veterans and military retirees in my district who would need health care services if Fort Monmouth's Patterson Army Health Clinic were to close in 2011. While I continue to oppose the decision to close Fort Monmouth and will continue to look for ways to reverse it, that decision is, for now, the law of the land. Accordingly, it is necessary to plan for meeting the medical needs of the many veterans and TRICARE beneficiaries in Central New Jersey in the event Fort Monmouth's medical facilities are closed. I'm pleased that the Committee is requiring that a report on how their needs will be met be delivered to Congress no later than January 30, 2009. 
   Overall, this bill would provide $40.7 billion for VA health programs, which is $3.1 billion over the current level. In addition to continuing to focus on providing adequate funding to treat veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, and traumatic brain injury, TBI, this bill would provide $400 million that was not requested by the President to start enrolling 10 percent of Priority 8 veterans in the VA medical system. The Priority 8 category is reserved for veterans whose injuries currently are not rated as service related and whose incomes are more than $24,644 if single or $29,576 for a veteran with a dependent. An estimated one half of all uninsured veterans are Priority 8, and Priority 8 veterans have not been enrolled since 2003 as part of an Administration effort to cut costs. 
   The bill also includes $200 million, which was not requested by the President, to improve access to care where Veterans Health Administration, VHA, services are not available. I am hopeful that this will assist both rural veterans seeking care and those living in urban or ex-urban communities that currently lack ready access to a VA community-based outpatient clinic. 
   The bill would provide $1.6 billion, $250 million more than last year, to provide veterans with more technologically advanced prostheses. The VA has a long and generally commendable track record in this area. However, I am pleased the committee recognizes the need for the VA to apply a greater emphasis on harnessing the latest technological breakthroughs to help give our wounded veterans the maximum possible personal mobility. 
   I am also grateful to the committee for providing $165 million for grants to States for the construction and renovation of extended care facilities. The President's proposed $80 million  cut to this account was, frankly, unconscionable. The VA grant program that serves the State-run extended care facilities is critical. Many New Jersey veterans have visited with me over the past several years and described in detail the kinds of air conditioning, heating, and other upgrades that are vital to facilities such as the one in Paramus, New Jersey. I consistently have supported proper funding for this account, and I thank the committee for meeting this important need. 
   Finally, for our active duty community, this bill would provide $336 million that President Bush failed to request to continue a quality of life initiative for troops and their families started in the Fiscal Year 2008 Supplemental Appropriations Act, H.R. 2642. The bill includes nearly $200 million for the Army and Marine Corps to improve the barracks that soldiers and Marines live in when they train. It also includes $136 million for medical military construction and planning activities to upgrade substandard medical treatment facilities. We have all seen the pictures and heard the stories about substandard living conditions for troops. I am pleased that the committee remains focused on fixing this problem as quickly as possible. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is a good bill that will help our active duty families and our veterans. I will vote for it and I urge my colleagues to do likewise.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for this time. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2016, the National Landscape Conservation System Act. 
   Think about it. Ranging from the awe-inspiring volcanic landscape of the craters of the Moon National Monument in Idaho to the majestic White Mountain National Recreation Area in Alaska, the Bureau of Land Management's National Landscape Conservation System protects some of the most spectacular landscapes in America. Altogether it protects 26 million acres of America's diverse public lands from Alaskan tundra to red-rock wilderness, deep river canyons to ocean coasts, to American Indian cliff dwellings, and our Nation's oldest trails. These sites provide Americans with unique venues for recreation, for wildlife viewing, for exploring history, for scientific research, and for a wide range of traditional uses. 
   H.R. 2016 would ensure that all 800 sites that comprise the NLCS remain a cohesive and protected system for generations to come. Now, currently these are recognized only through BLM administrative regulations. There's no guarantee that these beautiful sites, that this system, will continue to exist even 5 years from now.  
   President Lyndon Johnson put it well. He said, ``If future generations are to remember us more with gratitude than sorrow, we must achieve more than just the miracles of technology. We must leave them a glimpse of the world as it was created, not just as it looked when we got through with it.'' By making the NLCS Federal statute, we will ensure that future generations will enjoy these national treasures, and I urge my colleagues to support Mr. Grijalva's legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, America begins the fifth year of war in Iraq. I am pleased that Speaker Pelosi has scheduled such a thorough debate of the most important moral and political issue of the day. The war in Iraq was misguided from the outset, even illegal, and has been mismanaged consistently ever since. 
   The resolution we have before us today puts Congress on record opposing the escalation of troops in Iraq proposed by President Bush and expressing our steadfast support for our troops. 
   Let me say at the outset that I intend to vote for this resolution. It is an important first step. The President's escalation of forces in Iraq is worse than the stay-the-course strategy so clearly rejected by Americans. If we pass this resolution, we will be doing more than repudiating the President's disastrous policy. We will for the first time be putting Congress on record in a way that will allow us to bring this war to an end for Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, U.S. Armed Forces who are serving in Iraq are heroes. They are the most finely trained and dedicated group of patriots any leader could want. But they now find themselves mired in the middle of intense violence, based on sectarian, political, social and cultural factors dating back 1,000 years. 
   The situation in Iraq cannot be solved militarily. Pretending otherwise only puts our soldiers, marines and others in greater danger. I have visited them in theater, in Iraq and other countries in the region and, yes, at Walter Reed Hospital here in Washington. 
   I have met with their families in New Jersey. The quality of these men and women, their earnest wish to serve their country makes this situation all the more tragic. 
   Mr. Speaker, they were sent to Iraq irresponsibly and in ignorance by leaders, sometimes improperly equipped, and are now asked to achieve an impossible mission. There is no way for us to resolve militarily the emerging multifaceted civil war that is engulfing Iraq. 
   When he ordered the invasion of Iraq, President Bush unleashed forces he did not understand and could not control. As the most recent National Intelligence Estimate attests: ``The term civil war does not adequately capture the complexity of the conflict in Iraq, which includes extensive Shia-on-Shia violence and al Qaeda and Sunni insurgent attacks on coalition forces and widespread criminally motivated violence.'' 
   Whenever American forces leave Iraq, there will not be a stable American-style liberal democracy. Prolonging the occupation of Iraq whose stability has only declined by any measure as our presence goes on increases the costs we incur in lives, dollars, and international prestige. 
   No one will look back and say, if only the American military stayed a little longer. No, historians will look back and ask what took Congress so long to recognize a disaster and do something about it. Extracting American troops from this quagmire will dry up support for the various insurgencies operating in Iraq, and encourage other nations to take part in the process of stabilizing the country and promote the domestic processes necessary for long-term stability. 
   Given all of those factors, the burden should not be on those who believe that American forces should be withdrawn. The burden should be on those who want to continue this endeavor to show any compelling evidence that is worth sending more Americans to kill and to be killed. 
   Sending more troops should require the same high standard of evidence that should have been met to go to war in the first place.     
   But the President and, I am sorry to say, the previous Congresses did not apply that high standard. Some of us said 4 years ago that there was not evidence sufficiently compelling to send Americans to kill and to die. After the President went to war anyway, I called for withdrawal early.  
   Now, Congress must establish standards that we failed to set, standards of intelligence and evidence, standards of diplomacy, standards of legislative oversight, so that we do not go to war or escalate wars based on ideology rather than evidence, bravado rather than humility, patriotic fervor rather than patient diplomacy. 
   Congress failed in its constitutional role to exert a check and balance on the Executive. With this resolution we begin on a new course, under new legislative leadership. We will audit the books. We will review the procedures for detaining prisoners, for engaging civilians, for conducting intelligence. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time for President Bush to catch up with the American people. The American people understand that American forces should not remain in Iraq to try to quell a civil war they cannot control. The American people understand that we must refocus our attention on our real interests. If the President did not, let us show at least that we do and pass this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (NO CHILD LEFT INSIDE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 3036, the No Child Left Inside Act of 2008. 
   Today our Nation faces a number of pressing environmental issues, including clean water, clean air, open space preservation, and the looming threat of global warming. Addressing these problems will become one of the dominant issues and challenges in the 21st century and our workforce needs the knowledge and skills to understand and address these complex environmental issues. 
   I would like to commend my colleague from Maryland, Representative John Sarbanes, for his hard work on H.R. 3036, to expand and enhance environmental education. This Federal investment in environmental education will help prepare our Nation's youth as responsible citizens who will value and protect America's resources and landscapes. Environmental education is about more than just science; these programs can be designed to have a positive effect in reading, math, and social studies. 
   Environmental education is best understood by those who have had the opportunity to touch it, breathe it, and live it. Where better to learn about the importance of our national resources than in our Nation's most special and protected places? Imagine seeing the effects of climate change firsthand at Glacier National Park rather than learning about it in the abstract in a classroom, or learning about the ecosystems in Great Swamps National Wilderness Refuge in my home State of New Jersey, or learning about the human genome project in Yellowstone where crucial breakthroughs about DNA were made. 
   As a member of the Committee on Education and Labor, I had the privilege of working on this legislation when it passed through our committee. My colleague from Indiana, Representative Mark Souder, and I successfully offered an amendment to H.R. 3036 which would allow schools and local education agencies to partner with Federal agencies, including national parks, when developing and administering their environmental programs. 
   I would like to share a letter of support from one of my constituents. John from Pennington,  New Jersey, wrote ``As parents of a 7-year-old, we see how positive is the time he spends out back building his tree fort, or playing in Curliss woods, or attending summer camp at the Watershed ..... and how often his time before the TV seems deadening by contrast.'' 
   I firmly support H.R. 3036, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Illinois. 
   Madam Speaker, as one who has taught engineers earlier in my career, I am delighted to rise in support of this legislation that will recognize National Engineers Week and, through that, highlight the contributions made to society by engineers. 
   The programs that fit under National Engineers Week are broad. They will include such activities as Introduce a Girl to Engineering that will encourage women to pursue engineering and recognize those who do. 
   Other initiatives will include competitions and online exhibits, as well as  television programs. It will highlight that engineering is critical to the security of our country, certainly through developing sustainable energy production and use, in preventing and mitigating natural and man-made disasters, and to make our world work better and to contribute to the livability of our society. 
   Now Congress can pass this legislation supporting the excellent programming of National Engineers Week. Congress can also ensure that we make the best decisions based on the best information related to science, engineering and technology, such as we used to do with the help of the Office of Technology Assessment. 
   Congress can pass legislation to ensure that students nationwide are taught technical skills, that they are taught the importance of those skills as well, and to make sure that there are no financial obstacles for individuals who seek to pursue higher education in engineering and related fields. And Congress can ensure that federally funded research and development is not neglected as we put together the budget. 
   This is good legislation that highlights important work. I am pleased to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (HIRE A VETERAN WEEK -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to thank my colleagues for allowing this bill to come to the floor. I want to thank my partner in the bill, Mr. Brown of South Carolina, for his work and support on the measure, and also the chairman and ranking members of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee and the Armed Services Committee. 
   The bill calls upon the President to establish a permanent ``Hire a Veteran Week'' to help promote employment of veterans in a more concentrated fashion. Last year the House passed this bill by a voice vote. The bill enjoyed overwhelming support on both sides of the aisle because all of us understood that we had a lot more to do to help our veterans find jobs, start businesses on their own and get ahead as employees; and we still do have much more to do. I am grateful that the House leadership has allowed this bill to come forward today. 
   One of the reasons I am glad we are doing this is, we need to change the paradigm of how we think about veterans. Too often we spend a couple of days a year, Memorial Day, Veterans Day, thinking about veterans. But for too many Americans, these have simply become additional days to go shopping instead of recognizing the courage, the service, the sacrifice of those who have worn the uniform of our Nation, and that needs to change. 
   Since September 11, 2001, America has been creating the largest new pool of veterans since the Vietnam era. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have passed through Iraq and Afghanistan, including tens of thousands in our Guard and Reserve. All of these veterans are returning home and many, many of them, need help in obtaining and sustaining employment. 
   The most basic thing we can do is remind employers on a regular basis that veterans make great employees. It is not just that we owe it to them, although we do. It is not just that it is a matter of fairness, although it is. It is also that they are good workers with real, very real, life experience. 
   Some companies are making an effort to do this. One of them, in my district, Facile Corporation, has offices at Fort Monmouth, also in Camden, Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Washington, Arlington, Colorado Springs and in, Madam Speaker, the State of California as well. Facile is a diversified company providing a range of services to military and civilian clients, information technology services and so forth. 
   But what makes this company special for me is the fact that 26 percent of its workforce nationwide is comprised of veterans. This didn't just happen. The employer made a conscious and conscientious effort to do so, to hire these veterans. 
   Last November, just before Veterans Day, I had the privilege of meeting with employees of Facile and learning how this effort to hire veterans truly was a win/win proposition for the company and for the veterans. I came away more convinced than ever that we need to institutionalize that kind of outreach, which is why I am proud to cosponsor this bill with a number of other colleagues here.     
   We face many difficult days ahead. Those wearing the uniform of the United States, the various uniforms who are serving in harm's way to defend us, face many difficult days ahead. They should not face more difficulties when they come home. One thing we can all agree on is that we need to give our veterans every opportunity to achieve the American Dream. That is the point of this legislation, to create the Hire a Veteran Week and to encourage the President to support the goal of Hire a Veteran Week. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Madam Speaker, I thank those who have spoken today. I, too, thank the staff of the majority and minority on the Veterans' Committee for preparing this legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, our veterans returning from Afghanistan and Iraq will require a range of services and assistance in making the transition back to civilian life. We will take up many issues related to those veterans. We will take up issues of war and peace here on the floor. 
   In the meantime, we should remind all employers, both in the government sector and in the private sector that hiring veterans is a smart choice. Their discipline, their work ethic, their prior service to our Nation make them excellent employees. I know. I have a couple working for me. They are superb. 
   We should pass this legislation for Hire a Veteran Week because we owe it to those who have borne the battle. We owe it to our country. Employers owe it to their stockholders and their clients and their customers, and they owe it to themselves. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that I hope will become a reality soon so that we will have a Hire a Veteran Week in America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 24, which will reestablish the House Democracy Assistance Commission for the 110th Congress. 
   I was honored to be appointed by Speaker PELOSI to serve as a member of the House Democracy Assistance Commission during the last Congress, and I am proud of the accomplishments that were made by the Commission. I want to commend Representative DAVID DREIER and Representative DAVID PRICE who worked tirelessly during the 109th Congress to fulfill the mission of the Commission, and John Lis who worked tirelessly as the Commissions Staff Director. 
   The HDAC built upon Congress's long history of helping emerging democracies around the globe. Many of my colleagues will remember the informal Frost-Solomon Task Force which worked during the early 1990's to provide invaluable technical assistance and equipment to Albania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Poland and Russia. When the HDAC was created, former Congressman Frost commented that the work of the Commission, ``means a great deal to members of foreign parliaments because it demonstrates that elected leaders in the United States care about what happens in their country.'' The work of this Commission may not be noticed by many of our colleagues or even our constituents, but it is vitally important to support and strengthen parliaments of new democracies around the world 
   In 2006, the commission was active in Afghanistan, East Timor, Georgia, Indonesia, Kenya, Lebanon, and Macedonia. I was glad to join the House Democracy Assistance Commission delegation to Lebanon and Kenya. During the trip, the delegation met with our counterparts in the Lebanese National Assembly and the National Assembly of Kenya. In Kenya, the delegation visited the Kimana Health Center and the Sinet water project, both of which were then dedicated in honor of Representative DAVID DREIER and DAVID PRICE, respectively. 
   The final leg of this trip was to a meeting with Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. Liberia is home to the first female head of state in all of Africa and is a country founded by freed American slaves, it is essential that the United States remain actively engaged in helping to build Liberia's fledgling democracy. 
   Madam Speaker, the House Democracy Assistance Commission has only begun its important work. With the approval of this resolution, the Commission will be able to continue to spread its good work with an ever expanding list of partner countries.

   Madam Speaker, we have heard about the numerous obstacles that Dr. Julian faced, no public high schools for African-Americans in Montgomery, so he had to go as a subfreshman to DePauw University, but his skill, his intelligence, allowed him to thrive there against the adversity. We have heard that a research job fell through because African-Americans were not allowed to stay overnight in a town in Wisconsin where he was going for that work. 
   We have heard about his contributions: fire retardants, treatments for glaucoma, a low-cost process to produce cortisone. That brings us up to today, why we are talking about this. Of course, we want to honor and recognize someone of such skill and such perseverance, but we want to highlight it for a reason, and that reason is that even today we are excluding people whose talents we need. 
   African-Americans constitute 14 percent or so of the U.S. population, but receive fewer than 4 percent of the doctorates awarded in chemistry and chemical engineering; hold about 1 percent, one out of 100 chemistry faculty positions in the top universities. These distressing numbers are not just an indication of unfairness. They are an indication of the loss of talent, the loss of creativity, that we need in our society. So this is not just to extol the accomplishments of Percy Julian, but to remind us that we have to make way for these talented individuals in our society today.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (NATIONAL SECURITY FOREIGN INVESTMENT REFORM AND STRENGTHENED TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased that the House is considering this measure today, and I intend to vote for it. 
   According to the Congressional Research Service, in 2005, direct foreign investment in the U.S. totaled some $109 billion. By year-end 2004, the latest year for which detailed data are available, foreign firms employed 5.6 million Americans (just under 4% of the U.S. civilian labor force) and owned over 30 thousand individual business establishments. While the impact of foreign investment on our economy is generally positive, last year we saw how inadequate monitoring of the foreign investment process can produce threats to our security. 
   It was just over a year ago that we learned from media reports that the Bush administration had quietly approved the sale of an American port operations company to Dubai Ports World (DPW), an entity owned by the government of the United Arab Emirates. The deal was approved by a little-known government entity, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS for short. CFIUS was created by President Ford in 1975 via executive order in response to Congressional concerns over OPEC's investment activities in the United States. 
   In the DPW case, we subsequently learned that at least some elements of the intelligence community had expressed concerns about the security implications of the DPW transaction. In Congress, we were concerned that CFIUS had ignored or downplayed any potential security issues surrounding the transaction. We were told that DPW is well run and efficient. That may be, but there was good reason for concern. 
   The UAE, which owned and controlled the acquiring company in this case, had previously been identified as a key transfer point for shipments of nuclear components that were sent to Iran, North Korea, and Libya, which were sold by Pakistan's nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan. In addition, the UAE was one of only 3 countries (including Pakistan and Saudi Arabia) to recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan prior to 9/11. Two of the 9/11 hijackers were UAE nationals (Fayez Banihamrnad and Marwan al-Shehhi), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation had previously claimed the money used for the attacks was  transferred to the 9/11 hijackers primarily through the UAE's banking system. Furthermore, after the 9/11 attacks, the Department of Commerce complained of a lack of cooperation by the UAE and other Arab countries as the U.S. was trying to track down Osama bin Laden's bank accounts. 
   The Bush administration initially denied there were any such security concerns surrounding the DPW deal, so I worked to get a portion of the United States Coast Guard intelligence estimate declassified so the public would know the truth. The Coast Guard finally provided me with the declassified executive summary on May 25, 2006, and I want to make sure my colleagues and the public are aware of what this assessment says. 
   While the USCG assessment stated that the DPW deal posed no ``immediate'' threat to the United States, it also stated that the deal ``could also provide a potential vector for Dubai-based terrorists to enter the United States, exploiting the port facilities in the same way that other terrorists have exploited individual shipping companies.'' 
   I note for the record that I spent three months pressing Coast Guard officials to declassify this single page. Congress should not have to haggle with the executive branch to get intelligence assessments on potential security threats to our people in a manner that protects intelligence sources and methods. The bill before us contains changes in the law governing CFIUS that should help prevent a repeat of the Dubai Ports World fiasco, particularly with regards to intelligence assessments and Congressional notification. 
   Specifically, the bill before us requires a mandatory 45-day investigation for all acquisitions involving foreign governments, to include a requirement that the Director of National Intelligence play a direct role in evaluating the national security implications of such acquisitions. The bill also requires automatic notification of Congress within five days after the conclusion of each investigation. Finally, the bill requires the Secretaries or Deputy Secretaries of the Departments of Treasury and Homeland Security to personally approve such transactions. These are common sense reforms of the CFIUS process that are long overdue, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (RESPONSIBLE FEDERAL OIL AND GAS LEASE ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6251, the Responsible Federal Oil and Gas Lease Act. 
   Over the last few months we have frequently heard claims from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle that we need to open up more Federal lands to oil and gas drilling, the magic bullet that will solve our energy crisis. They have told the American people that Democrats and environmentalists are protecting our Nation's most sensitive and special environments at the expense of the American people. They have claimed that opening up land in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) would quickly help bring down the price of gas. Not only are these claims misleading American families desperately seeking help with skyrocketing gas prices, they are completely false. 
   Currently 81 percent of our Nation's Federal lands are available to be leased for the purpose of oil and gas drilling. Sixty-eight million acres of the lands open for drilling both onshore and offshore currently are leased by oil companies who are not using them for production. It is estimated that these leased but unused lands could produce an additional 4.8 million barrels of oil and 44.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas each day, nearly doubling U.S. oil production and cutting oil imports by a third. Existing leases can also come online much faster than any newly leased lands, which would save only pennies per gallon, more than a decade down the road. 
   I would like to commend my colleague from West Virginia, Representative Nick Rahall, for introducing H.R. 6251, the Responsible Federal Oil and Gas Lease Act. This legislation would require oil companies to certify to the Department of the Interior that they are actively developing on the lands that they have already leased. If these oil companies are not producing on these lands, they either would have to relinquish these leases or start producing on them before they could apply to lease additional lands. Also my colleagues who say ``drill, drill, drill'' should support this legislation and they should stop talking about drilling on our environmentally sensitive coastlines and wildlife refuges until oil companies have gone as far as they can towards on these currently leased lands. 
   This legislation is common sense and I urge my colleagues to support it. There is no logic to opening up more land to oil and gas drilling when we are not utilizing the leases we already have. Of course this legislation is not a long term solution to America's energy needs. Currently we produce 3 percent of the world's oil and consume 25 percent. Unless we find a way to dramatically reduce our consumption we will never be able to drill our way to energy independence. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to develop a long term solution to this crisis.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6377, the Energy Markets Emergency Act of 2008. 
   This bill is an important first step in reaffirming the authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to regulate excessive speculation in the energy futures market. There are many reasons that the cost of a barrel of oil has risen so dramatically in the last few years, including increased demand from developing nations, instability in oil-producing nations, the weakening of the dollar, and price gouging on the part of the oil companies. The recent surge in gasoline prices should serve as an urgent reminder that we immediately need to change the way that we produce and use energy. 
   Nonetheless, consumers should not suffer unnecessary increases in gasoline prices that don't reflect actual changes in supply and demand. I have heard from economists that excessive speculation has added anywhere between $20 and $60 to the price of a barrel of oil. The Bush administration has an appalling record on oversight, and they have allowed the CFTC to become powerless to regulate the commodities market. The CFTC has emergency powers at its disposal, and this bill mandates the use of this authority. In addition to curbing speculation, the CFTC must prohibit the outright fraud and abuse currently being perpetrated on the market. 
   Closing the loopholes that have allowed dark energy markets to flourish is just one step toward addressing our current energy crisis. I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 6052, the Savings Energy Through Public Transportation Act of 2008, H.R. 6052. 
   As gas prices continue to skyrocket to over $4 a gallon, commuters are increasingly abandoning their automobiles in favor of public transportation. New Jersey's public transit agency, NJ Transit, is breaking ridership records for the sixth consecutive year, with over 900,000 trips per weekday on its trains, buses, and light-rail vehicles. In the first 3 months of this year, public transit trips nationwide increased by 85 million over last year's numbers. Amtrak set record highs for its service with over 25 million users last year. This increase in use not only takes cars off our overburdened roadways, it conserves energy, decreases our greenhouse gas emissions, and helps our economy. 
   However, mass transit agencies are also suffering from soaring gas prices, increased demand for their services, and decreased operating budgets. Transit agencies are paying 44 percent more for diesel fuel than they were at the beginning of this year, and almost half of bus operators and more than two-thirds of rail operators have increased their fares. 
   The Saving Energy Through Public Transportation Act of 2008 would help State and local mass transit authorities meet the increase in demand and allow them to provide a cost-effective alternative to driving. This legislation would authorize $1.7 billion in grants for mass transit agencies to upgrade and expand their transit services without having to further increase their fares. 
   By taking public transportation the average American household could save $6,251 and help reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 4,800 pounds per year. However, commuters need affordable, reliable access to public transportation if they are to utilize these benefits. This bill would help make public transit more available to commuters, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, as a strong supporter of inclusive ENDA that provides employment protections for sexual orientation as well as gender identity, I am an original cosponsor of the original ENDA that was introduced earlier this year, the legislation we should be taking up today. 
   In my home State of New Jersey, we are proud to have a fully inclusive employment nondiscrimination law. We are proud of the New Jersey-based businesses that have corporate policies against discrimination based on gender identity, in addition to sexual orientation. Companies such as Johnson & Johnson, Merck and Prudential Financial prohibit employment discrimination based on gender identity, not only because they believe it's the right thing to do morally and ethically, but also they know it's a matter of corporate competitiveness and good for their companies. 
   Mr. Speaker, our distinguished colleague JOHN LEWIS often reminds us of the words of Dr. King, ``The time is always right to do the right thing.'' Dr. King warned us against the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. I am concerned that when we break apart legislation, some pieces fall on the floor to get swept into the dustbin of history or to be considered only years later. We should not do this to members of our society who need and deserve the same protections as all other Americans. 
   I want to thank the members of Garden State Equality, New Jersey Stonewall Democrats, the New Jersey Lesbian and Gay Coalition for their hard work and tireless efforts for inclusive protections. I ask to include in the Record a letter from Johnson & Johnson Company supporting an inclusive ENDA bill and a copy of the statement of dissent by Representatives CLARKE, KUCINICH, SANCHEZ and me in the committee markup of this legislation.

Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend Mr. Inslee from the State of Washington, and I would add that we believe that the Department of Energy should consider both conventional hydropower energy provided through dams, as well as hydropower through the movement of waves, tides, and currents in the oceans and free flowing rivers, lakes and streams. Each of these forms of hydropower holds the potential to improve greatly the way we generate energy. 
   We're pleased that the Appropriations Committee has recommended that the Department of Energy use some of this funding for nonimpounded marine renewable technologies, and we think it's important for the subcommittee to continue to provide oversight of the Department of Energy in support of this form of sustainable energy research.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, I rise today in reluctant support of H.R. 1424, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. 
   My constituents are angry and I am too that we let our economy get to this point. The speculation and greed of Wall Street in recent years--coupled with years of failures, excesses, arrogance, and irresponsibility of the regulatory agents, Treasury and other Cabinet Departments, the White House and even some in Congress--has resulted in the meltdown of our Nation's financial and credit markets. 
   Many have passionately called for rejection of this compromise bill sent to us by the Senate following the rejection of the House bill earlier this week. There is a temptation for me to vote ``no.'' We could teach a lesson to Wall Street highflyers. We could teach a lesson to Secretary Paulson, President Bush, and the regulatory agencies. We could teach a lesson to the mortgage companies who entice borrowers to get over their heads. We could teach the Senators a lesson not to attach extraneous things to a financial bill. We could let the credit markets freeze up. We could let small businesses fail to meet next week's payroll. We could let college students drop out because they can't pay tuition. We could leave farmers, homeowners, and factories out in the cold. Would that teach the right lesson to the right people? I don't think so. 
   Market turmoil is affecting more than the 78,000 New Jerseyans who work on Wall Street and the 266,200 New Jerseyans who work in the financial services sector throughout the State. There are thousands of my constituents who are not traders or high powered executives but still work in impacted industries. If left unchecked the credit crisis will hurt all of New Jersey, painfully affecting New Jerseyans from factory to financial district from farm to pharma. Furthermore, millions of Americans who have retired or are nearing retirement have seen their value of their pensions shrink. If day-to-day credit tightens up, Americans will not be able to get loans for college, cars, or a new furnace for the corner store. We need to act to ensure that retirement funds and pension plans are not devastated by investments that have lost value in a jittery market. Indeed we must act--we must stand behind our institutions, restore confidence in our markets, and protect millions of Americans who would be affected by a continuing collapse. That said, this bill is only one way to do that, and not the best way. I have worked with my colleagues to improve this bill, and I believe these improvements are sufficient to make the bill worth approving. 
   There is much that should have been done and must still be done fix the problems in federal financial oversight agencies. The Treasury Department should have exercised its authority to oversee the mortgage markets. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FDIC, should have raised the insurance limit on deposits, which has not been raised for 28 years, and created a net worth certificate program similar to the one that helped shore up banks in the 1980s. The Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, should have 
   prohibited short selling especially, naked short selling. It should have changed the mark-to-market rule that forces banks' assets to be valued not at their long term worth but at what they would be sold--if only they could be sold--for on market today. Alan Greenspan, the Chair of the Federal Reserve, should have followed the instructions of Congress in 1994 to regulate the mortgage market. Greenspan failed to act to institute oversight for years and years and when succeeding Chairman Bernanke finally recognized the need to act it was years too late. Had the Treasury Department, FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and SEC acted we would not be in this mess today. The  Democratic Congress has tried to set this right several times. However, we failed to convince the administration to do what was right. Recently I have joined my colleagues in introducing legislation requiring the Treasury Department, FDIC, and SEC to take these actions and it is my hope that they will use their existing authority to undertake these common sense measures. Indeed some of those recommendations are included in this final version of the bill that is before us today. 
   After careful and thoughtful review, I support the bill before us today because this legislation will help to mitigate this financial crisis, restore confidence in our financial institutions, and bring much needed liquidity to our marketplace. This bill is not, as so many of my colleagues have said on the floor today, a bailout that will save the fat cats on Wall Street. Had we accepted Secretary Paulson's original proposal that is exactly what it would have been. If the President had his way, he would have ridden a wave of fear and railroaded Congress into passing Secretary Paulson's original 3-page proposal asking for $700 billion--with no oversight--to bail out the financial services agencies. I did not support the original plan. The bill before us is a significant improvement to the original Bush-Paulson plan. While I believe that every Member of this body has what they think are better ideas how to fix the problem, no one has 218 votes for his or her plan. This is the plan we have. Legislative compromise is rarely pretty to watch. 
   This legislation includes protections to ensure that the taxpayers' money is not wasted. Only half of the authorized $700 billion would initially be available to the Treasury Department. A strict oversight board would be created to monitor how these funds are being used and the effect it has on the economy, and to advise the Secretary of the Treasury Department on how these funds are used. Congress and the President would have to approve the release of the next $350 billion if it is needed. This legislation would require the Treasury Department to implement a plan to mitigate foreclosures and to encourage lenders to modify loans and mortgages to prevent foreclosures and keep people in their homes. The bill also helps save small businesses that need credit by allowing small community banks to deduct losses from investments in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stocks. It will shore up banks by increasing FDIC insurance to $250,000 and prevent runs on banks. Finally, we can expect that taxpayers will recoup most of the money spent on this proposal through the equity they will hold in companies helped by this proposal. The total cost will be much, much less than $700 billion. 
   This legislation also extends a needed tax relief which, unless extended, would expire at the end of the year. It will provide a one year patch that will prevent 88,000 New Jerseyans from getting hit by the Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT, this year. It will 
   retain and create half a million jobs and strengthen our economy by extending the renewable energy tax credits. It will extend essential tax cuts for American families helping 4.5 million Americans afford college by extending the tuition deduction, and extending the child tax credit. It will extend for 1 year my initiative that allows a property tax deduction for taxpayers who do not itemize on their tax returns of $500 for single filers and $1,000 deduction for joint filers. The legislation helps American small businesses by extending the R&D tax credit and the new markets tax credit. It will also require mental health parity in employer-based insurance and end discrimination against patients seeking treatment for mental illness, an initiative that I have been working on since I was elected to Congress. These extraneous tax provisions should not have been added by the Senate. Nonetheless, most of the tax cuts in this bill have been passed by the House several times and are not ``pork.'' In fact they are the same tax benefits that are currently in effect and that this body has passed several times. 
   I do not deny that there are provisions in this bill that do not belong. In fact, the provisions decreasing the excise tax on Puerto Rican rum as well as the decrease in the excise tax on wooden arrows are egregious. There should not be a tax deduction for movie and television producers. Nor should this legislation encourage the production of dirty fuels like coal to liquids and oil shale. I cannot justify these provisions, but I will not vote against teachers being able to get a tax deduction for buying supplies for their students, against the solar tax credit which has helped New Jersey become one of the nation's leaders in solar energy production, or against incentives for businesses and individuals to donate items to schools. 
   We can expect that H.R. 1424 will help American families by loosening the credit market. However, if we do not address the origins of this problem we will be forced to come back again to address the symptoms. The root of this problem is that bad mortgages, when mixed with the good mortgages, have poisoned the financial papers. We need to help Americans saddled with these bad mortgages. It is estimated that a million currently solvent mortgages will turn toxic by next year and further destabilize our financial institutions. It is our responsibility to prevent this from happening. Doing so would benefit the homeowners, the neighborhoods, the towns, and the investors in the financial district. 
   I suggest that we consider a model that has been proven to help the homeowner, the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, HOLC. The Home Owners' Loan Corporation of the 1930's through the 1950's helped people with their mortgages. It was a Federal program that shored up a collapsing market and rescued a million homeowners. Incidentally, when it finally went out of business, it showed a net plus for the taxpayer. I will be introducing legislation which would create such a program. Indeed, that legislation should have been used instead of the Paulson-Bush approach. 
   I believe that Congress should come back into session after the November elections to pass such a bill and to take up an economic stimulus package that will help those suffering on Main Street. It is deeply concerning to me and infuriating to our constituents that as we have focused on the crisis on Wall Street we have not paid comparable attention to American families that have been struggling for months. The unemployment rate has been steadily increasing, reaching 6.1 percent this month, the highest level since 1992. This year, 605,000 Americans have lost their jobs. Employed Americans are continuing to struggle with increasing energy and food costs and decreasing wages. Many are at risk of losing their pensions due to bad decisions made by Wall Street. We must deal with the bad mortgages. People want to punish those who behaved recklessly. There may be actual legal action. That may provide some satisfaction, but without today's bill it would not address the crisis of confidence, it would not help the people who are about to be hurt financially. We must deal with the long term problems: problems of bond traders wheeling and dealing in paper with no thought of the homes, factories and people behind these bonds; problems of some employers who show no allegiance to their workers; problems of families who in good times consume more than they save; problems of regulatory agencies that revel in the unrestrained trading. We should not wait for a new administration to help Americans who are suffering from this economic downturn and I urge my colleagues to reconvene Congress after the elections to address our Nation's pressing economic concerns.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. Andrews. 
   Mr. Speaker, it will be a landmark day when we realize that health is not just about fixing broken bones. It's about having a healthy, complete individual from head to toe. 
   Today the House takes an important step to require mental health parity in insurance, and I particularly want to thank and recognize Patrick Kennedy and Jim Ramstad, and the late Paul and Sheila Wellstone. 
   Mr. Speaker, millions of Americans suffer from mental illness of some form. Few Americans are untouched and no one is immune. 
   Some of my colleagues have expressed their concern about the cost of providing mental health parity; yet an analysis of the bill indicates that it would result in an increase of less than 1 percent in premiums and would reduce out-of-pocket costs by about 18 percent. Further, according to a recent article in the Journal of the American Medical Association, employers who actively encourage their employees to use mental health services actually experience better health outcomes and, I want to emphasize this, increases in hours worked and productivity gained. 
   I include in the Record an editorial from the Journal of the American Medical Association from last September of 2007 dealing with the treatment of depression. 
   Reducing the Burden of Depression--Building Villages for Coordinated Care  
   In this issue of JAMA, Wang et al provide evidence that implementing depression care programs through employer-sponsored managed behavioral health can improve clinical outcomes, job retention, and effective hours worked compared with usual care. The programs encouraged depressed workers to learn about and use evidence-based depression treatments, supported clinicians in following practice guidelines, and offered telephone counseling and self-help workbooks. The monetary value of the increased work time under the program exceeded the direct intervention costs and likely exceeded or was within the range of cost increases due to greater mental health specialty use under the intervention. While formal estimates of cost-effectiveness and employer return on investment are pending, it appears to be in the business interests of many employers to implement such programs to protect their investments in the retention and productivity of workers they have hired and trained. 
   These findings should be evaluated within the context of the simple but startling facts about depression. Clinical depressive disorders are among the most prevalent of major medical conditions, affecting about 16% of adults in their lifetime. Owing to high prevalence, early age at onset (unlike other debilitating disorders that occur past the age of parenting and work responsibilities), and strong impact on functional status, depressive disorders are leading contributors to disability worldwide. Depressive disorders are highly treatable yet often remain unrecognized and untreated. While a number of effective programs promote higher use of treatments in service delivery settings, particularly primary care practices, these programs are not yet widely implemented. Thus, technology is available to treat this disabling condition, but US health care systems have failed to take full advantage of the technology to reduce personal or societal consequences of depression. 
   The intervention approach in the study by Wang et al can be characterized as ``building a village'' of health plans, clinicians, and resources that ``surround'' depressed persons with opportunities to learn about and engage in evidence-based care, attending to a careful fit of intervention requirements and context-specific implementation options. This approach has generally proven effective in primary care, and the substantial outreach efforts mirror those in the WE Care study demonstrating that depression treatments are effective for low-income and minority women. In the study by Wang et al telephone managers from the behavioral health company offered counseling and communicated recommendations to clinicians, an extension of their usual role. In the Partners in Care study, primary care nurses expanded their disease management skills to include assessment, education, and follow-up concerning depression. In both studies, patients and clinicians were free to use or not use study resources according to their preferences. Such interventions have the advantage of preserving the naturalistic context of the delivery systems, potentially facilitating the translation of findings into change by example. Interventions in both studies achieved roughly similar outcomes: a 10 percentage-point gain in use of appropriate treatment and in recovery from depression over a year, as well as roughly 2 more weeks of days worked in a year in the study by Wang et al and a month more of days worked over 2 years in Partners in Care. 
   Depression interventions have many advantages for individuals, their family and friends, employers and society, over and above relief of individual symptoms. As mothers' depression improves following care, for example, their children also enjoy improvements in mental health. The study by Wang et al demonstrates that treatment of depression increases productivity and may reduce economic losses due to depression for employees and employers. If such gains exceed costs of providing the interventions and treatments, there is ``money on the table'' across stakeholders that could be used to pay for interventions. Why then do many individuals with depression endure their illness without care? 
   One barrier to care is that depression affects motivation and cognition, making it difficult for many individuals with depression to realize they have a need and obtain care without the outreach provided by nurse/care managers. Family members also may fail to identify depression or have knowledge about appropriate care. This suggests that opportunities to improve access to depression care should be embedded within an infrastructure available to potentially depressed persons, such as primary care settings. However, an awareness of the effects of treatment on social costs such as productivity may not provide a strong incentive for clinicians and health plans to improve care, as they do not necessarily face immediate financial consequences from patients' changes in productivity or may not track this outcome. Yet most private health care in the United States is financed through employer-sponsored insurance. Direct contributions to the bottom line of employers offers them an incentive to promote depression care, independent of policy mandates or other motives such as responding to employee demand. 
   Other stakeholders, including policy makers and the public, may benefit from improved depression care through an increased tax base from employees who work more or an overall improved economy. Yet it is challenging in the US policy environment to use economic gains from one policy sector such as the labor market as leverage to support improved health care, However some policy changes could be implemented to better align the incentives to implement depression care programs across diverse stakeholders and to avoid undermining the goals of such programs, for example by excluding depression treatment from health insurance coverage when changing jobs or insurance based on a recent history of depression treatment in an employer-based depression program. Under such an ill-advised policy, the risk of losing coverage would serve as a major deterrent to seeking care. 
   The need to coordinate program implementation and policy suggests an expanded concept of ``a village,'' that includes not only wrap-around interventions but coordinated efforts across affected stakeholders. It may be trite that the stakeholder with the most power to influence services delivery for most Americans is the employer, but broader and deeper change in access to depression care may yet require a concerted effort among affected parties to yield prograns that address public and self-stigma and to provide access to depression treatments under policies that  facilitate use of such programs and do not penalize individuals for using them. Studies such as that by Wang et al strongly support such integrated solutions. 
   Exactly how programs to improve depression care are implemented may affect the distribution of benefits--an important issue given evidence of disparities in quality of depression care and the potential for practice-based programs to overcome disparities in depression outcomes. Developers of interventions and policies should consider implications of their design for inclusion of underserved groups who may not seek behavioral health care. Despite the extensive efforts by Wang et al to reach general employees, the majority of persons had already inquired about outpatient care. Learning how to optimize personal and societal gains by improving access to quality depression care across diverse communities through employer, practice, and community-based programs and policy changes is a next agenda for evidence-based action. As a community participant in the Witness for Wellness program recently stated: ``Depression is everybody's business.''  
   Now, ultimately, despite the economic arguments in favor of parity, it is not a debate about dollars and cents but about lives saved and people restored. Let's work to ensure that those who need access to mental health will get it.

   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, it will be a landmark day when we realize that health is not just about fixing broken bones. It's about having a healthy, complete individual from head to toe. Millions of Americans suffer from mental illness of some form, conditions that disrupt a person's thinking, feeling, mood, ability to relate to others, and daily functioning. Mental illnesses strain families and can contribute to lost productivity, unemployment, substance abuse, homelessness, or suicide. Few Americans are untouched by it. No one is immune. 
   Prompt and comprehensive treatment can reduce enormously these effects, but insurance companies--including government plans like Medicare, Medicaid, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP)--frequently impose limits on coverage for mental health that are not imposed on traditional medical and surgical care. Already this year, Congress has worked to address these inequalities in the federal health programs. 
   Today, the House of Representatives is taking a significant step toward finally ending the insurance discrimination that has existed for decades against people with mental illness. 
   Representative PATRICK KENNEDY and Representative JIM RAMSTAD deserve credit for their strong leadership on the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act, H.R. 1424, which I am proud to cosponsor along with more than 270 of my colleagues. This much needed legislation would require insurance companies to provide benefits for mental health and substance abuse treatment equal to those provided for physical medical treatment. 
   The Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act would require that all Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, DSM-IV, illnesses be covered, rather than letting insurance companies determine their own scope of coverage. This is the same coverage requirements that we as Members of Congress receive under our federal employee health plan, and our constituents deserve no less coverage. 
   The American Psychological Association, which publishes DSM-IV, reports that lack of insurance coverage (87 percent) and cost (81 percent) are the leading factors for individuals not seeking mental health services. The Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act would solve both of these problems. 
   Additionally, unlike the bill working through the Senate, H.R. 1424 would not preempt state law. This is very important for the residents of my home state of New Jersey and others who already have mental health parity laws on the books. For good reason these states worry that they might be forced to reduce their coverage requirements. 
   We know that mental illness is treatable, yet because one third of the people affected do not receive needed treatments, mental illness remains a leading cause of disability and premature death. According to the World Health Organization, the costs related to untreated mental illness are $147 billion each year in the United States. Those who oppose the legislation thinking it is too expensive should note this cost. 
   Yet, an analysis of the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act indicates it would result in an increase of less than one percent premiums and would reduce out-of-pocket costs by 18 percent. Further, a recent article in the Journal of American Medical Association, JAMA, indicates that employers who actively encourage their employees to use mental health services actually experienced an increase in hours worked and productivity gains. 
   Ultimately, despite the economic arguments in favor of parity, it is not a debate about dollars and cents, but about lives saved and people restored. I recently received a letter from a constituent who is a corporate human resource director. She did not write me in that capacity, however. Instead, she wrote me ``as the sister of a beloved brother who committed suicide one day after his in-patient mental health care benefit `ran-out'.'' She understood and related to me not only the human resources concerns, but also and especially, the true cost of mental health and the failure to enact mental health parity. Let's work to ensure that those who need access to mental health care, get it.

   Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, so far this primary season elections have been conducted in 14 States that still use unauditable voting machines, purely electronic. I have shared in letters to my colleagues information about incidents in a number of States, one where 90 percent of the machines were not functioning in one county when the polls opened; and another State, where results from the internal paper tapes did not match results on the corresponding memory cartridges; another State, where six voting machines in a county had faulty memory cards; in a polling place in Chicago, where no touch screen machines were working; and at a polling place in Atlanta, where only one in five was working. 
   In counties where there are no paper records verified by their voters, the irregularities cannot be resolved. Machine failures elsewhere would have prevented voters from voting had back-up paper ballots not been available. Some jurisdictions where paper ballots are required allow voting data to be verified by the voters and then used to confirm the results despite the failure of electronic memory. 
   There is still time before November to secure our electoral system. The Emergency Assistance for Secure Elections Act, if enacted, will provide localities what they need to do this. Please support this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 3121, the Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2007. 
   In April of this year, severe rainstorms in New Jersey caused the Delaware River to overflow for the fourth time in the past 2 years. Each of these floods caused substantial damage to the homes and businesses of my constituents in Mercer and Hunterdon counties. After each incident I toured the affected areas and met with local officials, residents, and business owners. Two primary concerns were raised by my constituents in each of these meetings. Residents wanted to know what efforts are being made to prevent future flooding and they wanted to be assured access to the financial resources available to them. 
   The legislation before us today provides needed comprehensive flood insurance reform. It will address concerns of the residents in my Central New Jersey district by expanding, improving and reauthorizing the National Flood Insurance Program, NFIP, through 2013. The NFIP is federally backed flood insurance available for purchase to homeowners, renters and business owners in 20,000 communities across the nation. In order to be eligible, these communities are required to adopt floodplain management ordinances to reduce future flood damage. 
   H.R. 3121 will improve the NFIP by increasing and expanding access to flood insurance policies. For the first time since 1994, the bill updates maximum insurance coverage limits for residential and nonresidential properties. It will create business interruption coverage policies for business owners to better prepare them to meet payroll and other obligations after a flood occurs. Additionally, this bill makes optional coverage at actuarial rates for basement improvements and for the replacement of items damaged by flooding. It also encourages participation in the NFIP through community outreach programs. 
   This legislation will help protect consumers and ensure that homeowners who should have flood insurance have it. H.R. 3121 increases the fines on lenders who do not enforce the mandatory flood insurance policy purchase requirement for those who live in a floodplain and hold a federally-backed mortgage. It will also clarify the disclosure requirements for flood insurance availability and require plain language information on flood insurance policies. It removes the current $500,000 per apartment building insurance cap and will allow each unit in the building to be insured for its total value. It requires landlords to notify their tenants of contents coverage availability. Further, the bill makes flood insurance effective immediately upon purchase of a home. 
   Not only does this bill work to ensure that insurance coverage is available to those who need it, it will help us to find better ways to prevent flooding in the future by requiring the Federal Emergency Management Administration, FEMA, to map the 500-year floodplain. It also makes the updating and modernization of flood maps an ongoing process, and increases funding for mapping. According to the Delaware River Basin Commission which works on issues relating to the Delaware River, updated floodplain maps will allow us to better predict areas that are vulnerable to flooding and identify ways to prevent floods from happening. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3121.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT EXPANSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 3567 the Small Business Investment Expansion Act. 
   Much of the economic success that we enjoy as a Nation is the result of innovation and development by America's small business community. Almost half of Americans working in the private sector are employed by small businesses. They are responsible for over 45 percent of our national payroll and have created 60 to 80 percent of new jobs over the last 10 years. 
   Since it was created in 1953, the Small Business Administration, SBA, has played an essential role in maintaining and strengthening the Nation's economy by aiding, assisting and protecting the interests of America's small businesses. However, there is an expanding gap between the assistance that the SBA's programs are able to provide and the capital needs of small businesses. 
   The legislation before us today will help to close this gap by expanding and improving two of the SBA's most successful programs, the Small Business Investment Company and the New Markets Capital Program. As a public-private partnership the Small Business Investment Company program stimulates and supplements the flow of private equity capital and long term loan funds for the sound financing, growth, expansion and modernization of small business operations. This program was able to leverage more than $21 billion to 2,000 small businesses in the last year alone; however more could be done to improve access to this program. This legislation will expand access for early-stage and capital-intensive small businesses by simplifying how maximum leverage caps are calculated and revising the limitation on aggregate investments. H.R. 3567 will also expand access to the New Markets Venture Capital program that provides entrepreneurial expertise and equity capital to small businesses in low-income regions. This legislation not only expands the programs but provides incentives for investors to invest in small manufacturing companies. 
   Additionally, H.R. 3567 will create a new office within the SBA to help start-up of companies find investors to support them in their early stages of growth, the Office of Angel vestment. This legislation will focus on three main initiatives: providing angel groups with matching financing leverage, create a federal directory of angel investors, and funding for awareness and educational programs about angel Investment opportunities. 
   Small businesses make up the engine that drives our economy. The legislation before us today will give small businesses the tools that they need to succeed. I therefore encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES REGARDING THE TERRORIST ATTACKS LAUNCHED AGAINST THE UNITED STATES ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 -- (House of Representatives - September 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, this is the day we pause and remember those who lost their lives on that terrible day 7 years ago. We also remember the heroism of the first responders, and of those who fought back against terrorists--people like the late Todd Beamer, a resident of central New Jersey. But even as we look back in sorrow and remembrance, we must also look to the future and remember our obligation to prevent other American families from enduring a similar horror in the future. 
   We have made progress in making our country more secure since September 11,  2001. A critical piece of legislation was enacted in August 2007 to better protect Americans from terrorism and improve our security. The legislation (H.R. 1) completed the enactment of the recommendations of the bipartisan, independent 9/11 Commission into law. This law requires 100 percent screening of cargo on passenger aircraft within 3 years and 100 percent scanning of seaborne cargo before it gets to U.S. ports within 5 years, ensures that first responders can communicate with each other in an emergency, and improves rail and mass transit security. It is disgraceful that the administration has failed to implement the law, and I will certainly do my part to keep the pressure up until they fully comply. 
   On the issue of meeting post-9/11 threats, I'm pleased that this Congress has taken steps to secure our rail and transit systems. As we saw with the attacks on rail and mass transit systems in Europe and India over the last few years, transit systems are prime targets. I was pleased to lead the effort last year that secured $400 million in funding for rail and transit security grant programs--$225 million more than President Bush requested in his budget. We still have a long way to go before our rail and transit systems are as safe as they should be, but we are finally moving in the right direction. 
   Madam Speaker, I support this bill and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for it.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3997, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. 
   As we work to rescue our economy we must understand how we got to this point. The speculation and greed of Wall Street in recent years--coupled with years of failures, excesses, arrogance and irresponsibility of the Bush Administration and some in Congress--has resulted in the meltdown of our Nation's financial markets. The subprime mortgage meltdown that started a few years ago has trickled up from Main Street to decimate Wall Street. The largest financial institutions in our nation, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, have fallen into brink of bankruptcy. 
   I am voting in favor of the Financial Rescue Legislation because it is a significant improvement--by including taxpayer protections and strong oversight--over Secretary Paulson's original $700 billion proposal, and because inaction could have a devastating impact on our already unstable economy. I still will work to ensure that Congress does more to rescue our economy in the long term, sensitive to the variety of kinds of work New Jerseyans perform from factory to financial district from farm to pharma. There are thousands of my constituents who are not traders or high powered executives but still work in these impacted industries. Furthermore, millions of Americans who have retired or are nearing retirement have seen the value of their pensions shrink or dwindle away. If day to day credit tightens up, small business may not be able to make payroll and farmers may not be able to get by until the harvest is sold. We need to act to ensure that retirement funds and pension plans are not devastated by investments that have lost value in a jittery market. 
   President Bush and Secretary Paulson have told us that this rescue must be done immediately or else our fiscal house would collapse. Indeed we must act--but we must act wisely and thoughtfully to stand behind our institutions, restore confidence in our markets, and protect millions Americans who would be affected by a continuing meltdown. 
   If the President had his way again, he would have ridden a wave of fear and railroaded Congress into passing Secretary Paulson's original three-page proposal asking for $700 billion--with no oversight--to bailout the financial services agencies. I would not support the original plan, and while I have reservations of the compromise bill before us today, after careful and thoughtful review I believe it is a significant improvement to the original Bush-Paulson plan. 
   For the last 9 days the President, the leadership in both parties and Secretary Paulson worked to come up with a more palatable proposal. The over 100-page bill that this body is considering today is a far improvement over what we started with. I wish that we 
   had more time to look at this proposal closely and determine that we are using the taxpayer's money wisely. If there is one thing we in this body should know it is that acting quickly can be worse than not acting at all. However it is essential that the world know that Congress will stand behind our institutions and avoid a financial collapse. 
   There are some vast improvements over the Paulson-Bush proposal in H.R. 3997. This legislation includes taxpayer protections and does not simply hand over $700 billion to the treasury. My constituents rightly are concerned about what they would get for $700 billion. Instead this legislation would parcel out this funding in much smaller amounts so we can monitor the effect that it is having on the economy. It would release $250 billion immediately, another $100 billion if the President can certify the need for such an investment, and the final $350 billion would require the approval of Congress and the President before it would be available to the Treasury Department. It would give taxpayers a share of the assets recovered, and it is likely that we would recoup much of our investment. The CBO estimates that this bill would only truly cost $10 to $30 billion, and requires the President in 5 years to come up with legislation which would recoup funds lost from the financial industry. And it would help keep families in their homes by allowing the Government to work with loan servicers to change the terms of mortgages. 
   The bill includes strong oversight and transparency, creating an oversight board appointed by Congress and instituting GAO oversight and audits at Treasury. It would include limits on excessive compensation for CEOs and executives. This legislation would also require the study of the way that our markets are regulated to make sure that this type of crisis does not happen again. 
   This is a far from perfect bill. I have concerns about the amount of power that we are vesting in the Secretary of the Treasury. I believe that we should have included a provision requiring assets to be valued at their actual worth rather than just requiring a study of the flawed mark to market industry. This legislation should have had stricter restrictions on ``golden parachutes'' to ensure that CEOs do not profit from the Federal Government's stepping in to correct their bad decisions. It was my hope that we would decide to shore up the bad mortgages and help the American families struggling to make ends meet similar to the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, a Federal program that shored up a collapsing market in the past. 
   Today's vote does not preclude us from acting further. We also must invest in the real economy and act to shore up the bad mortgages and help American families struggling to make ends meet. One approach would be similar to the Home Owner' Loan Corporation, a 1930s-era Federal program that shored up a collapsing market in the past. We also must reform the way the FDIC manages risk to accurately reflect the assets that banks hold, rather than the flawed ``mark-to-market'' requirements that led to this mess. Ultimately, we must change the failed philosophy that favored no regulation and no oversight and allowed this crisis to happen in the first place.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, a budget is a moral document that demonstrates our values and priorities. I believe this budget by Chairman JOHN SPRATT repesents values I can be proud of. This budget funds education, healthcare, housing and development while brinnging the budget back to surplus by 2012. 
   At a time when more than 10 percent of students drop out of high school before graduating and only 4 out of 10 children eligible for Head Start are able to participate, the budget reverses the administration's policy of under-investing in education for our children. The budget rejects the President's proposal to cut funding for the Department of Education by  $1.5 billion below the 2007 enacted level and to eliminate 44 different programs, and provides for substantial new investments to increase funding for vital programs such as Head Start, special education--IDEA, Title I and other programs under the No Child Left Behind Act. The bill also provides for funding the increase in Pell Grants so that high school students know that if they work hard, they can go to college. 
   The budget rejects the President's proposal to cut funding for the Community Development Block Grant by $1.1 billion below last year's level, and instead provides for the first CDBG increase since 2005. The cut advocated by the President would endanger job creation, economic development, and affordable housing efforts cutting CDBGs for nearly 1,200 State and local governments. 
   This budget rejects the President's proposal to cut the Child Care Development Block Grant and the Social Services Block Grant by a total of $520 million below the 2007 level. The President's budget would lead to a decline in children receiving assistance so their parents can work. Our budget would allow for the first increase in child care funding since 2002. 
   Further, knowing that we now have more uninsured Americans than 6 years ago, this budget blocks the President's proposed cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. These cuts would have made healthcare less affordable and accessible for millions of Americans. Additionally, this budget ensures that up to $50 billion over the next 5 years will be devoted to the State Children's Health Insurance Program--SCHIP--to help cover millions of uninsured children. New Jersey is a national leader in covering children through the SCHIP program and this additional funding is desperately needed to ensure our States' good work can continue. 
   This budget rejects the President's dangerous cuts to our Nation's first responders. What sense would it make to cut the Local Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention program, firefighter assistance grants, Byrne Justice Assistance grants, or the Community Oriented Policing Services--COPS--program? Our budget stands up for first responders and ensures that each of the programs receives appropriate levels of funding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I commend Mr. SPRATT for demonstrating that we can provide for our Nation's defense in a responsible way--both fiscally and from a policy standpoint. This 
   budget will provide $507 billion in base DOD budget authority, an $18 billion increase over the President's request. This budget also emphasizes the right priorities for meeting our security needs. 
   For example, this resolution opposes TRICARE fee increases and calls for a substantial increase in the veterans' health care system. The budget resolution notes the upcoming recommendations of the President's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors and other Government investigations in connection with the substandard care at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and allows funds for action when those recommendations are received. To help protect our Nation from a terrorist-sponsored nuclear attack, non-proliferation programs, such as the Cooperative Threat Reduction program, are given greater priority and higher funding. 
   Mr. Chairman, this budget will also help us keep our promises to our Nation's veterans. I'm pleased the committee has recommended raising increased discretionary funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs, from $36.5 billion to $43.1 billion--a $6.6 billion, 18.1 percent, increase over fiscal year 2007, and a $3.5 billion increase, 8.9 percent, over the administration request for fiscal year 2008. This budget provides a far more realistic spending plan than the President's proposal. Our proposed increase in this area will help meet some critical needs, including ensuring that medical inflation does not erode VA's ability to deliver quality health care to our veterans. 
   In order to maintain American competitiveness, we must make substantial investments in scientific research and education. The budget provides funding for initiatives to educate new scientists, engineers, and mathematicians in the next 4 years, and places more highly-qualified teachers in math and science K-12 classrooms. It makes critical investments in basic research, putting us on the path to doubling funding for the National Science Foundation, and bolstering investments in research and development throughout the budget. The reestablishment of the Office of Technology Assessment is made possible by Function 800, as is explicitly stated in the report language. The Office of Technology Assessment, an important tool for Congress's roles in fiscal planning, disaster mitigation, and oversight. 
   America's dependence on oil endangers our environment, our national security, and our economy. A sustained investment in research and development is crucial to creating cutting-edge technologies that allow us to develop clean, sustainable energy alternatives and capitalize on America's vast renewable natural resources. The budget provides increased funding for basic and applied energy research, to help America achieve energy independence in 10 years. 
   For the first time in 6 years, the budget resolution reflects a real commitment to protecting our most valuable natural resources by providing needed funding for our National Parks, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and the national wildlife refuge system. H. Con. Res. 99 provides a total of $31.4 billion for environmental programs, which is $2.6 billion more than the President's request. I have been an advocate for the Land and Water Conservation Fund since I came to Congress 8 years ago and I am 
   pleased that we are finally at a place where the budget includes adequate funding for both the State-side grant program and the Federal program. LWCF and the Forest Legacy program have done tremendous work in States across the country, including New Jersey, to protect open space, restore wetlands, and conserve forest lands. Why President Bush continues to turn a blind eye to our growing environmental needs is beyond me. Finally, we have a budget that realizes how important this investment is. 
   This budget achieves this without an increase in taxes. The budget would accommodate immediate relief for the tens of millions of middle income households who would otherwise be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT) while supporting the efforts of the Committee on Ways and Means to achieve permanent, revenue-neutral AMT reform. Unless the AMT is reformed, 19 million additional families will have to pay higher taxes in 2007. The budget would also accommodate extension of other middle-income tax relief, consistent with the Pay-As-You-Go principle. These tax cuts include: the child tax credit, marriage penalty relief, the 10 percent bracket, and the deduction for State and local sales taxes. 
   The past 6 years of fiscal irresponsibility have caused America's national debt to increase 50 percent, to nearly $9 trillion, or $29,000 for every American. Our ability to invest in the Nation's shared priorities is constrained by the cost of the debt run up over the last 6 years, when the administration and its partners in previous Congresses turned the largest surplus in American history into a record debt. About 75 percent of America's new debt has been borrowed from foreign creditors such as China, making our fiscal integrity a matter of national security. Over the last 6 years, President Bush has borrowed more money from foreign nations than the previous 42 U.S. Presidents combined. 
   Mr. Chairman, this budget restores the budget as a moral document that I can support. It funds the House Democratic innovation initiative, including commencing a doubling path for the National Science Foundation and providing significant increases for elementary and secondary math and science education. It accommodates a significant increase to expand children's health insurance to cover millions of uninsured children. It increases funding for veterans' health care and services so that returning soldiers will receive the care to which they are entitled. It accomplishes each of these goals without raising taxes on American citizens. I ask my colleagues to vote for the Spratt budget.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5349, PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Lungren and others who have spoken are right in one respect, yes, most of the House of Representatives voted not for the Protect America Act but rather for a substitute that we passed, a very good piece of legislation, that would indeed protect Americans, known as the RESTORE Act. That passed the House. It should be the law. 
   We do not need the Protect America Act to protect Americans, the so-called Protect America Act. We do not need it to keep from going dark. But what we do need is the time and the attention to get this right. This is a serious, serious matter about protecting the safety of Americans but also about the definition, the relationship between the people of this country and their government. 
   There has been a fundamental shift under the Protect America Act in the relationship between the people of this country and their government. It is whether or not the government regards the ordinary American with suspicion first. Think about it. 
   The reason this country and our liberty has survived so well is because the government understands they are subservient to the people. The government has understood that they treat the people with respect, their bosses, and do not regard them with suspicion first. 
   To be able to seize, search, intercept without having to demonstrate to an independent judge that you know what you are doing is a sign of disrespect. It is a sign of suspicion. It is, in fact, a redefinition of the makeup of this country. 
   So if we need time to get this right, let's take the time. We don't need the Protect America Act to keep us from going dark, and I would argue we certainly don't need it, as they argue, to protect Americans from those who would do us harm. We have offered that protection in the RESTORE Act. Let's get this right.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, Secretary Paulson's solution to the urgent financial crisis is wrong. The problem is that the financial institutions have been trading securities whose value they don't know and can't know because bad mortgages are mixed in with good mortgages in indeterminate amounts. 
   For any problem, you should go to the root in order to solve it. The root here is that the bad mortgages mixed with the good mortgages have poisoned the financial papers. In buying those papers, the taxpayers won't know whether they are getting any value for their dollar, and neither Paulson nor the market will be able to determine the value. So go to the root. Repair the bad mortgages. It will help Wall Street and Main Street. It will restore confidence, liquidity and solvency. 
   There is an antecedent. The Homeowners Loan Corporation in the 1930s dealt with a crisis of bad mortgages, put up $70 billion in today's dollars and rescued 1 million homeowners. It worked.

   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, later this week Congress will return to the issue of how best to modernize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. In November in this House of Representatives, we passed a very good bill. We would do well to observe the principles established in that bill. 
   Any final review of domestic surveillance passed by Congress should include court review of executive branch actions. The reason for this requirement is quite simple. Having a legal standard of review provides us both better intelligence and better civil liberty protections for our people. It is simple. It has been demonstrated that when officials must establish before an independent court that they know what they are doing, that they have reason to intercept communications, we get better intelligence. And, of course, that's the point, to have the intelligence to protect the American people from indiscriminate collection and fishing expeditions. Those are not productive. 
   In November, we passed a bill that would do this, the RESTORE Act. That bill guarantees court review of executive branch actions related to surveillance activities. I would commend that bill to this House.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, there is no denying that America is suffering from an energy crisis. My constituents are paying record prices at the pump, they are paying higher prices for food and commodities. This problem is only going to get worse this winter when they will be paying 15 percent more to heat their homes than last year. With family budgets already being stretched to the breaking point, Congress needs to act and to act quickly to address this problem. This will require both long term solutions that decrease our reliance on fossil fuels and imported fuels and short term solutions which will help bring down the price of energy now. 
   I have heard from a number of my constituents that a proven way to address both our short term and long term energy costs is to renew the renewable energy tax credit and the production tax credit that are due to expire at the end of this year. We already know how effective these tax credits are. For example, wind energy is not only a significant component of the global warming solution, but also a powerful engine in our economy. Since January 2007, more than 40 wind industry manufacturing facilities have been announced, brought online, or expanded in the U.S., creating over 9,000 jobs and one billion in new manufacturing investment. When the production tax credit lapsed in 2000, 2002 and 2004, wind capacity installation dropped 93 percent, 73 percent and 77 percent, respectively, from the previous year. It is unwise to allow the wind production tax credit to expire and allow this bright spot in our economy to grind to a halt. 
   The solar energy production tax credit and the solar residential tax credit have been instrumental in helping my home state of New Jersey become a leader in the production of solar energy technology. New Jersey is also one of the nation's fastest growing solar energy markets. The extension of the solar energy tax credit will spur job growth in communities and would help New Jersey reach its goal of having 20 percent of its electricity derived from renewable sources by the year 2020. I have heard from companies in my district that if we don't extend the production tax credit they will have to shut down new solar projects or charge more for energy. 
   The tax credit for consumers has been equally effective in saving our constituents  thousands of dollars on their energy bills. For example, I was recently contacted by Phyllis who lives in Marlboro, New Jersey. By utilizing the residential energy investment tax credit, Phyllis was able to install 55 solar panels on the roof of her home. Phyllis also used the investment tax credit to purchase a high efficiency heating and cooling system. Together these investments have decreased her energy costs to one fourth the cost she was paying the year before. Phyllis is also selling the excess energy her solar panels gather back into the grid and has made over $2,000 this summer. We need to encourage more Phyllises--that is how we will break our dependence on 19th century technology. 
   The renewal of these tax credits will also help to increase our economy by creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. According to a recent study, if the renewable energy tax breaks expire at the end of this year, over 116,000 jobs in wind and solar industries would be lost in one year. Today, when the predicted economic growth forecast is an anemic pace of 1.6 to 2 percent and unemployment is likely to continue to climb, we in Congress should do everything we can to ensure job growth and preserve jobs. 
   Renewable energy tax credits are instrumental to ensuring growth in the renewable energy sector, bolstering our national economy, providing us with home growth energy and have the potential to save our constituents thousands on their energy costs. It would be a disservice to our constituents if we do not act prior to Congress adjourning to extend and expand renewable energy tax incentives. Therefore, I have introduced legislation today that will extend the renewable energy tax credit, production tax credit, and the hybrid vehicle tax credit for ten years. This legislation would help to grow our economy and provide for a secure energy future.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 6899, The Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act. 
   Today's energy crisis is based on a generation of failed policies which have made us excessively dependent on foreign fuels. We must learn from the mistakes of the past and find a new direction that will decrease our reliance on gas and oil and move our energy policy forward. Today my constituents in New Jersey are paying more than $3.50 at the pump. The steep increase in gas prices is stretching family budgets to the breaking point, and I am deeply concerned about the impact that prices are having on American consumers. Congress needs to pass comprehensive legislation that will help families struggling with rising gas and fuel oil prices in the short-term, while developing a long-term strategy that decreases our dependence on foreign oil and reduces our greenhouse gas emissions. 
   The legislation that we are considering today, the Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act, has some good provisions, provisions that could help to move our country's energy policy in the right direction. I consistently have supported many of these provisions in the past. I have voted in favor of renewing the renewable energy tax credits three times this Congress. I have voted to repeal the billions of dollars in tax breaks that have been given to oil companies at the expense of the American taxpayer and to invest this money in clean, renewable energy. I have voted to provide relief to our public transit agencies which are struggling to meet the skyrocketing demand for public transportation. Twice I have voted to encourage oil companies to drill on the 68 million acres of the lands open for drilling both onshore and offshore that currently are leased by oil companies for production, yet remain unused. I have supported legislation which would help to increase supply for oil and decrease demand for oil including releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, instituting a national Renewable Portfolio Standard, and increasing the efficiency of buildings  and appliances. I have consistently supported comprehensive reform of our nation's energy policy. Last year I supported H.R. 6, the Energy Independence and Security Act, a law that will make a real difference in moving our energy policy forward by raising the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standard. However, unlike H.R. 6, the legislation before us today is not the comprehensive policy that we need to move our country forward and I cannot support it. 
   I believe that drilling in environmentally sensitive areas, such as our coastline, is unwise. Some in America claim that drilling--here, now, and everywhere--will bring instantaneous relief to families paying painful gas prices. The facts do not support this claim. ``Drill baby drill'' is not an energy policy, it is a slogan to hide behind to avoid corning up with a real policy which will help America move towards sustainable, affordable energy. There is no easy solution to this crisis, and the evidence shows that drilling in OCS would save pennies per gallon years from now. We can begin now, not years from now, to move to sustainable, affordable energy. Fortunately, the environmental and financial requirements for an oil or gas company to drill are strong enough that few if any wells will be drilled under this legislation, and I expect smarter, more comprehensive legislation will follow next year. 
   We will never be able to drill our way to energy independence. The United States consumes 25 percent of the world's oil but only possesses 3 percent of the world's oil reserves. Even if we drilled on every single square inch of land where oil is assumed to exist we will never be able to meet our national demand. Moreover, drilling 50 or 100 miles off our shores, as H.R. 6899 proposes, could be detrimental to the preservation of our environment for future generations. In New Jersey, tourism along our shore brings $35 billion to the state's economy. A possible oil spill from drilling of the coast of New Jersey, Virginia, or Delaware would be devastating to my state's 120 miles of shoreline. I am unwilling to sacrifice our nation's environment for drilling which will do nothing to decrease prices at the pump. 
   Since I was elected 10 years ago I have consistently opposed drilling in environmentally sensitive areas including the Outer Continental Shelf. I have a strong record for voting in favor of preserving our environment and developing new energy sources that are clean, safe, and sustainable. This is really the only way that we can lower our gas prices in the long term. I will not support legislation which will continue the failed policies of reliance on fossil fuels, and I oppose H.R. 6899. 
   I will continue to push for real reform of our nation's energy policy. Therefore I will be introducing legislation today which extend for 10 years the tax credits for hybrid cars, energy efficient housing, and renewable energy sources including solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, and hydro power. Extending these tax credits will help our country stay on the right path towards a cleaner energy future.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (UNITED STATES-INDIA NUCLEAR COOPERATION APPROVAL AND NONPROLIFERATION ENHANCEMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my friend, from Massachusetts. 
   There will be a time when the history of the spread of nuclear weapons of mass destruction is written, and we will look back and see when the last thread of the international nuclear nonproliferation regime was shredded with this agreement. Now, we can talk at length about the details of this cooperative agreement. We can talk about what a good friend India is and how responsible they have been, but the history will say that with this agreement the world lost the last bit of an international tool to control the spread of nuclear weapons of mass destruction. 
   We will be left only with the ability to jawbone with our allies and to threaten our enemies. Countries will work out whatever deals they can and will, two-by-two. 
   If we really believe that nuclear proliferation and loose nukes are the greatest threat to world peace and security, as I do, then we should be holding on to every tool we can find to prevent that threat. We should be working with India to strengthen the international nonproliferation regime, not collaborating with India to destroy it. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE COOPERATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 980, the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act. I have been a cosponsor of this legislation in every Congress since I was first elected, and I am glad that under Democratic leadership, it has finally come to the floor of the House for a vote. 
   It is imperative that we do all that we can to assist the police and firefighters that sacrifice so much in order to protect us. This bill requires States to establish a collective bargaining floor to allow police and firefighters the chance to negotiate their labor agreements. Many States already have similar laws on the books, but for those that don't, this is a good starting point. Public safety officers should have just as much of a right as other workers to organize. When they do so, they not only benefit themselves, but also society as a whole. 
   We are not forcing unionization on States, nor are we doing anything here today that could in any way jeopardize public safety. We are simply allowing those brave men and women who provide for our safety the chance to negotiate a more livable wage, a better pension plan, and expanded health insurance coverage. We owe it to them, and I am glad that this body will finally take up this important bill. I urge passage of H.R. 980.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Chairman, this amendment is intended to make it possible for more teachers throughout America to have the professional development that we have promised them in science, math and technology education. 
   You may know that under No Child Left Behind, the Elementary and Secondary Act reauthorization, that was the Eisenhower Program that provided teacher training and professional development, was changed to Math and Science Partnership. Subsequently, the funding was cut to about a quarter of what had previously been provided, and it has never recovered. 
   I recognize that the committee under Chairman Obey's leadership has tried to get back that lost ground that was lost under previous leadership. Nevertheless, the teachers and hence the students are not getting what they need. Whether you look at the ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' report of the National Academy of Sciences or the Congress's own Innovation Agenda or the President's Competitive Initiative, we are all saying, in fact leaders of this country are yelling and screaming that we must do better in science and math education for our competitiveness, for our quality of life. If we are to do that, we must help the teachers with their professional development. 
   Funding prior to No Child Left Behind for math and science teacher development was $485 million. Currently under this appropriations bill in front of us, the funding for the successor programs for math and science teacher professional development is $182 million. Again, I recognize what the committee has been trying to do. It is not enough. We owe it to the students. We owe it to the teachers. But even more, we owe it to our society. 
   If our economy is to grow, if our productivity is going to grow, we must do better in math and science education. This is one of the important steps as recommended by the Glen Commission on Elementary and Secondary Education, as recommended by the National Academy of Sciences, as recommended by so many, including so many in this room. So I urge the adoption of my amendment which would put $25 million additional dollars into the Math and Science Partnership. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

Perhaps this one will have a better chance of success. It still should provide funding for hundreds of teachers in each State, to get some of the professional development that we have promised them that they need and that will help our competitiveness, our quality of life, our economic productivity and the science capacity of our students. 
   Madam Chairman, we are not doing nearly enough in this area, and everyone says so. We should look for every opportunity to enhance our science and math education, and start by helping the teachers whom we ask to teach these subjects to our students.

   Mr. HOLT. Madam Chairman, as you may know, the funding authorized for the Help America Vote Act of 2002, known as HAVA, for disability access and protection and advocacy payments, was never fully appropriated. Section 261 of HAVA authorized $100 million in disability access funding to make polling places accessible to individuals with disabilities and to provide them with information about the accessibility of polling places. 
   I am sure the Chair and my colleagues would agree, it is important for equality under the law that all voters have good access to voting. 
   In addition, section 291 authorized $10 million annually for fiscal years 2003 through 2006 and such sums as necessary thereafter to pay for the protection and advocacy systems of each State to ensure full participation in the electoral process for individuals with disabilities, including the process of registering to vote, casting a vote and gaining access to polling places. To date, only $55 million of that amount has been appropriated under HAVA to fund accessibility, and only $22 million has been appropriated to fund protection and advocacy systems. 
   Voting is indeed the cornerstone of our democracy, and unless all eligible voters are assured access to the polls, that fundamental right and the integrity of our electoral system generally are severely undermined. Therefore, I seek to amend the bill to provide $15 million in funding for accessibility under section 261 of HAVA, and an additional $6 million in funding for protection and advocacy systems under section 291 of HAVA, for a total increase of $21 million. This would result, as you can quickly calculate, in several hundred thousand dollars per State to assist in voting for voters with disabilities. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this increase. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   After the season was over, they were the subject of hateful, crude and insulting comments; and they responded with restraint, with eloquence and dignity. They were classy. These athletes and Coach Stringer distinguished themselves after the season even more than they did during their extraordinary season. And they serve as a reminder of what college athletics is all about, or should be. We hold up college athletics not for the entertainment of alumni and fans, but because we believe athletic participation builds character. These women of the Rutgers basketball team showed that they have character.

   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California and congratulate him and thank him for developing this legislation. 
   We've outlined many of the provisions of the bill today. I would just point out that this will result in more than $250 million in additional loan and Pell grant aid to New Jersians. I'm also pleased that this legislation includes provisions from my bill, the Part-Time Student Assistance Act, that will make Pell Grants available year-round instead of the current two semesters a year, and this is important for students who work and go to school. 
   Also, we have raised the income protection allowance in the College Cost Reduction Act so that students who will have to work to support themselves and their families can earn more without having that count against their student aid. 
   The bill also includes provisions from my bill, the National Security Language Act. This provides $5,000 in loan forgiveness for Federal employees with critical foreign language skills. 
   The bill also provides upfront grant aid for those who are becoming math, science and foreign language teachers. Without qualified teachers in these areas, we're endangering the competitiveness of our children in the global economy. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Res. 521, Celebrating the 75th Anniversary of the 1932 Winter Olympic Games in Lake Placid, New York. This was truly a great moment in the history of sports. The beautiful Lake Placid-Wilmington region played host to athletes from around the globe and the event put the USA on the map of winter sports. The graceful Norwegian figure skater Sonja Henie won the second of her three gold medals. American speed skater Jack Shea won two gold medals, a first for Olympic competition. The United States won 12 medals in all, the most in the competition. Ever since, the spirit and beauty of competitive winter sports have remained on display in Lake Placid, which played host to the United States' memorable 1980 hockey victory over the Soviet Union, and in countless skiing, skating, sledding and other events. We can all be proud of Lake Placid's rich history.

   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, we finally are going to raise the minimum wage. No gimmicks, no combination with extraneous legislation, just a straight up or down vote to raise the minimum wage from what has become the lowest purchasing power in half a century. 
   New Jersey instituted a fair living wage a year or so ago; and, guess what, the increase did not result in layoffs. That indeed has been the experience of every previous increase around the country. With a minimum wage salary of a little over $10,000 a year, health premiums are that much, how do you expect a family to get along? This will benefit 13 million people, millions of children, millions with children to support, millions as head of household. 
   Now, you have heard about the fairness and the compassion arguments for this increase. We really must emphasize the solid economic arguments that this increase, like all previous increases, will benefit the entire economy. Workers will benefit. Businesses will benefit. Far from lopping off the lowest rung of the ladder, as our colleagues have argued, this will raise the entire ladder. The economics are clear. We have seen it again and again.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the most important political and moral issue of the day, the war in Iraq. The war in Iraq costs us dearly in lives, more than 3,000 Americans so far, in dollars, 471 billion by my count; in international prestige by compromising our ability to meet our other foreign policy goals. 
   President Bush has rejected the sensible recommendations of the Iraq Study Group and instead chosen an escalation of troops. Rather than sending more brave young Americans to fight in an undefined, impossible mission in an Iraqi civil war, we should be looking for ways to redeploy our troops responsibly. 
   Representative Murtha has courageously offered a framework for that redeployment, and the administration would be wise to heed his advice. The American people want to bring home their loved ones who are in harm's way. The Iraqi people want us to leave so that Iraqis can solve their problems. 
   As former Secretary of State Albright has pointed out, the only ones who want us to stay are those who will leave Iraq when we leave. 
   Mr. Speaker, Congress should reject the President's last ditch effort to salvage a botched execution of a flawed strategy.

   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5, a bill that would cut in half student loan interest rates and make college more affordable, improve our economy, and improve the quality of lives across America. 
   The average student graduates with more than $17,000 in loan debt, almost 45 percent more than just a decade or so ago. In New Jersey, in my State, this bill would save the average student 4 or $5,000 over the life of the loans. 
   According to the Congressional Research Service, half of the student loan borrowers who benefit under this legislation have family incomes under 60 or $70,000, and the median income of family borrowers is $45,000. These are ordinary folks. Now, each of my colleagues can find thousands of stories of citizens in his or her own district where these loans have given a greater lease on life and livelihood to ordinary folks. 
   We can talk about might have been, should have been, things we can do to make college more affordable. This is something we can do right now. The legislation we are considering today will provide needed relief for cutting interest rates from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent, and it will be a vital step toward making college more affordable for millions of Americans.     
   If we are going to stay competitive in the global economy, we must make access to higher education more possible; and helping qualified students pursue higher education is good not only for the individual students, but also for our economy, our competitiveness, our security, the future of this Nation. 
   We have an opportunity to do it. The opportunity has been passed over sometimes in the past, but let's do it now.

And it is required for a variety of reasons, not just for the protection of the detainees or the protection of the interrogators, but to get maximum benefit from the interrogation. 
   Under this amendment, the judge advocate general would develop guidelines to ensure that the required video recording is sufficient to protect both the abuse of detainees and to protect the identity of the interrogators from unauthorized disclosure. This is standard practice.

   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from Massachusetts for, once again, asking me to join him in the effort to refocus our military spending priorities toward more useful purposes. You know, one of the craziest ideas I've ever heard is that we should deploy this missile defense system as a way to test it. It should be tested before it's deployed. And I can tell you, even if it worked, it would never be so reliable that we would think of it as leak-proof, that it would actually change our strategy. So it just becomes another expense. 
   And simple strategic analysis tells us that a provocative yet permeable defense is destabilizing, and really leads to reduced security for all. 
   What we do here is provide over $600 million for the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, much more in keeping with the real threat that faces us, and money for the Second Line of Defense Initiative and other programs aimed at nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
   We would also provide $100 million for the care and support of wounded soldiers and their families, and $300 million more to address the National Guard and Reserve shortfalls, especially for homeland security activities. This is a commonsense amendment. I urge its adoption.

   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mrs. Tauscher for her wise leadership. 
   Mr. Chairman, this amendment is unwise and, at the very least, premature. Existing Department of Energy Reports and reports from outside consultants, such as the JASON group, have made it clear that our existing nuclear weapons will be viable for decades. It makes no sense to begin construction of a new generation of nuclear weapons. It is not necessary, and worse, it would be harmful to our security. 
   In light of our efforts to convince other countries to abstain from pursuing nuclear weapons, a pressing, indeed critical, national need for our security to persuade other countries to abstain going forward with Reliable Replacement Warhead programs would not make sense. It was defunded last year by the Appropriations Committee largely for some of these reasons I have outlined. 
   Finally, the United States has not recently conducted a comprehensive review of its nuclear posture, and no construction of new nuclear weapons or major alterations of the DOE lab complexes should be made until such a review is completed. 
   Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Pearce amendment.

   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee). And I look forward to joining him again in the Apollo energy legislation as I did in the last Congress, and this time I hope we will get it through because the way we produce and use energy in the United States is the greatest insult to our planet. 
   There are a lot of things that we do that are dangerous, unclean, unproductive. But the way we produce and use energy is the greatest insult. And I think what we want to talk about is the word ``sustainable.'' We should be in this for the long haul for centuries to come. 
   As we look back on a day like today when we celebrate the ongoing experiment of the American republic, we should be thinking, as those who wrote the Constitution were thinking, about something that would last for centuries. We should be embarking on a sustainable energy path. Not just clean energy, not just renewable energy, but a sustainable energy path that is environmentally sustainable, that is economically sustainable, and that is climactically sustainable. 
   One of the big changes that has occurred, and I think Mr. Inslee would agree, in the last year or 2 is here in Washington, and I think around the country, we have come to the conclusion, some of us years ago, but most people very recently, have come to the conclusion that global climate change, human induced global climate change, is real. They have come to the conclusion that it is real and they have come to the conclusion that it is serious. 
   They have not yet come to the conclusion that it is harmful. I would argue that it is costly and deadly. They have not come to the conclusion that there is something that we can do about it. But, indeed, I would argue that there is a great deal we can do about it. Some damage has been done.     
   There is much more we can do.

   Mr. HOLT. The gentleman makes a very good point, but this is not just a matter of the frost line moving a little bit north or spring coming a little bit earlier so you can get your tomatoes out sooner. No, it is much more serious than that. The pattern of storms, the pattern of droughts, even the pattern of freezes will change. Ocean currents are already showing signs of changing. That is what I mean when I say this is very costly and even deadly. 
   It is not just inconvenient. It does not just mean that, well, they are going to start growing sugar cane in Minnesota as the climate warms up. No, it means that lives will be lost and huge expenses will be incurred. 
   So that is the point. Let me just finish the two further steps we need to take in public understanding and, I would say, in legislative understanding. Once we recognize that human-induced climate changes, that it is real, that it is serious, that it is costly, and that something can be done, we have to figure out what those things are, and the new Apollo Energy Act of the last Congress that we will get in shape for this Congress will give you some of those ideas, I think. But then we have to convince ourselves that it is worth doing these things, that the benefits will be greater than the cost. 
   Well, I can assure you the cost will be great. But even more, we can make this a winner by stopping climate change, and we are in the best position in the world of all countries to do that  because we have set the pattern for energy use for a century, and we can set the pattern for the coming century. 
   We are behind other countries, are doing more, we are buying windmills from Europe, not the United States, just to take one example, but we can go on and on. We could take the lead, and I can assure you, I can assure the gentleman from Washington, and anyone else, that it will be better to sell these technologies to the world than to buy them, and there is going to be a huge market for alternative sustainable technologies.

   Mr. HOLT. If the gentleman would yield, I would like to elaborate on a point that Mr. Blumenauer made about transportation. Not only do we use a lot of energy going to and from work, we waste a lot of energy that no one wants to use sitting in congestion. There are some parts of the country, we certainly see it in my State of New Jersey, where an enormous amount of energy is lost. And if we could avoid that congestion, it would make everyone happier, I can assure you, not just at a sense of savings, but it would remove the aggravation. 
   Well, it is a whole lot easier to move electrons than it is to move chunks of metal. Smart transportation systems that take account of where the traffic is and where it can go, and compute in real time where you should go, rather than you running a car-sized computer system where you are trying this and you are trying that and you have got a million cars in this computer system in real-time trying to figure out the best routes. You can do that with smart transportation system cheap, relatively, save energy, save money, save aggravation. That is just one example of what we should do.

   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. For years, ethanol was dismissed as a net energy loser. It cost more energy to grow the crops and ferment them and produce useful fuel; it took more fuel than it provided. It was a net energy user. So it was easy to dismiss that and not invest much money in distribution systems and so forth. 
   Then, because there were not distribution systems, there was not much motivation to develop more efficient catalytic processes, to work with the waste, as you would be doing with cellulosic ethanol, for example. It really was, if we may mix an agricultural metaphor here, a chicken and egg problem, and we need to step in. 
   This is the sort of thing that the government can do at low cost without picking winners and losers by actually providing more choice, by making it possible for people to distribute the fuel as the new technology makes it economical and efficient to produce that fuel. It is a matter of investment in research and investment in infrastructure. Some of this is done through incentives, some of it is done through demonstration projects, some of it is done through direct investment of research and development. We can break out of this self-defeating chicken and egg cycle, or chicken and egg restriction.

   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, here's the problem as I understand it with the financial crisis that is called the worst in decades, maybe ever. 
   Time and complicated securities. The rescue must be done immediately or else the financial house will collapse, Paulson says. Second, the taxpayers say they don't know if they are getting anything of fair value for the $700 billion they are asked to put up. No one knows the value of these securities, and Paulson says there isn't time to find out. Trust him, he says. He won't pay too much. Maybe the market can even help him determine the fair value. 
   Yes, we may need to act quickly to staunch the crisis of confidence. Yes, the government may have to commit a lot of money to prop up the value of the investments. But rather than coming to the rescue by standing behind the investment paper, which is a mix of good and bad mortgages that have poisonous bad mortgages mixed with good, rather than committing $700 billion to something that Paulson and Bernanke and others say they don't really understand, why not stand behind the mortgages themselves? At least then the public will know what they are getting for their $700 billion and it will help the homeowner, the neighborhood, the community, and the investor. 
   There is an antecedent. The Home Owners' Loan Corporation of the 1930s through the 1950s helped people, individuals, with their mortgages. It was a Federal program that shored up a collapsing market. And, incidentally, when it finally went out of business, it showed a net plus for the taxpayer. 
   Let's take a breath, show the world that the Government of the United States will not let the financial house collapse. And let's go to the root of the problem. 
   I have been taking calls in my office from people who say ``help Main Street, not Wall Street.'' Well, in fact, by helping Main Street, we can help Wall Street. But by helping Wall Street, we don't necessarily help Main  Street. Bailing out those holders of financial paper does not stop the homeowner from the foreclosure. If we go to the root of the problem, we can help both.

Untreated mental illness is costly to individuals, to families, to companies large and small; yes, to the entire society. But from now on, millions of Americans who suffer from mental illness will receive full access to the treatment they need and deserve without higher copays and treatment limits. 
   Finally, I am pleased to say that this bill protects States like New Jersey who go above and beyond coverage requirements that this legislation establishes. There is more to do, but this is a landmark, red letter day.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (OBSERVING THE BIRTHDAY OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the extraordinary life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Few individuals have left such an indelible mark on society through their selfless and tireless actions to improve the lives of those around them. Dr. King was a powerful voice for justice and equality, and we must remember his legacy, not simply by reading aloud his works, but by heeding his call for action. 
   After receiving his doctorate from Boston University, Dr. King worked to confront the civil rights abuses that targeted the Black residents of Montgomery, Alabama. After the Montgomery bus boycott earned him national attention, Dr. King used his platform to highlight other forms of racial segregation in the South. His actions, including nonviolent civil  disobedience, laid the foundation for passage of both the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Despite his myriad accomplishments, Dr. King continued to work day and night until his death, often delivering rousing speeches even when physically and mentally exhausted. 
   These later speeches included powerful denunciations of the Vietnam war, and calls for a more just and peaceful society. Dr. King recognized that resources that could have been used to fight racial and economic inequalities at home were being squandered on an unnecessary war half a world away. Dr. King demanded that people sacrifice their energy to fight for causes larger than themselves. I am glad to see that the Corporation for National and Community Service has asked Americans to honor that call by volunteering their time on Martin Luther King, Jr., Day. We must all actively work to achieve peace, both in our communities and abroad, and I am proud to stand before this body today to celebrate the life of Dr. King.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOUSE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, the constitutional history of the United States has been the expansion of the voting franchise. Our history has been to expand the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. 
   With respect to the District of Columbia, the Constitution provides that the Congress shall have the power to exercise exclusive legislation. It does not say that the price is the loss of the franchise. 
   As a youngster who lived here in the District of Columbia, I was told by some that residents of D.C. were special. My colleague from Texas used the  word ``distinctive'' awhile ago, that somehow we were honored to have Congress govern us even though we did not have representation. 
   What a strange honor. It is truly paradoxical and ironic that residents of the seat of government of the greatest democracy in the world should not themselves have the right of direct representation, 600,000 citizens, citizens without the complete basic rights of citizens. Giving D.C.'s 600,000 residents direct representation of Congress is long overdue.  
   I rise today in support of the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007, and I would like to commend my colleagues Eleanor Holmes Norton and Tom Davis for their tireless efforts to bring this important measure to the Floor for a vote. 
   The United States Constitution, a relatively short and simple document, has utterly transformed the world in its 200 year history. It has served as a model for fledgling democracies everywhere, because of its establishment of a system under which the citizenry grant limited powers to the government and choose the individuals who will represent them in that government. The Constitutional history of the United States has been the expansion of the voting franchise. Our history has been to expand the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. 
   As for the District of Columbia, however, the Constitution provides that Congress shall have the power ``to exercise exclusive legislation over such District (not exceeding ten miles square) as may ..... become the seat of government of the United States.'' It does not say that the price is disenfranchisement. 
   The importance of creating a neutral jurisdiction for the seat of the federal government under the exclusive control of Congress made sense at the time. As a youngster who lived in the District of Columbia many decades ago, I was told by some that residents of DC were special, distinctive as the gentleman, Mr. Smith, that we were honored to have Congress govern us even though Congress worked without representation from us. What a strange honor! It is truly paradoxical that the residents of the seat of government of the greatest democracy in the world should not, themselves, have the rights to direct representation. The District of Columbia was created in 1790 and, in 1800, it had a population of just over 8,000. Today, it is home to about 600,000 citizens--citizens without the complete basic rights of citizens. 
   If enacted, H.R. 1433 would treat the District of Columbia like a congressional district for the purposes of allowing direct representation within the House of Representatives. This measure was reported out favorably by the House Committee on the Judiciary Committee by a margin of almost two to one, and subsequently by the House Committee on Oversight and Government by a margin of 25 to four. [Giving Washington D.C.'s 600,000 residents direct representation in Congress is long overdue;] I fully support this measure and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I shall be brief. 
   Suppose you are driving to work. Now, today you can listen to the radio and avoid some delays. But what if you had real-time information in your car that would instruct you to turn now and save 10 minutes on your commute? What if you could use that technology every day? What if millions of Americans used that technology every day? You would save time, fuel and money. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is not far-fetched. The technology exists today, but it is not widely implemented, although it could be. Information technology is becoming cheaper and cheaper. Electronic systems are now relatively inexpensive and easy to install, but we've really not looked at using them systematically. My amendment would mandate a study of this new technology, such as web-based real-time information systems, freight route management, congestion information systems, car pool information systems, parking information and so forth and would examine the fuel savings.     
   This amendment, which is supported by the Intelligent Transportation Society of America, simply calls for a study of the energy savings from intelligent transportation systems. It, indeed, I would argue, is an intelligent amendment, and I believe Mr. Oberstar from Minnesota would agree.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bill, which will provide our men and women in uniform with the tools to defend America and its people. Overall, this bill provides $459.594 billion for the operations of the Defense Department for fiscal year 2008, which is more than $43 billion above last year's level. 
   This bill keeps faith with our troops and their families in three key areas. First, this bill provides $2.9 billion ($558.4 million above the President's request) for programs including childcare centers, education programs and the family advocacy program which provides support to military families affected by the demands of war and episodes of child or spouse abuse. Second, the bill addresses the health care needs of military families and retirees by providing $22.957 billion ($1.7 billion above 2007 and $416 million above the President's 2008 request) for their care. The bill rejects the President's proposal to inflict $1.9 billion in TRICARE fee and premium increases on our troops, their families, and our military retirees. Finally, the bill provides $2.2 to cover the cost of a 3.5 percent military pay raise, as approved in the House version of the Defense Authorization bill. 
   This bill also prepares our forces to meet future needs. The bill provides $7.548 billion, a 13 percent increase for all home-stationing training, so that our troops are well prepared for any eventual deployment. The bill also supports DoD's plans to increase the size of the Army and Marines by providing $4 billion to cover the equipment costs of adding 7,000 Army troops and $2 billion to cover cost of adding 5,000 Marines. These force structure increases may reduce the number of deployments individual servicemembers may face in the years ahead. 
   The bill also addresses Guard and Reserve equipment shortfalls by providing $925 million ($635 million above 2007 levels) in order to help forces meet the demands of overseas deployments and respond to natural disasters here at home. This amount meets the requirements identified by the Chief of the National Guard Bureau in the ``Essential 10 Equipment Requirements for the Global War on Terror.'' 
   To help America maintain its technological edge in the military arena, the bill provides $76.229 billion ($1.112 billion above the President's request and $508 million above 2007 levels) for research, development, testing and evaluation programs, including military medical research. 
   Funding for production of the Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter was zeroed out because they are not ready to go into production. Research and development will continue. Regarding ballistic missile defense programs, the committee cut some $298 million from the President's $8.498 billion request. I continue to believe that this is the single most wasteful, technologically impractical, and politically shortsighted programs in the entire Pentagon budget, and I hope that further cuts to this program will be forthcoming when the House and Senate conferees meet later this year. 
   The bill also cuts $406 million from the President's $3.157 billion request for the Future Combat System, the Army's projected next generation of armor, artillery, and related vehicle programs. This is another example of a Cold War legacy program that continues to receive massive funding despite its complete irrelevance to the wars we've been waging since 9/11. 
   If we've learned anything from our experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, it's not that our soldiers' greatest need has been additional firepower from new tanks and artillery pieces--it's been their need for translators and cultural specialist who could help them bridge the language and culture gap with the Iraqis and Afghans who want to help us find the insurgents and terrorists who are destroying their societies. I'm glad the committee has taken this initial step in reducing expenditures on this Cold War legacy program, but I hope that it represents only the beginning of a fundamental reevaluation of this program and the eventual reprogramming of its funds towards more productive ends. 
   Finally, I wanted to take a moment to address a structural change that was made to the committee at the beginning of this Congress, one that has significantly enhanced this body's oversight of intelligence programs. Earlier this year and under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi, the House passed H. Res. 35, which created the Select Intelligence Oversight Panel, which I have the honor of chairing. This step was in direct response to the 9/11 Commission recommendation that Congress take steps to reform how it conducts oversight of the intelligence community. 
   Our panel contains a mix of members from both the Appropriations Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Our charter is to review the operations of the intelligence community and to recommend policies and funding levels where necessary. The bill before you incorporates our recommendations. The majority of these recommendations are detailed in the classified annex to this bill and cannot be discussed in open session. However, one specific recommendation can be outlined for this body and the public, and it involves those critical foreign language programs of which I spoke earlier. 
   Our panel recommended a more than $10 million increase in funding for the National Security Education Program, or NSEP for short. NSEP was established by the David L. Boren National Security Education Act (NSEA), as amended, P.L. 102-183, codified at 50 U.S.C. 1901 et seq. It was signed into law by President George H. W. Bush on December 4, 1991. The NSEA mandated the Secretary of Defense to create the National Security Education Program (NSEP) to award: (1) scholarships to U.S. undergraduate students to study abroad in areas critical to U.S. national security; (2) fellowships to U.S. graduate students to study languages and world regions critical to U.S. national security; and (3) grants to U.S. institutions of higher education to develop programs of study in and about countries, languages and international fields critical to national security and under-represented in U.S. study. Also mandated in the NSEA was the creation of the National Security Education Board (NSEB) to provide overall guidance for NSEP. 
   NSEP's mission is to build a broader and more qualified pool of U.S. citizens with foreign language and international skills. It consists of five initiatives that represent broad strategic partnerships with the U.S. education community designed to serve the needs of U.S. national security and national competitiveness. NSEP focuses on the critical languages and cultures of Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America, and is unique in the commitment of its award recipients to proceed into public service upon completion of their academic studies. Each NSEP award recipient must demonstrate a commitment to bring his or her extraordinary skills to the Federal Government through employment within one of its many agencies and departments. 
   I'm pleased that our panel has placed such bipartisan emphasis on closing the foreign language and cultural literacy gaps that still exist within our national intelligence and defense agencies. However, it is clear that our deployed forces still do not have anything approaching the number of qualified linguists and cultural experts to help them effectively interact with the people of Iraq, Afghanistan, and most of the other countries of the Arab and Islamic world that are the critical battlegrounds in the war of ideas, hearts, and minds against al Qaeda. I will work with Chairman Murtha in the coming year to address this issue. 
   Mr. Chairman, on balance, this is a good bill that provides our armed forces what they need to protect our citizens, our allies, and our vital interests, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I commend the subcommittee for bringing this bill to the floor. Let me also take a moment to commend the outstanding staff of both the Defense subcommittee and the staff of the Select Intelligence Oversight  Panel for their hard work and expert contributions to our final product. I also want to thank the Panel's ranking member, Mr. LAHOOD, for his many thoughtful contributions to our work this year. 
   Speaker PELOSI is a leader of vision and boldness. Under her leadership, the House passed H. Res. 35, which created the Select Intelligence Oversight Panel, which I have the honor to chair. This step was in direct response to the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission that Congress reform how it conducts oversight of the intelligence community. Specifically, the Commission said ``Congress should create a joint committee for intelligence, in with combined authorizing and appropriations powers.'' The Speaker created a panel consisting of appropriators and authorizers . 
   Our panel contains a mix of members from both the Appropriations Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Our charter is to review all aspects of the intelligence community and report to the Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Defense. The bill before you contains our first such set of recommendations, which have put everyone on notice that real Congressional oversight of intelligence activities has resumed after a long and dangerous lapse. 
   This panel--unprecedented in Congressional history I believe--appears to be making a difference. Chairman Obey and Chairman Murtha have taken the Speaker's proposal and made it succeed. Working in a bipartisan manner, the panel has made numerous recommendations ranging from increased funding for foreign language programs to restructuring of major intelligence programs. Those recommendations are incorporated into this bill. 
   I think almost all Americans now know that our national intelligence agencies activities around the globe affect their safety and prosperity at home. What I hope they will now also know is that we in the House have made the oversight changes necessary to help keep them safe and their liberties secure. 
   Let me close by saying that our Panel's work is just beginning, and that I look forward to reporting to the House occasionally on our activities.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, this tonight is about how our government treats its people. One of the characteristics of oppressive governments that we detest throughout history is that they spy on their own people. The chilling intrusion into people's lives, effects, and relationships must be controlled even if the government officers think that the intrusion is necessary to preserve safety, security and order. Indeed, civil protections are necessary, especially if the government says they are trying to protect safety, security and order. 
   Courts must establish that there is a probable cause to believe an American is a threat to society, and it must be the courts, not the Attorney General, not the Director of National Intelligence, who determine that the standard is being met. 
   Let me correct some points. There is not a huge gap. FISA is not broken. Do not believe these scare tactics. Legislation should not be passed to respond to fear-mongering. Of course, we need  good intelligence to protect Americans, but we are being asked to enter a ``just trust us'' form of legislation. Just trust an Attorney General who has provided demonstrably false or misleading testimony before Congress on this very issue. We are being asked to just trust this Attorney General with unlimited authority to authorize spying on Americans through this legislation without oversight of the courts, even after his own Inspector General has revealed massive abuses of civil liberties through his department's unchecked use of national security letters. 
   I urge my colleagues to recognize this for the historic importance it has and vote down this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - March 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the committee. 
   When Congress passed this bill last year, I lauded several of its features, provisions aimed at attracting and retaining people with good foreign language capability and understanding of foreign cultures, a provision bringing speed to security clearance processes for new hires, the provision directing the Director of National Intelligence to establish a multilevel security clearance process, a provision requiring the inspector general to review all covert action programs, and a number of other things. Getting these things right is critically important because intelligence is among the most important functions of our government. 
   A good intelligence system can save lives by preventing war, or, should war come, by helping to win the war as quickly as possible. But a flawed intelligence system can be dangerous, as when intelligence is manipulated so as to take America to war under false pretenses, or when fearsome powers of the government are turned on its own citizens without checks and balances. Indeed, it's because this President opposes checks and balances on our intelligence system that we are forced to have this veto override today. 
   Let's be clear, American personnel, civilian or military, should never engage in interrogation practices that amount to torture. The provision the President objects to would simply put the entire U.S. Government under one standard for interrogating detainees, the Army Field Manual. The heads of the Defense Intelligence Agency and the FBI have testified that the nontorture guidelines in this bill are adequate for their people to follow in interrogation of dangerous people. 
   If the President were serious about restoring our reputation in the world and about providing moral and legal clarity for all government employees involved in the handling or interrogation of detainees, he would never have  vetoed this bill. Providing that moral and legal clarity is our constitutional obligation. And to that end, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to override the President's veto.

I'm pleased to have been a co-sponsor of this bill, because the service programs and the new initiatives will help to address some of our Nation's toughest problems about poverty to natural disasters and will help improve the lives of millions of our most valuable citizens. The bill will increase the number of AmeriCorps volunteers by a third and will significantly increase the stipends for those volunteers. 
   I particularly want to highlight a section that I am proud of. It is a section that will create opportunities for professionals in the sciences and technical fields to keep America competitive. It engages scientists and engineers in volunteerism and encourages their efforts to address unmet education and human needs. It will use scientists, technicians, engineers and mathematicians, for example, to close the digital divide that creates such a chasm between low-income communities and the more privileged communities. 
   The bill also creates a national civilian conservation corps that, as a residential program, will be deployed in times of national need, such as emergencies and disasters. When not deployed in such circumstance, they will build infrastructure, protect the environment, conserve our resources, and help with urban and rural development. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is outstanding legislation. We really should commend Mrs. McCarthy as well as Chairman Miller, Mr. McKeon, and Mr. Platts for their work on this legislation.

   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the 21st Century Competitiveness Act of 2007. Taking most of its content from the National Academies Report ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' H.R. 2272 is the compilation of an ambitious legislative portfolio that will fulfill the Innovation Agenda. I was proud to help craft the Innovation Agenda, on which our nation is dependent for its future prosperity, and to serve on the conference committee of H.R. 2272. 
   As a scientist and educator, I have had the opportunity to work at several stages of our nation's science research pipeline. This bill contains sound strategies for addressing our lagging competitiveness at every stage of this pipeline, from K-12 education to research and development. Such a comprehensive approach is badly needed. H.R. 2272 creates programs for training teachers and for encouraging students to enter into fields where there is national need. It sets us on a necessary path to doubling our investment in the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy Office of Science, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. To ensure we are harnessing all available talent, this bill encourages underrepresented students to enter science and technology. It ensures that we do not lose talent at the early career bottleneck that follows completion of a terminal research-based degree. 
   I am also pleased that the two initiatives that I have championed in the House of Representatives have made it into the conference  report. The first is the Foreign Language Partnership, which is a competitive grant program to enable institutions of higher education and local educational agencies working in partnership to establish articulated programs of study in critical foreign languages so that students from the elementary through postsecondary level can advance their knowledge successfully and achieve higher levels of proficiency in a critical foreign language. 
   The second is State P-16 Councils--that is, primary school through college. The bill authorizes the Secretary of Education to award competitive grants to states to promote better alignment of elementary and secondary education with the knowledge and skills needed to succeed in academic credit-bearing coursework in institutions of higher education, in the 21st century workforce. 
   This bill will make us not only successful, but also a nation more worthy of success. It gives students with financial need better access to science and technology careers, empowering them to improve their lives and contribute to society. It makes necessary investments in energy research that will give our children a world we are proud for them to inherit. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution. Without its reforms, we will continue to lose our global lead in science, technology, and quality of life.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I commend the subcommittee and its chair for a good bill, and I wish to enter into a colloquy with the gentlewoman from Connecticut regarding funding for Community Food Projects and organic transitions research. 
   The 2007 farm bill that passed this House on Friday substantially increased the authorized funding for Community Food Projects, but it changed it from mandatory to discretionary. The CFP supports hundreds of innovative projects selected competitively, such as community kitchens, farmers markets, farm-to-school programs, in Connecticut among other States. I'm hoping that we can work toward finding discretionary funds for CFP. 
   Similarly, while the 2007 farm bill authorized a substantial increase in funding for various organic programs, funding for the organic transitions research program remained flat for the fiscal year. The market for organic food has reached $15 billion and is growing. Yet farmers need help making the transition from traditional to organic methods of farming, and without that help we will increasingly be dependent on overseas sources for organic products. 
   I ask the Chair to consider an increased level of funding for these programs.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008, and to commend the Committee and Subcommittee leadership for their efforts on the bill, but also to express my concern about the lack of funding for community food projects and the lack of an increase in funding for the organic transitions research program for Fiscal Year 2008. 
   The 2007 Farm Bill that passed the House on Friday substantially increased the authorization for Community Food Projects (CFP) funding, from $5 million to $30 million annually. However, it also changed the funding from mandatory to discretionary, and funding for CFP was not included in the FY 2008 Agriculture Appropriations bill that is before us today. 
   Hundreds of civic groups and associations throughout the country, as well as low-income consumers and farmers who produce for local and regional markets, benefit from this program. The program facilitates and builds the capacity of non-profit, community-based organizations so they can establish projects that meet the food needs of low-income populations; identify and address weakness in urban food systems, such as insufficient retail food stores in densely populations neighborhoods and poor access to healthy and fresh foods for schools; and promote comprehensive responses to food, farm, and nutrition issues by combining the resources of multiple sectors of the food system. From its inception in 1996 through 2007, CFP received mandatory funding under the Food Stamp Program and it has funded more than 240 innovative projects such as certified community kitchens, community supported agricultural operations, farmer's markets, agri-business incubators, farm-to-school programs and other projects. 
   I regret that the 2007 Farm Bill made CFP funding discretionary, if it remains so in the enacted bill, I hope that the Senate and House conferees will work to ensure that the prevailing level of funding for CFP will be provided in the enacted Fiscal Year 2008 Agriculture Appropriations bill. 
   In addition, I wish to stress the urgency of increasing funding for organic transitions research in Fiscal Year 2008. While the 2007 Farm bill will substantially increase funding for various organic programs, funding for the organic transitions research program has again remained flat for Fiscal Year 2008. The market for organic food has reached $15 billion and, according to the Organic Trade Association, growth in sales of organic food has been 15 percent to 21 percent each year since 1998, compared with 2 percent to 4 percent for total food sales. Although there are now 10,000 organic farms in the United States, that is not enough to keep pace with demand. As a result, organic food suppliers must increasingly look for organic produce and other agricultural products from overseas locations. 
   The Organic Transitions Program is a highly competitive grants program established as part of the Department of Agriculture's Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service. This national program has been extremely important to the organic farming community in funding research to assist farmers in overcoming the barriers to transitioning their farm operations into organic production. Through grants awarded under the program, for example, a university in the West has been funded to research ecological soil community management for enhanced nutrient cycling; a Northeastern university has been funded to research reducing off-farm grain inputs on northeast organic dairy farms; and another--a university in a Great Plains state--to fund research into the transition to sustainability. 
   The demand for research on a wide variety of topics related to organic agriculture has been increasing in proportion to the surging growth in the demand for organic agricultural products, and the benefits of this research accrue not simply to organic and other farmers, but to the entire health-conscious population. Notwithstanding this surge in demand, funding for organic research to facilitate the transition into organic farming methods has been holding steady at just under $2 million for the last few fiscal years, which represents only one-hundredth of one percent of the size of the industry the research is intended to support. 
   The organic transitions program has been extremely important to the organic farming community in funding research to assist farmers in overcoming the barriers to transitioning  their farm operations into organic production. My amendment to increase funding for this program to $5 million passed in the House last year, and I hope to see this level of funding included in the enacted Agriculture Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (ENSURING MILITARY READINESS THROUGH STABILITY AND PREDICTABILITY DEPLOYMENT POLICY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, the House is taking action today to bring some sanity back to our military deployment and rotation policies. I intend to vote for this bill. 
   We all know that because of these repeated deployments, the divorce rates of military families are up, and the financial burdens faced by our Guard and Reserve families have been enormous. While this bill cannot address all of the deployment-related problems confronting our military families, it would address one of the most glaring: insufficient down time and retraining between deployments. 
   If this bill becomes law, it would mandate dedicated periods of time between deployments for all servicemembers. For active duty personnel, the intervals between deployments would have to be at least as long as the last deployment itself. For our Guard and Reserve forces, the interval between deployments would have to be at least three times the length of a servicemember's last tour. 
   Every Member of this House can tell multiple stories they've heard from servicemembers or their family members about the toll that these multiple, sometimes back-to-back deployments take on our military families. Let me quickly relate one story I've heard, one of many reasons I'm voting for this bill today. 
   Bill Potter is an attorney and lecturer in politics at both Princeton University and Rutgers University. Just over a year ago, he wrote an op-ed in the Trenton Times regarding the situation of his nephew, a Marine Corps captain, who had been blinded in his right eye after being fired on by an Iraqi policeman-turned-insurgent--one of many Iraqi policemen-turned-insurgents that we have trained and armed with an inadequate counterintelligence effort by the Iraqi government to weed out such bad actors. 
   Bill's nephew is a remarkable young man. Wounded twice in Iraq on his first tour in 2005, recovered sufficiently to go on a deployment to the Pacific in 2006 and is now facing the prospect of a second tour in Iraq beginning in January 2008--and of leaving his now nine year-old son behind for a third time in as many years. 
   This young Marine--like so many others--has already paid too high a price for this President's misguided war in Iraq. This bill, if enacted, would at least give our servicemembers and their families some real down time between deployments--time to reconnect with each other, and time for these gallant Americans to get the rest and refresher training that they will need to face the future. It's for all of those reasons that I'm voting for this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (ADA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, I want to thank Majority Leader HOYER and Representative SENSENBRENNER for introducing the ADA Restoration Act last summer. ``I am a cosponsor of this bill and I am pleased that the House is considering this important legislation. 
   This July will mark the 18th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA. Unfortunately, as testimony before the House Committee on Education and Labor made clear in recent years, the Supreme Court has narrowed the scope of this law and created a new set of barriers for Americans with disabilities. Under this narrow interpretation, individuals with diabetes, heart conditions, epilepsy, mental retardation, cancer, and many other conditions have been denied their rights under the ADA because they are labeled as ``too functional'' to be considered ``disabled.'' 
   This legislation would restore protections for disabled Americans under the ADA and I am pleased that the bill we are considering today is supported by the disability community as well as the business community. This bill will reaffirm the ADA's mandate for the elimination of discrimination on the basis of disability and allow the ADA to reclaim its place among our Nation most important civil rights laws. 
   I am proud that my home State of New Jersey has enacted our own strong protections against employment discrimination or individuals with disabilities. My State's experience belies the claims made by some of the bill's opponents that this legislation is overprotective of individuals with disabilities. 
   In March, I hosted a roundtable discussion in New Jersey with representatives of disability organizations and individuals with disabilities and with representatives from corporate human resources departments. From that discussion, I drew information indicating that the Federal legislation is needed and that it could be implemented effectively. 
   At that discussion I heard from Jack, an employer in my district who was hesitant when approached by the ARC of New Jersey about hiring individuals with disabilities. Yet, today he now says they are some of his best employees. 
   Our Nation has come a long way since the passage of the ADA, from when the halls of Congress were not even accessible to disabled members. But, we have much progress yet to make to ensure that the American dream is truly accessible and available to all Americans.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6275, the Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008. 
   Forty years ago the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) was originally enacted to ensure that wealthiest Americans--like everyone else--paid their fair share of taxes. Prior to the enactment of the AMT, the wealthiest Americans were exploiting loopholes in the tax code to circumvent their societal obligations. However this tax, which was intended for a few hundred of the wealthiest Americans has never been adjusted to account for inflation. Through inflation and tax-rate creep the AMT has become a middle class tax hike. 
   We have been unable to pass a permanent fix to the AMT to prevent middle class Americans from fearing that they will get hit by the AMT every year. More families in Central New Jersey are affected by the AMT than anywhere else in the country. Over 33,000 of my constituents already pay the AMT, under the current law, and an additional 88,000 of my constituents would be subject to the AMT if we do not act to prevent the patch from expiring. American families are already suffering from skyrocketing gas and food prices that they did not build into their family budgets. Compounding this financial burden with an unexpected and undeserved tax hike would hit New Jersey families hard. Yet, that is what will happen if we do not take action today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have long been concerned with the growing debt that we are passing on to the next generation and have often called for a revision of the AMT that will not increase our national debt. The Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008 makes good on our promise to the American people that we will not spend money that Congress does not have. This legislation will offer more than 25 million families relief from the AMT without adding to the deficit. This will be achieved by promoting tax compliance, removing inequities in the tax code, and decreasing government subsidies to oil companies. 
   While I support this legislation, we need a permanent fix to ensure that this tax intended for the wealthiest Americans is not passed down to middle income Americans and do so in a fiscally responsible way.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that with the vote recently completed, we will move toward research in embryonic stem cells. 
   My home State of New Jersey asserted real national leadership on stem cell research. In 2005, New Jersey became the first State in the Nation to award public funds for research on human embryonic stem cells. But one State or another supporting this research is not a substitute for Federal support. 
   Opponents of this legislation that we passed say that we should pursue alternative avenues for research such as adult stem cells, cord blood cells, amniotic fluid cells, and they are correct. We should investigate each one of these avenues. Yet that is not a compelling reason to block the researchers from pursuing embryonic stem cell research, which experts agree hold the greatest potential because of the truly broad nature of these embryonic stem cells.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3221, the Foreclosure Prevention Act. 
   At the end of last year, home foreclosure rates rose to the highest level in 20 years. Every day more than 7,000 people file for foreclosure, and it is predicted that predatory lending practices and sub prime mortgages will cause one in every thirty-three homeowners to foreclose on their mortgages in the next 2 years. 
   This is not an issue that is merely affecting those who have defaulted on their mortgages and their lenders; it is having a ripple effect throughout the economy. It has resulted in a nationwide decrease in housing prices of 12.4 percent, and 10 percent of Americans now owe more money on their mortgages than their homes are worth. It has caused a decrease in consumer confidence and corresponding decrease in consumer spending. It has contributed to a steep increase in job losses in housing related industries such as manufacturing, construction and related industries. These job losses combined with the loss of consumer confidence could reduce economic activity by over 150 billion dollars in 2008. 
   This is a crisis, and it is time, it is past time, that the Federal Government step in and help those that are suffering. H.R. 3221 would provide mortgage refinancing assistance to keep families in their homes, protect neighboring home values, and help stabilize the housing market. It would expand the Federal Housing Administration to help borrowers who are at risk of losing their homes to refinance into lower-cost government-insured mortgages that they can afford to repay. H.R. 3221 ensures that this will be done responsibly, by requiring lenders and mortgage investors to take significant losses in order to participate in this program and by requiring borrowers to share a portion of any resale of a refinanced home with the government. 
   H.R. 3221 also provides 11 billion dollars in tax incentives to help Americans purchase a first home or hold onto the ones that they already have. This includes tax credits to first-time homebuyers, an additional 10 billion dollars in mortgage revenue bonds for states,  and improves access to low-income housing. It also includes a provision that I wrote to allow homeowners who currently do not itemize their Federal tax returns to take an additional standard deduction for the state and local property taxes that they pay. The Temporary Tax Relief Act creates an additional standard deduction of $350 for single filers and $700 for joint filers for state and local real property taxes paid or accrued. This legislation will complement efforts that have already been implemented on the state and federal level to help address the housing crisis. 
   I am proud that several organizations in my home state of New Jersey have stepped in to provide services and assistance to New Jerseyans who are at risk of losing their homes. One of the shining examples of this is Legal Services of New Jersey. LSNJ created the Anti-Predatory Lending Project 5 years ago to provide legal services to borrowers victimized by predatory lenders. LSNJ's hardworking lawyers have helped almost 500 families who were facing foreclosure receive legal assistance. I would like to commend LSNJ for the work that they have done on behalf of the residents of my central New Jersey district and for all New Jerseyans who have been at risk of losing their homes. 
   H.R. 3221 and the companion bill that the House of Representatives will be considering, H.R. 5818, the Neighborhood Stabilization Act are a bold step towards addressing the mortgage crisis and the resulting economic downturn, and I urge my colleagues to support them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, there are no words to describe the sorrow and the pain that we feel about the catastrophe that unfolded at Virginia Tech on Monday, April 16th. The most deadly shooting in our nation's history, it is indeed a tragedy of monumental proportions. 
   Among the 33 deaths in the attack at Virginia Tech were several New Jerseyans: Matt La Porte of Dumont; Michael Pohle from Raritan Township; and Julia Pryde, a biological systems engineering graduate student from Middletown and a resident of the 12th Congressional District. Two other Virginia Tech students killed in the attack--Mary Read and Caitlin Hammaren--had ties to New Jersey, and another--Sean McQuade of Mullica Hill--remains in critical condition. 
   Schools, colleges, and universities should be a safe refuge for students and faculty. They are environments that are open to new ideas, encourage learning in all aspects of academics and life, and help young adults to discover themselves and prepare for a career. Like students at colleges all over the country, the students at Virginia Tech are ambitious, intelligent, and community-oriented young people. They chose Virginia Tech, I presume, because of its high academic quality and because of the safe, pleasant community where the university is located. 
   I cannot begin to understand the pain and confusion that students must feel about the tragic events that have gripped the quaint town of Blacksburg. I can only begin to understand the panic and terror that parents, family members, and friends must have felt wondering about the safety of their loved ones. 
   In times of tragedy like these, it is important for a community to come together to help each other come to terms with the calamity that has occurred. I hope and pray that the friends and family members of the victims, the students and faculty at Virginia Tech, and others find solace and comfort as we deal together with this historic and heartbreaking episode. 
   This tragedy should lead other schools to review and develop their own plans for security, emergency response, and communication. Also, Congress and the entire country should reflect on what appears to be a culture of ever-increasing violence, on the psychology and methods of perpetrators of violence, and on the easy availability of guns. If there is a federal role in dealing with these matters, and I think there is, Congress should act.

   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend the Rutgers women's basketball team for making all New Jerseyans proud through their athletic and academic achievements, as well as through the intelligence, dignity, and class that they showed in response to hateful, racist, and sexist remarks made about and against them. As one of two Members of Congress who represents Rutgers University here in Congress, I would like to pay tribute to them. 
   The Scarlet Knights had a remarkable season, winning 27 games on their way to the national championship game. The Big East Champions played hard and displayed all the attributes of a championship team--hustle, dedication, skill, and teamwork. But what distinguished this team most, in my opinion, is not what happened during the season, but after it. 
   It is unfortunate that the end of this amazing season was marked not by a celebration of their achievements on the basketball court and in the classroom, but by ignorant, racist, and sexist remarks by a radio personality. The players and coaches were understandably hurt and angry, and their reaction to these hateful words shows why all New Jerseyans deserve to be proud. 
   The players and Coach Vivian Stringer reacted with restraint, eloquence, and dignity. They engaged with the person who had insulted them. They told their personal views of why his words were so hurtful and inappropriate, and they accepted his apology. I hope that this incident will lead to a broader dialogue about race relations in this country. I look forward to working with community and religious leaders, elected officials, and others in New Jersey to foster an atmosphere where such comments are not only condemned, but do not happen in the first place. 
   We hold up college athletics not for the entertainment of alumni and fans, but because we believe athletic participation builds character. These women of the Rutgers basketball team showed that they have character.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (REVOLUTIONARY WAR AND WAR OF 1812 BATTLEFIELD PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlelady from Guam. And I rise as the author of H.R. 160, the American revolution and War of 1812 Battlefield Protection Act, and to urge support of this legislation by my colleagues. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Rahall and Chairman Grijalva for their help in bringing this legislation to the floor today. 
   Madam Speaker, from the shot heard around the world at Lexington to the beginning of the winning, when Washington crossed the Delaware, to the surrender of Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown, the stories of the American revolution bring to life the ideals of liberty and democracy fostered by our Nation's Founders. 
   History is best experienced by those who can touch it, feel it, live it, and the battlefields of the American Revolution and the War of 1812 provide a great opportunity for Americans to experience where and how the epic struggle for our Nation's independence took place. 
   Preserving these American historic treasures is essential in remembering the sacrifices that our forefathers made to secure our freedom and independence, and essential for educating future generations about our rich cultural history. 
   Unfortunately, urbanization, suburban sprawl, unplanned development are constantly encroaching on many of the significant battlefields of that period. This encroachment poses a severe and growing risk to preservation of these historically significant sites. 
   As Ms. Bordallo has just said, this spring the National Park Service published its report to Congress on the historic preservation of Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 sites in the United States. And this report shows that there is a great need to act and to act quickly to preserve these sites. Out of the 677 nationally significant battlefields and associated sites of the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, 99 are already lost forever, 234 are fragmented or in poor condition, an additional 170 are in danger of being destroyed in the next decade. 
   H.R. 160 will authorize the use of money in the Land and Water Conservation Fund for the preservation and protection of the Revolutionary War and War of 1812 battlefields and related historical sites, in addition to the Civil War sites already covered under current law. And I might add, that law has been very successful. This legislation is patterned after the Civil War battlefields legislation which has been so successful. 
   This bill will allow officials of the American Battlefield Protection Program to collaborate with State and  local governments and nonprofit organizations to preserve and protect the most endangered historical sites, and to provide up to 50 percent of the costs of purchasing battlefield land threatened by sprawl and commercial development.     
   The story of the American Revolution and the War of 1812 crisscrosses 33 States, from New York to Louisiana, from Georgia to Oregon, and enacting this legislation will allow these States to better preserve their history and their role in these engagements. 
   I have also introduced legislation that I hope Congress will pass next year to provide additional funding for the program created in H.R. 160, the American Revolution and War of 1812 Commemorative Coin Act. 
   As the gentleman from Alaska alluded, my home State of New Jersey has a unique role in the American Revolution. In 2006, I am pleased to report, Congress took action to help protect the battlefields and historic sites where this conflict took place. We passed legislation that created the Crossroads of the American Revolution national heritage area, linking together 14 counties in New Jersey where more military engagements took place than in any other State. New Jersey was truly the crossroads of the American Revolution for a number of reasons, and I am pleased that we are taking steps to preserve the record of those engagements. H.R. 160 will allow many more historic battlefields to be preserved for our children's and our children's children to enjoy. We want to give Americans the opportunity to learn history. People who know history can be better citizens today and more engaged in current civic affairs. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I am pleased to rise to say that not only do we have enough time to debate this, but we have a very good, well-structured bill in front of us. 
   It is an important role of the Federal Government to look after the safety and the security of the American people. This bill does that. It is a well-structured bill that gives telecom companies the opportunity they have asked for to defend themselves in court. It provides for a congressional commission that will look at how electronic surveillance has been conducted and will make recommendations. It includes a reasonable expiration date to keep Congress involved in the oversight of this. And I would argue most importantly this legislation provides prior involvement of the court in all intercepts of communications of Americans. Critically important. 
   Here are the facts. This bill gives our intelligence community the flexibility they need to collect information on our enemies while protecting the American people in every aspect. And it mandates extensive reviews and reporting requirements on the electronic surveillance programs in question. It rejects the President's efforts to redefine the relationship between the people and their government, a very key point. 
   I commend the Speaker, the leader, the Chair of the Judiciary Committee, the Chair of the Intelligence Committee for negotiating with a firm tone and a principled approach to give us very good legislation, a very good bill despite the fact that they've had to work with the relentless drumbeat of propaganda and disinformation orchestrated by the administration in this matter. I commend them for producing such good legislation in such difficult circumstances.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON S. CON. RES. 21, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, a budget is a moral document that demonstrates our values and priorities. This budget Conference Report, brought to us by Chairman John Spratt represents values I can be proud of. This budget makes real investments in education, healthcare, housing and research and development while bringing the budget back to surplus by 2012. 
   At a time when more than ten percent of students drop out of high school before graduating and only four out of ten children eligible for Head Start are able to participate, this budget reverses the Administration's policy of under-investing in education for our children. The budget rejects the President's proposal to cut funding for the Department of Education by $1.5 billion below the 2007 enacted level and to eliminate 44 entire programs. It instead provides for substantial new investments in vital programs such as Head Start, special education (IDEA), Title I and other programs under the No Child Left Behind Act. The bill also funds an increase in Pell Grants so that high school students will know that if they work hard, they can go to college. 
   The budget rejects the President's proposal to cut funding for the Community Development Block Grant program by $1.1 billion below last year's level, and instead provides for the first CDBG increase since 2005. The cut advocated by the President would endanger job creation, economic development, and affordable housing efforts, cutting CDBGs for nearly 1,200 state and local governments. 
   This budget rejects the President's proposal to cut Child Care Development Block Grants and Social Services Block Grants by $520 million below the 2007 level. The President's budget would lead to a decline in valuable assistance for child care that allows many working parents to earn a living. The Conference Report would allow for the first increase in this funding since 2002. 
   Further, knowing that we now have more uninsured Americans than six years ago, this budget blocks the President's proposed cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. These cuts would have made healthcare less affordable and accessible for millions of Americans. This budget ensures that up to $50 billion over the next five years will be devoted to the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) so that millions of uninsured children can be covered. New Jersey is a national leader in covering children through the SCHIP program and this additional funding is desperately needed to ensure our state's good work, and that of other states, can continue. 
   This budget reverses the President's dangerous cuts to our nation's first responders. What sense would it make to cut the Local Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention program, Firefighter assistance grants, Byrne Justice Assistance Grants, or the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program? Our budget stands up for first responders and ensures that each of the programs receives appropriate levels of funding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr. Spratt and the Budget Committee conferees for demonstrating that we can provide for our nation's defense in a responsible way--both fiscally and from a policy standpoint. This budget will provide $507 billion in Department of Defense budget authority, an $18 billion increase over the President's request. This budget also emphasizes the right priorities for meeting our security needs. 
   For example, this resolution opposes TRICARE fee increases and calls for a substantial increase in the veterans' health care system. The budget resolution notes the upcoming recommendations of the President's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors and other government investigations in connection with the Walter Reed scandal, and allows funds for action when those recommendations are received. To help protect our nation from a terrorist-sponsored nuclear attack, non-proliferation programs such as the Cooperative Threat Reduction program are given greater priority and higher funding. 
   This budget also helps us keep our promises to our nation's veterans. I'm pleased the committee has recommended increasing discretionary funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs from $36.5 billion to $43.1 billion--a $6.6 billion (18.1%) increase over FY07, and a $3.5 billion increase (8.9%) over the Administration request for FY08. This budget provides a far more realistic spending plan than the President's proposal. Our proposed increase in this area will help meet critical needs, including ensuring that medical inflation does not erode VA's ability to deliver quality health care to our veterans. 
   In order to maintain American competitiveness, we must make substantial investments in scientific research and education. The budget provides funding for initiatives to educate new scientists, engineers, and mathematicians in the next four years, and places more highly-qualified teachers in math and science K-12 classrooms. It makes critical investments in basic research, putting us on the  path to doubling funding for the National Science Foundation, and bolstering investments in research and development throughout the budget. 
   America's dependence on oil endangers our environment, our national security, and our economy. A sustained investment in research and development is crucial to creating cutting-edge technologies that allow us to develop clean, sustainable energy alternatives and capitalize on America's vast renewable natural resources. The budget provides increased funding for basic and applied energy research. 
   For the first time in 6 years, the Budget Resolution reflects a real commitment to protecting our most valuable natural resources by providing needed funding for our National Parks, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and the national wildlife refuge system. H. Con. Res. 99 provides a total of $31.4 billion for environmental programs, which is $2.6 billion more than the President's request. I have been an advocate for the Land and Water Conservation Fund since I came to Congress eight years ago and I am pleased that we are finally at a place where the budget includes adequate funding for both the state-side grant program and the federal program. LWCF and the Forest Legacy program have done tremendous work in states across the country, including New Jersey, to protect open space, restore wetlands, and conserve forests lands. In the face of mounting evidence on the perilous state of our environment, it continues to amaze me why President Bush continues to turn a blind eye to our growing needs in this area. Finally, we have a budget that realizes how important this investment is to preserving our natural resources and promoting conservation. 
   This budget achieves all of these objectives and investments without an increase in taxes. The budget would accommodate immediate relief for the tens of millions of middle income households who would otherwise be subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), while supporting the efforts of the Committee on Ways and Means to achieve permanent, revenue-neutral AMT reform. Unless the AMT is reformed, 19 million additional families will have to pay higher taxes in 2007. The budget would also accommodate extension of other middle-income tax relief provisions, consistent with the Pay-As-You-Go principle that include: the child tax credit, marriage penalty relief, the 10 percent bracket, and the deduction for state and local sales taxes. 
   The past 6 years of fiscal irresponsibility have caused America's national debt to increase by 50 percent, an amount of nearly $9 trillion, or $29,000 for every American. Our ability to invest in the Nation's shared priorities is constrained by the cost of the debt run up over the last 6 years, when the administration and its partners in previous Congresses turned the largest surplus in American history into a record debt. About 75 percent of America's new debt has been borrowed from foreign creditors such as China, making our fiscal integrity a matter of national security. Over the last 6 years, President Bush has borrowed more money from foreign nations than the previous 42 U.S. Presidents combined. 
   Mr. Speaker, this budget reflects values that we can all be proud of. It meets the basic needs of Americans, invests in priorities important to our future while putting us on the path to fiscal responsibility. I ask my colleagues to vote for the Budget Conference Report.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crime Prevention Act, H.R. 1592. This legislation seeks to address the pernicious effects that hate crimes have on our society. 
   Bigotry, bias, and ignorance have existed since the dawn of time. Yet, in a country founded on the principles of freedom, equality and liberty for all, we must do all we can to stop individuals from committing crimes based solely on prejudice. 
   According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Report, there were 7,163 hate crimes committed in 2005 and we can be sure that number is low for crimes that are underreported. Hate crimes are very real. And each hate crime spreads fear and violence among an entire community. It's long past time for Congress to pass this important legislation to help prosecute those who would commit these heinous acts. 
   To paraphrase Martin Luther King, the laws we pass may not change the heart; but they can restrain the heartless. 
   As an original cosponsor of this legislation, I believe it is the fundamental role of government to protect its citizens. Therefore, it is necessary and proper for the federal government to work in conjunction with local law enforcement officials to robustly prosecute crimes motivated by bigotry. 
   The Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act expands our Nation's existing hate crimes laws to ensure that certain violent crimes committed against an individual because of race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability are prosecuted. As this bill states, bias and bigotry related crime ``savages the community sharing the traits that caused the victim to be selected'' for the crime, Additionally, this legislation expands the hate crime statute by dropping the requirement that the victim had been engaged in six specifically defined federally protected activities, such as voting. 
   H.R. 1592 also creates a grant program for the federal government to assist state and local law enforcement agencies in investigating and prosecuting hate crimes. State and local law enforcement prosecute the overwhelming majority of hate crimes. However, investigating and prosecuting these acts takes more time and resources than many local and state agencies may possess. Thus, H.R. 1592 authorizes the federal government to provide tools and resources that are needed by local law enforcement. 
   This legislation is supported by the National Sheriffs Association, National District Attorneys Association, International Association of Chiefs of Police, International Brotherhood of Police Officers, National Coalition of Public Safety Officers, Anti-Defamation League, American Jewish Committee, Consortium of Developmental Disabilities Councils, Human Rights Campaign, NAACP, National Victim Center, United States Conference of Mayors, National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, American Association on Mental Retardation, and more than 200 other law enforcement, religious, civil rights, and civic organizations. 
   By making our Nation's hate crimes statutes more comprehensive, we will take a needed step in favor of tolerance and against prejudice and hate-based crime in all its forms. This legislation sends a strong message that hate-based crime cannot be tolerated and will be vigorously prosecuted.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of the Technology Innovation and Manufacturing Stimulation Act, H.R. 1868. This important legislation is part of an ambitious initiative that will fulfill the Innovation Agenda. 
   I am proud of my efforts to help craft the Innovation Agenda, which will help provide for future prosperity through wise investments. H.R. 1868 is an integral part of this effort and will help meet the Agenda's call to double funding over the next 10 years for the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the Department of Energy's Office of Science. NIST exists to improve our Nation's economic security and quality of life through the improvement of technology and related sciences and standards. This legislation puts us well on the path to doubling our investment in NIST by setting the appropriate authorization levels through 2010. This will mean actual authorizations of $470.9 million in FY 2008 and $537.6 million in FY 2010. These increases are necessary investments in revitalizing NIST's staffing, activity, and physical infrastructure, particularly at a time when we face unprecedented levels of international competition. 
   In this bill, the Technology Innovation Program (TIP) is created. TIP gives businesses and universities grants that encourage high-risk investments in technology, in cases where such investments have potential widespread economic benefits. This is a sound use of taxpayer money, as projected economic payoff to society is a necessary precondition for issuance of a grant. This program helps to solve the failure of market forces to encourage full investment in research and development. This failure of market forces is rooted in the fact that only one third of the financial reward of research and development investment is felt by investors, with the rest being felt by society as a whole. 
   H.R. 1868 also improves the competitiveness of the American manufacturing industry by creating postdoctoral fellowships for related research, and by creating a manufacturing research pilot grants program for interdisciplinary collaborations between businesses, State governments, nonprofits, and universities. 
   By strengthening our existing investment in our national technology and manufacturing capacity and through the creation of new related programs, this bill is a crucial element of the Innovation Agenda to maintain American economic security and global leadership. I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution.

This bill eliminates all earmarks, some for worthy projects like job training, community-based healthcare, and boys and girls clubs. I had hoped that each of the eleven FY 07 appropriations bills would have passed separately into law last year, with proper funding increases to ensure that we are investing for the future. Unfortunately, the last Congress only passed two. 
   The last Congress failed at this, and we are left now left to pass a continuing resolution for the rest of FY07 without the detailed fine-tuning and funding increases the bills normally contain. The Republican failures on the budget created the worst budget mess since the Government shut down in 1996. It is no wonder that the debt has increased by more than $3 trillion since Republicans took control of the Government. 
   The funding of scientific research is crucial to our competitiveness, economic well-being, and quality of life. Flat funding in the context of inflation is difficult for everyone, but it is particularly damaging to scientific enterprise. Scientific budget items must change dramatically each year as large projects with short lives are constructed, go into operation, and are replaced. This year would be a particularly bad time for flat funding in the sciences. We have new international commitments to energy research and new national projects that have completed construction and require operating budgets. We also have unprecedented and much-needed consensus to increase funding in the sciences to keep pace with our international peers. To this end, wrote with two others letters to the Appropriations Committee raising concerns about the impact of flat funding on the Department of Energy's Office of  Science and on the National Science Foundation. These letters were signed by a sizeable fraction of the House, and I am pleased that the Appropriations Committee has addressed this matter, fully for the NSF and appreciably for the DOE Office of Science. I look forward to increased funding for research at NSF and for fusion energy in the FY 08 appropriations. 
   I would like to point out a few positive points in the bill. This bill provides for a $3.6 billion increase over last year's level for VA healthcare funding. I'm pleased that this increase will make it possible for us to provide services for an additional 325,000 patients in the VA medical system, and to meet rising healthcare costs as have more returning veterans than any time since the Vietnam era. I'm also pleased that the bill includes some $4 billion for our housing program for military families. These gains are important, but we have much more to do. As we begin looking at funding priorities for fiscal year 2008 and beyond, I believe it is imperative that the Congress finally meet America's obligation to provide for full funding of our veterans' health care system. VA hospital and clinic administrators cannot provide consistent, quality services and proper continuity of care over time unless they know how much money they have to work with. The existing discretionary appropriations process for VA healthcare is not working, and only a move 
   to mandatory funding can solve this chronic problem. I look forward to voting for such a proposal this year. 
   The bill raises the maximum Pell grant award from $4,050 to $4,310. This increase, the first in 4 years, recognizes the essential role of the Pell grant program in improving access to higher education and as a critical component in comprehensive efforts to address college affordability. For years under Republican leadership, Congress all but ignored the growing college cost crisis that was preventing many qualified students from going to college. Now, in just the first month of this new Democratic Congress, the House has already voted overwhelmingly to cut interest rates on need-based Federal student loans. And we have another major step towards putting a college education within reach of every qualified student by boosting the Pell grant scholarship by $260. 
   The bill also increases Title I school funding by $125 million, bringing total funding from $12.7 to $12.8 billion. The proposed increase would reverse the decline in Title I funding since 2005 and would allow additional reading and math services for some 38,000 eligible children. I also support the proposed $125 million for the Title I school improvement fund. These funds, if passed would be targeted to the 6,700 schools designated as needing improvement under No Child Left Behind, thereby allowing them to implement professional development initiatives, tutoring programs, and other improvements designed to raise student achievement. 
   The bill also spends $4.5 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion, to expand efforts to combat HIV/AIDS and TB programs, including in the 15 focus countries and the multilateral efforts through the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, TB, and Malaria. The bill also spends $248 million, an increase of $149 million, to allow the Agency to expand its bilateral global malaria initiative activities from the current three countries to seven. 
   The chairman deserves ones thanks for negotiating a bill better than a traditional continuing resolution, which would have jeopardized American national security, resulted in thousands of layoffs, and cut off healthcare for members of the U.S. Armed Forces and veterans. For example, the Food Safety and Inspection Service would have faced a month of furloughs, resulting in the closure of 6,000 meat processing plants; the federal judiciary would have had to fire 2,500 workers; and the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab and other research facilities would have had to stop projects and layoff scientists. I ask my colleagues to pass this bill so that we can begin the FY 08 appropriations and make more important investments in our future.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (ACT COMMEMORATING THE LITE, OR LIFETIME INNOVATIONS OF THOMAS EDISON -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Lifetime Innovations of Thomas Edison Act, originally sponsored by my colleague Mr. Payne from New Jersey, with others of us from New Jersey joining him. The legislation before us would reclassify the Edison home and laboratory as a National Historic Park. 
   First dedicated as the Edison National Historic site by the National Park Service in 1962, the site is badly in need of restoration. Dedicating this site as a National Historic Park and authorizing funding for the preservation of the Edison home and laboratory will preserve a national treasure. As you have heard from my colleague, the collection there, as well as the buildings themselves, are of great historical national importance. 
   Thomas Edison was one of America's most prominent inventors. From starting one of the first industrial laboratories, something that is often forgotten, to inventing the first incandescent light bulb, the motion picture, the phonograph, et cetera, Edison played an integral role in the technological advances that helped spur America's industrial revolution. 
   Mr. Edison held over 1,000 patents in the United States and other countries, was named by Life magazine as the man of the millennium, and awarded the Congressional Gold Medal by the Congress in 1928 for his development and application of inventions that have revolutionized civilization. Thomas Edison certainly deserves to be remembered and his collection deserves to be preserved. 
   The 13.5 acre site will make an outstanding national historic park. It will draw people from all across the country to see the important collection there, as well as the site of the first really major scientific industrial laboratory in the United States. 
   Despite being designated a national historic site, it has fallen into disrepair, and in 1992 the National Trust for Historic Preservation listed this as one of the Nation's most endangered historic places. This redesignation is of great importance. Mr. Speaker, we are not only recognizing Thomas Edison's numerous contributions to American society, but we will, with this, be preserving the Edison National Historic Site as a leading educational, scientific, and cultural center. 
   I thank the gentlelady.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (LILLY LEDBETTER FAIR PAY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the principle of equal pay for equal work and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2007, H.R. 2831. 
   On May 29, 2007, the Supreme Court issued a disturbing and retrobressive ruling. In a 5-4 ruling the Court issued its decision in a sex discrimination case, Ledbetter v. Goodyear, that fundamentally changed protections that American workers have enjoyed for more than 40 years when they were codified in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
   As a member of the House Committee on Education and Labor, I participated in a hearing on the flawed ruling in Ledbetter v. Goodyear. During that hearing the Committee heard testimony from Lilly Ledbetter describing the pay discrimination that resulted in her earning twenty percent less than the lowest paid man in the same position at Goodyear. 
   Applying the law as it was written and intended, the trial court awarded Lilly Ledbetter backpay and compensatory damages because of Goodyear's illegal sex discrimination. On appeal it went all the way to the Supreme Court, where Justice Samuel Alito led the 5-4 majority in dismissing the case. According to Justice Alito, when Lilly Ledbetter failed to file a discrimination case within the statutorily provided 180 days from the initial decision to pay her less than her male colleague, she was barred from filing a complaint and no relief was available. Despite documenting the sex based evaluation system Goodyear managers used, Lilly Ledbetter was denied justice and the rights afforded to her under the Civil Rights Act. 
   In a strongly worded dissent Judge Ginsburg noted the fallacy of the Majority's argument regarding the timeliness of Lilly Ledbetter's filing. She reminded the Court that a previous ruling that held each ``paycheck perpetuating a past discrimination . . . are actionable not simply because they are `related' to a decision made outside the charge-filing period . . . but because they discriminate anew each time they are issued.'' 
   Judge Ginsburg explicitly called on Congress to intervene and uphold the protections provided by the letter and the spirit of the law, saying ``the ball is in Congress' court.'' 
   Today, we answer Judge Ginsburg's call and reverse this disturbing Supreme Court decision. Today, we make clear that Congress is committed to protecting the rights of American workers and to ensuring that they have adequate remedies if they are discriminated against in the workplace. 
   The passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2007 clarifies that when it comes to discriminatory pay, the protections of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act extend not only to these discriminatory pay decisions and practices but to every paycheck that results from those pay decisions and practices. Any reasonable citizen who believes that we need protect the rights of workers for fair treatment at the workplace and fair pay would surely find the Supreme Court decision unreasonable. We must act once to reestablish fairness. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY CONSERVATION TAX ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5351, the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2008. 
   For the last 20 years, my colleagues in the scientific community have issued warnings that the release of greenhouse gases is altering the earth's climate in ways that are both expensive and deadly. It is well established that the climate change of recent decades can be attributed to the way we use energy. In fact, the greatest insult to our planet is the way we produce and use energy. This is one of the principle subjects that I have spoken about and worked on since I first ran for Congress, and it is one of the reasons, I believe, that my constituents sent me to Congress. 
   As an energy scientist, I know how much can be done technically to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and to slow the rate of climate change. Last year, Congress passed H.R. 6, the Energy Independence and Security Act, historic legislation that took the long overdue first steps toward addressing global climate change and addressing our long term energy needs. Unfortunately, the U.S. Senate removed a provision from the H.R. 6 that would have repealed billions in tax subsidies for oil companies and instead invested in the production of renewable energy. I am pleased that the House is reconsidering these important provisions today in H.R. 5351. If this legislation becomes law it will be a significant second step toward implementing a rational, sustainable national energy policy. 
   Today, consumers are paying more at the pump than ever before. My constituents in my Central New Jersey district are paying $2.95 at the pump, a 119 percent increase from what they paid in 2001. Gas prices throughout the country over the last two weeks have risen an additional 17 cents, and oil prices have reached a record high at $102 per barrel. While American families transportation and heating costs continue to rise, the five top oil companies posted record profits for 2007, and ExxonMobil posted the largest corporate profit in American history of $40.6 billion. At this time of record profits, oil companies are receiving huge government subsidies. It is past time that we reverse this failed policy which has only benefited big oil companies at the expense of American families and our environment. 
   The legislation before us today would eliminate the $18 billion in tax breaks that have been awarded to big oil. It will use this money to extend and expand tax incentives for renewable electricity, energy and fuel, as well as for plug-in hybrid cars, and energy efficient homes, buildings, and appliances. Specifically, it would extend existing tax credits for the production of renewable energy, including solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, hydro, landfill gas and trash combustion, as well as adding new incentives for the use and production of renewable energy. 
   My home state of New Jersey has been a leader in solar production, with over 2,400 solar installations in place and I am told that it has the fastest growing solar market in the United States. The extension of the solar energy tax credit through 2016 will help ensure that the use of solar will continue to proliferate in New Jersey. This will help New Jerseyans reach our goal of having 20 percent of the State's electricity come from renewable sources by 2020. 
   The renewal of these tax credits will also help to increase our economy by creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. According to a recent study, if the renewable energy tax breaks expire at the end of this year over 116,000 jobs in wind and solar industries would be lost in one year. Today, when the predicted economic growth forecast is an anemic pace of 1.3 to 2 percent and unemployment is likely to climb above percent, we in Congress should do everything we can to ensure job growth and preserve jobs. 
   Of course, this bill is not enough. If it becomes law it will be an excellent continuation of the work we began last year. Having passed this bill we will be able to continue to consider other alternative energy and climate change legislation, and I am confident that we will. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, almost before the ink was dry on the February 22 letter to Intelligence Chairman Reyes claiming that the telecommunications companies were balking at their surveillance support requests, the DNI and Attorney General were forced to admit that the companies were, in fact, cooperating with the U.S. Government surveillance activities. It is not simple patriotic duty; it's the law. They must cooperate. Under FISA, if they're compelled to cooperate, they are automatically provided immunity. 
   The truth is that the only time FISA phone taps have been turned off lately is when the President failed to pay the FBI phone bills. If you don't believe me, look at the Inspector General's report of the Department of Justice in 2008 this year. 
   The real issue before us is this: How do we produce law that provides us better intelligence and safeguards Americans' liberties? The answer is we've done it through the RESTORE Act, and the sooner that House-passed bill becomes the law of the land, the better. Requiring the government to apply to a court and demonstrate to a standard of probable cause that they know what they're doing not only protects the liberty of Americans, it produces better intelligence.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (FAA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization bill of 2007, H.R. 2881. 
   This summer's record delays at many of our Nation's airports have made it evident that our air traffic control system is in desperate need of reform. According to the FAA, 25 percent of flights arrived late, nearly 3 percent of flights were cancelled and customer complaints doubled since last year. My central New Jersey constituents who use Newark Liberty International Airport suffer from the worst delays in the country with only 55 percent of flights arriving on time. 
   The legislation before us today will give the FAA the tools it needs in order to reduce these delays and help increase flight safety. It will provide the much needed funding to modernize our aging air traffic control system and to strengthen and rebuild airport infrastructure. It will require the FAA to meet with airport officials and airlines to ensure flight reductions in areas where over-scheduling is causing chronic delays. This bill will make sure that there are the adequate consumer protections in place to protect our Nation's airline passengers. 
   Few of us have forgotten the February 14, 2007 and December 29, 2006 incidents where hundreds of airline passengers were held on tarmacs for up to 10 hours in appalling conditions. These passengers were held in planes with foul air, backed up toilets, little food and water, and no information. The legislation before us today will ensure that these situations will be avoided in the future. 
   H.R. 2881 requires airlines and airports to have emergency contingency plans to take care of passengers that are involved in long tarmac delays. Through these plans it will mandate that these passengers have access to food, water, clean restrooms, medical care and requires that passengers are allowed to deplane. It also requires the Department of Transportation to enact regulations that will require airlines to fairly compensate passengers whose flights are cancelled. These commonsense protections will make sure that the airlines respect the basic needs and rights of passengers. 
   The Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization bill of 2007 contains a number of other provisions which will improve the way that our aviation industry operates. It will help protect our environment through requiring the development of more efficient engines that release less greenhouse gases into the air as well as directs the FAA to develop more energy efficient routes. Our Nation's air traffic controllers work long and stress-filled hours to ensure that we have the safest air travel in the world. This bill ensures that the FAA will be forced to come back to the contract negotiating table. It will also increase the number of aviation safety inspectors by one third, require the FAA to be more accountable, and improve the security of aircraft repair stations. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the FAA Reauthorization bill of 2007.

   It allows Pell Grants to be used year round and by part-time students. It empowers community colleges to provide childcare programs so that working mothers can attend school. It has grants and loan forgiveness for math, science, and foreign language students who pledge to work in those areas after graduation. 
   As the chairman just said, it creates a deputy assistant secretary for international and foreign language education. It directs the Institute of Medicine to study the shortage of nursing faculty, which is one of the principal reasons for the shortage of nurses in America. 
   It provides funding to institutions of higher education that encourage science and engineering students to develop foreign language proficiency. It creates a scholarship database of financial assistance for post-secondary and graduate programs in science, technology, and engineering. 
   There are many other good features in this bill, and I, again, commend those who put it together. And I urge my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON S. CON. RES. 70, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, a budget is a moral document that demonstrates our values and priorities. I want to congratulate Chairman SPRATT for again bringing forth a budget that represents values of which we can be proud. This budget would make real investments in education, hometown security, veterans' programs, healthcare, and research and development while bringing the budget back to surplus by 2012. 
   I am pleased that this Fiscal Year 2009 budget continues to follow the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) principle that the House restored at the start of the 110th Congress. This ensures that every new dollar of spending is offset and will not worsen the deficit. Although the budget resolution does not set the taxes or appropriation money, it does lay out the plan for the coming years to spend money and to raise revenues. 
   The budget would require the Ways and Means Committee to find the savings required to prevent millions of new Americans from having to pay the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), which has slowly morphed into a middle-class tax hike. More families in Central New Jersey are affected by the AMT than anywhere else in the country. Last year, Congress prevented nearly 23 million Americans, including more than 88,000 in the 12th Congressional District, from paying the AMT in 2008. Without action on this issue even more Americans would be affected by the AMT in the future. 
   With the price of oil now over $130 a barrel, this budget would make a significant investment in our Nation's energy future by providing $7.7 billion for renewable energy, energy efficiency, and other energy programs. This is $2.8 billion--or 55 percent--more than the Fiscal Year 2008 budget. In doing so, the budget would reject the President's budget cuts to energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, and instead invest $2 billion in new programs to create ``green collar jobs.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, this budget honors our commitment to our Nation's children by investing in education. The budget would provide $8.4 billion above the President's request--new funding that could support vital programs like Head Start, special education, school improvement programs, and Title 1. The budget also would help make college more affordable and accessible for students in New Jersey and throughout the country by increasing funding that could support Pell grants, Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, and programs that broaden access to Historically Black Colleges and Universities. 
   Facing difficult and uncertain economic times, this budget would invest in job creation and job training. In addition to investing in programs to create ``green collar jobs,'' we reject the President's cuts to Community Development Block Grants and his proposal to eliminate four job training programs. We also look to a long-term economic growth strategy, one that invests in science and research and development. This budget would 
   support our Innovation Agenda by increasing funding for the America COMPETES Act, which authorized robust funding for research at the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy's Office of Science. 
   Our budget also addresses the fact that our Nation has more Americans than ever living without health insurance, including over nine million children. We would include funding to provide up to $50 billion for children's health insurance. This would help insure millions of children. Likewise, our budget recognizes the importance of Medicaid and Medicare and would reject the President's harmful proposal to cut Medicaid by $94 billion and Medicare by $479 billion over ten years. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm proud of this budget's commitment to making America more safe and secure. Notably, we would provide additional funding to implement the 9/11 commission recommendations, including required 100 percent screening for shipping and air cargo. We would also place a greater emphasis on funding nuclear nonproliferation programs, one of the most severe threats to our security. 
   Additionally, we would restore funding for vital first responder programs, including the State Homeland Security Grant Program (cut $705 million), Firefighter Assistance Grants (cut $463 million), Byrne Justice Assistance Grants (eliminated all formula funding), and COPS (cut $599 million). 
   This budget continues our commitment to fully fund veterans' health care by providing $48.2 billion for 2009, which is $4.9 billion (11.4 percent) more than the 2008 level. In fact, it would provide $3.3 billion more than the President's budget for 2009 and $39 billion more over five years. Consistent with past practice, the President's budget actually cuts funding after the first year. This budget also would allow the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to treat 5.8 million patients in 2009, including an estimated 333,275 Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans, many of whom suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injuries, or blast-related injuries. Additionally, the budget rejects the health care fee increases imposed by the President's budget, which total $2.3 billion over five years, including a new enrollment fee and pharmaceutical co-payment increases. Finally, this budget increases funding to speed disability claims processing, so that VA can continue to reduce its backlog. 
   I would like to recognize the budget's impact on voting reform. Implementing a nationwide requirement for independently auditable, and audited, vote counts is a priority of mine. As such, I was deeply disappointed that the President's budget made no request for funding under Title II of the Help America Vote Act. Approximately $560 million of the funding authorized under that Title remains unappropriated, and jurisdictions across the country could use that funding to improve the accuracy, integrity and security of their voting systems, as well as improve the administration of elections generally. Additionally, I was disappointed to see that the President requested only half of what remains authorized to fund disability access grants to ensure polling place accessibility. As we continue to debate the budget, we should address these budget shortfalls. 
   Mr. Speaker, this budget reflects values for which we can be proud. We reject cuts to important healthcare, education, veterans, and national security programs while maintaining our commitment to fiscal responsibility. By adopting this budget and supporting the designated funding levels throughout the appropriations process, we would be investing in priorities important to our future.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE FOR SECURE ELECTIONS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. I thank the gentlelady. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge my colleagues to support the Emergency Assistance for Secure Elections Act of 2008. 
   This is a bill that is optional for counties. It's to encourage counties and States to do the right thing. We should all want national standards of accessibility, reliability and auditability for our elections. This is an emergency stop-gap measure to see that we achieve as much of that as possible before the November elections. 
   The principle is simple. Anything of value should be auditable. Votes are valuable. They should be audited so that voters can have the confidence that each vote is recorded the way the voter intended. In too many places around the United States, votes are not audited. 
   In too many places around the United States, they are not even auditable. Voters leave the polling places wondering if their vote will be counted as they intended and election losers and their supporters are left wondering if they can believe the results. 
   Already in this primary season, there have been numerous, numerous problems, questions, and unresolved disputes. 
   In county after county, in State after State, electronic voting systems have failed in many ways, failure to start-up in the morning, a mismatch between the electronic count and the end-of-day printout, failed memory cards, and on and on and on. In too many places, the irregularities can not be resolved. There is no way to resolve them. There is no way to know because there is no record of the voter's intentions. 
   This legislation would reimburse counties and States for allowing voters to inspect paper-based records of their vote, in other words, paper ballots. That would not only make it possible for audits, but this legislation would go further and reward States for putting in place procedures to conduct those audits. This would go a long way toward restoring confidence in the process. 
   There is still time before November to secure our election system. If our Emergency Assistance for Secure Elections Act is enacted, localities could choose to convert to paper ballot voting systems, offer emergency paper ballots if machines fail, and to conduct audits to confirm the accuracy of the electronic tallies. 
   I want to stress that this is optional. We took great pains to accept the suggestions of the minority party, to take suggestions of election officials, to take suggestions of people all over the country, lawyers and others who have looked at elections in detail. We simplified this so that counties could not object that we were making them do something that we weren't going to support them on. This is optional. We have simplified it as much as possible so that it could be implemented in time for this year's election, and it could be.     
   This modest bill simply entitles jurisdictions to reimbursement for the costs to conduct fully auditable, fully audited elections. It will encourage States and counties that want to do the right thing on behalf of their voters. But time is of the essence. 
   If we don't take action immediately, we will not leave enough time for States that wish to opt to do so before the November election. Voters will lose further confidence in the system, and candidates will leave on election night wondering if they can trust the results. 
   Common Cause wrote: ``The security and reliability problems with electronic machines have been well documented. Both the State of California with the Top to Bottom Review and the State of Ohio with their study have documented numerous security vulnerabilities and have systems and have taken action to protect voters. Additionally, a number of academic and public policy experts have recommended that the shortcomings of these systems be addressed. Finally, there have been a number of incidents in which voters have been disenfranchised and election outcomes thrown into doubt because the machines have simply failed to work properly.'' 
   The Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law writes: ``Reports of machine problems during States' recent Presidential primary elections provide a preview of potentially widespread machine failure and disenfranchisement in November.'' 
   They and others go on to argue that this simple, straightforward legislation  will allow many counties and States around the country to address these problems in time for their November election so that we can have a truly reliable, accessible and auditable election that voters can believe in. 
   I yield back the balance of my time with thanks to the gentlelady from California for her diligent work in putting together such a good piece of legislation.

   Mr. HOLT. I thank the gentlelady. I just wanted to address a couple of the points that the gentleman from Ohio made. 
   The first is we don't in this legislation tell the counties how to run their elections. We leave this up to them, and it is entirely optional. There are States around the country who have instituted complete auditable election systems in a matter of months. 
   If a county or a State feels they cannot do it, then I would advise them not to opt in to this program. But we believe they can. Let's leave that to them rather than as the gentleman from Ohio would, try to decide for them whether this is something that they would want. 
   We believe from a number of indications that this will be useful in many counties and States around the country.

   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, under this legislation, the States and counties still have the responsibility for the mechanics of the elections. All we're saying is, if they put in place procedures to make them auditable, and procedures to audit the votes, we will assist them in the cost. 
   There are many things the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King) said we could be dealing with, and, indeed, we are not dealing with questions of registration and purging of names on registration lists and absentee voting and the openness of the tabulation phase of results. We are just talking about what happens in the voting booth, so that each voter will be able to verify, on paper, that her vote or his vote is recorded the way they intended, and then, those voter verified records be used to audit the results. It's that simple. 
   I can promise you that if jurisdictions don't take these steps, there will be many questions around the country that cannot be resolved. This is a simple, straightforward way to take care of it.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (GENETIC INFORMATION NONDISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 493, the Genetic Non-Discrimination Act (GINA). As a cosponsor of this important legislation since I first came to Congress, I am delighted that it is finally being considered by the House of Representatives. 
   As humans, we have a genetic destiny that we cannot control. The genes we are born with are the genes we will die with, and it is wrong for any employer to fire, refuse to hire, or deny insurance to an employee based on that individual's genetic composition. It is unconscionable for employers to require their employees to submit to a genetic test or to secretly obtain genetic information, only to use the genetic information against the employees. 
   The Human Genome Project was created to provide a genetic map of the human body to aid the scientific and medical communities in their fight against some of the most insidious diseases and afflictions suffered by humanity. It is a great irony and a tragedy that this research is now being used as justification to fire or refuse to hire employees who have no control over their genetic destinies. 
   As a member of the Education and Labor Committee, I participated in hearings on GINA which highlighted the existing loopholes in federal and state laws protecting an individual's health information. Lacking a strong and clear national law prohibiting genetic discrimination, employees have been fired or denied insurance coverage based on this most personal of information. 
   Today, the House will act to end genetic discrimination in hiring and firing decisions. GINA will protect prospective and current employees from discrimination based on a genetic predisposition regardless of what state they live in. It will provide strong protections to those individuals who may suffer from actual genetic discrimination now and in the future. This legislation would pose a nominal cost to employers, but provide priceless protections for American workers and peace of mind for their families. 
   New Jersey, along with 32 other states, already prohibits genetic discrimination in decisions on hiring, firing, or benefits. However, only 25 states prohibit employers from requiring genetic information from their employees. Worse yet, only 10 states prohibit employers from obtaining genetic information or genetic tests of employees through any means. 
   This vital legislation is supported by more than 200 groups and associations including: the Hereditary Disease Foundation, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Jewish Congress, the American Association of People with Disabilities, the American Society of Human Genetics, the March of Dimes, the NAACP, the National Fragile X Foundation, the National Hemophilia Foundation, the National Council of La Raza, Citizens for Quality Sickle Cell Care, the Coalition for Genetic Fairness, the Cornelia de Lange Syndrome Foundation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, The National Workrights Institute, the Religious Action Center for Reform Judaism, Rett Syndrome Research Foundation, the Spina Bifida Association of America and many others. 
   Madam Speaker, it is long past time for the Genetic Non-Discrimination Act to become law. I urge my colleagues to vote for this important legislation, which will protect the rights of American workers and their families.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Chair, I thank my friend, Mr. Tierney, for his leadership on this issue. I have worked on nuclear proliferation and weapon defense issues for decades. I can assure my colleagues in this House that with our present or even projected technologies, the administration's ``neo-Star Wars'' proposal has poor odds of defeating a ballistic missile strike on the United States. Our missile defense system does not work and wishing will not overcome physics. It can be confused by decoys, it faces numerous testing problems. To put it bluntly, it is a faith-based military program, not one grounded in science. 
   Furthermore, it is destabilizing and it is a wasteful program that robs us of funds that we need for truly important real-world crises facing our communities and our Nation and our national security.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Let me begin by thanking Chairman Skelton for his consideration in support of this amendment. 
   Some time back I was asking U.S. servicemen about interrogation of some detainees. Suppose you and your translator are not familiar with the dialect of the detainees, I said, how would you make a tape available to a good linguist for review? 
   What tape, they said. 
   Later in other circumstances I learned about charges of mistreatment of detainees. But the only record of our treatment of detainees were the shameful recreational photos of Abu Ghraib. An official recording would have helped the situation, perhaps even have prevented the problems. 
   Hundreds of law enforcement organizations in all 50 States and the District of Columbia employ recording of interrogations and that is becoming the standard for interrogations around the United States. It improves the ability to get the best information, and it protects all parties involved, the interrogators and the detainees. I believe the lessons of those law enforcement organizations can be applied to our current detainee policies. 
   For years, police officers around the country resisted the idea of putting video cameras in their cars and interrogation rooms. Now those cameras, the dashboard camera, for example, is one of the cops' best friends. Today, such tools are widely used by law enforcement organizations around the country because of the protections and the investigative value they provide. 
   My amendment has three provisions: to require video recording of interrogations and other pertinent interactions between U.S. military personnel, or contractors, and detainees arrested and held. The video records would be kept at the appropriate level of classification and be available for review by intelligence personnel to help maximize the intelligence benefits of such interrogations. It would require the Judge Advocate General, pursuant to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, to develop guidelines designated to ensure that the video recording sufficiently prevents abuses of rights of detainees and prisoners.

   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I thank the Chair for his comments. 
   Indeed, this is becoming the standard of interrogation. The video recording is inexpensive, easy to use, and it helps. 
   My amendment would also afford access to prisoners by the International Red Cross and Red Crescent, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture. 
   The electronic recording of interrogations is a concept that has been endorsed by multiple domestic and international organizations. In 1998, the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations strongly recommended that interrogation of suspects in police custody and substitute prison be strictly monitored and recorded by electronic means. In 2004, the American Bar Association urged all law enforcement agencies to videotape the entirety of custodial interrogations of crime suspects. Hundreds of DAs and prosecutors use these techniques. 
   Today, the ACLU noted in their endorsement letter of this amendment that it would increase the accountability for compliance with the McCain antitorture amendment. Human Rights First, Human Rights Watch expressed similar statements in their endorsement letters, and I will include in the Record these letters of endorsement from Human Rights First, Human Rights Watch, and the ACLU.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, I regret that the House is taking up a supplemental funding measure for the war in Iraq without tying that funding to a withdrawal requirement. I was in Iraq last month and had the chance to speak at length with General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker about the situation in that country. There is no disputing that our casualties are down, and that is due in no small part to General Petraeus's revised military approach to the conflict. But the purpose of the surge wasn't simply to reduce our casualties; it was to give the Iraqis time to resolve their political differences via dialogue, not car bombs. That has not happened, and there is no reason to believe it will happen. Indeed, the only thing Iraq's warring factions seem to agree on these days is that they oppose permanent U.S. bases in Iraq. This no-strings-attached funding measure will only make matters worse, which is why I cannot support it. 
   I am pleased to be able to support the new GI Bill. For the first time in over 60 years, our returning veterans will have a truly robust educational benefit waiting for them. We all know how successful the original GI Bill was and how much it contributed to fueling our country's economic and social progress it the decades after World War II. We need to make that kind of investment in our people once again. No one can dispute our veterans have earned it and no one can dispute the long term benefits our society will reap from implementing a new GI Bill. I look forward to seeing it become law. 
   This bill also provides a desperately needed 13-week extension of unemployment benefits for people who are struggling to find work in this tough economy. Since last year, the number of Americans seeking employment has swelled by 800,000 while the economy has lost 260,000 jobs. 
   In addition, the legislation blocks the implementation of dangerous Medicaid regulations that the Bush administration has issued which would cut $20 billion from Medicaid. I oppose these regulations and will continue to fight to protect the Medicaid program and the millions of Americans who rely on it for access to health care services. 
   Finally, the $400 million in funding for science included in the bill represents a downpayment in our continued effort to provide a robust investment for science, research and development, and innovation. By making a strong investment, we will support research that will help contribute to the Nation's long term economic growth.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased the House is taking action today to help protect reporters from prosecutions simply for doing their jobs. 
   Over the last few years, more than forty reporters have been subpoenaed for the identities of confidential sources in nearly a dozen cases. Although the Department of Justice has promulgated voluntary guidelines for issuing subpoenas to the media and reporters, these guidelines do not apply to civil litigants in federal court and give unreviewable discretion to special prosecutors. 
   H.R. 2102 would establish a Federal standard for all parties--prosecutors, civil litigants, journalists and sources--and send a signal to potential sources that they will be protected in most circumstances when they pass to news organizations evidence of waste, fraud and abuse in government and in the private sector. 
   The bill requires journalists to testify at the request of criminal prosecutors, criminal defendants and civil litigants who have shown by a preponderance of the evidence that they have met the various tests for compelled disclosure. The bill contains provisions to ensure that the privilege would not impair law enforcement's efforts to identify a person who has disclosed significant trade secrets or certain financial or medical information in violation of current law. 
   In the case of national security issues, the test is that ``disclosure of the identity of such a source is necessary to prevent an act of terrorism against the United States or its allies or other significant and specified harm to national security with the objective to prevent such harm.'' It is the latter half of this clause that would allow the Justice Department to compel testimony from reporters in national security leak cases. 
   It is important that we ensure that information that is properly classified be protected from unauthorized disclosure. However, as we've seen repeatedly over the last century, too often government officials will misuse the classification system to hide evidence of their own lawbreaking. It will be important for Congress to carefully monitor how this particular provision is employed by the Department of Justice to ensure it is not abused in a way that prevents Congress and the public from learning about violations of law carried out in the name of protecting the nation's security. 
   Organizations representing publishers, broadcasters, and journalists agree that this legislation provides a suitable framework for balancing the needs of a free press with the need to uphold our laws, and on balance, so do I. I urge my colleagues to vote for this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (PATERSON GREAT FALLS NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for H.R. 189, the Paterson Great Falls National Park Act of 2007. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation along with the New Jersey Congressional delegation. I also want to thank my colleague, Mr. Pascrell, a Paterson native and former mayor, for his hard work in drafting this bill and bringing it to the floor. 
   H.R. 189 will establish a National Park in Paterson, NJ, encompassing 118 acres of the Great Falls National Historic District and the adjacent Hinchliffe Stadium. These sites are of great historical significance to New Jersey and to the Nation at large. 
   In 1791, Alexander Hamilton created the Society for the Establishment of Useful Manufactures, a public-private corporation, to fulfill his vision of transforming the United States from an agrarian society into an industrial power. The society, in turn, established Paterson 1 year later as America's first planned industrial city. 
   Located 15 miles west of New York City, the centerpiece of Hamilton's industrial city is the Great Falls, a 77-foot waterfall on the Passaic River. After implementing engineer Pierre Charles L'Enfant's water power system, dozens of mills and manufacturing buildings were built on the banks of the Passaic, harnessing the hydropower made available by the Great Falls. 
   Paterson was the heart of the industrial revolution in the United States, with dozens of mills producing paper, cotton, and enough silk for Paterson to earn the nickname ``Silk City.'' As one of the earliest centers of manufacturing in the United States, Paterson was also home to historic inventions such as Samuel Colt's first repeating revolver and inventor John Holland's early submarine prototypes. 
   Paterson's Great Falls is also the site of historic Hinchliffe Stadium, which served as the homefield for the New York Black Yankees of the Negro Leagues during America's Jim Crow era. Placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004, Hinchliffe Stadium is one of a handful of remaining stadiums used by Negro League baseball teams. Hinchliffe stadium hosted baseball legends such as Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson, and Larry Doby, who became the first African American to integrate the American League. The stadium is a poignant reminder of a bygone era of our country's national pastime. 
   With the passage of this bill, Members of the House will create a unique national park that protects a striking natural resource along with cultural and historical sites that tell the stories of our Founding Fathers, America's  economic rise and of the African American experience. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL CHEMISTRY WEEK -- (House of Representatives - October 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 751, which recognizes National Chemistry Week. I am proud to support this resolution, as I have done in past years, which acknowledges the critical role chemistry plays in maintaining and improving our quality of life. I thank the gentleman from Texas, (Mr. Silvestre Reyes) for sponsoring this resolution and I thank the leadership for providing Members of Congress with the opportunity to show our support for this bill on the floor. 
   This year marks the 20th anniversary of National Chemistry Week. Started by the American Chemical Society in 1987, this year's National Chemistry Week brings together businesses, schools, and nearly 200 ACS chapters to raise awareness of chemistry in our daily lives. Through aggressive outreach, hands-on demonstrations within local communities and laboratory open houses, National Chemistry Week engages millions of Americans, particularly elementary and secondary students, asking them to think about the how chemistry surrounds us all. 
   National Chemistry Week's theme for 2007, ``The Many Faces of Chemistry,'' highlights the diverse roles chemistry professionals play in our society. From teaching in the classroom to conducting research in the laboratory, chemistry professionals provide countless services to society. ``The Many Faces of Chemistry'' is also a challenge to educators to promote diversity in chemistry and the sciences. 
   Madam Speaker, while ACS organizes National Chemistry Week to celebrate the contributions of chemistry to the common good, as well as the progress in achieving diversity within the field, ACS is also issuing a challenge and a warning to Americans. 
   Issues such as climate change and infectious disease pose threats not only to the United States, but also to the entire world. In order to solve these problems, we must insist that science education be a priority in our elementary and secondary schools to cultivate the next generation of scientists. 
   Additionally, this year's National Chemistry Week reminds us that our work is not done promoting diversity within the sciences. While the number of women, African-Americans, and Hispanics earning advanced science and engineering degrees has increased, growth has stagnated recently, and these groups remain underrepresented, when compared to the general population. If the United States is to remain the locus of scientific research and innovation in an increasingly competitive global playing field, we must continue to broaden these groups. 
   Once again I commend the American Chemical Society for establishing National Chemistry Week in 1987 and thank the organization for two decades of promoting science education. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution recognizing the goals and ideals of National Chemistry Week.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. I thank the chairman and commend my colleague from West Virginia for bringing this legislation to the floor. 
   Mr. Chairman, we are doing a good thing here. The Mining Act of 1872 is as archaic and as deserving of updating as the name suggests. It was written at a time of manifest destiny, the belief of our predecessors, who held that we should expand from coast to coast and that mining was recognized as one of the best uses of public lands when the country seemed so vast that no one could imagine that human actions would affect the world. 
   Many things have changed over 135 years. Our Nation is settled. We have come to realize the worth of our natural environment. We have come to comprehend the effects of human actions on the resources that we will pass down to future generations. 
   This legislation is governing hardrock mining, an industry that's remained exempt from environmental regulations despite the fact that the U.S. EPA's toxic release inventory has determined that hardrock mining is a primary source of toxic pollution in the United States. 
   I am pleased that in committee we have included language, important language, I would say, to restrict permits for activities that would harm national parks and national monuments. There are thousands of claims and could be thousands more in the close environment of national parks and national monuments, some of our most treasured lands. This legislation will provide vital protection for those lands. 
   We all know well the costs to American taxpayers of refusing to look after the environment. This language about national parks, I think, will also save the taxpayer money, because we will have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to clean up damage to water supplies and so forth. 
   I commend the chairman for bringing such a good bill forward and urge its passage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5803, a bill that would reimburse States and localities to make paper backup ballots available for this November 2008 election. 
   I compliment Representative Lofgren for introducing this measure which would allow more Americans to vote than might otherwise be able if their only option was failed electronic voting. The bill would also allow more Americans to vote when facing long lines, something that has been documented widely. 
   Passing comprehensive election reform to help ensure the accuracy, integrity, and security of our electronic voting systems and other voting systems has long been a priority for me. At the beginning of the 110th Congress, I introduced legislation to establish national standards of verifiable elections. That bill has not received a floor vote despite support from a bipartisan majority of Members. 
   So in January of this year, many of us introduced simplified, optional legislation that would reimburse States that convert to paper ballot voting systems, offer backup paper ballots, and/or conduct random audits in this fall's election. Unfortunately, following opposition from the White House, the vote broke mostly on party lines and the bill was not passed. 
   After our opt-in legislation was not passed, I urged Congress to reconsider this issue, and so I am pleased that the House Committee on Administration has incorporated part of our legislation into the bill on the floor today. This is a useful step. 
   The ability to vote is the most important right as it is the right through which citizens secure all of our other rights. Yet public cynicism is rampant, and could cripple our democracy. 
   Increasing the availability of paper ballots, however, is only one of the steps that we must take to address the documented problems faced by voters and election officials. 
   I will continue to work with Ms. Lofgren and others to ensure that Congress does all it can to protect the integrity and accuracy of our elections, and to give voters confidence in their system. Each election each year in recent years, cynicism has grown among voters. I hope my colleagues will join in the continuing effort to provide verifiable, reliable, confident voting.

   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Research Act. Taking its name from the sixth chapter of the National Academies Report ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' H.R. 363 is part of an ambitious legislative portfolio that is part of the Innovation Agenda. I was proud to help craft the Innovation Agenda, on which our nation is dependent for its future prosperity. 
   Fifty thousand people hold postdoctoral appointments in the United States. In 1999, postdocs were 43% of the first authors in articles in the prestigious journal Science. Postdoctoral appointments are temporary by design and are compensated poorly. Postdocs are generally motivated by the idea of becoming professors, a goal to which three quarters of postdocs aspire. However, only 20 percent will attain faculty positions. This had led to an increasingly dramatic and problematic holding pattern which could select more for flexibility and perseverance than for talent and performance. 
   As science funding has become tighter, it's become more difficult for postdocs to find permanent academic positions and to remain in science. The availability of positions is entirely dependent on the likelihood of a new professor finding funding. As of 2002, the median age at which one receives a first NIH grant as a primary investigator is 42. In 1981, the median age was 35. In the biological sciences, in 1980, researchers under 40 years old received more than half of all competitive research grants. By 2003, this had fallen to less than 17 percent. At NSF, the funding rates for first-time grant recipients fell from 25 percent in 2000 to 17 percent in 2004. 
   H.R. 363 addresses this problem by setting aside funds specifically for early career researchers, which are defined as assistant professors or the equivalent thereof. Assistant professor is the role to which most postdocs aspire as their next step. It is one step short of having a tenured, permanent position in a research institution. H.R 363 also requires DOE and NIST to report on how they are doing with recruitment and retention of early career engineers and scientists. 
   H.R. 363 supports the early career part of the science and technology professional pipeline in other ways, as well. The act requires NSF to set aside at least 1.5 percent of funds appropriated for research and related activities to the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program and permits the NSF to research the process of innovation and the teaching of inventiveness. 
   At present, the United States research infrastructure is deficient. In 2001, more than 60 percent of the Department of Energy Office of Science lab space was over 30 years old. This requires $2 billion to correct. In 1998, the NSF estimated that $11.4 billion were needed to  renovate U.S. academic research facilities. In 2001, the NIH estimated $5.6 billion in health research infrastructure needs. 
   This problem is in part caused by a 26 percent cap on reimbursement to universities from research grants for infrastructure costs. Since this cap was created in 1991, universities have been unable to find sufficient sources of funding to keep their scientific facilities competitive or, in some cases, adequate. At the same time, they are using these facilities to attempt to compete internationally for scientists. 
   H.R. 363 addresses this problem by instructing the Office of Science and Technology Policy to create a National Coordination Office for Research Infrastructure. This office would prioritize deficiencies in research facilities at universities and national labs and then work to coordinate a response to these deficiencies. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution. Without its reforms to our research infrastructure and science talent pipeline we will continue to deteriorate.

   In middle school, 68 percent of math students have a teacher who did not major in and has not certification in mathematics. Across all sciences, 57 percent of middle school students have teachers without a major or certification in the subject. In physical sciences, 93 percent have teachers without a major or certification. In high school, approximately 31 percent of math students, 45 percent of life science students, 61 percent of chemistry students, and 67 percent of physics students have teachers with no major or certification in the field. 
   The National Science Foundation's successful Noyce program recruits and trains math and science teachers, drawing from high-performing college students and from existing math and science professionals. The Noyce program also encourages those it trains and supports to serve in high-needs school districts. H.R. 362 expands the Noyce program and modifies it to include freshmen and sophomores. 
   Another successful math and science education program at the National Science Foundation is its Mathematics and Science Education Partnerships program, which provides grants to universities and nonprofits for the improvement of K-12 education. H.R. 362 improves the program by focusing grantees on teacher training, requiring grantees to offer masters programs for in-service teachers, and preparing teachers to instruct Advanced Placement courses. 
   H.R. 362 does not stop with the improvement of these existing programs. It recognizes the special need for quality hands-on science teaching by authorizing funds for the Laboratory Science Teacher Professional Development program. The Act also requires the Director of NSF to convene a panel of experts to develop nationally available K-12 math and science teaching materials, and it creates centers that will work on curriculum, pedagogy, and the training of professors and teaching assistants to increase undergraduate participation and performance in science, technology, engineering, and math courses. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, the conference report in front of us today, imperfect as it is, addresses several key issues facing our intelligence community today: attracting and retaining people with foreign languages and cultures; bringing speed to security clearance processes for new hires; the provision directing the Director of National Intelligence to establish a multilevel security clearance process; and a number of other things. 
   But as the person appointed by Speaker Pelosi to chair the Select Intelligence Oversight Panel, I'm especially interested and supportive of the provisions of this legislation that will improve the ability of Congress to exert oversight of the intelligence activities of this country, such as requirements that the intelligence community report to Congress and requirements that strengthen the Inspectors General in the intelligence community. 
   Intelligence is among the most important functions of our government because intelligence can save lives, prevent war, and assist our soldiers and protect Americans. But it is also among the most dangerous, dangerous because of the damage of intelligence poorly done, the damage that can be done to American interests and America's reputation and the freedoms and humane behavior that Americans hold dear. So these oversight provisions are particularly important. 
   Another provision of this legislation that I'm pleased to see is the requirement that the DNI produce National Intelligence Estimates on Iran and North Korea. I'm pleased to see that it seems that some reforms are now reflected in the way that the intelligence community does these National Intelligence Estimates. The recent Iran report appears to be a product of a reformed intelligence process. 
   Now, I've argued for years that we should have only one policy on how to handle detainees, and this bill addresses that issue head-on by requiring that the U.S. Government personnel and contractors, anyone involved in detainee operations, adhere to the Army Field Manual. 
   The bottom line is this: no torture of detainees, period. I'm thankful that we're finally taking that issue straight on; and in light of last week's news involving the CIA's detainee operations, I think it's clear that we still have more work to do. 
   The revelations surrounding and the ongoing investigations of the CIA's destruction of videotapes of detainee interrogations only underscore why Congress must establish clear policies for the video recording of detainee interrogations. I'm offering legislation in addition to what we're dealing with today that will deal with this, and I look forward to working with Chairman Reyes and the House leadership to bring that measure to the floor for a vote very soon.

   Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   I am pleased to join the Speaker of the House today as an original cosponsor of this important legislation to address the rights of the people of Tibet. Across the globe, people are speaking out in support of the people of Tibet. And today, Congress is making a strong statement. And no one outside Tibet has been more clear and more eloquent than the Speaker of the House. 
   I recently had the honor to join the Speaker as a member of a congressional delegation to India. We were with the spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, and we saw and heard thousands of Tibetan refugees cheering America, I'm pleased to say, but pleading and pleading with us not to forget Tibet. 
   Tibet has been under the heavy hand of China for almost five decades, and the situation has deteriorated with China brutally suppressing Tibetans and systematically and relentlessly eradicating Tibetan culture. Our delegation was moved to see and hear the pleadings of Tibetans of all ages who have braved Himalayan crossings to escape oppression, some weeks ago, some years ago. And the Dalai Lama gives them hope and calls on the world not to forget those who have fled and those who are left in Tibet. And we, too, should give them hope. 
   I have in my office a crayon-drawn Tibetan flag given to me during our delegation's visit to the Tibetan Children's Village, and I keep this flag in my office because it reminds me of the human toll of the situation. Children and adults flee the villages of Tibet and cross the highest range of mountains in the world to reach the promise of a life where they can preserve their culture and have freedom. The journey is treacherous, but children try to escape the oppression in Tibet. 
   I am pleased that all the members of this important trip joined the Speaker in introducing this resolution. Both Democrats and Republicans agree that the Chinese Government needs to end the violent crackdown on nonviolent Tibetan protesters. Furthermore, it is long past time for the Chinese Government to begin, without preconditions, a dialogue with His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, and ensure that human rights and dignity of all Tibetans are protected, to address the legitimate grievances of the Tibetan people, to safeguard the people and their distinctive identity, to support economic development, cultural preservation, health care, education and environmental sustainability. 
   This important resolution reminds the world and China of our commitment to the people of Tibet.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (RAIL AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this bill. 
   As events over the last several years have shown, we ignore rail and transit security at our peril. Since 2004, terrorist cells have conducted successful and deadly bombings on major passenger rail systems in Spain (2004), the United Kingdom (2005), and India (2006), with 450 people killed and 2,800 wounded. We know al Qaeda and like-minded groups desire to repeat such attacks here in America. We also know that our rail and transit systems need more money to help deter such threats. 
   For example, the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) estimates that since 9/11, our government has invested $7.53 in aviation security improvements per passenger boarding, but only $0.008 (less than one penny) in public transportation security improvements per passenger boarding. This security investment disparity has been allowed to persist for years, despite the fact that every weekday, more than 14 million people use public transportation, and more than 25 million passengers ride Amtrak each year. 
   In New Jersey alone, NJ Transit--the third largest statewide transit agency--has stated that it has only 220 police officers to protect 400,000 customers per day (265,000 bus and 135,000 rail), 10,500 employees at multiple locations, 800 trains on more than 1,000 miles of track, 161 rail stations, and 49 light rail stations. Additionally, these same officers must protect and secure more than 2,000 buses that use more than 20,800 bus stops. 
   In 2004, the APTA outlined $6 billion in needs for transit agency security-related investments. A 2002 Government Accountability Office study of just eight transit systems that had completed security assessments found that needed upgrades would cost at least $700 million. 
   The Congress took a positive step last year when it raised rail and transit security funding from $150 million to $175 million. However, if we are to prevent the tragedies that occurred in Madrid, London, and Mumbai from being repeated in America, we must act now to ensure that our local transit providers have the resources they need to protect the millions of Americans who rely on rail service. Fortunately, Congress is now taking additional steps to address this problem. 
   The bill before us today authorizes three separate security grant programs: one each for rail security, public transportation security, and over-the-road bus security. More than $5.8 billion would be authorized for these grants through 2011. If fully funded, these programs would help us close major security gaps in our rail and transit systems. Similar grant programs for firefighters and other first responders have helped local jurisdictions--including several in my own district--to upgrade their response capabilities. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make sure the money to support these new grant programs is there from day one. 
   Additionally, this bill mandates a range of additional measures designed to improve rail and transit security, including vulnerability assessments and regular security exercises to test the ability of rail and transit systems to spot and defeat potential threats to the traveling public. One of the chief lessons of the Hurricane Katrina debacle is that Federal, State, and local governments, along with the relevant private sector partners, must regularly test our collective response system to detect and fix problems before a real incident occurs. Regular exercises and the lessons learned from them must be implemented in a timely fashion. Creating a system that institutionalizes such a process is vital. 
   Mr. Chairman, I'm pleased we're finally beginning to address our rail and transit security needs in a systematic way, and I urge my colleagues to support passage of this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (IMPLEMENTING THE 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, after more than 2 years of needless delay, the House is finally taking action on the balance of the recommendations made by the 9/11 Commission.  This is a large bill that tackles a range of critical issues, but I want to comment on three areas in particular: risk-based funding for homeland security needs, making our first responder's communications truly interoperable, and measures we need to take overseas to stop the terrorist from getting here in the first place. 
   For the past several years, I've sponsored a series of homeland security grant writing workshops for first responder organizations in my district. These workshops are always well attended and I'm pleased that they've been of value in helping various fire, EMS, and police departments cross central New Jersey become competitive in applying for these grants. However, the one question I get most often from these professionals is ``Why aren't these grants allocated on the basis of risk?'' I know many of my colleagues were hearing the same thing from their first responders, which is why last year I joined a number of my colleagues in sending a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff asking him to make grant award decisions on the basis of risk. While DHS has made some progress in this area, it hasn't come far enough quickly enough. That's why I'm pleased that this bill requires DHS to use a risk-based funding formula when allocating these grants. New Jersey is at far greater risk of attack--and it has more infrastructure targets, like chemical plants--than more rural, less densely populated states. Our vulnerabilities require commensurately greater resources. 
   Another critical fix contained in this bill is a grant program dedicated to communications interoperability. As incredible as it may seem, 5 years after the 9/11 attacks, and one year after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the Department of Homeland Security still does not allocate funds specifically for the purpose of helping local first responders coordinate in an emergency. As a result, states and localities are forced to rob Peter to pay Paul by using large chunks of homeland security grant funding--in some instances 80 percent--to purchase communications equipment. As a result, fewer resources are spent securing bridges, ports, and buildings. This is a false choice being forced upon local officials. Today's legislation is a down payment on those needs. 
   Importantly, the federal grants can be used only for equipment, technology, and systems that have been determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security to meet emergency communications equipment and technology standards. Therefore, State and local governments will be protected from relying solely on the claims of vendors, and can use the grants to invest in emerging technologies, not the same dinosaur systems that first responders historically have been forced to rely on. Also, this bill also takes steps to ensure the completion of a National Emergency Communication Plan. Such a plan will help to ensure that Federal, State, and local governments are developing plans and systems 
   to improve multi-jurisdictions communications in an emergency that is truly ``National'' in scope. 
   Finally, while this bill includes useful provisions for strengthening our outreach to the Islamic world, we have to recognize that defensive measures at home are necessary in part because of a failure of our policies abroad. 
   For decades, our government has had a devil's bargain with a number of corrupt, despotic regimes in the Middle East and South Asia: they help us maintain order in the region, and we help them maintain order at home. We don't like to talk about this hypocritical double standard, but it exists, and it is impossible to truly quantify how much damage that hypocrisy and our support for such dictatorial regimes has cost us. 
   This is another legacy of the Cold War, where any country--no matter how brutal its government--was a potential ally for us against the Soviets. The same misguided approach is now being applied in our relationships with various countries with corrupt, brutal governments that ruthlessly suppress dissent at home even as they proclaim their solidarity with us in the war against Al Qaeda and like-minded groups. 
   The reality is that by viciously obliterating the voices of moderation in their societies, these despotic regimes are paving the way for Al Qaeda. By eliminating those calling for a free press and free elections, these governments are driving ever-greater numbers of Muslims into bin Laden's ranks. So long as we stand by and let them repress or destroy the voices of moderation in these countries, will we be complicit in the creation of the next generation of people who reject democracy in favor of the Kalishnikov rifle or the car bomb. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased that the House will pass this bill today and I will gladly support it. But we must know that even if this bill becomes law, the work of protecting our citizens and restoring our country's standing in the world has only begun.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (SELECT INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT PANEL -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
   I am pleased we are considering this bill today because it moves us closer to dealing with an issue identified by the 9/11 Commission as a problem. Not that we needed the commission to tell us this; we know it is a problem. I think we would all agree that congressional oversight of intelligence programs should be improved. This bill would do that by creating a standing body in which both the authorizing committee and the relevant Appropriations Committee come together to examine the requests and performance of the intelligence community's many agencies. This has never been done before, and I certainly believe it is a significant step in the right direction. 
   The panel is charged to look at whether the current programs that we support make sense in the world we live in today, how they perform, how they spend money, and whether they make us safer. The 9/11 Commission stated on page 420 that any congressional reform in this area should produce an entity that allows ``a relatively small group of Members of Congress, given time and reason to master the subject and the agencies, to conduct oversight of the intelligence establishment and be clearly accountable for their work.'' This bill does that. 
   The gentlewoman from New Mexico said the 9/11 commissioners surely don't approve. Well, Commissioner Roemer, a former member of this body who understands how things work here, said yesterday: ``They,'' meaning these recommendations, ``do one of the most important things for congressional reform, that is, strengthen the oversight process.'' He goes on to say: ``Empowering both committees will significantly improve our oversight.'' He strongly endorses this, as do the other members of the 9/11 Commission. 
   Money spent in inappropriate collection systems, questionable covert activities, or dubious intelligence community reorganization schemes is money wasted; and it shortchanges our ability to protect our troops and our people here at home. 
   Those who will serve on this panel truly will have their work cut out for them. Many intelligence programs have not received the type of scrutiny that they should have, and the success of this new panel is not guaranteed. But I can assure you, Madam Speaker and my colleagues, that we need for this committee, this panel to succeed. I applaud the leadership of the House for moving this bill, and I look forward to voting for it and urge my colleagues to do the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (PROVIDING FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3773, RESTORE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Florida, and I rise in support of the rule and the underlying bill. 
   When Congress made the error of passing in haste and in fear the unconstitutional Protect America Act this past August, some of us could take a bit of comfort from this sorry episode in that it would expire. That meant we would get another chance to get things right, to actually pass a bill that would protect our country from terrorists and also from those in government who would turn the fearsome powers of our Federal intelligence and enforcement communities against the American people. I am pleased to say that after some intense work, we have a bill that does that. 
   The RESTORE Act now includes provisions via the manager's amendment that will ensure that it is the courts, not an executive branch political appointee, who decides whether or not the communications of American citizens are to be seized and searched, and that such seizures and searches must be done pursuant to a court order that meets the standard of probable cause. 
   This bill now gives our citizens the best protection we can provide them: good intelligence and the review of the executive branch's actions by a court. We, everyone here, can tell each of our constituents, Muslim Americans, soldiers in uniform, international businessmen, college students: you have the protection of the courts. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank both chairmen of the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees for working so diligently to get this right. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule and ``yes'' on the RESTORE Act later today.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (RESTORE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. I thank my friend and colleague from Texas. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. As many of you know, when the committee reported this bill to the floor, I expressed concerns that it  lacked provisions ensuring that the courts would decide whether the executive branch could seize and search communications of Americans. 
   The RESTORE Act now before us includes provisions via the manager's amendment that will ensure that it is the courts, not an executive branch political appointee, who decides whether or not the communications of an American can be seized and searched and that such seizures and searches must be done pursuant to an individualized court order. 
   This bill gives our citizens the best protection we can provide them, a sound intelligence collection that will foil our enemies and the review of the executive branch's surveillance actions by the court. In other words, each of us can say to each of our constituents: you have the protection of the court. 
   Now, it is important to note that this bill will provide better intelligence than existing law, the existing law which was passed in haste and fear. This bill, by applying checks and balances, improves intelligence collection and analysis. It has been demonstrated that when officials establish before a court that they have reason to intercept communications, we get better intelligence, better intelligence than we get through indiscriminate collection and fishing expeditions. 
   Mr. Speaker, this does it right. Mr. Speaker, I would like to close by thanking the staff of the committee, Jeremy Bash and Eric Greenwald; and from the Judiciary Committee, Lou DeBaca and Burt Wides; as well as the chairmen, Mr. Reyes and Mr. Conyers, who took my concerns to heart and made them their own concerns. It has produced a good bill. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for the RESTORE Act.  
   Mr. Speaker, the RESTORE Act will ensure that it is the courts--and not an executive branch political appointee--who decide whether or not the communications of an American citizen can be seized and searched, and that such seizures and searches must be done pursuant to a court order. This bill gives our citizens the best protection we can provide them: good intelligence collection against our adversaries, and review of the executive branch's surveillance actions by a court. 
   I was pleased to be able to work with my colleagues on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to add several key provisions to this bill. For example, the bill's most critical new provision ensures that the government must have an individualized, particularized court-approved warrant based on probable cause in order to read or listen to the communications of an American citizen. Inclusion of this provision was vital. We must be able to assure our citizens that their communications cannot be seized and searched by the government in the absence of a court order, and with this provision now in the bill, we can provide that assurance. 
   Another provision I worked to include requires the Court to review and approve not only the procedures and guidelines required under this Act, but also the application of those guidelines. This provision provides another important point of review by the courts that will help ensure that the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence are actually doing what they claim they are doing. 
   I also asked that a provision be inserted that makes it clear that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) is the sole statutory basis for domestic surveillance. This language was needed to remove any ambiguity. We cannot have any President inventing other claims for secret, warrantless surveillance. 
   The bill also provides additional resources to both the executive and judiciary branches for processing FISA applications and orders. The bill increases the number of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) judges from 11 to 15, provides additional personnel to both the FISC and government agencies responsible for making and processing FISA applications, creates an electronic filing, sharing, and document management system for handling this highly classified data, and mandates training for all government personnel involved in the FISA process. All of this will help modernize and streamline the FISA application approval process. 
   Finally, the bill requires the Bush administration to ``fully inform'' Congress on all surveillance programs conducted since 9/11. It's outrageous that the Bush Administration has continued to stonewall this Congress over documents for the one program it has acknowledged. If we're to do our job of oversight, we need all the facts about past and current surveillance programs, and this provision will help us get those answers. 
   I hope our colleagues in the Senate will quickly pass the RESTORE Act, and I call upon the President to end his veto threats and work with Congress to bring America's surveillance activities into compliance with the Constitution. 
   President Bush has no inherent Constitutional authority to spy on our own citizens in the name of national security. If the President is serious about passing a law that allows us to protect our citizens from all enemies--foreign and domestic--he will sign this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2669, COLLEGE COST REDUCTION AND ACCESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2669 the College Cost Reduction Act. I would like to thank Chairman Miller and his staff for this bill that will provide New Jersey residents an additional $262 Million in loan and Pell grant aid. 
   Once signed into law, this legislation will ensure that more Federal student aid money gets to the students who need it, and in New Jersey, the need is great. Over 61,000 students in New Jersey take out need-based loans for 4-year schools each year and incur an average of over $14,000 in debt. Under the legislation, the maximum value of the Pell grant scholarship would increase by $1,090 over the next 5 years, reaching $5,400 by 2012. This increase would fully restore the purchasing power of the scholarship, which in recent years had been frozen at $4,050 until Congress boosted its value to $4,310 earlier this year. 
   I am pleased that the committee included several initiatives that I have been working on, including provisions from my bill H.R. 2017, the Part-time Student Assistance Act. We have raised the income protection allowance in the College Cost Reduction Act so that working students can work more without having that count against their student aid. Further, we were able to eliminate the earned income tax credit from calculations so that working families do not have to bear this burden. 
   The bill also provides upfront grant aid for those who are becoming math, science, and foreign language teachers. The bill would create grants providing upfront pre-paid tuition assistance of $4,000 per year with a maximum of $16,000 for elementary or secondary school math and science teachers and critical foreign language teachers. Our classrooms have an increasing shortage of teachers for these vital subjects. This problem is most severe in school districts were students come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Without qualified teachers in these areas, we are endangering the competitiveness of our children in the global economy. 
   Students who take out loans or receive Pell grants will now find it easier to finance their education. By investing in foreign language and math and science education, we'll enhance both our economic and national security. Part-time students will have an easier time balancing the need to care for their families and improve their education. This is public policy at its best--it lifts up Americans from all walks of life. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is an investment in our future. Without providing access to a college education we will not be able to compete with nations that have already made the investments in providing a quality education for their own children. The United States is a dominant world economy because of our educated workforce. With this bill we will take a larger step toward maintaining this edge and I ask my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (TAX INCREASE PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) was originally enacted in 1969 to ensure that the wealthiest Americans paid at least some income taxes--like everybody else. Before the AMT, the richest Americans could unfairly dodge their taxes by using deductions to sidestep their social obligations. However, what began at the end of the Johnson administration as an attempt to guarantee that the top few hundred Americans pay their fair share of taxes--has not been indexed for inflation and as a result has slowly morphed into a middle-class tax hike. 
   More families in Central New Jersey are affected by the AMT than anywhere else in the country. Currently 33,292 of my constituents are hit by the AMT and this number will increase to 121,503 if we do not take action today. 
   Madam Speaker, I believe that this bill should have been paid for. I voted twice now for appropriate offsets to ensure that we keep our promise to the American people that we will not continue to spend money that this Congress does not have. We can not continue to borrow money from China and other countries in order to pay for the choices we make today. It is our children and grandchildren that will be forced to pay this debt around the world. Unfortunately President Bush and the Republicans in the Senate refuse to worry about the costs of this bill and the effect it will have on the next generation. I will continue to support my colleagues in making sure increase in spending or cuts in taxes are paid for and that next year we find an offset so that we do not pass this debt to the future generations. 
   However, with the prospect of having an additional 88,211 of my constituents pay the AMT, I believe we must move today to enact an AMT fix. We cannot make the middle class pay for the failures of the administration. I urge all my colleagues to support this important tax reform that will help middle class families from unfair tax burden.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (PATRIOT WEEK IN TRENTON, NEW JERSEY -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, I rise today to call the attention of my colleagues to Patriot Week in Trenton, New Jersey. On December 26, 1776, Colonial soldiers under the command of General George Washington crossed the Delaware River and engaged in the first Battle of Trenton. As Thomas Paine wrote, this happened during ``times that try men's souls; the summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.'' 
   On this historic day more than two centuries ago, over 2,400 patriots proved that they were not summer soldiers, battling their way through a winter sleet storm, strong winds and the ice-strewn Delaware River. Against all odds, Washington and his soldiers completed the crossing, marched silently to Trenton on Christmas night with cannon, and arrived taking the Hessian garrison by surprise. This engagement, followed by the pivotal Battle of Princeton, has been called ``the beginning of the winning.'' 
   The crossing of the Delaware is a story that must be told again and again so all generations will know this feat and the new life it gave the American Revolution. On December 26 through 31 of this year, again this year, the Trenton Downtown Association will celebrate the 131st anniversary of this history-changing event through Patriot Week, the largest Revolutionary War festival in America. 
   Patriot Week in the Trenton area will include over 50 events, including the reenactment of Washington's crossing of the Delaware, puppet shows and other children's activities, tours by bus and on foot, and lectures and panel discussions. These events will help pass down this great and important story to our children and to adults, the story of the War for Independence. I am sure these events will be both informative and entertaining, as they have been in previous years, and I look forward to attending some of these events myself. 
   I am proud that in my central New Jersey district we honor the sacrifices that were made to found this great Nation through events like Patriot Week and through the Crossroads of the American Revolution which commemorates 14 counties in New Jersey where the War for Independence took place. 
   However, our battles against Britain for a free and democratic nation took place in over 19 States and over two wars, and each of these States has its own unique story about its role in the American Revolution and the War of 1812. Many States, however, have not taken sufficient steps to preserve the sites of those battles. Out of the 825 significant battlefields and associated sites of the American Revolution and the War of 1812, more than 100 of these battlefields have been lost, about 250 are in fragmented or poor condition, and another 220 are in danger of being destroyed within the next few years. Therefore, some of us have sponsored here in the House of Representatives the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 Battlefield Protection Act, H.R. 160, and the Revolutionary War and War of 1812 Commemorative Coin Act, H.R. 158. H.R. 160 would create a national program for the preservation of historic battlefields. It would allow officials of the American Battlefield Protection Program to collaborate with State and local governments and nonprofit organizations to preserve and protect the most endangered historical sites and to provide up to 50 percent of the cost of purchasing battlefield land threatened by sprawl and commercial development. H.R. 158 would provide the necessary funding for these purchases by authorizing the creation and issuance of commemorative coins for these two wars. 
   History is best understood by those who have had the opportunity to touch it, experience it and live it. On December 26 through 31, over 4,000 people will be reliving the history of the Battle of Trenton during Patriot Week. It is my hope that Congress will pass H.R. 160 and H.R. 158 to allow other States the privilege of preserving their historic battlefields where their citizens, and  all citizens, can experience the history of the founding of our great Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2643. I want to thank my colleague and friend, Chairman NORM DICKS, for his tireless work in bringing to the floor a bill that we should all be proud of because of its commitment to protecting and conserving our environment and natural resources for future generations to enjoy. 
   John F. Kennedy said in March 1961, ``It is our task in our time and in our generation to hand down undiminished to those who come after us, as was handed down to us by those who went before, the natural wealth and beauty which is ours.'' In previous years we have  passed Interior Appropriations bills that do exactly the opposite--we have cut essential funding that has put our natural resources at risk as well as allowed policy decisions to hamper our ability to protect at-risk land, wilderness and wildlife. In previous years, I have stood before this Congress and expressed disappointment and anger with our complete disregard for environmental stewardship. But this year is different. 
   We finally have a bill that reflects where our budget priorities should be. While this legislation may not solve all of our problems, I believe it is an enormous step in the right direction. 
   First, I am proud to say that this bill allocates $50 million for the stateside grant program of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The Land and Water Conservation Fund was separated into two components--the full federal program and the stateside grant program--to help address overdevelopment in both urban and rural areas. The stateside program has increased the number of recreation areas and facilities in our communities. It has also increased local involvement in land protection and open space preservation. 
   In New Jersey alone, the LWCF program has helped preserve of 73,000 acres of land by providing more than $111 million in funding. Some of the funding has been used to cleanup playgrounds, and build baseball fields, develop waterfront parks and restore open spaces. It is beyond me why the President continues to propose eliminating a program that is so successful. Fortunately, Chairman DICKS and the members of the Subcommittee understand the vital role this program plays in protecting and maintaining vital open spaces. They have invested in a program that remains a staple for conservation and land protection across the country. 
   These funds are long-term gifts that allow for the preservation of the wild and untouched places in America that our children and their children should have for their enjoyment. 
   These funds provide for Tuesday night baseball games and Sunday walks along the river, along with keeping what remains of our natural resources clean and pollutant free. 
   I also want to commend the committee for recognizing the dire situation of the National Parks. In preparation for the 100th anniversary of the National Parks System in 2016, we have included a hefty increase in the Parks budget for this fiscal year. This will go to park improvements, staffing increases, and visitor center upgrades in the Parks. Nearly a hundred years ago, Theodore Roosevelt urged the American people and the government to begin to conserve what natural resources we had so that some of the most majestic parts of this country would remain intact. With the 100-year anniversary of the National Park Service drawing closer, I echo the call to bring our National Parks up to standards. 
   Again, I would like to commend Chairman DICKS for crafting this bill before us today and I urge my colleagues to support it. By starting here today with this bill, we are voting for our sons and daughters and our grandchildren to be able to enjoy the natural resources of our country that so many of us have had the opportunity to experience in our lifetimes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my support for the inclusion of $300 million in funding for election reform programs under the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) in the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008. Although this represents less than half of the funding that still remains unappropriated under HAVA, it will help states improve and secure their election systems before November 2008. 
   We have now been through our second post-HAVA general election, but both the 2004 and 2006 elections provided strong indications that there is much work yet to be done in the area of election reform in this country. Election protection groups across the country published extensive reports after each of those elections, documenting machine failures, incidents of suppression, voters being told wrongfully that they were not on the voter registration rolls, voters being denied provisional ballots, and a myriad of other problems. One of those reports documented more than 1,000 incidents of machine failure in more than 300 counties in 36 states. In addition, a report issued by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University school of Law following an in-depth examination of all of the major voting systems used in the United States found that all such systems are vulnerable to tampering and failure.  
   Granted, many problems with our electoral system can be solved through better procedures and better enforcement of existing procedures, and do not require funding. But that is not true of issues related to the security and reliability of our voting equipment. That is why my Voter Confidence and Increased Accessibility Act (H.R. 811) authorizes $1 billion to help states transition to voting systems that provide a durable voter verified paper ballot for every vote cast, and $100 million to reimburse states for conducting routine random audits. 
   As the situation now stands, in November 2008, six entire states and various counties in 13 more and the District of Columbia will conduct their elections on voting systems that neither produce nor require the use of voter verified paper ballots, and therefore will provide no means of conducting meaningful recounts or audits. In total, approximately 35 million voters will be casting votes that will be completely unverifiable. That is more than ten times the margin of victory in the last Presidential race. In 2008, if the outcome of the Presidential race hinges on Pennsylvania, or Georgia, or Tennessee, or anyone of the other unauditable jurisdictions, there will be nothing tangible left that the voters themselves created or verified; whatever they will have seen on the touch screen on election day, it will be gone forever and all that will remain is a software translation that may or may not reflect voter intent. And we will never know, unless we have strong new legislation and adequate funding. 
   As a country, we simply cannot afford to have un-resolvable election problems in 2008. Election anomalies can be corrected by funding measures to ensure that voting systems produce durable paper ballots and that jurisdictions conduct routine audits of those ballots. Therefore, I commend the Financial Services Committee for including $300 million in HAVA funding, which may be used to meet and improve upon HAVA's requirement for permanent paper records with a manual audit capacity, in the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2008, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, recently I met with veterans in New Jersey, some of whom had served in the Second World War, and earlier in the day that I met with them, I had returned from a fact-finding trip to Iraq with Representative Thompson of California, a colleague on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. 
   I told these veterans that they would not recognize this war in Iraq. From a technological standpoint, the kind of battlefield sensors and intelligence analysis capabilities available to our troops in Iraq are so far beyond anything that was fielded by the military in the Second World War or, in fact, even in more recent conflicts. That's the good news. 
   The other thing that they would not recognize, the not-so-good news, is that unlike say the Second World War, the United States cannot control the outcome in Iraq or achieve success because we do not know who the enemy is and what constitutes success. 
   While part of our trip involved classified briefings in which we examined how the intelligence community is supporting our troops, we also had the opportunity to meet at length with General David Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker to discuss the situation on the ground, including the status of the political reconciliation among Iraq's warring factions. The two gave a positive report and spoke of a great deal of progress. 
   Two outstanding patriots, a good general, a good diplomat, but the presentation that America is making progress toward a successful outcome in Iraq makes sense only if we continually redefine what we mean by success. And for over 5 years, we've been redefining both our rationale for invading Iraq and how we propose to measure success. 
   First, it was to go after those responsible for 9/11. Then it was to remove Saddam Hussein from power and track down his WMDs. And then it was to bring stability to the region. And then it was to bring free elections and bring all the warring factions together in a model of democracy for the Middle East. Then it was to create a road to peace in Israel through Iraq. And then it was to give the Iraqis more time to organize their government. Now, it seems to be to reduce the number of members of al Qaeda in Iraq, the AQI, which was, of course, zero before it all started. 
   These repeated rationalizations and redefinitions serve no one's interests, particularly the interests of our men and women of our Armed Forces who we've sent in harm's way in Iraq. 
   In Baghdad, I met with active duty soldiers, including some from New Jersey. American troops are performing superbly in Iraq under difficult conditions. As I told them, they, and the New Jersey National Guard members who will be deploying later this year, deserve not just our gratitude, but all the support they need to do their job, the wherewithal they need to do their job, and I would say just as much support when they return home as veterans. 
   Of course, we want our soldiers to succeed. We want the Iraqis to be peaceful and prosperous. We want terrorists and other enemies of the United States to be defanged and defeated. But for that to happen, it must be in Iraq, at least the Iraqis, the Iraqi political factions who must take the lead in ending their civil war. 
   It's impossible to hide the fact that the limited security gains achieved since last fall have not been matched by political reconciliation on the part of the Iraqis. 
   Unfortunately, Iraq's central government continues to lack legitimacy in the eyes of its people, as the recent combat in Basra and Baghdad have clearly shown. It is clear that the Iraqi government is, so far anyway, unwilling or unable to take the steps necessary to reach a political settlement that will end the violence. 
   One of the reasons I voted against the war resolution to go into Iraq in the first place was that Iraq was not a threat to the United States in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and that attacking Iraq would unleash forces we could not control. I was not alone in making those arguments, which tragically have been validated by events. 
   My latest trip to Iraq has, sadly, reinforced my belief that success is being redefined only once again, and what we need to do is to take decisive action to end our combat involvement in Iraq and refocus our efforts on destroying al Qaeda and eliminating the conditions that breed international terrorism and refocusing our resources on pressing domestic and international needs.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by my colleague from Washington (Mr. Inslee) to the Beach Protection Act. 
   For the last 20 years, my colleagues in the scientific community have issued warnings that the release of greenhouse gases is altering the Earth's climate in ways that are both expensive and deadly. And nowhere is this change more evident than in the changing habitat of our world's oceans. 
   Science has demonstrated that global change is already causing the sea level to rise. It is predicted that in my home State of New Jersey, the sea level rise will cause a loss of 7 inches to 2 feet of our coastline by the end of the decade. 
   Of course, changes in the acidity of the ocean from increased carbon is another effect. And as the oceans continue to change, factors that are known to affect water quality along our coastline, such as flooding, storms and erosion, will, of course, occur. 
   The Inslee amendment simply requires the Environmental Protection Agency to study the effects of the global climate change on our Nation's coastlines. The amendment will help States, local communities and Congress better address the challenges, prepare for the changes, and it will call attention to the steps we need to take to prevent further damage. So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   I commend my colleague for preparing and introducing this amendment. 
   I yield back.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (TRIBUTE TO FATHER ROBERT F. DRINAN, SJ -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of our former colleague and man of faith, Father Robert Drinan. I never had the honor to serve with Father Drinan in Congress, but the effects of his advocacy and leadership remain. In the years after he left Congress and contining through my election and service, I was encouraged and honored to have the friendship and counsel of Father Bob. 
   His life is unique in American history. He was the only Roman Catholic priest to be elected to Congress. He represented the best that we, as Members of Congress, can aspire to. Not bound to special interests or enticed by political gains, he truly cared about the people who had elected him and those around the globe who were persecuted or malnourished, who could be called ``the least of these.'' 
   He was a passionate advocate for the poor and he called ending world hunger his ``number one passion.'' His opposition to the Vietnam war was the centerpiece of his 1970 campaign. Asked by a reporter for the Boston Globe why he decided to run for Congress, Father Drinan replied, ``Why? Why not. Jesuit priests have always been avant-garde. Right?'' 
   Born in Boston on November 15, 1920, Father Drinan never strayed far from the city and people he loved. After earning his bachelor's degree at Boston College in 1942, he enrolled in the Society of Jesus. He completed his seminary work at Weston College, earned a master's degree from Boston College, and a law degree from Georgetown University. In 1953, Father Drinan was ordained and shortly thereafter completed his doctorate in theology from Gregorian University in Rome. As dean of the Boston College Law School, he transformed the institution into one of the premiere law schools in the country. 
   In 1980, when he left Congress, he returned as a teacher to Georgetown University Law School. It was there that he not only taught but wrote important works of scholarship and continued to serve as a moral compass to his students, government officials and all Americans. He was deeply interested in human rights, constitutional rights, civil liberties and ethics. Until the very end of his life he continued to celebrate Sunday evening mass with the law students he taught and loved. 
   It has been recalled recently that when asked about his decision to wear a clerical collar and a black suit, his standard reply was, ``It's the only suit I own.'' He was a sharp wit, but also a deeply moral man. Many current and former members have called Father Drinan ``the conscience of the House.'' Senator Edward Kennedy said of Father Drinan that, ``of all the hats he wore, none fit better than teacher, for he was a teacher to all of us.'' Father Drinan will be sadly missed by this institution and our Nation. I am glad that last year the House honored Father Drinan with the Distinguished Service Award for his decade of service in the House. 
   I knew Father Drinan best from his work as chairman on PeacePAC, a division of Council for a Livable World, and as director of the Center for Arms Control & Non-Proliferation. He was a man who believed deeply in world peace and he struggled mightily to achieve it. He and the Council for a Livable World encouraged me when I first considered running for this office, and I will always remember their support and true belief that peace should be a goal of all Members of Congress. 
   In November of 2006, the Council for a Livable World established the Father Robert F. Drinan National Peace and Human Rights Award to be given annually by the council to the individual who best exemplifies Father Drinan's commitment to peace. As Father Drinan said at the unveiling of the award, ``people will be reminded that: you cannot just make war.'' He was right to oppose the Vietnam war and right to oppose the Iraq war. We can all learn from his life's commitment to peace. 
   Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia recently eulogized that, ``Bob Drinan never faltered, was never discouraged. It remains for all of us to carry on the work for which he prepared us, to build an earth in which justice will prevail.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, let us carry the spirit of Father Drinan in our hearts as we in Congress continue to work to complete the work he called us to do.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this bill. We cannot provide a blank check to this President regarding our involvement in Iraq.  
   I've heard a lot of talk about September--that it will be clear by September whether or not the ``surge'' is working. I've heard these comments even as this week the press has reported that another, little publicized ``surge'' is already underway--one that when completed will result in some 200,000 American troops being on the ground in Iraq before the year is out. We know now the ``surge'' is not working. 
   I cannot vote to provide this President with more money to send more troops to try to quell Iraq's civil war. I remind my colleagues that in less than a month's time, Iraq's parliament is going to adjourn for most of the summer, taking a two month vacation while American kids are left to dodge sniper fire and IEDs. Where are the Iraqi security forces? What happened to ``As they stand up, we'll stand down?'' 
   This month, the Defense Department reported a total of 337,000 Iraqi police and soldiers had been trained and equipped. They now outnumber our troops by two to one. Yet the administration has repeatedly refused to give the House Armed Services Committee information on the training program for Iraqi security forces and how their unit readiness is assessed. I suspect Secretary Gates is holding back those answers because he knows we're going to ask what we have bought with the money we have spent on Iraq's security forces--more than $15 billion. But I think most of us know what that $15 billion has bought us: an Iraqi security force that is corrupt, sectarian, infiltrated by insurgents, and hopelessly ineffective. 
   We can't keep ratifying a failed policy; that's not what the American people expect or need from us. I urge my colleagues to oppose the resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (FEDERAL PRICE GOUGING PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6346, The Federal Energy Price Gouging Prevention Act. 
   Today, my constituents in Central New Jersey are paying on average $3.98 at the pump, over a dollar more than they were paying at  the beginning of the year. Increases in gas prices have affected every sector of the economy. We are paying $2 more whenever we get a pizza delivered, $10 more for lawn mowing services, $1.70 for shipping packages, an extra penny for every letter that we send, and these are just a few examples of the effects of gas price increases on the economy at large. As American families suffer, oil companies continue to rake in record profits. It is essential that we prevent price gouging, speculation, and profiteering by those who would take advantage of our energy predicament and guard against harm to commuters and struggling families. 
   Current law does not have a mechanism for allowing the investigation and punishment of individuals and corporations that are artificially inflating the price of energy. H.R. 6346 would grant the Federal Trade Commission the authority to investigate and punish those who engage in price gouging. H.R. 6346 would finally provide a clear definition of price gouging so that the FTC can prosecute the worst offenders, specifically those companies with more than $500,000,000 in sales per year. It would strengthen the criminal penalties for price gouging to up to $150 million for corporations, and fines of up to $2 million plus jail sentences of up to 10 years for individuals. Finally, it would redirect the fines assessed to help fund the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). 
   Unfortunately, we are seeing examples across the country of unscrupulous individuals taking advantage of consumers during this energy emergency. Last week, New Jersey's Attorney General Anne Milgram released the results of an investigation that uncovered over 350 ticket worthy instances of gasoline price manipulation after a survey of 1,000 gas stations in the state. Among the citations issued were: 62 violations for the pump not accurately measuring fuel, 46 violations for per-gallon prices being different on each side of the pump, 37 violations for fuel grades not posted, 26 violations for inaccurate octane ratings, 19 violations for inaccurate total sale price calculation and 14 violations for multiple price changes in a 24-hour period. States like New Jersey are already taking action to prosecute gas price manipulation on a small scale; however, they do not have the means necessary to prosecute large-scale offenders. It is past time that Congress gives the FTC the tools it needs protect American consumers from these egregious violations at the pump and the legislation before us today takes an important first step towards achieving this goal. 
   Passing H.R. 6346 would help to prevent price gouging and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. However this bill is merely a short term solution to our long term energy needs. There are no easy answers to the fluctuating gas prices. We are paying at the pump today for flawed decisions made years ago. That is why we must work to implement strategies that will lower demand for oil in the long term.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this appropriations bill. 
   One of the most important roles of government is ensuring public safety. Over the last several years, the Federal Government simply has not been providing enough support to local and state law enforcement. The Justice Department's Uniform Crime Report statistics have now shown for 2 consecutive years measurable increases in violent crime nationwide. The Bush administration clearly has its priorities skewed, as the budget it proposed for the Community Oriented Policing Services (C.O.P.S.) program for Fiscal Year 2008 was a mere $32 million, a reduction of over half a billion dollars from last year's level. 
   This bill addresses that problem by increasing C.O.P.S. program funding to $725 million, and designating $100 million of that amount to be used to hire an additional 2800 police officers nationwide. 
   There is simply no question that our country's far more robust commitment to putting cops in the streets in the 1990's help reduce violent crime over the last decade. According to the General Accountability Office ``C.O.P.S. funded increases in sworn officers per capita were associated with the declines in rates of total index crimes, violent crimes, and property crimes.'' The same GAO study showed that between the years of 1998 and 2000, C.O.P.S. hiring grants were responsible for reducing crime by about 200,000 to 225,000 incidents--one third of which were violent. Across the state of New Jersey, approximately 4,790 officers were hired by local police departments using C.O.P.S. funds. This meant an additional 628 police officers and sheriff deputies walking the beat in the local communities of my Congressional District. Further, 33 school resource officers were hired to ensure that our children's schools are safe. The committee's increase in funding for this program for Fiscal Year 2008 is a welcome change from recent years, but I hope it will only be a down payment on much larger increases to come. Ideally, we should return to the kind of funding levels that gave us the kind of nationwide police presence we enjoyed in the last decade. 
   I am pleased that the committee has provided a robust increase for the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants Program by more than $80 million over the Fiscal Year 2007 level to $600 million. These grants are vital to our local communities--they help local law enforcement organizations get the support they need to combat violent crime, particular gangs and drug-related criminal activity. 
   In the area of science funding, the bill provides for much needed increases in the overall budget of the National Science Foundation, and for science education funding. Recent history has shown that when the federal government invests in science programs and education, our Nation as a whole benefits. 
   When funding for the National Institutes of Health was doubled during the previous decade, many students recognized the opportunity and acted accordingly. Federal seed money fostered high-income, highly desirable jobs and entrepreneurial companies that lead the 21st century economy. Their innovations have made the U.S. the global leader in the life sciences and biotechnology. 
   Earlier this year, I led more than 80 of my colleagues in an appeal to this committee that it increase overall funding for the NSF as well  as education-specific funding. I'm pleased that the committee responded by increasing NSF funding to $6.509 billion, $80 million over our collective request, as well as adding $72 million specifically for science education funding. I want to thank the chairman of the full committee, Mr. OBEY, and the subcommittee chairman, Mr. MOLLOHAN, for demonstrating a commitment to make meaningful investments in the NSF's physical sciences and engineering programs. 
   Finally, the Commerce Department portion of this bill provides badly needed additional funding to address perhaps the greatest threat to our collective future--global climate change. 
   The committee has added $171 million over the President's request to help fund a number of key climate change initiatives, including a comprehensive study of the problem, as well as changes to National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) program to ensure that critical climate monitoring sensors are added onto future NPOESS platforms. It is vital to both our economic and our national security that we take whatever measures are necessary to gain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that drive global warming so that we can implement the full range of measures necessary to combat it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I commend the committee for bringing us a bill that reflects the priorities of the American people, and I urge my colleagues to vote for it.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Chairman, our Nation's food inspection system is a critical safeguard in guaranteeing the health and welfare of all Americans. However, the federal protections that have existed for over 40 years are now threatened by a provision in the Farm bill that would allow meat and poultry inspected by state inspectors to be sold across state lines. 
   The Nation's food inspection system has served our Nation well by providing clear guidelines and a network of dedicated professional Federal inspectors. Its roots go back to the early 1900s, where a Federal inspection system became one of the landmark legislative accomplishments of President Theodore Roosevelt. While occasional problems have developed, on the whole, our national meat and poultry inspection system has been an unqualified success, with minimal incidents of food borne illnesses due to poor practices, handling or hygiene. 
   So why would we change a system that is so successful? It is my understanding that this change is being proposed to encourage the growth of small meat processing facilities as well as create new markets for state-inspected meat. While more competition and building new markets are laudable goals, they need not come at the expense of food safety or result in the dismantlement of the federal inspection system. No one has made a compelling case that the federal inspection system has truly hindered competition or market development. Thousands of small plants do well under the current inspection regIme. 
   However, in making this change, we are opening the door to problems that could multiply the exposure of consumers to food borne illnesses and food poisoning. The record of plants subject to state inspection is troubling. The USDA IG has repeatedly found that state inspection regimes often do not meet basic requirements for sanitation or cleanliness. 
   Despite this, language was added to the Farm bill to roll back these protections. A letter to Congress from a coalition of groups promoting food safety pointed out that the provision would:  
   Eliminate the 40 year old protection in the federal meat and poultry inspection acts that prohibit shipping state inspected meat across state lines. 
   Make 80% of all federally inspected plants eligible to leave federal inspection in favor of state programs which supporters of the bill insist are more understanding of company problems. 
   Not allow states to impose additional or higher food safety standards. 
   Ignore the inability of states to implement recalls of adulterated meat and poultry that have crossed state lines.  
   The potential for the spread of food-borne illnesses across the country will only increase if we are to allow this provision to remain in the legislation. I plan to work with my colleagues to ensure that this troubling provision be dropped when the conference to the Farm bill is convened. Americans deserve the piece of mind that comes with the knowledge that the next meal they consume will not make them sick nor cause them harm.

   By shifting from obsolete programs the Kind amendment provides an additional $1.2 billion above the committee bill for fruit and vegetable growers--tripling the Farmer Market Promotion Program, making $500 million mandatory for Specialty Crop Research, making $150 million mandatory for Community Food Projects, and providing hundreds of millions of dollars for community supported agriculture, and the School Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program. 
   I want to emphasize that the Kind amendment would provide $3 billion more than the committee bill to conservation programs. 
   Support for the Kind amendment is broad and diverse including environmental and conservation groups, nutrition groups and groups that serve low-income Americans, specialty crop and organic farmers, and taxpayer groups. This is a sensible amendment. Indeed, the proposal by Mr. Kind, the gentleman from Wisconsin, is a remarkable, admirable legislative reform. I urge my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Chairman, I rise today to oppose the amendment offered by my colleague from Indiana, Mr. PENCE to the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2008. 
   Mr. PENCE's amendment would deny Federal funding under Title X of the Public Health Services Act to Planned Parenthood health facilities throughout the country. As a supporter of Planned Parenthood and the services that it offers to my constituents in my central New Jersey district, I firmly oppose this purely political amendment. 
   This should not be an anti-choice or pro-choice debate about one of the many services that Planned Parenthood provides. In fact, according to Federal statute, no money from Title X can be used for abortion services. Title X makes grants to public and private nonprofit organizations to provide family planning and basic reproductive health care information and services to low-income women. Therefore this debate should be about prevention. It should be about continuing to provide women with the necessary tools for proper prevention, including contraception and education. It should be about protecting women's health by providing women with access to reproductive health care. 
   Planned Parenthood's 841 affiliates provide reproductive health care services to 5 million men and women annually including 84,500 in the state of New Jersey. 63 percent of these patients receive reproductive health care services and 37 percent receive family planning services. Through family planning services Planned Parenthood estimates that its services prevent over 631,000 unwanted pregnancies annually. 
   Cutting Title X funding to Planned Parenthood is nothing short of irresponsible. The low income women who are served through Title X are four times more likely to face an unintended pregnancy. As a safety net provider, Planned Parenthood plays a critical role in serving these women. Title X has proven to be effective and prevents 1 million unwanted pregnancies each year. Planned Parenthood, as the Nation's oldest and largest family planning provider, is responsible for preventing 60 percent of unwanted pregnancies and we should not act to prevent women from getting the reproductive health care they need. I urge my colleagues not to support the Pence amendment.

   One of the characteristics of oppressive governments that we detest is that they spy on their own people. The chilling intrusion into people's lives, effects, and relationships must be controlled even if the government's officers think the intrusion is necessary to preserve safety, security, and order. Indeed, civil protections are necessary, especially if the government officers say they are trying to protect safety, security, and order. 
   Courts must establish that there is a probable cause to believe an American is a threat to society, and it must be the courts, not the Attorney General, not the Director of National Intelligence, who determine that the standard is met. 
   The issue here is not about foreign-to-foreign intercepts. It is about how our government treats its citizens.

I urge our leadership to make the changes necessary to this bill so that it protects our citizens from both enemy attacks and warrantless government surveillance. 
   Mr. Speaker, executive branch assurances that the rights of Americans will be protected through administrative procedures are no substitute for judicial protections.

We will have the best protection when agencies have to demonstrate to a court that they know what they are doing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support the amendment from my colleague from New Jersey, Mr. Pallone and my colleague from Pennsylvania, Mr. Murphy to the Federal Railway Safety and Safety Improvement Act. 
   Mr. Pallone and Mr. Murphy's amendment would exclude from the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board the regulation and approval of solid waste transfer and processing facilities near railway stations. This amendment addresses a serious environmental concern in allowing companies to skirt solid waste regulations and I fully support this amendment. 
   The Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 gave the STB jurisdiction over transportation by rail carriers and authorized the STB to pre-empt Federal, State or local laws in conflict with Commerce Clause. This law was intended to extend the STB's authority only to railroad operations, not to the operation of facilities located by rail services or to businesses which have a connection to a rail company. Unfortunately, confusion about Congressional intent behind the ICCTA has been exploited by some companies to override State and Federal environmental regulations for the sake of profit and have put both the environment and the public health at risk. 
   It is through a gross misinterpretation of ICCTA that the STB allows companies to seek Federal preemption of a host of environmental and public health laws by simply locating their facilities on railroad property. One of the more egregious examples of this abuse is the building of solid waste facilities along rail lines. In the State of New Jersey, the STB has allowed nine railroad transfer facilities to operate under the supposed Federal preemption supposedly authorized through the ICCTA--at least one of which handles toxic waste. 
   Many of these facilities are little more than trash heaps which do not have to comply with either State or Federal solid waste regulations. This is unacceptable. We have spent the last decade working to clean up the damage that has been caused by improper waste disposal, and continuing to allow companies to exploit the ICCTA is a step backwards in the progress we have made in regulating this industry. Mr. Pallone and Mr. Murphy's amendment would take a crucial step towards correcting this problem and I urge my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3773, RESTORE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
   The RESTORE Act, which its well-meaning authors believe will both help protect our liberties and our security, does the latter but, unfortunately, does not fully do the former. If I had more time, I would talk about the good features of this bill, but in the time I have, I would like to point to the one thing that it needs most, that it lacks, which is ironclad language that maintains the fourth amendment's individual warrant requirement when Americans' property or communications are searched and seized by the government. 
   The RESTORE Act would allow the government to collect the communications of innocent Americans. The executive branch assurances that the rights of Americans will be protected through administrative procedures are no substitute for judicial protections. In recent weeks and months, we've seen too many abuses of administrative warrants to find any reassurance or to even find these assurances believable. 
   Yes, I voted ``yes'' in committee to bring this to the floor, with the assurances that we would work to get it better. I regret to say that I've seen no effort to resolve this point. It could be fixed easily to the safety of Americans, because Americans will be safer when agencies have to demonstrate to a court that they know what they are doing. We get better intelligence, just as we get better law enforcement, when you do it by the rules. 
   In fact, my own leadership I believe would deny me time to speak on this issue to try to strengthen this bill, but for the sake of the security of Americans, I implore the leadership to make these improvements.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. I thank the Chair, and I rise in support of the bill. 
   The work in the Intelligence Committee is some of the most difficult work that goes on here in the House, behind closed doors, necessarily with little public input, but we are blessed with a good staff and a good chairman. We never forget that our work is about people, about the safety of the American people and about the hardworking, brave people of the intelligence community. 
   H.R. 5959 contains some useful provisions that are designed to strengthen congressional oversight. Among these is a fence of 75 percent of covert action funds, fenced until each member of the House and Senate intelligence committees has been fully briefed. 
   I think it would be sufficient to say that this administration has taken a cavalier attitude toward its legal obligations to keep the committees fully and currently informed. 
   This bill would require the CIA Inspector General to conduct audits of all covert action programs regularly. It would increase critical research and development activities and improve foreign language capabilities. It would prohibit the use of contractors for CIA detainee interrogations. 
   It would clarify what ``fully and currently informed'' in the law means for briefing Congress so that all information necessary for Congress would be provided, and it explicitly requires that all committee members be notified in general, not just selected members. 
   It requires guidelines for the implementation of a multilevel security clearance to increase linguistic and cultural expertise. It would require reports on the use of contractors, on workforce diversity, on foreign language proficiency, on the protection of intelligence officers' identities. 
   There are a number of good features. This is a good bill that strengthens our oversight of the intelligence community. We do have a long way to go to provide the kind of oversight needed after many years when the intelligence community got almost every wish, billions of dollars with insufficient justification. 
   I do support the bill and urge that my colleagues do as well.

   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I need not be long. 
   This is a straightforward, simple amendment that I hope will be without controversy. My amendment to the Intelligence Authorization Act would require the Director of National Intelligence to inform all recipients of the October 2007 National Intelligence Estimate on Iran's nuclear program of any new intelligence on this subject that has emerged since the publication last fall. 
   The October 2007 NIE was prepared with new and, I would say, improved procedures and provided us with insights into the status of the Iranian nuclear program. As you know, Mr. Chairman, the intelligence process is not static. This amendment is designed to ensure that Congress and others in the executive branch get the very latest information on Iran's nuclear program in a timely fashion and developed with good intelligence procedures. 
   I believe I have no other speakers, but I will reserve my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from Florida. It is indeed a pleasure and an education to serve with him on the Intelligence Committee. 
   And I rise today in support of this rule and the underlying bill. Although this bill is not the full reform that I think is needed, it does contain many features that, if enacted, will improve the operation and oversight of the intelligence community. 
   I'd like to address one amendment that has been made in order, and I thank the Rules Committee for accepting for consideration an amendment that I offer that seeks to address an issue that's been one of the highest concerns for both this committee and the Congress, and that is, protecting the security and the cover of intelligence officers. 
   This grows out, in part, of the well publicized outing of a former CIA officer. For nearly 4 years, I have led the effort within the committee and in this body to determine the facts surrounding this case, as well as its consequences for the security of our Nation. 
   In previous Congresses, on eight separate occasions, in committee and on this floor, the then majority voted down every effort to obtain information on the matter. As I repeatedly noted at the time, Mr. Fitzgerald's criminal inquiry could never address some of the key questions that we sought to have answers for. 
   For example, how and why did Ms. Plame's cover status become known to those with no legitimate need to know? 
   How much damage was done to our intelligence collection efforts as a result of the outing of Ms. Plame? 
   What measures has the CIA and has the now Director of National Intelligence taken to prevent similar compromises in the future? 
   We still need answers to these and other questions. The amendment I am offering today that I will offer, would require the President, through the Director of National Intelligence, to report annually to the Congress on the need for any modification to the Intelligence Identities Protection Act to improve the legal protections for covert agents. This report, along with other oversight that the committee will undertake, and that I hope to undertake through the Select Intelligence Oversight Panel, will help us establish exactly what measures need to be taken to minimize the chances of such compromises of the identities of covert operatives in the future. 
   These men and women take enormous risks on our behalf. We owe it to them to ensure their identities are protected from the exposure, both from hostile intelligence services but even from those within our own government who would seek to retaliate against them for speaking truth to power. 
   This reporting requirement would be an amended version of what the President is already required to do, but has failed to do every year. We seek to have the President show more diligence in protecting the cover of these employees. 
   Let me reiterate that this amendment represents only one step in the process. The chairman of the committee has assured me that there will be oversight and legislative action on this issue in addition to that which we are taking today. 
   I would also like to comment that it is astonishing in the debates leading up to this in committee and here on the floor today that there would be so much attention being paid to the request for a national intelligence estimate on climate change. A preliminary assessment is already in the works. We should want the intelligence community to be considering everything that affects our national security, be it demographics or climate or droughts. I am astonished that there would be any resistance to having such a national intelligence estimate. So I am pleased that the committee has put that in this bill, and I look forward to its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' CARE, KATRINA RECOVERY, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. I thank my friend from Wisconsin. 
   Mr. Speaker, 4 years ago, President Bush used soldiers and sailors as stage props to declare that major combat operations in Iraq have ended. Well, indeed those combat operations should have ended, in fact, they never should have begun. This combat is constitutionally and strategically unjustifiable, operationally poorly executed with regard to armoring and deploying the troops, and politically and diplomatically disastrous. 
   This war is not making anyone more safer or more free, and it cannot be won militarily. As retired General Odom said, the challenge we face today is not how to win in Iraq but how to recover from a strategic mistake, invading Iraq in the first place. 
   The President continues to squander American influence, blood and treasure. It is the President's intransigence that forces us to pass this bill to force a change in the course in Iraq. The President needs to know that the days of congressional blank checks in support of a failed policy are over. We cannot continue to buy time with American lives.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our troops and for ending President Bush's war in Iraq. 
   This bill gives the President all the money he needs to ensure our troops have the equipment, ammunition, fuel, food, spare parts, and anything else they need to ensure their safety and security. What this bill does not give the President is the blank check with no questions and no accountability that he's come to expect over the last 4 years. Those days are over. 
   Yesterday's Washington Post front page story on the President's ``surge'' strategy was entitled ``Commanders in Iraq See `Surge' Into '08.'' While General Petreaus told the Congress earlier this year that we could determine the effectiveness of the troop increase within several months, General Odierno is trying to ``get until April (2008, that is) so we can decide whether to keep it going or not.'' 
   If the Post's report is accurate--that the surge that was supposed to last several months will now last for well over a year--then it is more imperative than ever that we place clear limits on our future involvement in Iraq. We cannot continue to buy time with American lives and taxpayer dollars to support a fundamentally flawed policy. 
   Nor should we continue down this road when the Iraqis themselves fail to take the steps necessary to heal the divisions in their own country. Americans deserve to know that Iraq's government is about to take a 2-month vacation--while Baghdad burns and American troops continue to die daily amid the crossfire of Iraq's civil war. As the current U.S. troop ``surge'' reaches completion around mid-June, Iraq's parliament will adjourn for 2 months. 
   If Iraq's government is prepared to go AWOL in the middle of their civil war, why should we stay? Why should more of our troops die to help protect a government that leaves town with the battle raging on the streets of Baghdad? 
   I want to thank my friend, the gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. McGovern, for offering his own blueprint for redeploying our forces from Iraq. I'm pleased to be able to support this measure, and I commend Mr. McGovern for his relentless commitment to help this House get it right on Iraq--to demand accountability for those responsible for the situation in Iraq. 
   That's what this debate is really about: getting Iraq's leaders to take responsibility for their country's security and its future. We can't end their civil war--only they can, but only if their political leaders cancel their 2-month vacation and get down to the hard work of building a new Iraq. 
   If enacted, this bill would incentivize them to do exactly that--it would force them to focus their full energies on reaching a political solution to Iraq's civil war, or face the prospect of a cut off in U.S. aid. 
   Mr. Speaker, President Bush announced his intention to veto this bill before it ever came to the House floor. His veto threat proves that he's more interested in continuing his war with Congress than he is in finding a bipartisan solution to the war in Iraq. That threat is all the more reason why we need to pass this bill so we can do what the American people have asked us to do: to end America's tragic misadventure in Iraq.

   Mr. HOLT. Madam Chairman, although the bill before us today does not produce the overhaul of intelligence I seek, it does address a number of critical deficiencies in the operation and oversight of the intelligence community, and I support this important legislation. 
   I commend the committee staff. They do excellent work without help from outside. And I commend the Chair, the gentleman from Texas, for his sensible, considerate approach to his work as Chair. 
   There are several specific provisions in this bill that I would like to highlight. For example, the bill requires the compilation of a comprehensive inventory of special access programs, as well as measures to improve the contracting accountability. These provisions will give the committee additional tools to hold the intelligence community accountable for its actions and the use or misuse of taxpayer funds. 
   Again this year we demand more attention to the foreign language facility of employees in the intelligence community. 
   Of course, we would want the intelligence community to look at international and global issues that affect our national security. And who could oppose the attention to climate change? 
   There are a number of areas where we have had added or reduced resources. Overall, the agencies have ample support, the largest budget ever. By the way, I would say to my colleague from Kansas, there is no reduction in human intelligence collectors. This legislation adds resources for their training, it adds analytic capability, it adds technologies to help them do their job. 
   Let me close by thanking the chairman again for the admirable manner that he shows in running this committee. I support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to do so.

   The amendment I am offering would require the President, through the Director of National Intelligence, to report annually to Congress on the need for any modification to the Intelligence Identity Protection Act to improve legal protection for covert agents. This report, along with other oversight work the committee will undertake, will help us establish what measures need to be taken to minimize the chances in the future of compromising the identities of covert operatives. 
   These men and women take enormous risks on our behalf. Their covers are their only protection when they are working overseas. We owe them everything we can do to ensure that their identities are protected from exposure both from hostile intelligence services or even from exposure within our own government by those who would seek to retaliate against them for speaking truth to power. 
   This grew out of my consideration, trying to draw lessons from what has become a well-publicized example of the outing of a former CIA officer. In previous Congresses, on eight separate occasions in committees and on this floor, the then-majority voted down every effort to obtain information on this matter; and as I repeatedly noted at those times, Mr. Fitzgerald's criminal inquiry could never address some of the key questions that we sought answers to: How and why did Ms. Valerie  Plame's cover status come to be known to those with no legitimate need to know? How much damage was done to our intelligence collection efforts as a result of the outing of Ms. Plame? What measures has the Central Intelligence Agency and now the Director of National Intelligence taken to prevent similar compromises in the future? 
   It appears that nothing has changed. So this sort of thing could happen again. It's important that we take steps to protect, as I say, the only protection that these covert agents have if they are in dangerous positions overseas. 
   So that is the point of this amendment, and I seek the approval of the House. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Auto Industry Financing and Restructuring Act (H.R. 7321), emergency legislation to authorize and appropriate funding to temporarily stabilize the American automobile industry. 
   The automobile industry provides one of the few manufacturing bases left in the United States, and approximately 3.3 million jobs in the Nation are either directly or indirectly dependent upon it. According to the Economic Policy Institute, New Jersey stands to lose 17,900 jobs if General Motors fails, and 65,000 jobs if the auto industry collapses--and an industry-wide collapse is the likely result if even one of the big-three auto makers fails. As we stand on the precipice, already facing an unemployment rate more than 6 percent, we cannot afford to stand by and watch as millions more in America join the ranks of the unemployed. It is well within the realm of possibility--some experts argue it is virtually a certainty--that allowing even one of our major auto makers to fail would send the country into a depression. 
   The United States is facing a virtual ``perfect storm'' with respect to the many sectors of its economy that are simultaneously in distress. One of the most damaging outcomes of this economic crisis has been that credit markets are frozen. In fact, despite the infusion of billions in funding intended to stabilize the financial services markets under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, EESA, enacted in October, credit markets still have not improved as of the closing days of 2008. Instead, stable banks that have received those Capital Purchase Program, CPP, funds under the EESA have tended either to retain the funds to improve their own stability or use the funds to purchase other struggling financial services entities. Had Troubled Asset Relief Program, TARP, funds under the EESA been used for the purpose the Treasury Secretary originally demanded them for--to purchase troubled assets or implement other mechanisms through which those assets could be liquidated and thus free up the credit markets--perhaps things would be different. 
   Under the EESA, the U.S. Comptroller General is required to report every 60 days on TARP implementation, and in its first report released last week, the GAO stated that ``Treasury has yet to address a number of critical issues, including determining how it will ensure that CPP is achieving its intended goals.'' I am not convinced that the CPP is achieving its goals, or even that the CPP program will be more effective than using TARP funds or other creative mechanisms to liquidate TARP assets would have been. In addition, the Treasury Secretary and the Bush administration have refused to use even a tiny fraction--less than 5 percent--of the TARP funds to stabilize the auto industry until the CPP has the impact of freeing up credit markets, which could then meet the auto industry's need for financing. Therefore, our major auto makers have come to Washington to ask the taxpayers for a loan. 
   Some commentators, and indeed some of my constituents, have argued that Congress should simply let the automakers go bankrupt. But the likelihood that that could deepen our current recession is too great, and the persons who would be punished by congressional inaction are not the ones who created the crisis,  but rather the millions of people whose jobs depend on the auto industry. 
   Therefore, we must support the auto industry. I am pleased to see that the measure before us will provide taxpayers with an equity stake in the underlying companies, prohibit the payment of dividends to shareholders during the life of the loans, and prohibit golden parachutes and payment of bonuses to the top 25 most highly paid employees at each company. In addition, it establishes both a ``Car Czar'' to hold the companies accountable for developing and implementing sustainable restructuring plans, and oversight authority by the Government Accountability Office and the Special Inspector General overseeing the TARP rescue funds. 
   But my own personal request to the automakers is that they look deep inside and unearth the roots of the problems that--independently of both the current financial crisis and the legacy costs that they have faced that other manufacturers have not--have caused them to lag behind their competitors overseas. It is important for us all to remember that it was General Motors that established the Saturn Corporation more than two decades ago, with the goal of creating a manufacturing plant from scratch to build small cars of superior quality and value, combining what was then the most advanced technology with the newest and most efficient and environmentally responsible approaches to management. Indeed, within a decade, Saturn achieved those goals by producing a car that J.D. Power & Associates ranked behind only the Lexus and the Infiniti, luxury cars produced by Toyota and Nissan overseas, for customer satisfaction in 1992. 
   And it was General Motors, again, that developed the EV1 electronic car more than one decade ago, in response to California's then-zero-emissions requirement. The EV1 was a sleek, fast, powerful vehicle than ran on an overnight charge in the garage, and it was the much-beloved means of transportation for numerous well-known Hollywood celebrities. And yet, within a decade, the EV1 had all but disappeared from the roads and most of them--as graphically depicted in the documentary ``Who Killed the Electric Car''--were actually destroyed. If we don't understand all of the reasons why the success of GM's Saturn venture waned, or why the GM EV1 was all but wiped from the earth, we will never relaunch a sustainable auto mobile industry in this country. 
   But we are here today because the United States remains in the throws of a financial crisis, and it is incumbent upon the government to act. Although I regret that already-authorized TARP funds are not being used for this purpose, and that the plan before us will in part cannibalizing the very funds authorized to facilitate the efforts of the automakers to develop more fuel-efficient vehicles, I will stand firmly behind our auto industry under the conditions the leadership have negotiated, rather than let it fail and disappear. I look forward to working with the new administration to craft a more sustainable, fiscally responsible solution to this problem in the coming months.

   Mr. HOLT. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, today we will hear the good features of this legislation, the 4.5 million families that can afford college better because of tuition deductions, teachers who can get deductions for classroom expenses, the extension of the R&D tax credit, the 11 million families who will benefit from sales tax deduction, and of course the central piece of this, the relief from the alternative minimum tax. In fact, in my own district, which is one of the most hardest hit in the country by the alternative minimum tax, 88,000 of my constituents are unfairly caught in the AMT, and they will find relief in this bill. 
   I would like to address a feature that I am particularly pleased to see in this legislation. Property taxes are applied locally, as we know, and for some years I've tried to get relief at the Federal level for these local taxes, which have grown far ahead of the rate of inflation. Several years ago, in the previous Congress, I introduced legislation that would provide a standard deduction for homeowners who do not itemize their taxes. Now the Ways and Means Committee, under the new leadership of Chairman Rangel, and with the strong advocacy of Representative Emanuel, has included in this legislation such a deduction. Now, more than 30 million homeowners who do not currently itemize their tax deductions and yet still pay high property taxes will find relief in this bill. It will be a standard deduction of $350 for those filing individually, $700 for those filing jointly, and it will be available, I repeat, for something like 30 million Americans, including those in New Jersey who pay the highest property taxes in the country. 
   So, I thank the chairman and the committee for their wisdom in including this legislation. I urge adoption of the rule and the passage of the underlying bill.

   Unfortunately, the negotiators who brought this bill to the floor bought into the flawed assumptions of the Bush administration that because we live in a dangerous world, we must now redefine the fourth amendment and thus the fundamental relationship between the government and its people. 
   If this bill becomes law, it will perhaps be the only lasting legacy of the Bush-Cheney administration's overhaul of national security policy, a congressionally blessed distortion of congressional checks and balances. It permits massive warrantless surveillance in the absence of any standard for defining how communications of innocent Americans will be protected; a fishing expedition approach to intelligence collection that we know will not make Americans more safe. 
   Its court review provisions are weak and narrowly defined. I know some of those who negotiated this bill say that some court review is better than no court review. That is only true if the judge's hands aren't tied in the review process. They are in this bill. 
   There is a fundamental American principle that those who search, seize, intercept and detain should not be the ones who decide who are the bad guys.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (WOUNDED WARRIOR ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, it's unfortunate that we even have to consider this bill. Proper care of our military wounded should be the top priority of our military medical establishment. As we know now, it was not a sufficient priority for the Secretary of the Army and several senior Army officers. Those individuals may be gone, but the problems they allowed to take root and fester must be eliminated. This bill is a good first step in that direction. 
   The Wounded Warrior Assistance Act seeks to correct the training, personnel, and oversight deficiencies that the Walter Reed Medical Center scandal revealed earlier this year. I want to be clear: the overwhelming majority of the men and women who work at Walter Reed are first-rate medical professionals who care deeply about the troops in their care. However, we now know that for several years, Walter Reed--and almost certainly other DoD and VA medical facilities across the country--had been strained beyond its capacity. 
   Ill-advised decisions--including the outsourcing of administrative and maintenance personnel--clearly contributed to the appalling living conditions experienced by some soldiers at Walter Reed. I applaud the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Skelton, for including a 1-year moratorium on such outsourcing pending a review of the entire practice. I have long argued that it is a myth that the private sector can invariably do a better job than the Federal government with these kinds of services. We've already seen in Iraq how corporate contracting giants like Haliburton can make hundreds of millions of dollars while providing substandard services to troops in the field. I'm grateful that my colleagues on multiple committees are looking at these issues, and I'm sure the reforms in this bill will only be the beginning of our effort to re-evaluate the use of contractors within the Federal government. 
   This bill also mandates a review of the status of all DoD medical facilities, which is another key step in providing the oversight needed to ensure that any other hospitals or clinics with deficient care are identified and remedial measures taken immediately. I am confident that my friend from California, Mr. Filner, the chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, is already taking the same steps. Indeed, another positive aspect of this bill is that it seeks to streamline and rationalize the transition process for veterans when they move from the DoD medical system to the VA for treatment and followup care. 
   This bill requires that DoD ensure the veteran's medical and related records are transferred in a timely fashion, and that veterans get pre-separation counseling so that they understand the benefits they are entitled to and how to best interact with the VA medical system. Establishing a clear-cut mechanism for ensuring that veterans transition seamlessly from one system to another will require both a congressionally mandated structure, but perhaps even more important, continuous congressional engagement. That is why I am especially pleased that this bill mandates that members of Congress be informed any time one of their wounded military constituents enters the military medical system. 
   Current law requires DoD to notify members of the death of military constituents. These notifications, while bearing tragic news, allow us to provide the maximum possible assistance to families who have lost a servicemember. By now ensuring that we are informed when military constituents are wounded, we will be able to work proactively with the families to ensure the needs of the wounded are met in a more timely manner, and to provide us with a roadmap for oversight actions early on. 
   Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from Missouri, Mr. Skelton, for the work that he and his committee colleagues have done to bring this measure before us today, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008, H.R. 5501. 
   This important legislation reauthorizes and expands the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). I have long supported this bold initiative that has made the U.S. a leader in this critical health and moral issue of our time. PEPFAR has shown to the world our nation's vision and compassion in addressing this healthcare crisis. 
   Five years ago, an estimated 31 million people were living with HIV/AIDS worldwide, anti-retroviral drug treatments were expensive, and approximately 8,200 people were infected with HIV/AIDS every day. 
   I have heard from a number of my constituents about their support for continued U.S. efforts to combat AIDS and the spread of HIV around the globe. It is obvious that Americans care. In the absence of a cure for AIDS, this worldwide epidemic continues to spread at an alarming rate. 
   That is why I am pleased that H.R. 5501 makes an important transition from emergency relief to the establishment of long-term and sustainable AIDS relief programs. The legislation also works to better integrate the tuberculosis and malaria programs with the HIV/AIDS programs. This is essential because in sub-Saharan Africa tuberculosis is the leading killer of individuals with HIV/AIDS. 
   Since the creation of this program, the United States has invested more than $19 billion to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. The results have been striking. By the end of 2007, the United States had helped provide anti-retroviral drug treatments to approximately 1.5 million people with AIDS, supported care for 6.6 million--including 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children--and  helped to prevent more than 157,000 infant infections. 
   H.R. 5501 greatly expands our efforts abroad by authorizing a total of $50 billion over five years. This total includes $41 billion for HIV/AIDS programs, $5 billion for malaria programs, and $4 billion for tuberculosis programs. This dramatic increase in funding will help partner countries continue to identify and meet targets for treatment and prevention. Additionally, the funding will help build and strengthen the existing health systems in host countries. 
   While I support the underlying bill, I do have some concern about one specific issue. I have long been concerned by the restrictions placed on how PEPFAR funds can be spent. I have opposed the requirement that one-third of the funds be spent on abstinence-only education because it has not proven to be a successful way to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. A report by the Government Accountability Office found that this restriction tied the local hands of public health workers. 
   I believe that PEPFAR funds should be spent on the most effective HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention strategies available. That is why I am pleased that H.R. 5501 removes the requirement that one-third of the funds be spent on abstinence education. As this bill works through the legislative process, I hope that any language in the bill that might be interpreted to limit funding to programs that are compliant with the global gag rule be removed. 
   Madam Chairman, our country has done more to end the spread of HIV/AIDS in the last five years than any nation in the history of the world. We must continue. This bill represents a reasonable expansion of our efforts and makes the important transition to permanent HIV/AIDS relief. I urge my colleagues to support this investment in the health of our global community and in the fight against HIV/AIDS.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING SCIENCE EDUCATION -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution and commend my colleague, EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON, for introducing it and the chairman of the Science Committee for bringing it forward. 
   This resolution expresses the sense of Congress that increasing American capabilities in science, mathematics, and technology education should be a national priority. And I must say, I hope Members on the other side of this aisle will avoid distracting us with red herrings across the trail and debating other diverting matters such as drilling and digging in the United States and stick to this topic which is of critical importance. 
   Since first coming to Congress almost a decade ago, I stressed the need for a new major national effort to improve science, mathematics, and technology education. I'm a product of the science revolution in the United States that occurred following the launch of Sputnik in 1957. And today, as this resolution notes, we must recommit ourselves to creating a new generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians, and just as important, indeed more important, we need to build a general public that is literate and comfortable with science, math, technology. 
   I would ask at this point to include in the Record a copy of a recent op-ed essay entitled ``Put a Little Science in Your Life'' by Brian Greene, professor of physics at Columbia and author of The Elegant Universe. He discusses the importance of science in everyone's lives, not just scientists.

   Mr. HOLT. Quite simply, the reason gasoline prices are so high today--of course there is international speculation--is there's demand from other countries; there's the falling value of the dollar. Principally, it is because, in past decades, we failed to wean ourselves from fossil fuels. We have failed to make the investment in research and development that would make that possible. You're talking about drilling in Alaska.

   And to my friend from California, I would say if we wanted to use this time for a discussion of both fiscal responsibility and which side of the aisle has done better with respect to individuals with disabilities and title I, boy, that's an argument that we would gladly take on. 
   But that's not the topic here. The topic here is the green schools program, and energy costs are the second highest operating expenditure for schools after personnel costs. 
   The two gentlemen from California were talking about how this is wasteful spending. I'll tell you what's wasteful. About a third of those $8 billion annually that schools spend on energy could be saved. 
   What this legislation does, it provides help for local schools and States to invest in energy-saving design and technology, which will provide not only better learning conditions but save billions of dollars. 
   So this actually is beneficial from a fiscal point of view, as well as an educational point of view.

   Also, we've included a provision to ensure that veteran-owned businesses receive the same contracting preferences as minority and women-owned businesses. As the war continues to swell the veteran population, it's our duty to help to ensure that returning soldiers have jobs to return to.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (STUDENT LOAN SUNSHINE ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 890, the Student Loan Sunshine Act and I thank Chairman GEORGE MILLER for bringing this bill to the floor. 
   With the rising cost of college, students and families are more reliant then ever on student loans to pay for college. At the same time, it is becoming more and more important for these students to earn a college degree to compete for good jobs. U.S. Census data show that, on average, every year of post-secondary education raises a worker's annual earnings, helping the worker to provide for his family as well as to give back to his community. Post-secondary education is becoming more and more important--according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the percentage of jobs requiring post-secondary education will rise from 29% in 2000 to 42% by the end of the decade. 
   Ongoing investigations into the student loan industry have revealed that egregious conflicts of interest and corrupt practices among lenders, schools, and public officials are undermining the student loan programs that millions of borrowers have come to depend on. Just yesterday Theresa Shaw, chief operating officer of the office of federal student aid, resigned from the Department of Education. My own State of New Jersey now has the State Attorney General looking into evidence of agreements between the New Jersey Higher Education Student Assistance Authority and lenders that show lenders paid the agency to market their products to schools. 
   I am pleased that this bill bans all gifts, participation on advisory boards, and risk-sharing agreements between lenders and schools and requires institutions to disclose all relationships with lenders. The bill ensures that students have access to all lenders of their choice, including those not on the ``Preferred Lender Lists.'' The bill bans staffing of school financial aid offices by lenders, and ensures that schools process all loans, from any lender, and do not steer students away from their first choice. I am also pleased that the bill requires lenders offering private loans to first inform students of their federal borrowing options, so that the student can get the better federal interest rates. 
   Too often, when students leave college they are not informed of all their repayment options. The bill requires that all exit counseling is provided with the school's involvement and that they inform students of all of their repayment options. 
   Students deserve clear, straight-forward information and the bill instills enforceable marketing protections, including disclosures and notifications to students and institutions by lenders offering private loans. This bill gives a student the full picture by requiring lenders and institutions to disclose fully and prominently the terms, conditions, and incentives for all loans. 
   Again, I look forward to the results of the investigation of the State of New Jersey Attorney General and I thank Chairman MILLER for taking these steps to disclose all information about the student loan industry, colleges, and public officials. I ask my colleagues to support this important bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. If enacted, it will spur needed improvements in a critical Federal department that is clearly struggling in many areas. 
   Earlier this year, the Department tried to put the best face on a devastating poll of Federal agencies in which DHS was ranked worst among places to work in the executive branch. Poor morale has led to significant turnover throughout the various agencies that comprise DHS, and inequitable pay scales have contributed to this problem. This bill corrects one of those inequities: the bill strips the Department  of the authority to develop a personnel system different from the traditional GS schedule Federal model. Workers who perform largely the same tasks at DHS that are performed at other agencies should not be paid less for doing the same work. This is a basic issue of fairness, and I'm glad the bill addresses this issue. 
   I'm also pleased that the bill requires pay parity for Customs and Border Protection employees. Our CBP officers often have some of the most dangerous and thankless jobs in the Federal Government. The fact that in the past they have not been compensated at the same rate as other Federal law enforcement officers is an injustice that this bill remedies. Recruiting and retaining CBP officers who are skilled at managing the complex and sometimes dangerous task of protecting our borders must be a national priority. This provision reaffirms that fact. 
   This bill also seeks to strengthen and formalize the Department's roles and relationships with State and local fusion centers. If there is one complaint I think every member of Congress receives from their local first responders, it's that information they receive from DHS is either late in getting to them, irrelevant to their needs, or both. I have spoken to DHS's Chief Intelligence Officer, Charlie Allen, about this ongoing problem. He knows there is much more that needs to be done to improve the information sharing process. What is unclear to me is whether the Department's senior leadership recognizes the problem. 
   What DHS needs--but still lacks--is a common intelligence database that is accessible to State and local law enforcement officials who are cleared to receive such information. Posting more DHS personnel to State and local fusion centers will improve the security of localities in States only if the information being provided through such liaison officers is timely and relevant. 
   Finally, I am concerned that DHS continues to flounder in its efforts to prioritize its science and technology needs.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (SMALL BUSINESS FAIRNESS IN CONTRACTING ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1873, the Small Business Fairness in Contracting Act. 
   Small businesses are a big part of the U.S. economy. In fact, small businesses employ more than half of all private sector employees and pay 45 percent of the total U.S. private payroll. New jobs come disproportionately from small businesses, which generated 60 to 80 percent of new jobs in the past 10 years. 
   Although federal government contracting practices are required by law to be supportive of small businesses, the bundling of contracts has prevented many small businesses from being able to compete fairly. This is a significant loss to small businesses, as federal contracts pay a total of $400 billion annually to contractors. H.R. 1873 gives small businesses a fair chance at competing for these contracts by preventing the contract bundling that has excluded them from being considered. In doing this, the Act also insures that taxpayer money is spent more efficiently, as more competition for government contracts will necessarily result in better use of public funds. 
   The Act further improves small business contracting practices by creating a system by which small businesses and opportunities for small businesses can be better catalogued and tracked. If a business has grown and should no longer be considered small, we will know, and well give priority to true small businesses. If a large business has not subcontracted enough to small businesses, we will know, and we will assist small businesses in finding these subcontracting opportunities. 
   When small businesses can compete fairly and are made aware of the opportunities provided them, jobs are created, entrepreneurship thrives, and the overall economy prospers. I therefore encourage my colleagues to support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (PASSAGE OF H.R. 4 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I believe we have an obligation to ensure that our Nation's seniors have access to the world-class prescription drugs which have been developed to improve their quality of life and, in some cases, to save those lives. That is why I thought that the previous Congress did a disservice to our Nation's seniors when the flawed prescription drug benefit was created. 
   I want Medicare part D to work as well as possible for America's seniors, and that is why Congress needs to address the gap of drug coverage that occurs when a senior enters the so-called doughnut hole and does not get financial help. 
   I want Medicare part D to work as well as traditional Medicare, which does work well. I will soon reintroduce legislation to help those who have experienced the predicament of being stuck in the doughnut hole by increasing the types of expenses that are counted toward their total out-of-pocket costs. This will help seniors get through the doughnut hole. 
   Now, today, the House passed legislation to give seniors access to affordable medicines. I supported this legislation because I think we need to act to improve the drug benefit and ensure that our Nation's seniors are properly taken care of. 
   I am pleased that the legislation maintains the prohibition on formularies contained in the original 2003 drug benefit legislation. It seems to me that national formularies, to limit available medicines, would do more to undermine patient health than to lower costs and, therefore, should not be imposed. 
   I remain concerned that there is no such language concerning price controls. I don't think the government can effectively establish prices. The marketplace is the best place to set prices that will help ensure the continuing pipeline of lifesaving and life-improving drugs. Historically, price controls have proved to be an awkward, clumsy way to allocate goods and services under ordinary circumstances. 
   But I want to talk for a moment about the great research that is being done at a number of different pharmaceutical companies in my district, in my State and across America. Research and development is the lifeblood of America's economic growth. Let me repeat: research and development is the lifeblood of America's economic growth. 
   I am proud to be the founder and co-chair with the gentlelady from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert) of the Congressional Research Service and Development Caucus. 
   Now, every time this House acts, we should make sure that we protect the vibrant, path-breaking research that is occurring in the United States. 
   Now, there is a reason that we had a debate today on the prescription drug bill. We had the debate and the vote on this because the pharmaceutical research has been extraordinarily effective. Pharmaceutical companies have produced medicines that are not only very good for keeping people alive, improving their lives and reducing suffering, but medicines that were even inconceivable a decade or two ago. These medicines are truly a matter of life and death, and we would not be having this debate, but for the success of the pharmaceutical companies. 
   I don't want today's debate to leave anyone with the impression that this body wants to demonize the industry and make them stop doing their lifesaving work. None of the drugs we hear about were created overnight. They took years of effort by thousands of talented researchers and scientists. Starting with maybe half a million chemical compounds after years of basic research, a company might end  up with, say, 10 safe and effective compounds. The best one, after 8 more years of clinical trials, might receive FDA approval. And then, and only then can they begin to bring this medication to market. 
   This research is costly, but vitally important. At every step along the process the research might prove to be noneffective, and the process would have to start over again. It is not easy; it is not cheap. These companies spend more money on research and development than any other industry. 
   I often point out that we in the United States fail to invest sufficiently for research and development in every sector of our economy, with the possible exception of pharmaceuticals.     
   Let us not punish these companies for their very success and research that will be to the possible benefit of nearly every person in America. 
   While we must ensure that all Americans get the full benefit of that research, and that is part of what today's legislation was about, it is essential that we do everything in Congress we can to ensure that America maintains its innovative edge and continues to grow as a leader in research and development.

   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I would like to commend Chairman Miller and Mr. McKeon for producing a strong piece of legislation. The College Opportunity and Affordability Act does what the name suggests. It expands affordability and access to college education for the broadest range of Americans. It expands Pell Grants, the basis of financial aid, and I'm pleased to say it allows Pell Grants to be used year round and for certificate programs and part-time students, something I have been working on for a long time. 
   The bill does many other things, including some initiatives that I have been working on. It empowers small and community colleges to provide child care programs so that working mothers can attend school. It includes grants and loan forgiveness for math and science students who pledge to conduct service in math and science fields after graduation. It includes grants for foreign language partnerships between local schools and language departments at institutions of higher learning and grants to institutions that will combine science with foreign languages. 
   I am pleased that in the Education and Labor Committee we were able to pass an amendment so that this bill would create an Assistant Secretary for International and Foreign Language Education. 
   I am pleased to note further that the bill will direct the Institute of Medicine to study how to deal with the shortage of nurses that's created by the shortage of nursing faculty. 
   These initiatives are part of a large effort to make it easier for students to finance their education and an effort to strengthen the quality of education that they receive. This is a good bill. I look forward to working with Members of both parties to see it become law.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. If enacted, this act would compel the President to begin redeploying our troops from Iraq not later than 120 days after it becomes law. It creates the appropriate framework and mechanisms for ensuring an orderly withdrawal of our forces, and it puts the responsibility for Iraq's security where it belongs--on the Iraqis. 
   But once again, the President has declared--long before this bill was brought to the House floor--that he would veto it or any other measure that attempted to correct his failed policy in Iraq. He has become intransigent and disconnected from the reality on the ground in Iraq, and indifferent to the will of the American people. 
   The President's much-vaunted ``surge'' has been underway for 6 months now, and the results are obvious: Iraq is no less violent and chaotic than before the ``surge'' began. Indeed, American casualties--both killed and wounded--have been on the rise for nearly a year, long before the surge started. By pouring more troops into Iraq, the President has simply given the insurgents more targets to shoot at. 
   Perhaps, even worse, he is ruining our ability to work with other countries to foster peace in the Middle East, and he is fanning the flames of a conflagration that is now likely to engulf other countries around Iraq. 
   The President's refusal to change course in Iraq is an enormous injustice to the brave Americans he has put in harm's way. Our troops accomplished the goal of removing Saddam Hussein from power more than 4 years ago. They accomplished the mission that they were given--and then were given another mission for which they were not provided the proper equipment and resources: being forced to act as referees in Iraq's growing civil war. Our troops deserve better. 
   Moreover, the President and his advisors have continued their well-established pattern of moving the goal post on his Iraq policy. Every year, the Congress has been told that Iraq's security forces would be ready to assume responsibility for their country's security in 12 to 18 months. And every time we reached that 12 to 18 month benchmark, the Administration would reset the goal post another 12 to 18 months down the road. The American people have had enough of this bait-and-switch game. Iraqis must accept responsibility for their country's future. 
   Indeed, the President's troop increase has played into the hands of Iraq's current government, which continues to claim that the additional American forces are needed to quell the violence--without mentioning that it is Prime Minister Maliki's own policies that are helping to fuel that violence. Prime Minister Maliki's refusal to purge his security forces of militias and sectarian death squads is a prime reason why Sunni insurgents continue their attacks against Iraq's security forces. Prime Minister Maliki's refusal to compromise on the distribution of power and oil revenue among Iraqis is why the insurgency has only gained in intensity over the past year. How long will we continue to provide military and financial support to his corrupt and ineffectual government? How much longer should our brave fighting men and women serve as referees in the middle of a spreading civil war? 
   If passed, this bill would compel Iraq's leaders to face the fact that we will not continue to indefinitely provide for their country's security with the lives of America's military men and women, and that they must take the necessary political steps needed to end the violence. It is for all of these reasons that I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this conference report, which seeks to ensure that our government fully implements the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. While the Congress has previously enacted the majority of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, several were not addressed during the last Congress. Moreover, in the years since the Department of Homeland Security was created and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 became law, we've learned a number of lessons about how well--or poorly--these reforms have worked. The bill before us is a partial response to those lessons learned. 
   This bill authorizes robust funding for a variety of homeland security grant programs, including emergency management performance grants, interoperable emergency communications grants, and the Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program. The bill also mandates more emphasis on a risk-based approach to the awarding of UASI grants, something that I and others in the New Jersey delegation have long advocated. 
   Improving the department's ability to spot threats and foil attacks before they happen remains a primary concern of all of us in Congress. Those of us who serve on committees that deal with intelligence issues know that the department's intelligence operation suffers from a lack of clout within both the department and the intelligence community as a whole. The bill offers a partial remedy for this problem by reorganizing the department's intelligence operations and elevating the Chief Intelligence Officer from an Assistant Secretary to an Undersecretary--putting that officer on par with his counterpart at the Pentagon. 
   I agree with the thrust of this reorganization. However, we shouldn't deceive ourselves: rearranging the department's organization chart is no substitute for the President putting forward highly qualified nominees for this and the many other positions at DHS that remain vacant to this day. While I believe this proposed reorganization will help to rationalize and streamline DHS's intelligence management structure, the President must take action to appoint intelligence leaders who are aggressive and focused--and then hold them accountable for their performance or lack thereof. 
   Another 9/11 Commission recommendation relating to our intelligence operations concerned declassifying how much we spend per year on intelligence activities. 
   Those who oppose declassifying the overall budget figure claim it would undermine our security. Declassifying the overall budget figure would simply tell the American taxpayer how much of their money is going towards intelligence programs and activities, something they most certainly deserve to know. Declassifying the overall budget figure would in no way compromise intelligence sources or methods. That is why I was disappointed that the conferees elected to include language that allows the President to postpone or even waive the disclosure of the overall intelligence community budget figure by certifying to Congress that such disclosure would damage national security. This was a needless concession to the President and I will seek to have this provision reexamined next year. 
   Regarding measures Congress can take to improve its oversight of the intelligence community, I was pleased to see that the report indicates that the Senate is considering following the House's lead in this area. Earlier this year and under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi, the House passed H. Res. 35, which created the Select Intelligence Oversight Panel, which I have the honor of chairing. Our panel contains a mix of members from both the Appropriations Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Our charter is to continuously review the operations of the intelligence community and to recommend changes in policies and funding levels where necessary. We just completed our first such review, and the vast majority of our recommendations were approved by the full Appropriations Committee just this week. If the Senate is looking for a model for how to better coordinate its intelligence oversight work, I would highly recommend that they look at the model we're now using here in the House. 
   I was also very disappointed to see that the conferees dropped language relating to workers' rights to organize and engage in collective bargaining with the department. Most other Federal workers already have this right, and our failure to ensure our airport screeners are allowed to organize and negotiate for better salaries and benefits is wrong and should be revisited next year. 
   On a brighter note, the bill significantly enhances the power and status of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), whose creation was another key recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. 
   Currently, the PCLOB is under the direct control of the Executive Office of the President. It has lacked significant funding, something I tried to remedy in the fiscal year 2007 Intelligence Authorization bill by offering an amendment to the bill that would have authorized an annual funding stream of $3 million. Unfortunately, the Republican majority blocked that amendment from coming to the House floor for a vote. This bill solves that problem by authorizing a steady increase in the Board's budget, from $5 million for fiscal year 2008 up to $10 million through fiscal year 2011, and such funds as are necessary from 2012 and beyond. 
   Another drawback to the current Board is its lack of independence has clearly undermined its ability to act as a true civil liberties watchdog. The bill before us would remove the Board from the EOP and make it an independent agency within the executive branch, and require that all Board members--not just the chairman--be subject to Senate confirmation. The bill also gives the Board real subpoena power, a critical tool for ensuring compliance with the Board's requests for information and testimony from executive branch officials. 
   Overall, this is a good bill whose enactment would enhance our Nation's security, and it is for that reason that I will vote for it and I urge my colleagues to do likewise.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOLT. (NATIONAL HIGHWAY BRIDGE RECONSTRUCTION AND INSPECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 3999, the National Bridge Construction Act. 
   When the National Highway System was created in 1955, President Eisenhower said ``Our unity as a nation is sustained by the free communication of thought and by the easy transportation of goods ..... [T]ogether the unifying forces of our communication and transportation systems are dynamic elements in the very name we bear-United States.'' 
   However, since the creation of the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s, the Federal Government has failed to fulfill its commitment to maintain our Nation's infrastructure. Conditions on America's surface transportation systems--our roads, bridges and highways, our passenger and freight rail facilities, our public transit networks--are deteriorating. The physical infrastructure itself is showing the signs of age. In almost all cases, the operational efficiency of our key transportation assets is slipping. 
   The catastrophic collapse of the I-35W bridge in Minnesota last year was a reminder that a lack of funding for proper maintenance of our bridges and roadways is more than an inconvenience, it can be deadly. The legislation before us today would provide a short term solution to this problem by increasing funding for bridge construction over the next fiscal year by $1 billion. H.R. 3999 would also require the Department of Transportation to create a better system for inspecting our bridges so they can ensure their safety. It would also ensure that the bridges most in need of repairs are given the funding necessary for safety retrofits. 
   In my home State of New Jersey there are over 6,000 bridges, nearly a third of which the Department of Transportation has determined either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete, including 12 in my central New Jersey district. This legislation would provide the State of New Jersey with over $42 million in  much needed grants for rebuilding these bridges, and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Unfortunately, this funding is little more than a drop in the bucket when considering our long term transportation needs. Our transportation programs are drastically underfunded and require immediate attention in order to be corrected. Today the House of Representatives will consider emergency legislation that would authorize the transfer of $8 billion to the highway trust fund which is expected to experience a $14 billion shortfall in Fiscal Year 2009. However, this is still not enough. 
   When we passed the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy For Users (SAFETEA-LU) back in 2005, we authorized the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission to undertake a thorough review of the state of our national transportation system. This study found that we would need to invest $225 billion annually over the next 50 years in order to ensure that our transportation infrastructure is in a good state of repair. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to address our pressing transportation needs.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join you today in standing up for working families in America by opposing the flawed fast track procedures. 
   When the President sent the Colombia Trade Agreement to Congress earlier this week, he started a clock for the agreement's consideration. He hoped that by forcing Congress to act, he would be able to win approval of the Colombia FTA. Yet, in reality, he only exposed one of the many problems that fast track trade negotiation authority created. 
   Today, Congress is sending a clear message to the President that we will not consider the Colombia Free Trade Agreement or any other FTA's on his time table. We will not be bullied. Congress is a coequal branch of government. 
   As you may know, I have long opposed the granting of fast track authority to the President because it removed Congress from shaping and drafting trade agreements, the timing of their consideration, and allowed Congress only an up or down vote on unamendable trade agreements. In doing so Congress abdicated our essential responsibility to our nation's citizens. I was pleased that this dangerous fast track authority expired last summer and has not been renewed. 
   As I hear from people from across central New Jersey, protecting workers' rights, human rights, and the environment are not secondary or extraneous concerns; they are central to what the United States stands for. I support trade that elevates the quality of life for citizens all over the world. The United States, and indeed the entire world, can benefit from increased trade, but increased trade in itself is not the goal we seek. Rather, we seek an improved quality of life for our people and advancement of other people's well-being. 
   Additionally, even on the merits I am very concerned by the Colombian agreement. As I have said before, trade done right helps lift the global standard of living and works to protect our natural environment. Trade agreements are not just about goods and commodities, they are about values. Trade agreements state what constitutes acceptable behavior in worker's rights, environmental matters, intellectual property, and so forth. We should make sure we export the goods we produce and not the workers who produce them. We must continue to demand improvements in our trade policy.

   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, as a longtime cosponsor, I rise in support of H.R. 1286, the Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route National Historic Trail Designation Act. Students of American history are intimately familiar with the Battle of Yorktown, in which French and American soldiers forced the surrender of British General Lord Cornwallis, effectively handing victory of the Revolutionary War to the American Colonies. 
   However many Americans are less familiar with what preceded it--a harrowing nine state, six hundred mile journey of more than 6,000 allied soldiers from Newport, Rhode Island, through my home state of New Jersey to Yorktown, Virginia. Many historians identify this march led by George Washington, General of the Continental Army and French General Count Rochambeau along a network of roads, trails, and waterways as critical to the American victory at Yorktown and the eventual creation of the United States. 
   In Philipsburg, New York on August 14, 1781, having learned that a large fleet of French naval vessels was heading from the Caribbean Sea to the Chesapeake Bay, Washington and Rochambeau discarded plans to siege New York City and march to Southeastern Virginia, where another celebrated Frenchman the Marquis de Lafayette and his 5,000 troops were outmaneuvering Cornwallis, forcing his British troops to bunker down in Yorktown. With little time to prepare, Washington and Rochambeau led more than 6,300 American and French troops on a southward march to Virginia. 
   H.R. 1286 is an important piece of legislation that comes at a critical time. Despite strong grassroots support from organizations like the National Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route Association, and efforts at the state and local level, many historical sites associated with the American Revolution will be lost to development and suburban sprawl. This bill would designate the route as a National Historic Trail, allowing the National Park Service to preserve and link together sites along the trail. Moreover, this designation would preserve this important piece of America's heritage using existing roads and rights of way--without the federal acquisition of private lands. 
   Preservation of the Washington-Rochambeau route will allow American citizens and visitors alike to gain a greater appreciation of the magnitude and improbability of the American victory as well as the important and often forgotten role our French allies played in securing American independence. Americans need a sense of history and an understanding of history now more than ever. This trail tells an important story in American history, and I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.

   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Fiscal Year 2008 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations bill and also to congratulate Chairwoman LOWEY for her impressive job in crafting a spending bill that meets our important commitments to the international community.  
   I would especially like to thank Chairwoman LOWEY and the State-Foreign Operations Subcommittee for including language in the Committee Report that I requested regarding the science and technology literacy and capacity in the U.S. Department of State. Additionally, the Committee Report includes language I requested supporting the variety of science fellowship programs in the Department of State, including the science-diplomacy fellows of the American Association for the Advancemnt of Science (AAAS), the professional society fellows, and the recently established Jefferson Fellows Program. 
   The Office of the Science and Technology Adviser to the Secretary of State (STAS) has played an important role at the Department of State since 2000. As the chief scientist at State, the Adviser has brought greater visibility to ``science for diplomacy'' and ``diplomacy for science.'' STAS has increased the number of PhD scientists and engineers employed at the Department, including AAAS fellows, professional society fellows, and most recently, Jefferson Science Fellows program. 
   I am glad that the Committee Report includes language applauding the work of the STAS for continuing to promote the essential role of science and technology in diplomacy. More importantly, the committee strongly encourages the Department to continue to increase science and technology capacity and literacy within the Department and the role of science and technology in our Nation's foreign policy. And the committee requests that the Secretary of State be prepared to report during hearings on the Fiscal Year 2009 request on progress made during the 2008 fiscal year. 
   I look forward to working with the State Department and the Appropriations Committee to ensure that advances are made to achieve these stated goals during this upcoming fiscal year. 
   Second, language included in the Committee Report supports the JSF and the other science fellowship programs in the Department of State and makes clear that the committee believes they are valuable programs that should be expanded in the years ahead. 
   As a former AAAS science fellow I know first hand about the important role that science fellows serve in helping policymakers better understand and are able to advance science and technology as a major component of diplomacy. 
   One such program, the Jefferson Science Fellows (JSF) program was established Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in 2003. By providing 1-year fellowships to tenured academic scientists and engineers from our Nation's colleges and universities, the JSF program works to incorporate the American science, technology, and engineering communities into the formulation and implementation of U.S. foreign policy. Each Jefferson Science Fellow is hosted during their fellowship at the Department of State or a foreign embassy abroad. Jefferson Science Fellows are now contributing their scientific expertise to such challenging problems as nuclear non-proliferation, assessments of nanotechnology, pandemics like avian flu, and extreme weather. As the JSF program matures, this growing cadre of practicing experts with first-hand knowledge of the workings within the Department of State will be an increasingly important resource throughout the government. 
   Again, I would like to thank the committee for including this language and I look forward to working with the committee as we build the role of science in our Nation's diplomacy.

   Mr. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to two destructive amendments to the State-Foreign Operations Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2008. 
   First, I oppose the amendment offered by my colleague from Pennsylvania, Mr. PITTS. 
   This amendment will strike an essential provision in this bill for preventing the spread of HIV and AIDS around the world. Mr. PITTS' amendment would strike a provision included in the bill which give the President greater flexibility and the ability for U.S. funded HIV/AIDS programs to better respond to the epidemics in each country. 
   This does not have to be a pro-choice or pro-life debate. In fact, it is short-sighted for us to think of it that way. This debate should be about prevention. It should be about providing necessary tools for proper prevention including providing contraception, ensuring access to condoms and providing educational information to those in need. 
   We have the ability to reduce the number of cases of HIV/AIDS around the world by allowing for greater flexibility in how we implement prevention funding. Instead of taking an approach where we require that one-third of all HIV/AIDS prevention funds be spent on abstinence only programs, that are not only ineffective in preventing sexual activity, but in fact harmful to the health and well being of young women, we should be allowing for greater flexibility in how we allocate these essential funds. 
   The statistics on the number of cases of HIV around the world are startling. In 2006, there were 4.2 million new HIV infections. According to UNAIDS, women and girls make up half of all HIV infections worldwide. And according to the World Health Organization, unprotected heterosexual sex is the leading cause of HIV infections around the world and 80 percent of new infections in sub-Saharan Africa. 
   Clearly, calls for abstinence alone are not working. We must admit to ourselves that young people, whether by choice or through coercion, are engaging in sexual activity. We have the tools to prevent less unintended pregnancies. We need to use them efficiently and effectively. 
   In order for any HIV/AIDS prevention program to be successful, we must make sure that we use proper prevention tools like condoms and contraception. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Pitts amendment. 
   Further, I rise today in strong opposition to the amendment offered by my colleague from New Jersey, Mr. SMITH and my colleague from Michigan, Mr. STUPAK. 
   Access to contraceptives and condoms is essential to stop the number of cases of HIV/AIDS around the world. With good reasons, the Subcommittee under the leadership of Ms. LOWEY from New York has included a provision that will allow foreign organizations that are currently prohibited from received family planning assistance under the global gag rule to receive in kind contributions of condoms and contraceptives. 
   I believe that the global ``gag rule'' is onerous and should be lifted because it not only bans foreign non-governmental organizations, NGOs, from using their own funds to engage in free speech and assembly activities on a woman's right to choose, but it also prevents health care providers from counseling the world's poorest women about all their legal health care options. 
   But the provisions in this bill do not lift the global gag rule. What these provisions do is promote proper family planning information and services. As a basic prevention form of healthcare, family planning services can improve maternal and child health in developing countries, lead to better diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, and reduce the incidence of unintended pregnancy and abortion. The global gag rule has stopped U.S.-donated contraceptives from reaching 16 countries with people in desperate need in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Simply allowing access to contraceptives is a small and necessary step in prevention. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose the Smith amendment.
