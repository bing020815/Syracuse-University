<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 5501, TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde U.S. Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Reauthorization Act. 
   Five years ago, Congress passed the first U.S. Leadership Act aimed at combating HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria worldwide. Since that time, U.S. assistance has enabled 33 million HIV counseling and testing sessions, provided antiretroviral treatment to 1.45 million people, and prevented 157,000 infants from contracting HIV through mother-to-child infection. In addition to combating HIV/AIDS, the U.S. Leadership Act has contributed to the treatment of millions of people with TB, and to the distribution of millions of bed nets to prevent the spread of malaria. 
   But there is so much more work to be done. There are currently about 39 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS, more than the population of California. Each year, 2 million people die from tuberculosis. Every 30 seconds, a child dies from malaria, a fully preventable disease. 
   From both a moral and self-interested perspective, we simply cannot afford to let the epidemics of HIV, TB, and malaria grow. Our long-term prosperity and security are inextricably linked to our commitment to help build stronger economies and reduce poverty around the world. Promoting public health is a critical component of this effort. Disease cripples not only individuals, but economies as well, preventing parents from supporting their families, and leaving children orphaned with no financial security, limited opportunities for education, and narrow prospects for future contributions. 
   We must also recognize that in a global society, we ourselves are not immune to these diseases. Malaria was rampant in parts of the United States as little as 60 years ago. The World Health Organization estimates that worldwide, more than one third of the world's population is infected with the tuberculosis bacteria. Poorly supervised or incomplete treatment of tuberculosis can be more harmful than no treatment at all, allowing the bacteria to develop resistance to drugs and increasing the hazards of contracting the bacteria for the whole planet. In an ever more integrated world, we cannot wall ourselves off from the reach of these diseases. 
   This bill reflects our commitment to contribute to the treatment, prevention, and ultimate elimination of these diseases worldwide. It ensures a balanced approach to the prevention of HIV/AIDS that includes abstinence, faithfulness, and condom promotion as the three-tiered strategy to prevent HIV infection. The bill also includes key provisions that recognize the inherent link between disease treatment and support of basic needs, such as food, shelter, and economic opportunity. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (CONSUMER ENERGY SUPPLY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, all of us are aware of the soaring cost of gasoline and the impact it is having on the people we represent. Our constituents want to know what we're doing to provide relief at the pump. 
   Over the initial opposition of the White House, the Congress has already passed legislation to suspend further oil purchases for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve this year, freeing up 70,000 gallons of oil a day for use by consumers. Further action is needed to help the economy and help consumers. 
   The bill before the House today takes the next step. It requires the Energy Department to release 70 million barrels of light, sweet crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in exchange for the same amount of heavier grade crude oil. Light, sweet crude oil contains less sulfur and is the easiest oil to refine into gasoline. Under this legislation, the Secretary of Energy would be directed to deploy 70 million barrels of light crude oil over the next six months. Passage of this bill would also be a shot across the bow of the speculators who have been driving up the cost of oil. More than any other action the Federal Government could take, this proposal has the greatest potential to reduce gasoline prices in the near term. 
   I know that some of my colleagues will object to the use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for this purpose. They will protest that the Reserve is for use in emergencies. Like a broken record, they will repeat their call to open up the entire Outer Continental Shelf to oil drilling. I do not agree. Rising oil and gasoline prices are causing serious damage to our Nation's economy. We have before us the means to mitigate some of that damage and do so immediately. 
   Vast areas of the Outer Continental Shelf are already open to drilling. Less than 2 years ago, and with my support, Congress voted to open up an additional 8.3 million acres for offshore exploration and drilling. All told, the oil companies are using only 10.5 million of the 44 million offshore acres that have already been leased to them. In any case, according to the Bush Administration's own Energy Information Administration, even if we repealed the offshore ban today, oil and gas production would not begin there until 2017 at the earliest; further, lifting the remaining offshore drilling restrictions and I quote from the EIA analysis ``would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030.'' 
   We cannot wait until 2030. The need for relief at the pump is immediate. I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting the legislation before the House.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Thank you, Mr. Rangel, for your kind words, and congratulations to the bipartisan leadership that has worked this out. 
   Yesterday in this very place, the President said: ``Our economy is undergoing a period of uncertainty.'' For millions of people in this country, our economic difficulties are very, very certain indeed, and that is true of the over 7 million who are unemployed. 
   Economists agree that unemployment insurance is one of the most stimulative approaches that can be undertaken. Unemployment is rising significantly. In December, the total number of unemployed was 900,000 higher than the same month in the prior year, and long-term unemployment is now twice as high as it was in the last recession. Almost a fifth of those who are unemployed have been unemployed over 26 weeks, and in Michigan, 72,000 people will exhaust their jobless benefits in the first half of this year. 
   In the past, the extensions of unemployment compensation have come too late. The time for action on extension is here and now.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1108, the Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. I urge the House to vote in favor of this legislation, which takes critical steps to protect the public, especially minors, from the dangers of tobacco use. 
   According to the American Heart Association, cigarette use is the number one preventable cause of poor health and premature death worldwide. It is estimated that smoking causes one in five deaths in the United States, or approximately 400,000 premature deaths per year. 
   Despite laws in every state prohibiting the sale of cigarettes to minors, the U.S. Surgeon General estimates that young people ages 12 to 17 continue to purchase and smoke millions of packs of cigarettes each year. H.R. 1108 contains a number of strong provisions to protect young people from tobacco advertising and access to tobacco products. The bill requires the Food and Drug Administration to ban outdoor tobacco advertising within 1,000 feet of schools and playgrounds, restrict tobacco vending machines to adult-only facilities, require retailers to verify age for all over-the-counter tobacco sales, and mandate Federal enforcement and penalties for those who sell tobacco products to minors. 
   The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act also includes provisions to ensure that tobacco advertising is not misleading to consumers. In the past, tobacco companies have been allowed to use such terms as ``light,'' ``mild,'' and ``low'' without proving that products labeled with these words were less dangerous to health than generic equivalents. This bill requires tobacco manufacturers to prove that products actually impart reduced risk or reduced exposure to users before employing terms that imply these safeguards. 
   In addition, H.R. 1108 contains vital provisions that aim to reduce the harmful health effects of tobacco products for adults who do decide to use them. The bill allows the Food and Drug Administration to regulate the contents of cigarettes and other tobacco products. This authority is of paramount importance. Over 4,000 chemicals, including 60 carcinogens, have been identified in tobacco smoke. It is unlikely that tobacco will ever be an inherently safe product. But allowing the Food and Drug Administration to regulate the chemical additives to cigarettes and smokeless tobacco will help to reduce the health dangers of these products to the extent possible. 
   Passage of H.R. 1108 is an essential step forward in promoting the health of all Americans. Let's pass this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I support the rule and urge the House to adopt the Energy Independence and Security Act. 
   The basic issue before us is whether we are going to take action to address energy security in this country, or are we going to sit on the sidelines and let American consumers and businesses fend for themselves. All of us know that we can't continue business as usual. The price of oil stands near $90 a barrel. In my home State of Michigan, gas costs over $3 a gallon. Families are struggling with persistently high home heating costs. At the same time, the effects of climate change are becoming more and more pronounced, yet the United States remains the only industrialized nation in the world that has no plan to address global warming. 
   The package before the House strengthens our energy security, lowers energy costs, grows our economy, creates jobs, and begins to address global warming. It also bolsters our national security. Today we import more than 60 percent of the oil we use. It is simply not in our long-term security interests to continue to rely on oil imports from the Middle East and other volatile regions of the world. We can't drill our way out way out of this situation, so we need to try another approach. 
   Many of the provisions of this legislation are common sense and will achieve significant energy savings with little or no cost. For example, the bill sets new energy efficiency standards for appliances, lighting, and buildings. Doing so will save consumers and businesses hundreds of billions of dollars over time. This legislation also includes incentives for manufacturers to produce washing machines, refrigerators and dishwashers that push the boundaries of energy and water efficiency, and to build them in the United States. Reducing the energy or water usage of a washing machine may seem like a small thing, but over time and across millions of households, these incentives will produce remarkable reductions in energy and water usage, and consumers will save money on their utility bills. 
   Other sections of this bill will challenge key sectors of our economy. In particular, the legislation calls for a 40 percent increase in vehicle fuel economy by 2020. The compromise that has been reached is ambitious, but it has the support of auto manufacturers, the United Auto Workers, 
   consumers groups, and the environmental community. We also reform the existing CAFE mechanism, which for years has discriminated against manufactures, including Ford, GM and Chrysler, that produce a full line of vehicle sizes. The agreement contains anti-backsliding language to help keep small car production here in the United States and protect the jobs of American workers. I am pleased that this bill also begins the work of helping industry reach the higher mileage standards through retooling assistance and incentives such as a new plug-in hybrid tax credit. 
   I also strongly support the renewable electricity portfolio provisions of this bill that require utilities to generate 15 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2020. Obviously, this provision will pay environmental dividends. Moving towards renewable energy will help keep mercury out of the Great Lakes and greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere, but it also will help create new industries and jobs here in the United States. There is no reason in the world why the U.S.  should not lead the world in the production of wind turbines and solar panels. This bill will help ensure that these jobs are created here in the United States. 
   Our work in this House is about priorities, and the difference in priorities on this bill could not be more clear. I urge all of my colleagues to support this responsible legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act. 
   Despite the rosy economic forecast provided by the administration, a broad array of indicators shows otherwise--namely that despite record levels of corporate prosperity, the economic pressures exerted on our middle class continue to build. 
   Middle class families have and continue to lose ground, faced with stagnant incomes and rising costs of essential services like health care, gasoline and a college education. 
   One of the most important things we can do to relieve this middle class squeeze is to restore workers' freedom to join together to bargain for better wages, benefits and working conditions. Indeed, on average, union workers earn 30 percent more on average than nonunion workers and are much more likely to have health care and receive pension benefits. 
   Yet the current system governing the formation of unions is badly flawed, and permits an unfair process greatly tipped in favor of employer efforts to block unionization drives. At present, organizers can present cards signed by a majority of the workforce in support of union representation, but the employer has absolutely no obligation to recognize this effort. Instead, employers can force a National Labor Relations Board election, which can take months to take place, during which time employers are free to erode union support using company resources through mandated anti-union activities at the workplace. Any pro-union activities are explicitly prohibited at the workplace. 
   H.R. 800 levels the playing field by requiring employers to recognize the card-checking procedure, ensuring a fair and equitable process that balances the rights of employers with the rights of workers to form a union. 
   This bill also provides negotiation benchmarks to ensure that initial collective bargaining agreements are negotiated in earnest. These provisions address problems with the current system which relies entirely on both parties engaging in a ``good faith'' effort to reach an agreement. In reality, this system permits employers to indefinitely delay negotiations during which time they can rekindle efforts to disband the newly elected union representatives. 
   Lastly, the bill includes tougher penalties for violations of workers' rights. Currently, about one in five pro-union employee activists are illegally fired for their union activities, in large part because the remedies for these employer violations are so weak. By strengthening these penalties, we are further ensuring that employers follow the rule of law. 
   The middle class is the backbone of our society. And the middle class is stronger when workers can join together to bargain for a higher standard of living. Years ago, it was unions that helped pave the way towards employer sponsored health care and pensions benefits. Now more than ever, it is vital that we address the current inequities faced by those who are fighting for workers' rights to bargain collectively. In doing so, we foster a stronger middle class and a more prosperous nation. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 800.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. I think the more we discuss this, the clearer the issue becomes, including the last statement that we heard. There's no disagreement about the need for growth policies. But to say that, and use it as an excuse not to provide extended unemployment benefits is really indefensible. 
   You can't say to people who have been out of work for 26 weeks, who are there through no fault of their own, and who must be looking for work, that because of the absence of growth policies they should, essentially, be out in the cold. That's close to a cold-blooded approach to this issue. 
   And, if you mention States like Iowa, look, in some States, if there's a surplus, people who are out of work, in most cases, if they're looking for work, and they must, will find other work. 
   But it makes no sense to take the position of the administration, and that's what the gentleman from California, essentially, was reflecting, where they say that historically, the unemployment rate has had to be at a certain level in order for Unemployment Compensation to be extended. 
   And there was, they say, an exception after September 11, 2001. It's really hard to fathom who people would use 2001, September 11, as an excuse not to extend benefits. 
   The unemployment rate when President Bush signed the extension was 5.7. It's now 5.5. And essentially, what you're saying is we're going to deny benefits to well over a million, with 3 million more likely to come, because of a difference of \2/10\ of 1 percent. 
   And then you say you want it to be targeted. But, as we pointed out, the data vary from month to month. One month it's 100 metropolitan areas with unemployment rates over 6 percent. More recently, it's been 65 or 66. It will probably go up. How do you, in good conscience, stand before people in those areas and say no?

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the State Children's Health Insurance Reauthorization Act of 2007. This legislation renews and strengthens a program that provides health insurance to children whose families cannot afford it on the private market. 
   The legislation we are voting on today will extend children's health insurance to enroll almost 4 million kids that are currently eligible for the program and not yet enrolled. That's in addition to the 6 million low-income children already receiving health care under the SCHIP program nationwide, including 55,000 kids in my home state of Michigan. 
   I regret that many of the provisions the House included this summer did not make it into the compromise bill. I'm hopeful that we will work with the Senate to approve legislation before the year's end in order to ensure Medicare beneficiary access to physicians and stop the further erosion of Medicare solvency. Nonetheless, I support this legislation and urge my colleagues to vote in support of the compromise bill. 
   Providing health care for children should not be a partisan issue. The legislation has the support of a large majority of state governors, Republicans and Democrats alike. The bill has broad bipartisan support in the Senate; unfortunately, most of the Republican minority in the House has failed to join us in crafting this compromise and the President has threatened to veto this important legislation. So it comes down to this: Clearly, a majority of the House will vote for the SCHIP bill today; the only real question is whether the House will pass this bill with enough votes to discourage a Presidential veto. Do we stand with the President or with kids who need health care coverage? 
   Instead of working with Congress to expand health care coverage for children, the President's proposal would actually cause 840,000 kids that are currently covered under SCHIP to lose their benefits, not to mention leave hanging the 4 million children that Congress' bill would bring into the program. 
   The American people want the children of America covered by health insurance. A bipartisan majority of House and Senate Members are committed to carrying this out. The question remains as to whether or not the Bush Administration will get on board.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (EXTENDING TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I now yield myself such time as I may consume.  
   Today we are considering an extension of a critical component of our trade agenda, an extension of the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. All three programs that make up TAA, Adjustment Assistance for Workers, Adjustment Assistance for Firms, and Adjustment Assistance for Farmers, expire on September 30. 
   Trade Adjustment Assistance helps to make sure that workers impacted by increased trade get the help and retraining they need and deserve so that they can go out and get new, good-paying, family-wage jobs. 
   It's not a perfect program. In fact, it needs work. The committee will be taking up legislation reforming and reauthorizing Trade Adjustment Assistance shortly. 
   Critically, this program will improve the effectiveness of the program by, among other things, offering TAA access to service workers, increasing funding to satisfy unmet demand, getting rid of complicated and burdensome rules that make it hard for people to take advantage of Trade Adjustment Assistance. 
   I think all of us can expect a discussion draft of the bill reforming and reauthorizing TAA to be circulated in the next week. The committee should take up the bill sometime after that; and if all goes as planned, the program will be authorized before the end of the year. 
   We will hammer out the details of TAA overhaul; and while we do that, we need to pass this short-term, 3-month extension. 
   The bill under consideration today was originally introduced by Mr. Herger. His support for the extension reflects the bipartisan support for Trade Adjustment Assistance that's really necessary, and I hope for in the future. It is also a recognition of the fact that the program has an important element of America's overall trade agenda. 
   I also want to thank, in addition to Mr. Herger and those of you on the Republican side, I want to thank Mr. ADAM SMITH for his work on Trade Adjustment Assistance.     
   We all have been focusing on this issue for many years, and now there is the opportunity to act within this House. 
   I also want to thank Mr. McDermott, another subcommittee Chair for his help.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   We clearly need to reform and reauthorize TAA. We also need to be sure that we reform trade policy. One is not a substitute for the other. We need to do both. 
   In the continuing resolution that was passed last February, Congress included language prohibiting the United States Department of Labor from issuing final regulations concerning the TAA program. Critically and problematically, these regulations would contravene Congress's legislative intent in the important policy areas and cause confusion among State and local operators of the TAA program. In short, these regulations would change the very nature of this program, a program specifically committed to ensuring that workers adversely affected by trade get the assistance and training they need to obtain new, good-paying, family-wage jobs, as I said before. 
   For example, these rules would, number one, compel States to implement a ``rapid reemployment'' strategy; two, permit States to establish monetary caps on training for dislocated workers; three, compel States to integrate the TAA program into the Workforce Investment Act system; four, permit the privatization of the administration of programs; and, five, abolish merit staff standards. 
   These rules are extremely troubling. They undermine the program and, more generally, the intent of Congress. 
   Fortunately, my colleagues on the majority side felt the same way about the Department of Labor proposal. Recognizing the serious implications of these flawed rules, Chairman Obey included the following language in the February continuing resolution: 
   ``None of the funds made available in this division or any other act shall be available to finalize or implement any proposed regulation under the Workforce Investment 12 Act of 1998, Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933, or the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act of 2002 until such time as legislation reauthorizing the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 and the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act of 2002 is enacted.'' 
   And I quote that because it is so important. 
   Mr. Speaker, I now would like to yield such time as he may consume to my colleague from Washington, Adam Smith, who has been working so hard on this issue.

   Mr. LEVIN. That is absolutely correct. As Chairman Rangel has stated and I have stated at the markup last week, this is an extension of existing law. It is not a reauthorization. As Ranking Member McCrery stated at the markup and as Mr. Herger explained in the remarks he submitted for the Record, this piece of legislation is a simple extension of existing law, nothing more, nothing less. So the prohibition on the implementation of the rules remains fully in effect.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   I will close, first of all, if I might, commenting on TAA to the gentleman from Texas and to Mr. McCrery and Mr. Herger, who could not be here, we have a lot of work to do on TAA. We are working on legislation that would reform it as well as reauthorize it, that would expand its scope. To exclude service workers, for example, is no longer acceptable, if it ever was. 
   We also need to be sure that we remove the obstacles to those who have been eligible on paper for TAA but, because of the obstacles and the complexities within the law, have really not been able to access it. 
   We also need to look at the health benefit because today only about 10 percent of the people who are eligible for TAA ever are able to access the health benefit. 
   So as mentioned by my friend from Washington and as I said earlier, as Mr. Rangel has also said publicly, we are working on legislation. We hope to have a draft ready next week, but we want to disseminate it and discuss it within the majority ranks, also to discuss it with the minority, in the hope that perhaps we can obtain strong bipartisan support.     
   I don't think it's preordained on trade issues; I guess nothing is preordained. But there will be those discussions. But I want to serve notice that we really need to and intend to proceed, that this extension is not an excuse for the lack of basic action. 
   And, secondly, I want the record to be entirely clear that TAA reform is critical, but it is no substitute for reform of our trade policy. We need to have programs that help those who are disadvantaged by trade, and for other reasons, to be able to have the opportunity, they have the desire, but also the opportunity to do some retraining, to obtain more education to extend their skills so that they can get back on their feet with a living wage. 
   We also need to pass reform of trade policy that prevents dislocation in the first place, wherever possible. And to have the notion that simply ``catch those people who fall off because of dislocation'' isn't enough. We have to address the basic issues in trade policy. We began to do that in the Ways and Means Committee today in terms of a Peru FTA that I think are the first steps toward a new trade policy for America. I hope that we can do both and, if at all possible, on a bipartisan basis, but we need to do both.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. It's estimated that 4 million workers, 4 million, would be eligible under this unemployment extension, over 1 million who have already exhausted and 3 million in the future. 
   You know, in previous downturns when there were unemployment offices giving out checks, we could go there and we could talk to the people. That's no longer true in most States, but we should not let the absence of real faces blur our vision in Washington. 
   If you had the 4 million people line up, it would extend from Washington, D.C., to Denver, Colorado, and we should not differentiate as to what State they live in. If they've exhausted their benefits, they should be eligible. 
   Mr. Weller says targeted, that's over 6 percent. It leaves out a majority of those who have exhausted their benefits. It's not targeted. It's ruthless. It's ruthless. It doesn't take into account the lives of people. 
   We saw the biggest increase in 20 years last night, from 5 to 5.5 percent. When President Bush signed the extension in 2002, it was 5.7. So you're going to stand up here now and quibble because of a difference of two-tenths of 1 percent, you don't want to extend benefits. 
   The 20-week thing is a Trojan horse. It's another excuse not to step up to the plate. 
   This is not a political issue. This is a people's issue. The exhaustion rate is the highest it's been at the beginning of the past five recessions. I urge on a bipartisan basis the passage of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Amendment 3 concerns unemployment compensation. It's estimated that in the first 6 months of this year, 1.3 million Americans will exhaust their benefits. The number of long-term unemployed Americans is almost twice as high now as it was in the last recession. 
   This is targeted at the long-term unemployed wherever they live. The Republican approach, Mr. Weller's approach, the President's opposition, it's not targeted. It misses tens of thousands of people who are unemployed for more than the 26 weeks. I come from Michigan with a high unemployment level. I want all the unemployed long-term to be covered wherever they live. 
   I think it's time that the minority and the President get out of the offices they reside in and get into the shoes of typical American families. 
   I read a letter that came from a person in Roseville whose husband had lost his job as a machinist: 
   ``With the job market as bleak as it is today, the fear that unemployment benefits may run out is something no family should have to face. My husband has been actively seeking work since his layoff, but there's simply nothing to be had right now. I've never seen him look so sad and upset in all our nearly 30 years of marriage. The President and Congress must be made to understand that what is happening to the workers of this country, and most especially, to the people of Michigan is not something they've chosen for themselves.'' 
   Opposition to extension of unemployment compensation is unconscionable. I urge support for amendment 3.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007. We can never guarantee the results of scientific research, but without it we can guarantee that there will be no results. 
   From juvenile diabetes, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease to Multiple Sclerosis and cancer, stem cell research has the potential to begin to uncover cures for the diseases that affect our constituents and our families. In the debate over fixing our broken health care system in America, we cannot afford to ignore the medical breakthroughs in disease management that stem cell research has the potential to uncover. 
   Some opponents of this legislation argue that the federal government already significantly funds stem cell research or that private entities will step in to take up the slack. The reality is that stem cell research is practically at a standstill in this country today. Of the 78 stem cell lines currently permitted under federally funded research, 57 are contaminated and are thus incapable of producing such breakthroughs. Research has been stifled under the Administration's stem cell policy. 
   This morning's news highlights a recent scientific paper written by scientists that have manipulated an ordinary mouse skin cell into what may be effectively an embryonic stem cell. More research must be done to see if scientists can coax human skin cells to have the same qualities as embryonic stem cells; however, as advocate Sean Tipton told the Washington Post this morning, ``You cannot make good policy one scientific paper at a time.'' The bill before us today encourages further research on isolating and testing non-embryonic cells and at the same time lifts the ban on federal support of embryonic stem cell research. 
   The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act is a well-crafted, bipartisan approach. The bill only allows the use of stem cell lines generated from embryos that would otherwise be discarded by fertility clinics. The legislation contains strict ethical guidelines, including the requirement that embryos can be used only if the donor give their written consent and receive no money or other inducement in exchange. 
   The President vetoed very similar legislation last year, and there is little doubt that he will veto it again. The medical research that embryonic stem cell lines offer is crucial for millions of people dealing with incurable and debilitating diseases. It is an insufficient response for Congress to simply accept the Bush Administration's intransigence on this issue. The legislation before us is a bipartisan bill that strong majorities of the House and Senate support. Further, it is clear that a broad majority of Americans support responsible embryonic stem cell research. The real question today is whether enough Members of the House now recognize that the current stem cell policy is not working and are willing to vote for a better way forward. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this vital legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1281, the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important bill. 
   We have come a long way since the Jim Crow era of voter disenfranchisement and intimidation, but we still have a long way yet to go to ensure an equal right to vote for all citizens. Every election, we hear shocking and disgraceful stories of voters being lied to about their voter registration or citizenship status, polling place information, or even the date of the election, in order to suppress the vote in certain areas. The targets of these tactics seem to always be the same: racial minorities, immigrants and poor communities. 
   Thomas Paine once said, ``Voting is the right upon which all other rights depend.'' Throughout our nation's history, Congress has acted to ensure that right, granting African Americans and women the right to vote, prohibiting states from requiring the payment of poll taxes to vote, and the passage and reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Today, we continue in that grand tradition with passage of this important legislation to make it unlawful to knowingly communicate false information with the intent to prevent another person from casting a ballot. 
   The right to vote may be the most basic right we have as Americans, but we must remain vigilant in protecting this right in order to ensure that it is not weakened or undermined by those who seek political gain at the expense of this basic tenet of democracy. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1281.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the legislation before the House, the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Health and Iraq Accountability Act. This measure supports our troops in the field. It provides more resources to ensure that our wounded service members and veterans receive the health care and support they need. And it sets a responsible timeline for the phased redeployment of our troops. 
   Our Nation continues to pay a high price for the administration's reckless invasion of Iraq and the President's open-ended commitment of U.S. military forces in that country. Our troops are entering their fifth year in Iraq, and there is no end in sight. The situation is deteriorating. Iraq is descending into a civil war.  For the last 4 years, the former Republican majority in the Congress sat on its hands and followed the President's policy like robots. The American people elected a new majority in the House and Senate so that Congress would stand up and stop being a rubber stamp for the President. 
   The President's open-ended policies of committing U.S. troops in Iraq for as long as it takes is not working. We need a new way forward. The only chance to salvage the situation in Iraq is to put real pressure on the Iraqis to take responsibility for their own future. 
   Last January 10, President Bush addressed the Nation and admitted that the situation in Iraq was descending into a vicious cycle of sectarian violence. He laid out a series of actions that the Iraqi Government would have to take; benchmarks that the Iraqis would have to follow through on or lose the support of the American people. The President said that Iraq would approve legislation to share oil revenue among the Iraq people; that Iraq would spend $10 billion of its own money on reconstruction and infrastructure projects; that Iraq would reform the laws governing de-Baathification and allow more Iraqis to re-enter their nation's political life; that Iraq would establish a fair process for considering amendments to Iraq's constitution; and that Iraq would set a schedule to conduct provincial and local elections. The President said, ``America will hold the Iraqi Government to the benchmarks it has announced.'' 
   Since President Bush made that speech two months ago, 217 American soldiers have been killed in Iraq. More than 3,200 American soldiers have died since the war began. More than 23,000 have been wounded. Until the Iraqis step up to the plate and make the difficult political decisions that need to be made, the sectarian violence will continue and American military men and women will continue to be killed and wounded. Either the factions in Iraq are going to come together and make these decisions, or they are not. We should not leave our troops in harm's way indefinitely and just hand the President another blank check to continue an open-ended policy with no end in sight. 
   The legislation before the House supports the troops, both in Iraq and Afghanistan. It holds the Iraqi Government to the benchmarks for progress that the President outlined in his January 10 speech. Under this bill, if the President cannot certify that Iraq has achieved these benchmarks by October 1 of this year, a redeployment of U.S. troops begins immediately and must be completed within 180 days. Absent this pressure, the Iraqi Government will continue to postpone action on achieving the benchmarks. If the Iraqi Government does, indeed, meet the benchmarks by October 1, redeployment of U.S. forces would begin next March and be completed within 180 days. 
   After more than 4 years, this legislation would end the open-ended commitment to this war. It would set a clear timeline for the phased redeployment of U.S. troops. Without this pressure, there is little chance that the Iraqi leaders will make the decisions necessary to end civil war and build one nation. Our country cannot make these decisions for them. I urge passage of this legislation by the House.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (WATER QUALITY FINANCING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Madam Chairwoman, two points. The revolving fund has meant so much to the district I represent. The 12-town drain system before was an open sewer, and with the revolving fund help, we were able to address and attack the problem. 
   My second point is this: It is interesting that those who come here complaining about the Davis-Bacon provision have been in a party that has sat on its hands on this issue year after year and have come from a party whose President has suggested cutting the revolving fund by $396 million. 
   You should have acted long ago to make the revolving fund more meaningful, and so don't use the prevailing wage issue as a reason to oppose this when you have failed to step up to the plate. We are stepping up to the plate here. More money and under circumstances that provide people a chance to have a decent way of life. I urge support of this bill.  
   I rise in strong support of the Water Quality Financing Act. The bill before the House calls for a significant and needed increase in the annual Federal contribution to the Clean Water State Revolving Fund program. This may not be a well known program, but it has been absolutely critical to water quality improvements in my district, and in many other communities around the country. 
   The Clean Water Revolving Fund is the only major Federal program that helps localities build, repair, and improve their sewer infrastructure. Over the years, the Revolving Fund has provided more than a billion dollars to my home State of Michigan for low-interest loans for water infrastructure projects. 
   A billion dollars sounds like a lot of money, but it is literally just a drop in the bucket compared to the need. In southeast Michigan alone, maintaining and improving our aging sewer systems will cost between $14 and $26 billion over the next 30 years. 
   Let me tell you what the Clean Water Revolving Fund has meant to my district. In the early 1990s, the Clinton River that runs through my district in Oakland and Macomb Counties was little more than an open sewer. In particular, there was one, large combined sewer system called 12 Towns that spilled hundreds of millions of gallons of partially treated sewage into the Clinton River each year. This contributed to a nearly dead river and closed beaches downstream in Lake St. Clair. It was a major concern to both Oakland and Macomb counties. 
   In the late 1990s, the communities undertook an expensive renovation project at 12 Towns that has greatly reduced the sewer overflows. The communities bore the full expense for this project, which cost well over $100 million, but the low interest rates provided by the Revolving Fund saved the communities tens of millions of dollars in interest costs. The result is that the Clinton River is making a comeback. Water quality is improving. 
   Twelve Towns is not an isolated example. The Revolving Fund has also helped many other communities in my district with critical water quality improvements. We could not have accomplished the progress that has been made to clean up the Clinton River and Lake St. Clair without the Revolving Fund's help. 
   The Federal Government has to do more--not less--to help communities shoulder the burden of addressing critical water infrastructure needs. We should have increased the funding for the Revolving Fund long before this; instead, in recent years the Bush Administration and Congress has cut the program again and again. Just last month, the President's budget proposed a $396 million cut to the Revolving Fund. This takes the effort to clean up the Great Lakes in exactly the wrong direction. 
   I urge all my colleagues to join me in voting for this important legislation. We should vote for the bill today and--just as importantly--provide the funding for the Clean Water Revolving Fund when we take up the EPA appropriations bill later this year.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the legislation before the House, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007. 
   It's time for Congress to face the facts and begin to break our nation's dangerous addiction to oil. The industry tax breaks and royalty holidays that we seek to eliminate today no doubt serve the interests of the big oil companies, but they do not serve the interests of our nation's long-term energy security, or, for that matter, the interests of taxpayers, consumers and the environment. 
   We import more than 60 percent of the oil we consume every day in this country. We are increasingly dependent on oil imports from volatile regions of the world and from countries that are not necessarily our friends. If we do nothing, our dependence on imported oil will only grow. Some will say that the answer  is to provide more subsidies and tax breaks to encourage oil drilling in the United States. Well, we've tried that, and it hasn't worked. We're more dependent on foreign oil than ever. All the industry subsidies in the world won't change the fact that the U.S. has just 3 percent of the global oil reserves. We can't drill our way out of this problem. 
   Rather than continue business as usual, today we are beginning to chart a new course to energy security. The legislation before the House repeals $13 billion in egregious tax subsidies and royalty holidays that have been given to the oil companies in recent years. Instead, we will invest these funds in clean, renewable energy that is made here in the United States, including solar, wind, biomass, and biofuels. We will also invest in new energy technologies and develop policies to stimulate investment and deployment of energy efficient products and services. Investing in alternative fuels and new energy technologies is also an investment in jobs here in America. 
   I want to make it clear that this legislation eliminates only the most egregious energy industry subsidies. First of all, we target the flawed deepwater oil and gas leases that were awarded in 1998 and 1999. Contrary to longstanding practice, these leases did not provide for royalty 
   payments--no matter how high oil prices rise. In this legislation, we require that these leases be renegotiated. The American people deserve a fair royalty for publicly-owned resources. 
   I also want to respond to some of the statements made today by opponents of this legislation. Some have suggested that our legislation unfairly singles out the oil and gas industry by repealing their ability to take advantage of a tax provision intended to encourage domestic manufacturing. This is not the case. Many of my colleagues will recall that several years ago our trading partners in the European Union successfully challenged a tax benefit that the Federal Government provided to U.S. exporters. Let's be clear that the oil and gas industry did not qualify for the old FSC-ETI tax benefit, and neither did any number of other U.S. industries, including financial services, hospitals, and real estate, to name only a few. When Congress repealed the FSC-ETI in 2004, we provided a replacement benefit to U.S. exporters in the form of tax benefit for domestic manufacturers. But for some reason, this manufacturing tax break was extended to include the oil and gas industry, even though they were never eligible for the old FSC-ETI benefit. If there is a problem with unfairly singling out an industry, it is not in the bill before the House today. The problem lies in the loophole in the 2004 bill that singled out the oil and gas industry to receive a domestic manufacturing benefit that was not justified. 
   I hope this clears up this matter and that all my colleagues will join me in voting for this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. TAA will run out very soon, and it's essential that that not happen. This is a vital program for workers in this country, for the firms for which they work, for farmers, and for their entire communities. 
   We've been trying to not only extend TAA, but we've been trying to reform it and to improve it. We have passed legislation in this House, legislation that, indeed, reformed and enhanced and expanded TAA, and it passed this House with some considerable bipartisan support. It addressed issues like this: 
   Expands TAA to service workers; 
   Improves funding, because a number of States have essentially run out of funds; 
   Streamlines the process for application for TAA because an unfriendly regimen of rules has too often made it difficult for people to access it; 
   Modernizes the unemployment system, which badly needs it; 
   Provides assistance to manufacturing communities hard hit by trade. 
   Unfortunately, though this bill passed comfortably in this House and was an important landmark supported by our Speaker, by the majority leader, by Chairman Rangel, by others, many of us on the Ways and Means Committee and, as I said, with some considerable bipartisan support, but unfortunately, the bill has essentially not moved in the other body. And it has been blocked, I think, by a position in the other body that it should be linked to something else. 
   Also, the administration essentially has opposed this legislation. And it was really rather startling that that occurred. After all, earlier this fall the President said this about TAA: ``I understand that if you're forced to change a job halfway through a career it can be painful for your family. I know that. And that is why I'm a big believer in trade adjustment assistance that helps Americans make the transition from one job to the next.'' 
   Unfortunately, it was only a few weeks after that that we received, on the eve of the markup of the bill in the Ways and Means Committee, a letter from the Secretary of Labor opposing the bill that was before the committee. And in the letter the Secretary said, ``negative impacts with trade that are borne by the few,'' that this does not warrant the changes we make in the legislation. Unfortunate language, indeed, because there has been an impact of trade very substantially across the board, not only in the manufacturing industries, but in the service industries and beyond, and that that impact has been borne by many, many more than a few. 
   So, what has happened is that we passed this legislation with some bipartisan support, legislation that, as I say, expanded and reformed TAA and also addressed overdue issues of unemployment counts. We're just stuck because of the opposition of the administration, and also because of inaction in the Senate. 
   So, here's what this legislation does: 
   It extends TAA for 3 months. Why 3 months? Three months because it's the intention the majority, after we return after the holidays, if we adjourn for the holidays, and I assume we will, to get moving quickly to take up this vital reform of TAA within the first few months, to make it a high priority in this House, and we hope in the entire Congress, and we hope in the White House.     
   So I come today on behalf of many of us viewing the importance of this legislation and asking that this House vote for a 3-month extension until March 31, 2008. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, this is not the time to have any lengthy debate about trade nor, I think, about TAA. But before I yield back my time, since this is going to be a 3-month extension, and that means there needs to be quick action and we intend to undertake it as soon as we come back, I do want to emphasize a few points. Number one, the bill that passed here addressed the issue of service workers. Essentially, what Mr. Herger has referred to in his bill left the status quo and left out virtually all service workers, and that is simply inadequate and inappropriate. 
   It also did not touch the issue of funding. It did not streamline the processes so many people today in the manufacturing field for example when they lose their job because of trade simply can't work their way through all of the red tape. Also it doesn't address the issues within the unemployment compensation system and also doesn't refer to the needs of communities especially hard hit in manufacturing areas. 
   So we should pass this bill with notice that we here on the majority side intend to move quickly next year. I hope there can be a lot of bipartisan discussion. We need to do it quickly. 
   Let me say one last thing about the gentleman from California's statement about trade bills. We need to reform trade policy. We also need to pass trade adjustment assistance, and the attempt to link the two in terms of legislation simply will not work, and I don't think should or will happen. 
   TAA can stand on its own feet. TAA is necessary for those thrown out of work through no fault of their own because of the impact of trade. And to try to use TAA as an instrumentality to push particular trade bills simply shortchanges people in this country who lose their jobs, communities that lose their base, firms that are left out because of trade. Trade is not the only cause of dislocation in this country, but it is a substantial cause that needs to be addressed by reforming trade policy, number one, and we took major steps to begin to do that this year on the majority side, and also to pass TAA. 
   So I hope Mr. Herger and the Republicans will join with us the first 3 months of next year, and let's get busy and pass TAA. I hope also that the administration will drop its resistance and also stop trying to use TAA as a bargaining tool. That is not fair to people who are hurting economically through no fault of their own.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Thank you to my friend from Ohio for yielding. 
   Bills that come up on suspension are often thought to be of less importance. That surely is not true here today. Tax equity has been a major principle in our efforts this year. And this legislation is an important aspect of that, a response to the subprime mortgage crisis. 
   The data just released by Fannie Mae show that our State of Michigan leads the Nation in losses on bad mortgages. Other rankings have Michigan at second in the Nation in delinquencies and third in foreclosure inventory. Ohio is next in some respects, but many States, really, all States show immense numbers of people who are suffering. 
   And nothing would seem more unfair than when someone loses their home to a foreclosure, if the bank sells their house for less than they owe, the IRS says ``pay taxes,'' and this remedies it. Also, as mentioned, this bill provides a 3-year extension of the deduction for mortgage insurance premiums, another vital part of this legislation. 
   By leveling the playing field among mortgage products, we will make homeownership more affordable, especially at a time when so-called ``piggy back'' loans are becoming more expensive, and in some cases difficult, to obtain at any price. 
   And I close with this remark, ``we pay for it.'' We pay for it. That's also been an important principle, tax equity, but not deepening the hole of fiscal irresponsibility. And this bill lives up to both, equity and fiscal responsibility, and we're proud to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (JOSHUA OMVIG VETERANS SUICIDE PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 327, the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important bill. 
   Estimates indicate that nearly 1,000 veterans receiving care from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) take their own lives each year. This should be a clear sign that more must be done to address the very serious and troubling issue of veterans' suicide. Many veterans continue to return from Iraq and Afghanistan with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other mental health concerns, and we must equip the VA with the information and resources they need in order to ensure that our veterans receive adequate care. 
   When this legislation was first brought to my attention earlier this year, I happened to come across an Associated Press news story about a young man from Minnesota who served as a U.S. Marine in Iraq. Upon returning home from Iraq, he experienced nightmares and paranoia, often re-living his combat experiences in his sleep. On January 11, 2007, he told staff at a VA hospital that he felt suicidal. He mentioned this again over the phone the next day to VA staff. Despite these direct pleas for help, no action was taken, and 4 days later, he killed himself in his Minnesota home. He was 25 years old. 
   H.R. 327 takes a number of important steps towards reducing the incidence of suicide among veterans. This legislation directs the Department of Veterans Affairs to develop a comprehensive program to regularly screen and monitor all veterans for risk factors of suicide, set up a tracking and counseling referral system to ensure all veterans found to be a suicide risk will receive the appropriate help, and provide education and training for all VA staff, contractors, and medical personnel who have interaction with veterans. The legislation would also provide 24-hour mental health care for veterans who are believed to be at risk for suicide, so that veterans could seek assistance whenever they need it. 
   Our Nation's veterans fight for us overseas, and deserve proper care when they return home. This includes educating VA staff, veterans and their families about PTSD and suicide prevention in order to encourage service members to seek mental health assistance when necessary. Now more than ever, as service members return home with PTSD and other mental health issues, it is essential that we provide adequate mental health care that can help prevent suicide among our Nation's veterans. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 327.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. 
   This day is long overdue. Freedom from discrimination in the workplace. A simple concept  really. One should be judged by the quality of their work, not by the color of their skin, not by their age, not by their disability, and of course, not by their sexual orientation. 
   Thirty States continue to permit employers to discriminate against employees based solely on their sexual orientation. It is vital that we adopt federal protections to end this unjust discrimination that affects millions of Americans. The bill before the House today would extend the basic protections of the Civil Rights Act by prohibiting employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. 
   For all of my life, this country has been grappling with the issue of how to extend fundamental rights to every individual in our society. We all know the profound impact of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which made it illegal to fire, refuse to hire, deny promotions or otherwise discriminate against employees based on race. While the Civil Rights Act was controversial in the years leading up to its enactment, one of our country's proudest moments was the day President Johnson signed it into law. 
   I very much regret that the Bush Administration is threatening to veto this legislation. Back in 1990, the first President Bush signed the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act, which barred workplace discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities. It is unfortunate that the current Bush Administration has chosen not to build on this progress. 
   But today is about progress. Today we stand up for gay Americans and say it is long overdue that you have the protections needed in our Nation's employment laws. Tomorrow we continue to educate and outreach around the need to also prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. As the Speaker and the majority leader made clear months ago, and Mr. Rangel and myself, what we are talking about today is about Peru, not Colombia, not Panama, not Korea. We are talking about a basic issue, and that is in terms of liberalization, do you try to shape its course or let it happen willy-nilly? 
   The crucible in terms of that issue has been core labor standards and environmental standards. That was the basis of the fight over NAFTA, over CAFTA and over the trade bill of 2001. The basic fact is that in this agreement, not in the preamble, in this agreement, ILO core labor standards are there, enforceable like everything else, and so are environmental standards. So it's a question of whether you shape trade agreements or just let it happen. And we say shape them. 
   Again, the crucible has been initially labor standards and environmental standards. So this is the antithesis of CAFTA. This is a historic breakthrough. This is the first step towards a new trade agreement. We should not turn our back on it. We should build on it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, this morning a jobs report came out. It paints a truly devastating picture for the American economy and for American families. 
   In September, we had the biggest 1-month job loss in over 5 years. Long-term unemployed rose dramatically, up 167,000, to a total of 2 million; 775,000 people will exhaust the first emergency extension this month alone, over 1 million by the end of the year, unless we act. New claims for unemployment are at a 7-year high. And I point this out finally, the statistics are startling. Let's look beyond the statistics to the people involved. In total, there are now 9.5 million people in our country looking for work, the most since 1992. 
   I simply would ask those who would vote against this, come down to the floor and explain not only to their district, but the American people, why they would not vote ``yes'' on the extension of unemployment compensation.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (SHAREHOLDER VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1257, the Shareholder vote on Executive Compensation Act. 
   Earlier this year, the Ways and Means Committee held a series of hearings on the state of the U.S. economy. We heard from experts across a variety of disciplines and a wide spectrum of political perspectives, and one of the recurring themes we heard from them was that income inequality is rising, and that this trend is eroding the public's confidence in the fundamental fairness of our society and our public policy. Recent data indicate that in 2005, the share of national income going to the top one percent of earners jumped to 19.3 percent, representing the highest degree of income concentration since 1929. 
   Rising executive compensation is, of course, just one component of this trend, but it is one of the most visible. What are middle-class families who are struggling with the rising costs of health care and higher education to think when they read about CEOs that are given tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars to leave companies whose stock price has fallen precipitously? These executives are not being rewarded for their performance, they are apparently being rewarded for squandering billions of dollars of shareholder value. 
   Mr. Chairman, corporations are creations of government, and by law, their boards have a fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders who are the owners of that corporation. A variety of scandals from Enron to options backdating have called into question the independence of boards that are often hand-picked by management, and we have taken steps both through legislation and the regulatory process to strengthen the independence of boards of directors. 
   The measure before us is a relatively modest additional step to ensure that corporations and their management operate in the interest of shareholders. All we are saying in this bill is that shareholders own these corporations, and they should have an annual, non-binding vote on the corporation's executive compensation disclosures. 
   The opposition of the minority to this is simply inconsistent. They call for an ``ownership society'' that would all too often shift ever greater risk onto individuals, and then oppose giving individual shareholders a non-binding vote on the compensation of senior executives who are the guardians of their investment. Corporations do not exist to serve the interests of management, they exist to serve the interest of their owners.  
   Mr. Chairman, it is not too much to ask that hardworking Americans who have made an investment in a company be given the opportunity of an advisory vote on the pay of managers who are essentially their employees. Again, the Shareholder Vote on Executive Compensation is a modest, common-sense reform that will strengthen corporate governance in our society, and I urge its adoption.  
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. 
   The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, was agreed to. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Under the rule, the Committee rises. 
   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. McDermott) having assumed the chair, Mr. Pomeroy, Acting Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1257) amending the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to provide shareholders with an advisory vote on executive compensation, pursuant to House Resolution 301, he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted by the Committee of the Whole.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (FEDERAL PRICE GOUGING PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, as a cosponsor of H.R. 1252, I rise in support of the Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act, and urge its passage by the House. 
   Gasoline prices are now at record highs. In my home state of Michigan, the average price of regular gas is $3.47 a gallon--a full 66 cents a gallon higher than it was at this time last year. According to the General Accounting Office, the rise in gasoline prices this year has drained consumers of an extra $20 billion. The six largest oil companies announced $30 billion in profits over the first three months of 2007 alone. This is on top of the $125 billion in profits they racked up last year. 
   The other side says that we should do nothing. They say that it's a world market for oil, and therefore something we cannot control. How then do they explain that the cost of gasoline has been rising even in the face of falling world oil prices? We must face the fact that there is something wrong in the distribution chain, especially during times of energy emergencies such as when Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast. As a first step in attacking the problem, we need to give the Federal Trade Commission the explicit authority to investigate and punish those who artificially inflate the price of gasoline. 
   The oil companies oppose this bill. The White House also has indicated that the President may veto the bill. With all due resect, we work for our constituents, not the oil companies and not the White House. I urge the House to stand with consumers and vote for this needed legislation. 
   Mr. HARE Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R 1252, the Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this important piece of legislation. 
   Oil prices are continuing to skyrocket, increasing the burden on American families, small businesses, and individuals who rely on their vehicles for their livelihood. Every day I hear from troubled constituents who are paying over $3.00 per gallon at the pump. Constituents like Richard Benefiel, a small business owner who called me yesterday out of desperation explaining he would have to shut down his shipping operation in less than 30 days unless relief was provided. On the other hand, Exxon-Mobil raked in $9.3 billion between January and March--its best first quarter in history. This is unacceptable. 
   The bill before us today is a much needed step toward addressing market manipulation by Big Oil and the egregious impact it has on the American consumer. The Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act provides the Federal Trade Commission with new authority to investigate and prosecute energy companies who engage in predatory pricing, market manipulation, and other unfair practices, with an emphasis on those who profit most, thereby providing immediate and much needed relief to consumers. 
   Yet, this is only the first step in bringing down energy costs. Last year, our Nation hit its highest dependence on foreign oil, importing 771,000 barrels daily from Saudi Arabia and other Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC. This served as a wake-up call for the United States to begin taking measures to decrease our dependence on foreign oil. I refuse to continue to allow OPEC, which accounts for 65 percent of internationally traded oil, to continue to dictate our Nation's gas prices. Antitrust laws must be put into action and greedy oil exporters need to be held accountable. 
   I am pleased that we voted yesterday to pass H.R. 2264, which authorizes the Justice Department to take legal action against OPEC state-controlled entities who conspire to limit supply or fix the price of oil. 
   I also believe that building a diverse energy portfolio which focuses on renewable, homegrown energy sources like ethanol, biodiesel, as well as wind, solar, hydro-power and clean-coal technologies is a critical step toward energy independence, which will bring down prices, and clean up our environment. 
   The Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act is a critical first step in addressing skyrocketing energy costs and I urge all my colleagues to support the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (TRADE AND GLOBALIZATION ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   I would like today to talk about the facts, and next week we will talk about the facts on trade legislation. I think the approval of the U.S.-Peru FTA that came out unanimously from Ways and Means is the antithesis of CAFTA. Let me talk about the facts on TAA, which relates to those who are dislocated. 
   We received a letter dated October 23, 2007, from the Secretary of Labor, and she said it is important, and I quote, ``that the negative impacts that are borne by a few are offset in the form of assistance to persons and firms that may be adversely affected.'' 
   I just want to say the facts are very different. It isn't a few. Trade isn't the only source of dislocation, but it is one of those and a substantial source. It's not a few. It's hundreds of thousands of people. We have lost 3 million manufacturing jobs in this country in recent years. 
   The President, or at least the administration, has sent a letter indicating their strong opposition, and I want to go over the facts quickly. It says, and I quote, that this legislation converts TAA from a trade-related program to a universal income support and training program. That is simply not true, and I will come back to that when I talk about services. 
   Number two, it says the increased duration of income support under this bill would result in some workers remaining out of the workforce and on assistance for 3 full years. That's really not accurate because the first 26 weeks are usually taken up by unemployment compensation when people are not using TAA directly. And then there are 2 years. In order to receive income support, they have to be in a training program. Now, there is a provision for an additional 6 months, but it applies to a relatively few people. So these facts don't support the strong opposition of the administration. 
   I am still hoping for bipartisan support. We did accept, voted for three amendments from the minority side in the Ways and Means Committee. We had three votes from the minority side, and I hope for very, very many more here on the House floor. 
   Next, the administration statement talks about industry-wide eligibility determinations and says that it would include workers not demonstrably affected by trade. It's the Department of Labor that has the ability to determine this, and so that sweeping statement is simply not true. As to the service sector, the administration letter says the bill does not clearly articulate any separation of such workers from their employment, must be attributable to trade. I just ask they read the language in the bill because it talks about articles or services like or directly competitive with articles that are produced  or services that are provided by such firm that relate to overseas competition. 
   Lastly, I want to say a word about health care. Look, we increased it from 65 to 85 percent because 65 percent doesn't work. Only 10 percent of those eligible for TAA now receive health care. We have an obligation in this institution for people who are laid off, who are dislocated, to receive health care for themselves and their family, and 65 to 70 percent isn't going to work. We know it. We know it.

   Mr. LEVIN. The choice is clear. We have heard your rebuttal. Your bill does really nothing about the problem for people in manufacturing. If there is an outsourcing to China, the workers are out in the cold. That is cold, not like you. But it is cold. 
   Service employees, why distinguish? It is an increasing part of our economy. You do nothing. 
   In health care you put a little patch on a big problem, and that is not good health care. 
   Essentially what you are trying to do with your substitute is to minimize the problem rather than maximizing an effective response. The 3 percent figure as to the impact of trade is really out of thin air. It is surely not true of manufacturing. Not at all true. Some who served in Republican administrations say it has been much more than that. 
   In the capping of training, we heard the response from the representative of the administration. That $3,000 figure at best is an average, and even that is indefensible. Mr. McDermott read to you the number of States where training is much higher, so you essentially cut the worker off halfway. That's what you are going to do in terms of training. 
   Seven States ran out of resources in 2007, nine in 2006; you do nothing. We need a new trade policy. We need a new, vigorous TAA. We need more than a pat on the back. 
   Our bill does what needs to be done. I am afraid the substitute at best is a  pat on the back. Let's vote it down. Let's have a bipartisan vote for this TAA. Bipartisan, as we did in the Ways and Means Committee. Bipartisan.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the energy legislation before the House. 
   We need a comprehensive approach that includes responsible development of additional energy resources, greater energy efficiency, tax incentives to spur alternative energy, investment in new technologies, and relief to American consumers. The bill before the House does that. 
   It is clear that a more-of-the-same approach to energy will not work. If we've learned nothing else from the last eight years, we've learned that we cannot drill our way to energy security. Neither will conservation alone do the job. 
   The legislation before us provides long-term incentives for renewable energy that will give the solar, wind, and biomass industries the stability they need to make investments in additional production capacity. There are also significant incentives for making our nation and economy more energy efficient. 
   The offshore drilling provisions of this legislation open up as much as 400 million acres of land off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts that are currently off limits to drilling. Through this compromise, we will expand oil production offshore, while setting a reasonable buffer zone. 
   The legislation requires electric utilities to produce more of their electricity from renewable energy sources. This is smart energy policy that will create new industries and new American jobs. 
   The legislation increases the tax credit for alternative refueling property, such as E85 pumps, and extends the credit through 2010. Biofuels are an important component of our nation's energy strategy, and U.S. automakers have made significant investments to bring flex-fuel vehicles to market. To maximize the impact of this progress we need to speed the deployment of E85 pumps. 
   This legislation also provides incentives for manufacturers to produce washing machines, refrigerators and dishwashers that push the boundaries of energy and water efficiency, and to build them in the United States. Reducing the energy and water usage of a washing machine over time and across millions of households will produce remarkable reductions in energy and water usage, saving consumers billions on their utility bills. 
   In a word, the approach taken by this bill is comprehensive. It addresses both the supply and demand sides of our nation's energy policy. It is a balanced, responsible and long-term approach to addressing the challenges of energy security. I urge all of my colleagues to support this comprehensive package.

   Mr. LEVIN. I want to spend these 2 minutes talking about a lot of forgotten people in this country, the people who are looking for work, laid off through no fault of their own. 
   This bill would address their needs. If we don't act, over a million Americans are going to exhaust their unemployment benefits before the end of the year. The unemployment rate in California has skyrocketed, now 7.7 percent with 1.4 million people looking for jobs. In Florida, the unemployment rate is 6.5 percent; 600,000-plus people looking for work. And in my home State of Michigan, over 400,000 people are out of work through no fault of their own. 
   The answer to the agony of the unemployed from the minority is stony silence. It is inexcusable. We need to pass this bill and address the needs of the unemployed. 
   I will read just from one letter, someone from Southfield, Michigan. ``I am 54 years old and finding that there are no jobs available to me. I do not want to be part of the statistics of those who lose a home or worse. The unemployment benefits give me more time to secure a job so that I and others like me are not a burden to the system.'' 
   We should stand up for those people and pass this bill.

   Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, we are going to pass this legislation. To say we are not going to have legislation regarding these energy provisions or the R&D tax credit or others is really a straw man. 
   The question is whether or not we are going to exercise our constitutional responsibility and act on a bill that is paid for. 
   The basic difference between the Senate and the House is not over rural schools. Mr. Rangel has already made that clear. It is not a question of tax relief. You so strangle fiscal responsibility that when we try to pay for something, you say that isn't tax relief. That's a strange logic. 
   The tax provisions here have essentially passed the Senate before, and the additional one is extension of a provision that the President has already agreed before to allow to go into effect later. 
   So let me not be personal but very direct. If you want to simply say the Senate shall rule, run for the Senate. If you want to exercise responsibilities as Members of the House, stay here. This is a bill that is solid substantively. It is not political. It involves a basic question of whether we want to try to be fiscally responsible in passing beneficial legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1677, the Taxpayer Protection Act. 
   I would note that its consideration today is particularly timely as millions of hardworking Americans file their tax returns. Those workers and families deserve to know that their government is taking every step to protect the sensitive data contained in those returns and to enhance taxpayer rights. 
   Identity theft is a large and growing problem in our society, and unfortunately, a lack of vigilance on the part of the IRS has contributed to that problem. One criminal who testified before the Senate Finance Committee last week detailed how he stole $1.1 million from the Treasury by using stolen identities to claim fraudulent refunds. While this individual is rightly serving time in prison, we must act to prevent such crimes in the future. 
   This legislation contains a number of common sense provisions to accomplish just that, including a requirement that the IRS notify a taxpayer if it discovers that there may have been an unauthorized use of the taxpayer's identity during the course of a tax fraud investigation and the authority for the IRS to notify taxpayers on the Internet about unclaimed tax refunds. It also increases penalties on misleading websites that use government names and symbols to engage in the fraudulent practice known as ``phishing. `` 
   I am also pleased that it enhances Earned Income Tax Credit outreach so that every taxpayer who is eligible for this credit realizes its benefits. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2669, the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007. 
   In 2004, a report by Michigan's Lt. Governor John Cherry's Commission on Higher Education and Economic Growth laid out how two-thirds of the jobs created in the next decade will require post-secondary education and training. There is little debate that Michigan's economic future is directly linked to our ability to accelerate the completion of degrees in higher education. 
   Despite increasing costs across the country and in our state, our federal investment in higher education has faltered. Direct grant aid, which once made up roughly 60 percent of the federal government's student aid contribution has dropped to 40 percent, with the remaining 60 percent offered through loans. The real dollar value of Pell Grants has sunk in recent years, while the average college graduate is now faced with close to $17,500 in debt. For lower and middle income students and families these costs are simply too great, forcing nearly 200,000 to delay or postpone their college dreams because of the prohibitive costs. 
   It has become increasingly clear that the failure of the federal government to adequately invest in higher education will have effects beyond college accessibility. In 2005, the National Academies of Sciences released a report entitled ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' which expressed deep concern that our country is losing its competitive advantage in science and technology research, two fields that are critical to our economic leadership.  
   The seriousness of our higher education crisis necessitates a comprehensive response of dramatic proportions. The College Cost Reduction Act of 2007 rises to this challenge by investing $18 billion over the next 5 years in higher education, the single largest investment in college financial aid since the GI Bill in 1944. 
   The maximum Pell Grant is boosted $500 to $5,200--up from just $4,050 in 2006--with its eligibility expanded to more students. TEACH grants are established to provide $4,000 per year for high-achieving students who commit to teach in high-need schools or high-need fields--like math and science. The interest rates for need-based student loans would be halved. 
   In Michigan, over 200,000 students could see benefits from the Pell increases and about 144,000 student borrowers with subsidized loans would see savings of over $4,200 on average over the life of their loans. This bill provides close to $513 million in loans and grants to Michigan's students and families. 
   The investments in this bill maintain the commitment made by this Democratic Congress to fiscal responsibility. The bill is fully offset by trimming excessive federal subsidies to lenders in the college loan industry. Not only will this not cost taxpayers a dime, it includes $750 million over 5 years to pay down our national deficit. 
   The College Cost Reduction Act meets the mounting hurdle of higher education affordability with vigorous across-the-board grant aid and loan investments. It shows the commitment by this Congress to the availability of a college education and the importance of this education to our economic competitiveness. Improving access to higher education is vital to expanding opportunity for Michigan students and building Michigan's economic future. This has to be an ongoing priority for the federal government and this legislation is an important step in the right direction. With this legislation, Congress has stepped up to the plate to ensure a better future for our students, their families and our country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. This bill will renew the import ban on products from Burma. In light of the overwhelming evidence that that country continues to blatantly disregard human rights and suppress democracy, it is important, indeed I would say vital, to continue to continue sanctions for another year. 
   The State Peace and Development Consul, as it is called, the controlling military junta, continues to have total disregard for its own people and their basic rights. The Burmese regime forcibly relocates civilians and has created a situation in which hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced or forced to flee to neighboring countries. That government continues to arrest, imprison, torture, and beat political activists and senior officials of the National League for Democracy. Over 1,100 political prisoners are imprisoned. 
   In May, the Government of Burma extended the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the National League for Democracy and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate. She has been detained for 11 of the last 17 years without charge or trial, and has spent the past 4 years in isolation. 
   In light of that country's continuing dismal record and its lack of any concrete steps to provide basic human rights to its citizens, I urge all of my colleagues to extend the ban on the import of Burmese products for another year. And also, very importantly, we hope the European Union, ASEAN, and other nations around the world will continue to work with the United States to increase pressure on the Burmese regime.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (COLLEGE STUDENT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, one of the pillars of the New Direction for America was a promise to make higher education more affordable and accessible so that more Americans can advance their education and enhance their economic future in an increasingly competitive global economy. Today we are taking a first step towards achieving this goal. 
   For a country whose economic success relies on the very best colleges and universities in the world, we are at an important crossroads. Today's college students are graduating with increasing levels of student loan debt--$17,500 on average. In many cases, this debt is simply too substantial to manageably repay. For many young people, the mere thought of putting themselves in such enormous debt could lead them to delay or forgo college. Indeed, according to the Congressional Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance, financial barriers will prevent at least 4.4 million high school graduates from attending a four-year public college over the next decade, and prevent another 2 million high school graduates from attending any college at all. 
   At a time when college tuition is skyrocketing--increasing by 35% at four-year public institutions over the past five years--it is clear that Congress needs to act and act now to make college more affordable. 
   The College Student Relief Act cuts the interest rates for undergraduate students with subsidized student loans in half over the next five years at no cost to the taxpayer. This commonsense legislation will help 5.5 million students across the country. 
   In Michigan, for about 144,000 student borrowers who will graduate from Michigan colleges and universities, this bill would generate savings of over $4,200 on average over the life of their loans. For example, these savings will benefit close to 1,200 students at Lawrence Tech and 3,500 students at Oakland University. 
   For Michigan, the benefits of this loan relief couldn't be clearer. A report by Michigan's Lt. Governor John Cherry's Commission on Higher Education and Economic Growth spelled out how Michigan's economic future is directly linked to our ability to accelerate the completion of degrees of higher education. Two-thirds of the jobs created in the next decade will require post-secondary education and training. 
   By making a higher education more affordable for thousands of Michiganders we are not only helping them realize their dreams, but we are also helping ensure the future of our state. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to stand today with our students and support the College Student Relief Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (ORDERLY AND RESPONSIBLE IRAQ REDEPLOYMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, the issue before the House today is straightforward. Do we think the President's Iraq policy is working so well that we should give him another $200 billion to continue it, or do we need a fundamental change in direction? 
   I truly believe we need to change an Iraq policy that is simply not working. From the beginning, the Bush administration has been wrong about the war in Iraq. If you set aside the administration's rhetoric, the reality is that the surge has not worked. The goal of the surge was to give the Iraqi Government breathing space to make the political decisions necessary to reduce the violence that is tearing Iraq apart. But 11 months into the troop surge, progress on political reconciliation continues to be all but nonexistent. Meanwhile, 2007 has already been the deadliest year for American troops since the start of the war in Iraq. 
   There is a clear choice before us. If you are satisfied with how the Bush administration has been conducting the war for the last 4 1/2 years, you should oppose this bill. If, on the other hand, you believe the administration's strategy isn't working and want to require the President to change course, you should vote for this legislation. 
   Whatever small chance there is of the Iraqi factions coming together, it will not happen as long as the U.S. military commitment in Iraq remains open-ended. We need to change course.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Honest Leadership and Open Government rules package currently before the House. 
   Reform of the way this House conducts its business is not an option. It is an absolute necessity. A recent poll found that only 37 percent of Americans approve of how Congress is doing its job. Does anyone here doubt that the ethical scandals and procedural abuses of recent years are a major factor for this low public approval rating? In 2006 alone, four Members of the House resigned their seats under a cloud. Two of these former Members have already been convicted for unethical and illegal ties to lobbyists. 
   I do not believe that these specific abuses represent the majority of Members, but I do believe it is the responsibility of the Majority party to set out strong rules that can begin to regain the trust of the American people in their institution of Congress. 
   For many years now, our constituents have been bombarded by media reports of cozy relationships between Congress and special interests lobbyists. They are incensed by news reports of Members accepting all-expense-paid trips to play golf in Scotland, the flagrant abuse of House rules to hold I5-minute votes open for hours for the sole purpose of affecting the outcome, the widening Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal, and the lack of accountability and transparency in how congressional earmarks are awarded. 
   I mentioned that our constituents learned about these abuses from the media, in their morning newspapers and on the nightly news. Too often in recent years, it is also from the media that rank-and-file Members of Congress have learned about special interest provisions that were secretly inserted into legislation in the dead of night and brought up for a vote before Members had an opportunity to read what they were being asked to vote on. This form of secret legislating has got to stop, and it will stop under this reform package. 
   The reform package before the House will also curb a large number of the other abuses that have come to light. These reforms will ban gifts from lobbyists, expand and tighten the restrictions on congressional travel paid for by outside groups, prohibit travel on corporate jets, and require greater public disclosure of targeted special interest legislation. The reforms will also prohibit the practice of holding votes open for the sole purpose of affecting the outcome. 
   There are many other needed reforms contained here, but the one I want to single out is the provision that restores pay-as-you-go budgeting. Pay-as-you-go budgeting simply means that Congress will not consider any legislation to boost entitlement spending or cut taxes unless it is fully paid for. Before they were abandoned in 2002, the pay-as-you-go rules helped to turn record deficits into record surpluses in the 1990s. Since abandoning pay-as-you-go, the cumulative deficit for the past four years has totaled over $1.36 trillion. We simply cannot continue to pile up more and more debt and pass it along to our children and grandchildren. 
   For all these reasons, I urge all my colleagues to join me in voting for the House rules reform package before the House.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Thank you very much, Mr. Scott, and I thank the chairman and the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee for bringing this to the floor. 
   I rise in support of this resolution, marking the 75th anniversary of the man-made famine that killed millions of Ukrainians in 1932 and 1933. 
   Recognizing this tragedy and remembering its victims are important for all of humanity, including 1.5 Ukrainian-Americans. It has special meaning to the people of Ukraine, who continue to struggle toward a more free, democratic, open society, and indeed to all of us who value freedom. 
   During the famine-genocide of 1932-33, 7 to 10 million Ukrainians were deliberately and systematically starved to death. We are familiar in this House with the terrible suffering caused by famines that are the result of natural forces, but the famine of 1932-33 is all the more tragic because it resulted from criminal acts and deliberate decisions by Soviet officials. Despite efforts by the Soviet Government at the time and afterward to hide the planned and systematic nature of this famine-genocide, it is clear that the Soviet Union used food as a weapon. 
   We in this country must persist in standing with those living under oppressive and tyrannical regimes as they struggle for their freedom. During the 109th Congress, we enacted a bill authorizing the Government of Ukraine to establish a memorial in Washington, D.C. honoring the victims of the Ukrainian famine-genocide. The Ukrainian Government and the Ukrainian-American community are working with the appropriate Federal agencies to identify a site for this memorial. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I first became involved with mental health services over 50 years ago when my beloved late wife, Vicki, worked in the network of child guidance clinics in Oakland County, Michigan. Those clinics tried to fill huge gaps in mental health services which in most cases were not covered by any insurance. 
   Since then the battle has ensued to provide mental health services on a parity with all other services in health insurance, private and public, including Medicare. 
   Twelve years ago, Congress and President Clinton came together to approve legislation that put this country on the road to mental health parity. It was a vital first step. 
   Today, we take another important step towards genuine mental health parity. Fifteen percent of Americans have no health insurance at all. Even Americans who do have health insurance often find themselves unable to receive care because of discriminatory policies in their health plans that require them to pay more and receive less for mental health care than for  other services. This bill will change that. 
   This bill is another milestone in the long battle that must continue until everyone has full access to mental health services in our beloved Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the AMT Relief Act. Once again, we are considering a one-year ``patch'' for the AMT. This bill will protect over 25 million families who would otherwise be forced to pay higher taxes under the AMT through no fault of their own. 
   We all know that the AMT was never meant to apply to middle-class families, and I think we all agree that we need to find a permanent fix to this problem. 
   But once again, the minority wants to insist that we provide this tax relief in a fiscally irresponsible manner. Patching the AMT for 2008 without offsets would increase the deficit by $61 billion. Our colleagues in the minority will argue that because Congress never meant for this to happen, or that because it maintains the status quo for taxpayers, we don't have to pay for it. 
   The reality is that we pay for it one way or another. The minority would have us borrow the money and make our children pay for it. 
   Let me say a word about the offsets we've used here, because this bill is paid for with provisions that end basic inequities in our tax code. 
   The Joint Committee on Taxation's revenue estimate for the carried interest provision indicates that over $150 billion in income will be taxed at capital gains rates rather than ordinary income rates if we do not make this change. This is a lot of income, and according to the Joint Committee, this is not going to ``mom and pop'' operations, a common reference by those arguing against this provision. 
   For anyone who thinks there are ``mom and pop'' private equity funds, or that this is essentially about ``mom and pop'' real estate developers, let me quote the Joint Committee on Taxation. In a memo to the Ways and Means Committee staff, the Joint Committee writes: ``We assumed that nearly all recipients [of carried interest] would be at the highest marginal tax rate.'' The top tax bracket for married couples starts at $357,000 in taxable income. Claims made that the carried interest issue is about ``mom and pop'' business owners just are not credible. 
   More generally though, treating carried interest as ordinary income is not about raising taxes, it's about fairness. Investment fund managers should not pay a lower tax rate on their compensation for services than other Americans. The only thing this does is say to the fund managers, if 
   you're providing a service, in this case managing assets for your investors, you ought to be taxed on that compensation at the same rates as everyone else. 
   If they have their own money in the funds they manage, they will still get capital gains treatment on that portion of the profits. This is no different in concept than options for corporate executives. They are both incentive compensation to encourage performance, and carried interest should be taxed at ordinary rates like stock options. 
   The argument that this proposal will hurt economic growth or even pension plans is just disingenuous. If it will hurt growth, why have senior economic advisers to the last three Republican Presidents publicly supported this proposal? Real estate partnerships, including those that don't use carried interest at all, earn less than 10 percent of all income from real estate development and construction. 
   Regarding the oil and gas provisions, I think it's important to look at the history of how these companies got these subsidies in the first place. In 2004 we had to replace the FSC provisions of our tax code because of a WTO ruling. We replaced them with a deduction to encourage domestic manufacturing. 
   The minority, then in the majority, added the oil and gas industries to what was supposd to be a deduction for manufacturers, even though the FSC provisions we were replacing had nothing to do with oil and gas. This was an unjustified giveaway then, and it is only fair that we correct the situation, especially now that oil companies are earning record profits. ExxonMobil alone earned $40.6 billion in 2007, a U.S. corporate record. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, this bill protects middle-class families from the AMT, it's fiscally responsible and it makes our tax code fairer. I urge all my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. 
   Embryonic stem cell research holds potential for some of the most far-reaching breakthroughs seen in modem medicine. This is a field filled with promise, with the potential to cure the incurable and to heal that which was once thought impossible to mend. 
   We're bringing this bill up again with the hope that the President will hear the scientists and researchers and hear the voices of the American people that he do the right thing and sign this vital measure into law. We need to take action now so that this crucial research can go forward for the sake of the millions of people dealing with incurable or debilitating diseases--diseases such as juvenile diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, and cancer. We can never guarantee the results of scientific research, but without it we guarantee there can be no results. 
   The President's current stem cell policy is not working. Research is practically at a standstill in this country. Of the 78 existing stem cell lines permitted for use in Federally funded research, only 21 of these lines are currently used for research, and many of the available stem cell lines are contaminated, making their therapeutic use for humans questionable. 
   The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act is a well-crafted, bipartisan approach. Let me be clear that the bill only allows the use of stem cell lines generated from embryos that would otherwise be discarded by fertility clinics. The legislation contains strict ethical guidelines, including the requirement that embryos can be used only if the donors give their written consent and receive no money or other inducement in exchange. 
   There has been recent news regarding ongoing research using non-embryonic stem cells. While I believe it is necessary to support study on all stem cell types, this research alone is in no way a substitute for embryonic stem cell research, whose potential is different from that of other stem cell types. 
   We need to pass this bill today on a strong, bipartisan vote. I truly hope the President will reconsider and do the right thing and sign this bill into law. This legislation is so important to millions of Americans, and we stand with them as we vote for the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act today. 
   I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this vital legislation.

   There has been some bipartisanship that has motored this legislation, and I hope it won't break down today. 
   The crisis in housing needs the attention and the support of everybody. It needs much more than tea and sympathy, it needs legislation. Recently I met with mayors and managers from the 12th District, in Macomb County and southeast Oakland. And they all talked about the plight of the homeowner, the plight of the communities when houses are shut down. We have to act. And I pay tribute, all of us should, to the Committee on Financial Services. 
   And let me say just a word about the tax provisions. They would provide credit to first-time homebuyers. Essential. It would improve access to low-income housing. Essential. It would allow families to deduct property taxes through the standard deduction. It's a good experiment. It should have been done earlier. And it also would allow Federal home loan banks to help relieve pressure on credit markets. 
   I read the Statement of Administrative Policy that said it was risky and it was an expansion of the purpose of the banks, and I think it's incorrect in both respects. So I just want to close with the sense of urgency that I think all of us feel. Mr. Bernanke said that if markets were simply allowed to follow their own course, it could ``destabilize communities, reduce the property values of nearby homes and lower municipal tax revenues.'' 
   What more do we need to impel us to act than the flight of families, the plight of communities, and the plight of municipalities? Let's vote on a bipartisan bill. Let's vote for this bill.

   Passage of this legislation today is essential to the health of the Great Lakes. With the approval of the Compact, at long last we will close the door to bulk diversion of Great Lakes water. The Compact also establishes a comprehensive management framework to protect this shared resource and requires Great Lake states to control their own large-scale water use. 
   Some will say that the agreement does not go far enough and that Congress should hold off approving the Compact until changes are made. We have to be careful not to let the perfect become the enemy of the good. The agreement before us is the product of years of effort and enjoys broad support from all eight Great Lakes states, the environmental community, conservation groups, and other key stakeholders. The region has come together behind this plan as the best way to protect the Great Lakes. It is now time for Congress to act. 
   There is no question that we're in a much stronger position to protect the Great Lakes with the Compact than without it. I urge the House to join me in supporting this vital legislation.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, some issues are complicated. This one is quite simple. It's kids and more benefits for seniors. 
   Five million more kids. I just wonder how many on the minority side are going to stand up and say no to 5 million kids, including kids where you live. Benefits for seniors are improved. And then we hear there will be benefits for illegal aliens, illegal immigrants? It's false. It's a lie. 
   This does not go to illegal immigrants. I did read the bill, and I also read the minds of the American people. 
   I also read the minds of the American people. They want the children of America covered by health insurance, and the Republicans have failed to do it in their years here. 
   We're going to do it today for the 5 million kids in the United States of America. That's what this is all about.  
   I rise in strong support of the Children's Health and Medicare Improvement Act of 2007. This legislation re-authorizes the State Children's Health Insurance Program and improves Medicare for all beneficiaries. 
   Some of the issues we debate in Congress are complicated. This issue is quite simple. It is about kids getting health care and seniors getting better Medicare benefits. The American people want the children of America covered by health msurance. 
   The current health insurance program covers 6 million children nationwide, including 55,000 kids in my home State of Michigan. But when two-thirds of the 9 million uninsured kids in America are eligible, but not participating, we need to extend the reach of the program. Extending this program means giving States the resources they need to reach out and cover these 6 million kids. 
   This important legislation not only allows more kids to have health insurance, but it also  makes long-needed improvements to the Medicare program. Improvements include ensuring physician access for Medicare beneficiaries, lowering the cost of mental health care for seniors, eliminating co-pays and deductibles for preventative services like mammograms and colonoscopy screenings, and expanding programs that help low-income seniors pay for their health care and prescriptions. 
   The Republicans reject this bill because it does not fit their rigid ideology. This bill is about a program that works and kids that need health care.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act. 
   This bipartisan legislation will give state and local law enforcement the tools and resources they need to prevent and prosecute violent hate crimes. 
   In the not so distant past, violence motivated by hatred or discrimination towards a minority was sanctioned by our government. As we struggled to right the inequities present in our society, many used targeted violence against individual African Americans as a tactic to scare African Americans in general and discourage the Civil Rights Movement overall. 
   This type of targeted violence against a minority--violence specifically intended to intimidate and repress all members of that minority--was particularly reprehensible and damaging to society as a whole. Congress recognized that these particularly heinous actions warranted stronger criminal penalties, which were codified in Federal hate crimes law in 1968. 
   Unfortunately, almost 20 years later bias-based violence continues, and while the groups and individuals victimized have changed, the damage remains the same. In 1998, Matthew Sheppard was viciously murdered because of his sexual orientation. In January 2000, a 16-year-old high school female student was brutally attacked by a group of teenagers because the student was holding hands with another girl--a common practice in her native country in Africa. Just last October, Michael Sandy was beaten then chased into traffic and killed because he was gay. 
   Under current law, the attackers in each of these cases could not be prosecuted for a hate crime for two reasons. First, in order for it to constitute a federal hate crime, a victim must be engaged in a federally protected activity such as voting. Second, the current hate crime law does not consider sexual orientation a protected class. 
   The Hate Crimes Prevention Act addresses both these gaps in current law by expanding the definition of a hate crime to cover all violent crimes motivated by race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability. It also expands the instances in which federal authorities can prosecute or assist local authorities in prosecuting hate crimes. 
   Importantly, the bill before the House includes specific language stating that nothing in the bill can be interpreted to prohibit ``expressive conduct'' protected by the First Amendment. In doing so, we have ensured that this legislation in no way impinges on one's constitutional right to freedom of speech or religious expression. 
   The Hate Crimes Prevention Act enjoys the strong support of law enforcement, and has  been endorsed by International Association of Chief of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association, the National District Attorneys Association, as well as 31 state Attorneys General. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation. In doing so we are sending a clear message that hate crimes have no place in America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, today there are two distinct messages coming out of Washington. The first message is from a majority of the Congress and underscores impatience with the lack of political progress in Iraq. We call for a new direction, including enforceable benchmarks for the performance of the Iraqi government. The other message is from the White House. The message the President is sending is that America's military commitment in Iraq remains open-ended, no matter what. 
   The President keeps saying that we're making progress in Iraq. This claim cannot be reconciled with the facts. Nearly everyone agrees that there is no military solution possible in Iraq; rather, the Iraqis must make the political compromises necessary to end the violence. 
   But where is the progress on the benchmarks that the President himself has endorsed? Where is the agreement to fairly share Iraq's oil wealth among all of Iraq's people? Where is the law reversing the disastrous de-Baathification policy? Where are the promised new election laws? Where is the progress on amending the Iraqi constitution to address longstanding Sunni concerns? The Iraqi government has repeatedly promised action on all of these, but there is little forward movement after many months. 
   Benchmarks are only real if there are consequences for failure to meet them. Back in January, the President said, and I quote, ``if the Iraqi government does not follow through on its promises, it will lose the support of the American people--and it will lose the support of the Iraqi people.'' But by vetoing the Iraq Accountability Act, the President has made it clear that failure to follow through on the benchmarks will not result in the loss of the White House's support for this open-ended war. 
   From the beginning, the Bush Administration has been wrong so many times about nearly every aspect of the war in Iraq. Now the President comes to Congress again to ask for yet another blank check. We should not give him one. I urge the House to override the President's veto.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution before the House. 
   Few will take any great satisfaction with the manner in which the Congress is at last completing the budget process for 2007. This work was supposed to have been completed 4 months ago. It is important for everyone to understand how we got to this point and why we are forced to take the extraordinary step of approving a continuing resolution to fund nearly every domestic program for the balance of this fiscal year. 
   We are here today because the Republican majority that controlled the House last year failed to do its work. Last May, they voted for a budget resolution that was so unrealistic that not even they could find a way to live within it. As a direct result after 8 months, the former majority was able to complete action on just 2 of the 11 regular appropriations bills. Then, in early December, the outgoing leaders of the House and Senate decided to punt on the remaining funding bills, pass a stopgap spending bill to keep the Government operating through February 15, adjourn the Congress, and leave town. 
   So now it is up to the new Congress to clean up this budgetary mess as best we can, and that's what the bill before the House does. It is an imperfect solution. There are any number of programs that deserve a lot more funding than we are able to give them here today. We are still constrained by the overall funding levels adopted in last year's budget resolution, a budget that not a single Democrat voted for. At the same time, I am glad that the measure we are considering today manages to increase funding in a number of priority areas, especially veterans health care, medical care for U.S. troops wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Federal highway program, medical research at the National Institutes of Health as well as some key education programs. I also applaud the decision to put a moratorium on Members' earmarks until a reformed process is put in place to provide an accountable and transparent process for funding these projects. 
   Even so, some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have gotten up to complain that we should have done better. They want less spending in some areas and more spending in others. After sitting on their hands for 8 months last year, they now object to the procedure we're using to clean up the mess they made. It is unfortunate that the people who are complaining the loudest today were unwilling to convince their own leadership to make these spending decisions last year by passing the individual funding bills on time and getting them to the President for his signature. 
   The reality is that we are already 4 months into fiscal year 2007. There isn't time to spend another month or two debating spending bills that should have been completed last September. The agencies and the States have waited long enough for Congress to act, and the President is submitting his 2008 budget request to us next week. It's time for Congress to complete this work.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (ANDEAN TRADE PREFERENCE EXTENSION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of extending the Andean Trade Preference Act, which provides duty-free treatment to certain exports from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. 
   The ATPA program is a program that has been working. It has benefited the region by providing much-needed economic development to these four countries. There is also some evidence that it has helped create some alternatives to the illegal drug trade. 
   Importantly, and I emphasize this, this has all been accomplished in a way that is more complementary than it is competitive; so there have been economic benefits for the four nations and for our Nation. In fact, if you exclude oil and oil products, the U.S. has a trade surplus with the region. We export about $13 billion to these four countries, and they export about $11 billion to us. 
   Beyond the numbers, the composition of the trade is also complementary. With agriculture, it's the seasonal nature of the trade. Crops from these countries tend to be imported when the U.S. crops they compete with are not in season. 
   It's also complementary in textiles and apparel trade. Under ATPA the U.S. textile industry ships U.S. yarns and fabrics to the region, and they export to us apparel made with those U.S. inputs. In fact, U.S. exports of yarn and fabric to the region were $111 million in 2007, up from $58 million in 2002. The only apparel that comes in duty free that is not made with U.S. yarn and fabrics is made with materials that we don't have in our country like pima cotton and alpaca. 
   It's the complementary nature of this trade that has generated widespread support for the extension of this program, including support from the business community and the labor community. 
   Concerns have been raised about whether Ecuador and Bolivia are living up to their ATPA obligations and treating U.S. investors fairly. And the answer is, and I want this to be clear, that the administration has the authority to revoke ATPA status to any country failing to meet any of the ATPA criteria, and there is a broad range of them, including those related to the treatment of investors. 
   If this program is not extended, it would be mutually disadvantageous to both the United States and to these four countries. 
   I want to emphasize, as I did some months ago when there was an extension, we are talking today about the Andean Trade Preference Act. We are not talking about any other FTA, whether it be Colombia, Korea, or any other place. Each agreement must be decided on its own merits. In any respect, therefore, it would be counterproductive to vote against extending the Andean Trade Preference Act. 
   I strongly urge approval of this 10-month extension. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   In closing, let me just emphasize a few points. Mr. Rangel and I and others offered a bill for a longer extension than this one, but we weren't able to bring that about here on a bipartisan basis. So what we have today is a 10-month extension, and I very much urge its passage. 
   I simply want to emphasize that every program has to be considered on its own merits. This is a continuation of a preference program that has been mutually beneficial. This is not involving an FTA with any of these countries. FTAs involve different and broader considerations. So I think discussion of that must be left for a different time under different circumstances after different events have occurred. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY CONSERVATION TAX ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, as you listen to the minority, it shows the bankruptcy of their approach to energy. They have been in control of this town for all these years, and we have moved backwards. So, instead of coming up now with an alternative of their own, what they do is raise arguments that are so irresponsible. For example, about raising gas prices. The Joint Economic Committee has refuted that. 
   There isn't a single argument that Mr. English raised that can bear any weight of observation. It is absolutely mysterious why, in a time of global warming, what they do on the minority side is come here with a cold shoulder. 
   This is a responsible bill, a balanced bill. It addresses long-term needs on energy, long-term incentives for renewable energy, solar, wind, biomass, and also tries to give impetus to the use of biofuels like E85, and actually tries to make some progress with the deployment of pumps. Also, in terms of what we use every day, refrigerators, washing machines, there is an incentive here to increase the efficiency and also to do so with American jobs. 
   So I stand here today wondering, where have you been all of these years  when you controlled this institution and the White House? And that is, I think you have not only been out to lunch, but you have been out to dinner, and you come here today with nothing but attacks that are unwarranted. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge that we move this bill once again, and hope the Senate will find the 60 votes and that the President will come to his senses on energy in this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1338, the Paycheck Fairness Act. 
   In 1963, President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act into law in order to promote workplace equality for women. Since then, women have made great gains in workforce participation, compensation, and advancement, but a significant wage gap still exists between women and men. Women working full-time year-round earn on average 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man. The wage gap is even wider in Michigan: On average, women in Michigan are paid only 67 cents for every dollar earned by a man. 
   Wage discrimination is not just a women's issue--it is a family issue. With a majority of American households depending on two incomes to make ends meet, the wage gap is more relevant than ever. The current pay disparity may cost a woman anywhere from $400,000 to $2 million in lifetime earnings relative to a man performing equivalent work. The cost is often borne not just by an individual, but by all the members of the household who rely on that income. Congress must respond to this injustice. 
   The Paycheck Fairness Act updates and strengthens the Equal Pay Act in light of more than 45 years of real-world experience. Courts have interpreted the Equal Pay Act more narrowly than other employment discrimination laws, counter to the intent of Congress. The Paycheck Fairness Act clarifies that the factors used by employers to justify wage disparities must be related to the employee's work or to the business. The bill also redefines the standard for comparing employees' compensation, reducing a frequently prohibitive burden of proof for plaintiffs. 
   Data collection is key to tracking women's relative compensation in the workplace, but the federal agencies charged with enforcing employment discrimination laws have little information about wage disparities. The Bush administration, furthermore, has halted or tried to halt many efforts to collect data. The Paycheck Fairness Act ensures that the Bureau of Labor Statistics will collect data on wage disparities, and it requires the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to offer guidance in order to enhance enforcement of federal law. These measures will help shed light on wage discrimination that would otherwise go unseen. 
   This legislation takes vital steps toward realizing the goals established 45 years ago in the Equal Pay Act. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I have been listening, as I hope everybody has, and I think the comments from the minority are the height of fiscal irresponsibility and fiscal irrationality. Both. 
   You simply say because it was unintended. But no, in 2002 and 2001 when you passed the tax bill, you knew that the AMT was going to take away some of the effect. You knew that. You've known all along that this was coming down the track. And essentially what you said was borrow, borrow, borrow. 
   And now you are carrying that to a ridiculous extreme by saying don't act  and pay for it by closing a loophole that gives people in our country who try to escape taxation by going overseas, don't act. That's irrational as well as irresponsible. 
   So what we are saying to the Senate is we are giving you another chance. It has been blocked in the Senate by the Republican minority and by the President of the United States. We have to act on the AMT. You have to act at long last responsibly, and so do Senate Republicans and so does the President of the United States of America.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (SMALL BUSINESS TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 976, the Small Business Tax Relief Act. 
   This tax package provides limited, targeted tax relief for small businesses in a fiscally responsible manner. At a little over $1.3 billion it provides a meaningful level of relief, offset by closing a loophole that would allow some upper income tax payers to take advantage of a reduced capital gains tax that was intended to benefit low income Americans. 
   In addition to being fiscally responsible, it's fully bipartisan. Both Democratic and Republican Members had a chance to provide their input. It was introduced jointly by Chairman RANGEL and Mr. MCCRERY, and it has been co-sponsored by an overwhelming bipartisan majority of the Ways and Means Committee. 
   I am particularly supportive of extending the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, and expanding the Credit to include veterans who have been disabled since September 11th, which this bill does. 
   But mostly, I am supportive of going to conference with the other body to pass a minimum wage increase. This legislation will accomplish that. Thirteen million Americans have not had a raise--not even a cost of living adjustment--in 9 years. In a word, a minimum wage increase is overdue. 
   The current minimum wage is so low that an individual working full time at the minimum wage would make only $10,712--that's 35% below the federal poverty line for a family of three. I urge all of my colleagues to support this responsible tax package so we can move onto conference and providing millions of Americans with the raise they deserve.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Thank you for yielding. 
   Thank you to the Rules Committee, and to you, Mr. Obey, who has been more than a stalwart central figure in this whole effort. And as I'm going to say, there are hundreds of thousands of people who will say to you, thank you, because today the voices of over one million people who have not been heard enough on this floor are finally being listened to with a much-needed extension of unemployment benefits. 
   Some have written us the most persuasive letters about being unemployed, often for the first time, sending out hundreds of resumes, losing their health care, and having difficulty making ends meet. They have not marched on Washington. They have individually been in their communities looking for work. But if they did form a line, these million plus and those who've exhausted their benefits, by estimation, it would extend from this Capitol to Denver, Colorado. 
   I asked the State of Michigan to provide me information on individuals who have exhausted their benefits just yesterday, and we have the figures now. They come from the broadest range of occupations--sales, health care, production, management, financial operations. I would suggest that each Member do the same, because once you look at the data, you will have no doubt that we are doing the right thing today. 
   Today is a victory for more than one million of our citizens and an additional 2.5 million estimated to exhaust their benefits. This is a vital first step, and we will be ready to fight to sustain this program for people who continue to be unemployed through no fault of their own in a truly difficult job market.

   So here we hear the Republicans opposing it. They did not know how to govern effectively when they were in the majority, and they're showing today they don't know how to oppose effectively when they're in the minority. 
   They criticize PAYGO. Their creed is ``pay-no.'' They don't want to pay for anything. They oppose a tax provision to close a loophole, an egregious one, and they call that a tax increase. They say this is their principle: Don't pay for extending current tax law, even though the reason it meets its end is because they didn't want to extend it a few years ago and increase the deficit. What illogic. 
   They say do further with the extenders, but they don't want to pay for it. They say do more right now on the AMT but don't pay for it. 
   We're going to keep working on the AMT. We're going to keep trying to pay for it. The reason this may not succeed in the Senate is because of the minority Republicans and in the White House.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (HARDROCK MINING AND RECLAMATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2262, the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act. Reform of this 135-year-old law is long overdue, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of this needed legislation. 
   In 1872, President Ulysses S. Grant signed the General Mining Law. The intention of the law was to promote the settlement of the American West. Under the 1872 law, mining companies do not pay any royalties for the publicly-owned ``hardrock'' minerals mined on federal lands. Over the years, mining companies have been able to extract hundreds of billions of dollars in gold, silver, platinum, copper, and uranium without paying royalties. 
   It is time to overhaul this archaic law. Let me be clear that this bill does not affect privately-owned land, but rather federal lands that belong to all Americans. The American people deserve a fair return for the minerals extracted from the lands they own. By comparison, the coal, oil, and gas companies already pay royalties for their operations on federal lands. Why should hardrock mining be any different? Virtually every other nation that allows mining on public lands imposes some form of royalty. 
   Opponents of this bill claim that charging an 8 percent royalty on new hardrock mines and setting some basic environmental standards will devastate the domestic mining industry and send mining jobs overseas. I read in the paper this morning that the price of gold hit just hit a 27-year high of $800 an ounce. Platinum is now selling for $1,447 an ounce. The worldwide demand for copper is so high that thieves have taken to stealing phone lines in some areas so they can sell the copper at recycling yards. Yet, in the face of these facts, opponents of the bill implausibly argue that the mining industry in this country will collapse if we don't continue to give away publicly-owned minerals for free. 
   I urge all my colleagues to join me in voting to bring this 19th century mining law into the 21st century.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I urge the House to join me in voting to override the President's veto of the ``Medicare Improvement for Patients and Providers Act of 2008.'' 
   A vote to override the President's veto of this bill is a vote in support of our seniors and their doctors. It is a vote in support of people who have worked hard, who have contributed, who have earned the best health care available to them at this stage of their lives. It is a vote that sends a clear message that politics should not get in the way of their access to the care they deserve. 
   H.R. 6331 prevents a pending 10 percent reduction in the payments physicians receive for treating Medicare patients. The bill also allows for the expansion of preventive care services under Medicare, reforms the pharmacy payment process for the benefit of our small community pharmacies, and delays and repairs a flawed competitive bidding process for durable medical equipment. 
   We must continue a vigorous effort to ensure that Medicare remains strong for all of the Nation's citizens. This bill honors that commitment without delaying difficult decisions about Medicare's funding future; it is fully paid for. 
   I encourage all of my colleagues to vote in favor of the veto override.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, as a cosponsor of H.R. 518, I rise in strong support of this measure. The issue of waste coming into Michigan from Ontario is one of great concern to the people I represent, and I appreciate Representative DINGELL's tireless efforts to move this legislation. 
   Like the bill approved by the House last year, the International Solid Waste Importation and Management Act directs the Environmental Protection Agency to implement and enforce the Agreement Concerning the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste between the United States and Canada. The Administrator is required to issue final regulations within 24 months after the date of enactment. 
   The legislation further requires the Administrator of EPA, when considering whether to consent to a shipment of foreign municipal solid waste to give substantial weight to the views of the recipient State or States, and also consider the impact of the shipment on local recycling programs, landfill capacity, road deterioration, homeland security, public health and the environment, among other factors. 
   As I mentioned, the bill before the House is nearly identical to the legislation that the House approved last September. Unfortunately, the former leadership of the Senate failed to take up the bill last year, despite bipartisan pleas from Michigan's House delegation urging prompt action. Now that the Senate is under new management, I hope we can at last address this longstanding problem and get a bill to the President's desk for signature. 
   Our Nation has no closer friend in the world than Canada, but the current trash arrangement in which hundreds of trash trucks cross the border each day on their way to Michigan landfills is simply untenable. The legislation before the House builds on the agreement that Michigan's two Senators negotiated with the government of Ontario last year to reduce municipal waste shipments from Canada over the next four years. 
   I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting the legislation before the House.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the resolution. 
   China has a law that includes protections for the distinctive culture, language, and identity of ethnic minority citizens. Its Regional Ethnic Autonomy Law guarantees ethnic minorities the ``right to administer their internal affairs.'' More specifically, the term ``regional ethnic autonomy'' reflects ``the state's full respect for ..... ethnic minorities' rights to administer their internal affairs.'' Madam Speaker, China in recent weeks has reflected anything but ``the state's full respect'' of ethnic minority rights nor of basic human rights recognized in both Chinese and international law. 
   Protest activity has included instances of rioting resulting in destruction of property and death of Tibetans and non-Tibetans alike. This is unacceptable in any context. But most protest activity, while at times disorderly, has been nonviolent. The Chinese Government's reaction, however, has revealed a level of hostility towards Tibetans not seen in decades and has heightened fears for the Tibetan people. 
   The Chinese Government would do well to consider a number of concrete steps to address the current crisis, and I would ask, Madam Speaker, that a list of such steps prepared by the staff of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China be submitted for the Record.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Coast Guard Authorization Act. In particular, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation's ballast water treatment requirements. 
   The Great Lakes are one of this nation's crown jewels. They are the most unique set of freshwater lakes in the world. They provide drinking water for millions. They provide habitat for our fisheries and they offer tremendous recreational and tourism opportunities. 
   The Great Lakes are threatened by damaging aquatic invasive species that arrive in the Lakes at a rate of one every eight months. The communities I represent have first-hand experience of the devastation these aquatic invaders can cause. In the mid-1980s, the zebra mussel was brought to the Great Lakes by hitching a ride on an ocean vessel from Europe. They were first identified in Lake St. Clair in 1988, and since then the zebra mussels have spread throughout the Great Lakes and have made their way into the Mississippi River and its tributaries. The economic and ecological costs of dealing with aquatic invasive species are staggering. 
   Invasive aquatic species pose a clear and present danger to virtually every U.S. waterway and coastal area. Many more invasive species will arrive in rapid succession and spread within U.S. waters unless effective measures are taken to prevent them. 
   The bill before the House contains strong provisions to reduce and hopefully eliminate the spread of aquatic invasive species through ballast water. The bill establishes a national goal to eliminate invasive species from ballast water that is discharged into U.S. waters by the year 2015. As an interim step, the legislation requires all ships entering U.S. waters to conduct ballast water exchange at least 200 miles off the nation's coastline. Between now and the end of 2013, the legislation requires vessels to be fitted with effective ballast water treatment equipment. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this comprehensive response to one of the most serious problems confronting the Great Lakes and waterways across the nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (IMPLEMENTING THE 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1, which provides for the implementation of remaining recommendations by the bipartisan 9/11 Commission. 
   Implementation of the 9/11 Commission's recommendations is long overdue. In 2004, the 9/11 Commission submitted 41 recommendations to the Bush Administration and Congress to fill critical gaps in our nation's homeland security. More than two years later, many of these recommendations have only been partially implemented and others not at all. Troubling gaps in our homeland security still exist. As the Co-Chairmen of the Commission stated last August, ``we are not as safe as we should be.'' 
   As just one example, the 9/11 Commission found that the inability of first responders to communicate with each other and their commanders resulted in a loss of life after the planes hit the World Trade Center towers five years ago. In an emergency situation, first responders in a unit--and across departments--must be able to talk to each other. In response, one of the Commission's recommendations stated that establishing and funding interoperable communications for first responders had to be given a high priority. This hasn't happened; indeed, after Hurricane Katrina slammed into New Orleans last year, the communications network in that city simply collapsed. 
   Securing funding for interoperable radios is the number one homeland security priority for my district, but the high cost of establishing the required infrastructure and acquiring the necessary equipment has greatly slowed this vital effort. For smaller communities, the tens of thousands of dollars needed to upgrade their systems is simply too great. The stand-alone interoperability grant program included in this legislation is a great step forward, and I look forward to working to secure appropriations for this critical effort in the future. 
   The Commission also criticized the current funding system for federal first responder funding--which guarantees States a large portion of baseline funding with some additional funding distributed on the basis of population--arguing that homeland security assistance should be based ``strictly on an assessment of risks and vulnerabilities.'' 
   One result of the current funding formula is that States at low risk of terrorist attack receive far more money per capita than states at much higher risk from terrorism. For example, under the current formula, Wyoming received $18.06 per capita in Department of Homeland Security grants in 2006 while Michigan, whose border crossings are the busiest on the northern border and conduct about $450 million in trade every day, received $5.13 per capita. 
   The legislation before the House significantly increases that share of state homeland security grants provided on the basis of risk. Under the bill, most States would be guaranteed a minimum of 0.25 percent of Homeland Security grant money, down from 0.75 percent. Eighteen states that have international borders, including Michigan, would get a higher guaranteed amount of 0.45 percent of the total. The rest of the money would be distributed based on the Homeland Security Department's assessment of risk and need. I agree with this approach. We must focus our resources on high-threat areas where the risk from terrorist attack are greatest. 
   The most basic job of government is to be ready to respond in the event of a disaster, whether natural or man-made. We can't afford another response like the one following Hurricane Katrina. I urge all my colleagues to join me in voting for this important legislation.

   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in Strong support of House Resolution 15. It is fitting and right that the House remember this highly distinguished citizen of the State of Michigan, and honor his service to the people of the United States.  
   Gerald Ford's life and legacy define the term ``public servant.'' He served with distinction in World War II aboard the U.S.S. Monterrey. In 1948, he was elected to the House of Representatives, where he served with integrity for 25 years. In 1974, during one of the darkest moments in U.S. history, Gerald Ford served as our Nation's 38th President, and restored integrity to the Presidency. 
   As the Nation has honored President Ford over the course of the last week, I have been struck by how many have made mention of his honesty, trustworthiness and essential decency. As the first President Bush said of his one-time colleague in the House of Representatives at the memorial service at Washington Cathedral last week, ``to political ally and adversary alike, Jerry Ford's word was always good.'' 
   President Ford will also be remembered for believing that America is strongest when we work together and work with others. 
   President Ford has left us a rich legacy. As we begin this new Congress, I hope all of us here will honor him by taking to heart that legacy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, the question of whether the Federal Government is finally going to do more to provide health coverage to children who need it is not going to go away. This is not an issue of partisan politics. It's not a complicated issue either. It's simply a matter of doing what's right. 
   I believe that no American child should be without access to decent health care. This is especially true given the worsening economic conditions that are battering Michigan and every other State. Rising unemployment results in more American families losing their health insurance. Not only do workers find that health coverage is increasingly beyond their reach, the problem extends to children. 
   A new study by the Joint Economic Committee underscores the fact that between 700,000 and 1.1 million additional children will enroll in Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Programs each year due to slowing employment growth. The projections show that more than 35,000 additional children in Michigan alone will need help. But State budgets have been hard hit by the economic downturn. They don't have the resources to provide health care coverage to millions of kids that already need it, let alone all the new children who will need help due to the economic downturn. 
   That's why it's vital that Congress vote to override the President's veto of the Children's Health Insurance Program bill. By doing so, we can extend health care coverage to nearly 4 million children who are currently uninsured. Let's not let America's children become casualties of the economic downturn. Vote to override the President's veto.

   Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Madam Speaker, I am from Michigan. I have seen firsthand the dislocation from globalization. That's why we have been fighting for a new trade policy, a trade policy that shapes globalization. It shapes trade to expand the benefits and to address the down sides. 
   Enforceable worker rights and environmental standards have been at the core of this struggle. Worker rights in the trade equation fundamentally alters the power dynamics in developing countries, just as it has in our own. This is important for those workers, for Peru, who needs a middle class, for our workers who should not compete with workers who are suppressed, and our businesses and their workers who need more middle classes to sell to. 
   Let me close by saying a word about enforcement. The core labor standards and the environmental obligations are on a par with every other provision in this bill, every other. Any person can file a petition if there is a failure to enforce. We have the power of oversight, including subpoena power, if this administration fails to enforce. 
   We have worked with Peru to bring their legal structure into compliance with ILO standards. There has been reference to a recent mining strike, and we worked with the Peru Government to change their rules regarding what it takes to have a strike. Also, they are working now to determine who is, within ILO rules, the proper authority to declare a strike legal or not. 
   This Peru FTA is a victory. It's a breakthrough. It's a first step in a new trade policy. Our job is to lead, to build on that history, not to retreat from it.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (MEDICARE, MEDICAID, AND SCHIP EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, it has become clear, not only to my colleagues in Congress, but also to the American people, that the intransigence of President Bush and his supporters in the House and Senate have made it difficult to advance long-needed bills to improve Medicare and expand the Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   The bill we are considering today in no way reflects negotiations with the Senate on the CHAMP Act that the House approved with a bi-partisan majority on August 1st, and the Senate's Medicare and SCHIP priorities. Rather, it is a skinny health extenders package that generally extends some provisions in current law for only 6 months. 
   Shoring up Medicare from years of neglect under the Republican Congress and expanding the Children's Health Insurance Program to cover 10 million low-income children are top priorities for me and the New Democratic Majority in Congress. That is why the House approved the CHAMP Act of 2007 to eliminate the scheduled Medicare physician payment cuts for the next 2 years and expand the Children's Health Insurance Program to cover 10 million low-income children nationwide. The only reason that the legislation we approved in August to improve the Medicare and SCHIP programs has not been signed into law is because President Bush and his allies in Congress oppose it. 
   There are several provisions of importance back home that I wish to recognize. We were able to keep in the health extenders bill a moratorium on cuts to school-based Medicaid services that the Administration has proposed. We have included a 6-month extension of a wage-reclassification program in the Medicare program, and have provided funding to extend the Special Diabetes Program for research, treatment and prevention of diabetes through September 30, 2009. 
   Unfortunately, imperative improvements to the Medicare program have been dropped from the bill. Improvements approved in the House in August include mental health parity for seniors, making prevention more accessible by eliminating 
   co-pays and deductibles for preventative services like mammograms and colonoscopy screenings, and expanding programs that help low-income seniors pay for their health care and prescription drugs. 
   The Children's Health Insurance expansion that has been dropped from the bill would have extended children's health insurance to enroll 6 million kids that are currently eligible for the program and not yet enrolled. That's in addition to the 6 million low-income children already receiving health care under the SCHIP program nationwide, including 55,000 kids in my home state of Michigan whose parents make between $20,535 and $41,300 a year. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the short-term extensions in the legislation before us today, and to join me in addressing long-needed reforms to Medicare and SCHIP in the new year.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (MORTGAGE FORGIVENESS DEBT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation. On the Democratic side, we've been emphasizing the importance of fairness in the code, of equity in the code, the ability to go home, meet our constituents, look them squarely in the eye and say that we're taking steps to make the Tax Code more equitable. And this legislation is a step in that direction, and an important one so a loss isn't taxable when it should not be. So this is one step, an important step, towards meeting the subprime mortgage crisis. 
   My home State of Michigan has very much suffered from this phenomenon, and I'm glad that we're taking this step today. 
   As mentioned, also included in this legislation is a 7-year extension of the deduction for mortgage insurance premiums. This is also necessary. What it does is to level the playing field among the products of mortgages; and this will be helpful, especially helpful now, in view of the crisis with these mortgages. 
   Let me just say a word about the payment. There's been some comment about the pay-for, and I mean to say this charitably. I think this pay-for is better than, much better than no pay-for. And we've been having too much, in recent years, legislation that proceeded without any pay-for at all. And this is an effort to be fiscally responsible, and I think it does so in an effective and an equitable way. 
   I urge support for this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (ANDEAN TRADE PREFERENCE ACT EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - June 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, as we proceed, it should be clear. We're talking now about the Andean Trade Preference Act, and we're not talking about the free trade agreements that have been discussed here. 
   In my view, whether one supports or opposes any of those free trade agreements, it would be counterproductive for someone to vote against extension of the ATPA for 8 months. 
   This relates, as mentioned, to the four nations. The original ATPA was passed in 1991, and it was expanded and  extended through a voice vote in the year 2001. 
   I think it should be emphasized that, basically, our trade relationship with these four nations is more complementary than it is competitive. That's a crucial issue. And if you exclude oil and oil products, our trade balance, our relationship, is essentially balanced in the range of 10- to $11 billion that we export and they export, if you exclude oil, which is not covered by the ATPA. 
   The Andean countries are a steadily growing market for U.S. goods, and that meant there was an increase, a rather substantial one, in 2005 over 2004. 
   Let me touch briefly on issues that have been discussed regarding the ATPA. First, apparel. The Andean Trade Preference Act requires the use of U.S. yarns in fabrics, so it isn't a one-way street. And it's somewhat technical, but if you include, if you look at the source of the fabric, essentially the U.S. has made clear that we're not going to be left out in the cold. 
   In terms of crops, whether they're fruit or vegetable crops, the trade is far more seasonal. In that sense, the trade is far more complementary than it is competitive. And so it's been of mutual interest to have this Andean Trade Preference Act. And that's why it was passed originally with broad support. It was extended with broad support. There was controversy last time because it was tied to TPA, and it essentially gave different treatment to Bolivia and Ecuador that this bill does not do. 
   So it's also, I think, because of the complementariness of this agreement that it has had broad support in this country, and that's true in good parts of the management ranks as well as the labor ranks. 
   There's been reference here to drugs, and that's been a mixed picture. But I think there is evidence that the ATPA, which was originally passed as part of a drug eradication strategy, has had some positive impact in several countries, much less so I think in Colombia than in Bolivia and Peru. 
   If this is not renewed, I think it would be mutually disadvantageous. I think, because of the mutuality of this agreement, the way it's worked out, that we should pass it. 
   And I close by emphasizing we're talking today about the renewal, or I should say the extension, of the ATPA for 8 months. We're not talking about free trade agreements. I strongly urge approval of this 8-month extension.

   Mr. LEVIN. I want to be clear; we're voting on the Andean Trade Preference Act, we are not voting on FTAs. We are not voting for a bridge to other agreements, we're voting on the merits of the extension of this Trade Preference Act. 
   It has basically worked. On this side, we're opposed to one-way trade agreements. This has been a two-way passage for those countries and for this country. 
   Our trade, if you include oil not covered by the Trade Preference Act, has essentially been in balance. We should extend this on its own merits. 
   In terms of asparagus, if you look at the facts, it shows that these agreements are basically complementary and not competitive. 
   I urge support of this extension, as I said, on its own merits, not because anyone is trying to use this as a path to anything else. 
   Vote ``yes'' on this. Be clear. This has been a two-way street, which this side of the aisle has insisted on as a basic part of American trade policy, and we will continue to do that, building upon it with a new model of trade. 
   I urge a strong vote for this extension.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2316, the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, as well as H.R. 2317, the Lobbying Transparency Act. 
   When the new Democratic Congress convened on January 4, our first action was the approval of a sweeping package of changes to restore the integrity and fiscal responsibility of the House of Representatives. While these reforms represented the most significant ethics and lobbying revisions in decades, we promised that this would be just the first step in ending the cozy relationships between Congress and special interest lobbyists. Today we take the next important step. 
   The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act H.R. 2316 mandates quarterly disclosure of lobbying reports; ends the K Street Project of Members and staff influencing employment decisions of private entities for partisan political gain; increases disclosure of lobbyists' contributions to lawmakers; and establishes an online, searchable public database of lobbyist disclosure information. 
   One of the most important provisions of this lobbying reform package is the Lobbying Transparency Act, H.R. 2317. This legislation requires a registered lobbyist who also serves as a fundraiser to disclose the campaign checks that he or she solicits or ``bundles.'' 
   When lobbyists also act as campaign fundraisers, a possible conflict of interest arises, making it all the more necessary to allow for greater public awareness as to their actions and treatment. 
   Reforming the way that lobbyists and Members of Congress do business is the right thing to do not only because it will help to restore the trust of the American people in their institution of Congress, but also because doing so has a very real impact in putting the power back into the hands of the public. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2316 and H.R. 2317.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, voting ``no'' today will not bring home the troops during the next four months. The President is determined that the troops remain during this period. The danger is that cutting the funds could leave our troops in Iraq without the necessary equipment, including equipment vital for their safety. It is so difficult to watch the deaths of so many brave American soldiers. Until we can force the President to bring them home, we must give them the equipment they need to keep them safe. 
   So de-funding this supplemental will not shorten the war but could endanger the safety of our men and women in uniform. This is the issue confronting those of us, like myself, who actively opposed going to war in the first place 4 years ago, and who have voted time and again since then to press the White House and the Iraqi government to achieve a number of key benchmarks so our troops can come home. The Iraqi government has to finally step up and make some difficult political decisions and end the sectarian violence that is tearing their country apart. 
   The benchmarks contained in this bill are important, but they would be much more effective if they were backed up by a realistic timetable for the redeployment of our troops if the benchmarks are not met. The House and Senate approved just such a bill last month, but the President vetoed it and there were not enough votes in either the House or the Senate to override the President. Everyone should understand that it was not for lack of Democratic votes that we were unable to force the President to change direction on Iraq. The problem is that it takes a two-thirds vote of the House and Senate to override a Presidential veto and only a handful of Republicans were willing to vote with us. 
   This bill contains funds to provide our troops with body armor, vehicles designed to withstand improvised explosive devices, countermeasures to roadside bombs and mines, and medical care to treat their injuries. Again, voting no on the bill today won't force the President to withdraw our troops from Iraq; it just means our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan won't get the resources they need to protect themselves. Voting no would also cut off funding needed to sustain our military and political efforts in Afghanistan. This is an area that many of us feel deserves more attention and resources, not less. 
   It is critical that today's vote is not the end of this debate. The funds provided for Iraq in this bill run only through September. In the weeks ahead, there will be other opportunities for Congress to change the direction of this war, to hold the Iraqi government and President Bush accountable, and bring our troops home. The legislation we need to debate and pass is one that essentially deauthorizes our current military involvement in Iraq and provide a responsible timeline for the orderly redeployment of our forces. I regret that this is not the bill before us today, but we will have this debate in September. At that time, I hope that more of our Republican colleagues will join us in voting to change the President's policy on Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Water Resources Development Act and urge its passage by the House. I want to compliment Chairman Oberstar and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for making early passage of this legislation a priority. The last Water Resources bill was signed into law over 6 years ago by President Clinton. It is Congress' job to renew this law every 2 years, but for whatever reason, we have been unable to reach agreement with the other body and get a final bill to the President for his signature. 
   The Nation's water and environmental infrastructure problems won't wait forever. We need to overcome our past differences and move this bill to upgrade and modernize our Federal programs relating to navigation, flood damage reduction, shoreline protection, dam safety, water supply, recreation, and environmental restoration. 
   I want to express my thanks to Chairman Oberstar for including a project I requested to authorize Federal funding to implement restoration projects in Lake St. Clair. In the past, Lake St. Clair has been described as ``the forgotten lake.'' No longer. Today, many of my constituents refer to Lake St. Clair as the ``Heart of the Great Lakes.'' We need to protect and restore it. Lake St. Clair is not the largest body of water in the Great Lakes System, but it is absolutely one of the most heavily used portions of the Lakes in terms of fishing, boating and drinking water. 
   Two years ago, the Corps of Engineers completed a comprehensive management plan for Lake St. Clair and the St. Clair River. Congress paid for this plan. The recommendations contained in the management plan will help shape Lake St. Clair's future, but only if they are implemented. Having come this far, we can't let the report and its recommendations become another study that sits on a shelf and gathers dust. Everyone, including the federal government, has to step forward and take responsibility for turning these recommendations into action. 
   Again, I support the bill before the House and urge its adoption.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 7321, AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. And not from all. We hope for a bipartisan effort. We worked with the White House. It is interesting that now we face opposition, though the White House has said action is necessary; the President-elect has said action is necessary; the Speaker has said action is necessary; the majority leader in the Senate has said action is necessary. And now what many are saying on the other side in this House is bankruptcy, chapter 11. Chapter 11 will lead to chapter 7. 
   I just want to quote from a few documents that say that. A recent study by the Anderson Economic Group says, ``It would be four times more expensive for a bankruptcy proceeding than a Federal bridge loan.'' 
   Also J.P. Morgan, I want to read this, their analysis: ``Without government support, we believe auto suppliers will tighten terms, causing Big Three bankruptcy filings. Due to a potential sales decline and fixed-cost absorption issues, we expect a chapter 11 reorganization would rapidly move to liquidation.'' 
   Look, this is complex. But what isn't complex is the essential continuation of a domestic auto industry. 
   Mr. Dreier says don't play favorites. Winners and losers. Doing nothing to help the domestic industry is playing favorites. 
   So I suggest we look at what is involved here. This bill proposes strong oversight. All parties will come to the table, all parties, without chapter 11, without chapter 7; all parties will be brought to the table and taxpayers will be protected. 
   Let me just say what is at stake here. We are talking about millions of people. We are talking about people who work in the factories and people who manage them. We are talking about suppliers. If one of the Big Three goes down, the supplier network will be devastated, and all those who sell automobiles and all those who are involved indirectly in the economy. 
   So I just urge, the time for rhetoric is gone. Why is this going so fast, Mr. Dreier? It is because there is an international economic and national credit crisis. Every country that has an automobile industry is now helping them. Rushing? It doesn't matter whether they are conservative or liberal or socialist; all of the other countries are moving to help.

   Essentially what is being proposed by those who oppose this is paralysis. We  need action to help bridge. They have started on restructuring. They have a long ways to go. It is up to us to provide this bridge to the future. These domestic companies are moving on electric cars, on hybrids. Don't shut them down when they want to move ahead.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (TEMPORARY TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, this legislation reflects the priorities of the new majority in Congress: middle-class tax relief, fiscal discipline, and tax equity. 
   Income inequality is dramatically increasing in our country. Between 2004 and 2005, the average annual income of the top 1 percent increased by $120,000, while the average income for all the other 90 percent of households increased by just $550. 
   In the face of this, we need to be able to look our constituents in the eye and tell them we are working to make the Tax Code fair and equitable. 
   The principle in taxing private investment fund managers or ``carried interest'' is basic. 
   If you are investing your own money, you should receive the capital gains tax rate; if you are providing the service of managing other people's money, you should pay the ordinary income tax rate. 
   Some argue that fund managers deserve capital gains treatment to align their interests with investors or because ``carried interest'' is risky. Many other forms of compensation are risky, and they are taxed at the ordinary income tax rate. When a company gives its CEO stock options, he or she pays ordinary income tax rates when they exercise those options. Real estate agents only make money if they actually sell a house. Authors receive a portion of their book's profits. Waiters get tips based on the quality of the service they provide. All of these people pay ordinary income tax rates on their compensation. 
   Estimates are that there is currently around $130 billion in carried interest at stake. Investment managers currently take home $110 billion and when we close the tax advantage, they will take home $85 billion--a pretty significant reward for their services. 
   A fund manager's paying a more appropriate tax rate will not curtail economic activity, innovation, or real estate development. Since investors are not affected, there is no reason to believe that the amount of capital available for investments in real estate development or start-up companies would be reduced. 
   This bill has the right priorities: It brings tax relief to tens of millions of middle-class families, it's paid for, and it makes our Tax Code more equitable. I urge my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the bill. I appreciate the hard work that Mr. Hoyer and others have done on this legislation. The bill before the House is a vast improvement over the administration's Protect America Act, which I strongly opposed last August. The legislation is also a significant improvement over the seriously flawed FISA legislation approved by the Senate earlier this year. In many respects, the bill before the House strikes a reasonable balance between giving the Government the tools it needs to protect U.S. national security and protecting Americans' constitutional rights. 
   In particular, I am pleased that the bill reaffirms that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is the exclusive legal means by which the Government may conduct surveillance. This stands in stark contrast to the Bush administration's warrantless surveillance program. I also support the provisions of this bill that protect Americans traveling abroad. They need no longer leave their constitutional protections at home. 
   At the end of the day, I oppose this bill because of the provisions that would confer retroactive immunity on the telecommunications companies that participated in the Bush administration's warrantless surveillance program. We are a nation of laws, and it sets a dangerous precedent for Congress to approve a law that dismisses ongoing court cases simply on the basis that the companies can show that the administration told them that its warrantless surveillance program was legal. A program is not legal just because the administration claims that it is. The retroactive immunity provisions in this bill shield the administration from accountability for its actions. The goal here is not to harm the telecommunications carriers, but rather to get to the truth of what happened. A much better alternative would be to grant indemnification to the companies and go forward with the trials. 
   Irrespective of the outcome of today's vote, we need a full accounting of the administration's surveillance program, and the bill before the House provides for an Inspectors General audit describing all Federal programs involving warrantless surveillance conducted since September 11, 2001. The audit is to be completed within 1 year. Congress must get to the bottom of what happened and prevent it from happening again. It is essential that Congress follow up on the audit's findings with robust oversight.

   On the contrary, it's the people's will that is breaking down the wall of a tragically mistaken policy. It has become painfully obvious that the White House is incapable of changing course in Iraq. 
   The Bush administration's talking points about the situation change from week to week, but the fundamental strategy remains the same. The President has determined our troops will remain in Iraq no matter what. The reality is that the government of Iraq is not meeting the benchmark. 
   Six months into the surge, there is no indication that the Iraqis are coming together to make the political decisions necessary to end the sectarian violence that's tearing the country apart. They are unlikely to do so as long as the U.S. military commitment remains open-ended.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   It has become painfully obvious that the White House is incapable of changing course in Iraq. The Bush administration's talking points about the situation in Iraq change from week to week, but the fundamental strategy remains the same. The President is determined that our troops will remain in Iraq no matter what. 
   The latest White House talking points are aimed at getting the American people to believe that the surge in Iraq just began a couple weeks ago, instead of 6 months ago. In fact, the President announced the surge back on January 10, and the troop escalation began in early February. 
   The White House is emphasizing today that it finds that Iraq is making ``satisfactory'' progress in some areas, such as the cooperation between U.S. forces and tribal sheiks in Anbar province as well as the formation of a Constitutional Review Committee, although the constitutional review itself is not complete. The reality is that the Iraqi Government has not approved a law to share Iraq's oil wealth. It has not enacted legislation to reform the De-Ba'athification laws. It has not disarmed the militias. It has not made progress on ensuring that Iraqi Security Forces are providing even-handed enforcement of the law. It has not made progress toward increasing the number of Iraqi Security Forces units capable of operating independently. It has not made satisfactory progress toward establishing a date for provincial elections. 
   In the past 6 months, nearly 600 of our troops have died. More than 13,000 Iraqis have died. The level of violence in Iraq has not decreased. The violence and attacks have  simply shifted away from places where our forces are concentrated. 
   Six months into the surge, there is no indication that the Iraqis are coming together to make the political decisions necessary to end the sectarian violence that is tearing their country apart. Time has shown that whatever small chance there is of the Iraqi factions coming together, it will not happen as long as the U.S. military commitment in Iraq remains open-ended. We need to change course. The bill before the House does just that. It requires the Department of Defense to begin a phased and orderly redeployment of our combat troops from Iraq starting in 120 days of enactment, with the troop reduction to be complete by April 1, 2008. No other way has worked to convince the Iraqis that they need to step up and reach a political settlement to end the sectarian violence.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution before the House. 
   We need to send a clear bipartisan message to the White House. There is little support in this Congress for deepening our open-ended military commitment in Iraq by sending an additional 21,000 troops into this conflict. 
   The debate we are having today is about the future of our Nation's policy in Iraq, so my main focus will not be to catalog the litany of the administration's past grave mistakes and misstatements over the last 4 years. At the same time, as a lesson for the future, it is important to remember that the war in Iraq was the first application of the Bush Doctrine. This policy was unveiled by the President in his commencement speech at West Point in June 2002 and made policy a few months later in the administration's 2002 National Security Strategy. 
   The administration's doctrine stressed preemptive attack, U.S. military superiority, and U.S. unilateral action. This flawed policy has proven to be disastrous. It has destabilized Iraq, and threatens to undermine the stability of the entire region. It blinded the administration to the Pandora's box it was opening when it invaded Iraq in search of weapons of mass destruction that did not exist and 9/11 terrorists that were not there. 
   Far from strengthening U.S. security, this misguided doctrine has put our Nation's vital interests at greater risk. The elevation of unilateralism has helped erode our Nation's standing in the world. The released NIE Estimate for Iraq underscores just how flawed the administration's doctrine has been. Among the key judgment, I quote, ``Iraqi society's growing polarization, the persistent weakening of the security forces and of the state in general.'' And again I quote, ``Extremists continue to act as a very effective accelerator for what has become a self-sustaining intersectarian struggle between Shia and Sunnis.'' And now I quote again. ``The Intelligence Community judges that the term `civil war' does not adequately capture the complexity of the conflict in Iraq.'' 
   The judgments of the National Intelligence Estimate reinforce the view that a military solution in Iraq is not possible. The administration has attempted troop surges in the past. They haven't worked. Adding another 21,000 American troops will not put an end to violence and instability in Iraq. The only chance to do that is for Iraq's leaders and factions to come together and begin the difficult process of political compromise and reconciliation. 
   I believe that announcing the orderly redeployment of U.S. forces is the best way to put pressure on the factions in Iraq to come together and make these difficult choices. 
   This resolution is straightforward. It states clearly and unambiguously that Congress does not support the President's plan. It supports our military personnel but not a further military escalation. 
   Some have said it is not serious because it is nonbinding. Others have said the resolution emboldens our enemies and hurts the troops. How does it embolden our enemies or hurt the troops for this Congress to disapprove continuing a strategy that is not working? 
   The resolution we are debating today is nonbinding, but is not nonconsequential. I hope the administration will hear the clear bipartisan message we are sending and change course. 
   The question today before the House is whether or not we agree with the President's plan to send 21,000 additional troops to Iraq to referee a growing civil war. I do not agree with this escalation. I urge all my colleagues to join in calling on the President to change course in Iraq

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (APPROVING RENEWAL OF IMPORT RESTRICTIONS CONTAINED IN THE BURMESE FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY ACT OF 2003 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The bill before us will renew the import ban on products of Burma. While there can be concerns about the universal effectiveness of unilateral sanctions, Burma clearly presents a unique situation. There is overwhelming evidence that Burma continues to blatantly disregard human rights and suppress democracy, and it is therefore important to continue the import ban for another year. 
   Under the military regime that rules Burma today, Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi remains under house arrest, which the military regime extended yet again in May. She has been detained for 12 of the last 18 years without being charged or tried. The government is also detaining almost 2,000 other civic activists indefinitely and without charge. The detention of Aung San Suu Kyi and these other activists would be reason enough to renew the sanctions. Unfortunately, there are many more examples of human rights abuses in Burma. 
   Government security forces killed and injured hundreds of demonstrators during their suppression of pro-democracy protests in September. These forces have also committed other extrajudicial killings, as well as disappearances, rape, and torture in the past year. 
   Regime-supported organizations and militias have harassed, abused and detained human rights and pro-democracy activists. The government regularly tramples on the Burmese people's privacy and their freedom of speech, press, assembly, association, religion and movement. 
   Violence and discrimination against women and ethnic minorities; recruitment of child soldiers; and trafficking in persons, especially women and girls, persist. Workers' rights remain restricted and forced labor, including that of children, continues to be a problem. 
   The military regime's handling of tropical cyclone Nargis this past spring also underscores the poor human rights situation in Burma. The regime did little to warn citizens about the calamitous cyclone. Almost 150,000 people are dead or missing. Nor did the regime provide adequate assistance to hundreds of thousands who survived the cyclone. 
   While dozens of nations, including our Nation, responded immediately to the cyclone and attempted to provide humanitarian assistance, the government initially denied them permission to enter the country. It continues to severely limit their ability to provide assistance. 
   As a result, the Burmese people unnecessarily suffer. In light of Burma's continuing dismal record and the lack of any concrete steps to provide basic human rights to its citizens or to implement basic democratic reforms, I urge my colleagues to extend the ban on the import of Burmese products for another year. 
   I also hope the European Union, ASEAN and other nations around the world will continue to work with the U.S. to increase pressure on the Burmese regime. This week's ASEAN meetings in Singapore offer the opportunity to do so.

   Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time with the hope that we will pass this. And I think Mr. Crowley noted the efforts of our late colleague and close friend, Tom Lantos. He paved the way on this, and I think we need to follow in that path.

   Mr. LEVIN. I enthusiastically support this bill. The housing crisis has hit home, hundreds of thousands of homes throughout the country. There is a provision that's going to allow local governments to act. 
   I met a couple of months ago with mayors and city managers in the district I represent in MaComb and Oakland counties. They talk about the impact of foreclosures on the family in the house, on the neighbors, and on the city. And now we're going to provide some assistance for local governments to respond. 
   I trust them to act wisely. I trust them to act wisely. 
   There's another provision in this bill that is important for industrial America. In the stimulus bill, we provided some money for incentives for growth in industry but not for companies that are currently not profitable. We correct that problem in this bill so that those companies that are not currently profitable but are trying to grow, as is so critical in the manufacturing sector, have some help. 
   This bill is a tribute to Mr. Frank and the committee, to Mr. Rangel and our committee that has worked, the minority included on many provisions, and I think is a tribute to the leadership of this Congress that is determined to act when the crisis opens up. 
   I hope there will be a bipartisan vote for this. American families deserve it.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (NATIONAL HIGHWAY BRIDGE RECONSTRUCTION AND INSPECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Madam Chairman. I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by my colleague from Michigan, Mrs. Miller. 
   Carbon fiber, which is a very lightweight material, is sturdier, less susceptible to corrosion, and more durable than steel. The Michigan DOT has constructed a bridge featuring carbon fiber technology in 2001, and is planning to build 3 more bridges in the next two years. The use of carbon fibers and a new ultra high strength concrete could result in a 100-year sustainable bridge. 
   The institution pioneering this technology is Lawrence Technological University, which is located in my district, but is very much a regional asset in southeast Michigan. 
   This amendment requires the Secretary of Transportation to study the costs and benefits of using carbon fiber composite materials in bridge projects and report back to Congress within 180 days of the bill's enactment. This will allow us to review those findings in time for next year's reauthorization of federal transportation programs. 
   Madam Chairman, using advanced technologies like carbon fiber in bridge construction is a classic investment decision: if we pay a bit more today, we can save money ``down the road'' on maintenance and repairs. 
   A cost-benefit analysis of this investment from the Department of Transportation will help us determine how good an investment this will be, and I urge all my colleagues to support the amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (RELATING TO THE CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5724, UNITED STATES-COLOMBIA TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Trade policy under the Bush administration has been badly off track. The approach of the administration and the then-Republican majority in Congress was to go their own way and dismiss bipartisan effort, starting with a side letter to the Jordan FTA thwarting enforcement of worker rights provisions negotiated by the Clinton administration. 
   In the cases of Morocco, Bahrain, and Oman FTAs, it was left to Democrats to negotiate with governments of those countries to bring their laws into compliance with international labor standards before a Congressional vote, with no help from the administration. 
   And we all remember CAFTA, where the administration's approach was go it alone from the beginning through the end, with false claims that the other nations were already in compliance with international standards. 
   And last year, with the loss of a congressional majority, the Bush administration was forced to include fully enforceable labor and environmental standards in the Peru FTA. And when Democrats pressed for Peru to bring into compliance with the language of the agreement, the administration attacked Democrats and refused to even participate in the changes that Peru made in its legal structure. 
   At that time Democrats made clear that Colombia was different from Peru with the level of violence against workers, impunity from prosecution, and laws that did not meet international standards, and that sustainable progress was required before consideration. The administration kept on insisting that the status quo was good enough and has done nothing to address these concerns. 
   Urged by both the House and Senate Democratic leadership not to proceed with the Colombia FTA under present circumstances, the administration decided once again to go its own way. This rule reflects the Speaker's response to assert a congressional role on international trade under the Constitution of the United States of America.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act. 
   I do so because this legislation is necessary to protect 25 million middle class families from a tax that was never intended to apply to them, including more than 53,000 families in my district. 
   But the bill before us will also increase the Federal deficit by more than $64 billion. 
   Earlier this year, we passed an AMT patch in a fiscally responsible manner. We paid for it by closing loopholes and improving the fairness of our tax code. 
   The minority argued that we should just borrow more money, ignoring the ballooning deficit and mounting debt, and the Bush administration's reckless fiscal policies. At no time did we hear the minority oppose our offsets on the merits. At no time did they argue we should not close these loopholes. 
   They just engaged in absurd ideological arguments and claimed that closing a loophole is a tax increase. 
   Today we will take this action to protect 25 million taxpayers because it's the necessary thing to do.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Chairm an, over 25 years ago I was assistant administrator of AID, running the population program. This issue of fungibility came up. We were assiduously implementing the Hyde amendment. So we tried through accounting mechanisms to address the fungibility issue. 
   So then it was said that's not enough. So then Mexico City was proposed and implemented. 
   This is not a repeal of the Mexico City policy. Whatever one thinks of it, it is not.     
   This isn't about abortion, and it really isn't about fungibility. 
   Mr. Wolf, if you take your position far enough, we should give no military assistance to any country that has a policy on family planning that you don't like because in that sense it is fungible. But that carries it beyond a rule of reason. And what this proposal does is to apply a rule of reason, as has been s aid, to contraceptives provided in kind to people who need these contraceptives. That is the long and the short of this. And, essentially, you are the ones who are blurring the issue, not us. And if you take your logic to the extreme, you will tie this appropriation process for numerous countries into knots. This is trying to untie a knot, if you want to put it that way, only in the sense of providing products in kind to people who need them. And if you say you are for family planning and you vote otherwise , you are voting against family planning.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEVIN. (FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3540 extends the financing and spending authority of the Airport and Airway trust fund. 
   The trust fund taxes and spending authority are scheduled to expire on October 1, 2007. H.R. 3540 extends these taxes at current rates for 3 months. H.R. 3540 was unanimously reported out of the Ways and Means Committee with bipartisan support. This bill will keep the Airport and Airway trust fund taxes and operations in place until the long-term FAA Reauthorization Act is signed into law. 
   Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate--September 21, 2007 
   H.R. 3540  
   Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2007--As ordered reported by the House Committee on Ways and Means on September 18, 2007 
   Summary: H.R. 3540 would extend, through the end of calendar year 2007, the existing taxes that are dedicated to the Airport and Airway Trust Fund and are set to expire on September 30, 2007. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates that enacting H.R. 3540 would have no effect on revenues relative to the current baseline projection for taxes dedicated to the trust fund. 
   The bill also would extend, through the end of calendar year 2007, the authority to expend amounts from the trust fund (including interest) for major programs administered by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). CBO estimates that implementing the bill would increase discretionary spending by $3.1 billion over the 2008-2012 period by authorizing appropriation of revenues expected to be collected during  the first three months of fiscal year 2008. Enacting the bill would not affect direct spending. 
   JCT has determined that the bill contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). 
   Estimated costs to the Federal Government: The estimated budgetary impact of H.R. 3540 is shown in the following table. The costs of this legislation fall within budget function 400 (transportation). 
     By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--     2007  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012   SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION 
    Spending from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund under Current Law:    Authorization Level \1\   11,846   0   0   0   0   0     Estimated Outlays   12,310   4,714   1,944   744   214   35     Proposed Changes:     Estimated Authorization Level \2\   0   3,091   0   0   0   0     Estimated Outlays   0   2,782   278   31   0   0     Spending from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund under H.R. 3540:     Estimated Authorization Level   11,846   3.091   0   0   0   0     Estimated Outlays   12,310   7,496   2,222   775   214   35   
   Basis of estimate: For this estimate, JCT and CBO assume that H.R. 3540 will be enacted near the start of fiscal year 2008 and that appropriation actions consistent with the bill will be taken in fiscal year 2008. 
   REVENUES 
   The existing excise taxes that are dedicated to the Airport and Airway Trust Fund are scheduled to expire on September 30, 2007. The taxes consist of levies on transportation of persons and property by air, use of international air facilities, and use of aviation fuels and are estimated to generate revenues of over $11 billion in fiscal year 2007. The bill would extend all of the taxes at the current rate through the end of calendar year 2007. 
   Under the projection rules in section 257 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, which are followed for Congressional scorekeeping purposes, estimates of the revenue effects of the legislation assume that expiring excise taxes dedicated to a trust fund are extended indefinitely and are measured relative to a baseline that assumes that the expiring excise taxes are extended at the same rates that would be in place immediately before their scheduled expiration. As a result, JCT estimates no change in revenue from the three-month extension in this bill.
