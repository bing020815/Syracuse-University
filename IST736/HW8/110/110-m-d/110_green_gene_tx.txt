<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank my Georgia colleague and member of our Energy and Commerce Committee for yielding to me. 
   And I stand here in strong support of H.R. 6578, the Consumer Energy Supply Act for 2008, introduced by my good friend from Texas and a leader in the House on energy issues, NICK LAMPSON, as well as my esteemed colleague on our committee, Representative ED MARKEY of Massachusetts. 
   Now, I have to admit, I agree--we need everything, Mr. Speaker. We need to drill more. And frankly, my Michigan colleague, maybe we ought to drill in the part of Lake Michigan that we are not allowed to drill in, since Canada drills there and probably exports that gas to us. 
   But this bill is so important because this is something we can do immediately. Today's rising petroleum gasoline prices are taking a toll on our hardworking families, even in our district that produce a lot of refined products. 
   And let's be clear. There are no quick fixes or easy answers to the high price of gas. Prices are set by complex factors like climbing world demand and geopolitical events. 
   But for the problems within our control, the proper management of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or the SPR, we need to take steps necessary to protect the American consumers' interest. 
   I do not believe the current administration has properly managed the SPR. The SPR exists to protect us during the energy crisis, and is almost full to its 227 million barrel capacity. 
   But while the cost per barrel of oil skyrocketed, the administration continued to purchase high-priced oil off the market to put in the SPR, limiting the amount of oil available. Granted, it is a small amount, but it would still allow for that additional oil to be on the market. 
   But Congress fixed that when it sent legislation to the President. And I supported it and it was signed in law to suspend oil additions to the SPR until the end of the year, unless the price of oil falls below $75. 
   I also believe that when oil prices are very high, we should release SPR oil into the market to increase supply, as the Department of Energy did in response to Hurricane Katrina. 
   Consistent with the Government Accountability Office recommendation to add heavy crude to our national reserves, this bill would modernize SPR by requiring DOE----

   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. By requiring the DOE to conduct the sale or exchange within 6 months the 70 million barrels of light crude for heavy crude. The GAO found that refineries who, if forced to rely solely on SPR oil during an emergency, would experience a 5 percent reduction in their production capacity. This bill will increase the ability of refineries to respond to supply disruption, and optimize our SPR's effectiveness. 
   This release would have an immediate impact on the market, reducing the prices at the pump, and easing the effects of energy market speculation. 
   This is a good first step. And I urge my colleagues, make this step, because we do have a lot of other steps we have to make.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008.  
   This important piece of legislation outlines the United States' efforts to combat the devastating effects of AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis on our global community. 
   I am extremely encouraged that this bill declares Tuberculosis control a major objective of U.S. foreign assistance programs--particularly, that this bill will encourage the development of a TB vaccine. 
   TB is the leading killer of people with HIV/AIDS, and the explosion of drug-resistant TB in sub-Saharan Africa threatens to halt and roll back our progress in combating both diseases. 
   In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that 1.7 milion people died of tuberculosis in 2006, with 200,000 dying from HIV-associated TB. 
   The TB germ is constantly changing and drug resistant strains have been found in 28 countries on 6 continents. 
   Our current TB Vaccine, BCG, is more than 85 years old and is not compatible against pulmonary TB, which accounts for most TB cases. 
   Even right here in the United States, it is estimated that 10 to 15 million people in the U.S. have latent TB. 
   Therefore, developing a vaccine has important implications both internationally and domestically. 
   Studies also show that the ten year economic benefits of a TB vaccine that was only 75 percent effective could result in an estimated savings of $25 billion; no one can deny that this is a significant amount. 
   This legislation is a good start in our critical battle against TB and we as a legislative body need to continue to work on TB efforts both internationally and right here at home. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
   Mr. BLUMENAUER, Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased that Congress has come together in a bipartisan and bicameral way to address the devastating impact ofHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. The Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act reaffirms our commitment to fighting the causes and the spread of these terrible and largely preventable diseases. 
   Treating HIV/AIDS is more than taking prescription drugs. I applaud my colleagues in the House and Senate, particularly Chairman BERMAN and Ranking Member ROS-LEHTINEN, for recognizing that fighting HIV/AIDS means treating the person and not just the disease. The latest breakthrough medicines are worthless without access to food, water, and security. 
   This legislation makes the connection and contains an important section to address barriers that limit the start of and adherence to treatment services. There is specific recognition of the direct linkages between efforts to treat HIV/AIDS and nutrition, income security, and drinking water and sanitation programs. 
   We cannot treat HIV/AIDS without clean water. There is terrible irony in providing patients with advanced antiretroviral agents, and asking them to wash the life-saving pills down with a glass of water that may infect them with a life-threatening, water-bourne illness. I am particularly proud that my simple amendment to add safe drinking water to the list of related activities vital to treatment is included here. This small addition shapes our approach to treatment in a realistic and profoundly positive way. 
   Much more must be done to deal with the global HIV/AIDS pandemic and the problem of lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitization, the world's leading preventable cause of death. The recognition of these important linkages is a critical step forward in our understanding and treatment of these diseases. 
   This bill is an important part of the tribute to our late colleagues, Chairman Lantos and Chairman Hyde.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this conference agreement to reauthorize important user fee programs at the Food and Drug Administration and enact critical drug safety reforms at the agency. 
   This legislation is the result of intense negotiations between the House and Senate, whose negotiators have worked tirelessly to reach consensus on this legislation. They did so with a looming deadline of September 31, after which the user fee program would expire and many hard-working FDA scientists would likely lose their jobs. To reach a compromise, all parties to the negotiation had to give and take, but I am pleased that the product before us represents something we can all support. I would like to congratulate the negotiators on their success. 
   The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 makes important changes at the FDA to place a greater emphasis on post-market surveillance within the agency. The Risk, Evaluation, and Mitigation Strategy established by this bill would give the agency the authority to monitor drugs throughout their life-cycle for adverse events or other signs of safety concerns. A critical aspect of this strategy is the additional authority this bill gives the Secretary of HHS to mandate that drug manufacturers conduct post-market studies. 
   Under this bill, the additional post-market activities extend to the user fee programs that help fund the drug approval process. Specifically, this bill directs drug manufacturers utilizing the FDA's drug approval process to dedicate an additional $225 million over 5 years for postmarket surveillance activities at the FDA. This additional funding represents an important investment by the pharmaceutical industry in the FDA's post-market safety activities, while also ensuring that pre-market user fees are adequate to bring potentially life-saving medicines to market in a reasonable time. 
   There is no question that the labeling and liability language prompted a great deal of debate during conference negotiations, but one thing is clear: the Congress in no way intends to limit the ability of a patient injured by a drug to seek redress from our Nation's justice system. FDA should have the ability to require labeling changes, but that additional authority does not absolve the drug manufacturer of any duty to initiate labeling changes on their own when new data bears out the need for a change. The implementation of stronger drug safety authorities does not mean that drug companies get a free pass when their products harm consumers. I am pleased that the conference agreement makes this point perfectly clear. 
   This legislation also reauthorizes the Medical Device User Fee Act, as well as the Best Pharmaceuticals For Children Act and the Pediatric Research Equity Act, which help ensure that pharmaceuticals are tested for their effect on children. After all, we know that children are not simply smaller adults, and part of protecting America's children is knowing how best to treat them when they face health concerns. 
   I would like to thank our Chairman, Mr. DINGELL, and our Health Subcommittee Chairman, Mr. PALLONE, for their work on this important legislation, and encourage my colleagues to support this important bill. These necessary changes at the FDA will go a long way toward restoring the American public's confidence in the agency and its ability to ensure the safety of the Nation's drug supply.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my friend from Louisiana for allowing me to speak. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is no question this is a historic day. This bill will substantially increase fuel economy standards for the first time in over 20 years, increase energy efficiency requirements, and promote research and development of alternative sources. These are all worthy accomplishments, and the efforts of Chairman Dingell should be commended.     
   The only opportunity this Congress missed was to create a balanced energy policy that invests in our energy future without ignoring America's energy needs today. I believe as Democrats, we could have crafted a sensible energy policy that actually enhances our energy security, but that would require bringing all Democrats to the table, including those of us who represent districts that produce energy needed to heat our homes, fuel our vehicles, and generate our economic prosperity. 
   While some improvements from the previous bill, H.R. 3221, have been made, new additions that have not been thoroughly debated have been included and could have a negative impact on the cost of energy in our area. 
   For that reason, I must vote against the legislation and hope that we can instead vote on an energy bill that is focused on provisions we can agree on, such as a bill to increase CAFE standards, energy efficiency standards, and that would actually increase energy security in the United States. 
   I am particularly disappointed in the lack of discussion on the renewable fuel standard, RFS, which was not included in our House bill and was not moved through any regular process in the House of Representatives. It is premature to consider expanding the RFS until our current one is fully implemented, and we run the risk of negative environmental impacts, questionable greenhouse gas emissions, and increased food and energy prices with a focus on corn-based ethanol. 
   A sensible approach would have been to require RFS to include, prior to taking effect, a clear mechanism to reduce the mandate in case the environmental challenges, technological, or feasibility  of supply issues, or projected food price increases were impacted. 
   This bill includes tax provisions outside of those carefully negotiated earlier in H.R. 6 that actually tilt the competitive playing field for global energy resources against U.S.-based oil and gas companies and discourage the expansion of natural gas distribution systems. 
   There has been an effort to moderate some of the tax provisions passed early in August, particularly by retaining current deduction levels under section 199 for our Nation's independent producers. I am glad that happened, but I am concerned with the impact on my constituents and their electricity bills with a Federal renewable electricity standard, the RES. Under a one-size-fits-all mandate, Texas utilities may be forced to make payments to the Federal Government to meet a 20 percent target or a 15 percent target, or 11 percent, now we hear it is 11 percent, ultimately driving up costs for the utility, the electricity users. 
   I wish Congress would capitalize on this historic moment and actually make it to where we could pass an energy bill that would be bipartisan. We could instead have a more sensible bill that focused on the provisions we all agree on, increase CAFE standards and energy standards, and that would meet with Senate and Presidential approval.  
   Mr. Speaker, there is no question this is a truly historic day for Congress. This bill will substantially increase fuel economy standards for the first time in over 20 years, increase energy efficiency requirements, and promote research and development of alternative sources of energy. These are all worthy accomplishments and the efforts of the Chairman should be commended. 
   The only opportunity this Congress missed, Mr. Speaker, was to create a balanced energy policy that invests in our energy future without ignoring America's energy needs today. I believe as Democrats we can craft sensible-energy policy that actually enhances our energy security, but that would require bringing all Democrats to the table, including those of us who represent Districts that produce the energy needed to heat our homes, fuel our vehicles, and generate our economic prosperity. 
   I believe that day will come, but after reviewing some of the proposals contained in this legislation, it is clear we have a long way to go. While some improvements from H.R. 3221 have been made, new additions that have not been thoroughly debated by this House and that could have a negative impact on the cost of energy have been included. 
   For that reason, I must regrettably vote against this legislation and hope that we instead vote on an energy bill that is focused on the provisions we can all agree on--such as a bill to increase CAF&#201; and energy efficiency standards--and that will actually increase the energy security of the United States.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Chairman, I thank my colleague. And as an alumni of the Education and Labor Committee, I appreciate the time today. 
   Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of this legislation and oppose the substitute. I applaud the chairman and members of the Education and Labor Committee for their work on this bill. 
   We have a problem in our country. When I was growing up, we always heard the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, but we know now that we have a disparity between the richest and the poorest in our country that is getting bigger every day. 
   The Employee Free Choice Act gives employees the protections they need to form unions and provide mediation and arbitration for first contract disputes. This is the first step to try and lower that disparity, where people can organize together and actually improve their living standard. 
   I am pleased, also, that section 3 of this bill includes language that I have worked on for many years by incorporating language from our bill, H.R. 142, the Labor Relations First Contract Negotiation Act. The bill requires an employer and a union to go to Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, FMCS, for mediation for agreements not reached within 90 days or either party wishes to do so. 
   So we don't have these year-long discussions about trying to get a contract. If the FMCS is unable to bring the parties to agreement after 30 days of mediation, the dispute will be referred to arbitration, and the results of the arbitration will be binding on both parties for 2 years. 
   So we will see contracts, after we have the elections, where there are elections or card checks. We have seen numerous examples in the Houston area of elections taking place, and then there is a long delay in the negotiation process. 
   As a whole, this legislation is a huge victory for workers and employees across the country and can help us with the wage gap between the highest paid and the lowest paid in our country. Joining together in a union to bargain for better wages, benefits, and working conditions is the best opportunity for working people to get ahead and is a part of the true free enterprise system that we say we are for. 
   Today, good jobs are vanishing and health care coverage and retirement security are slipping out of reach. Employees who belong to unions earn 30 percent more than nonunion workers. They are 60 percent more likely to have employer-based insurance and four times more likely to have pensions.

   Employees who belong to unions earn 30 percent more than nonunion workers. 
   They are 60 percent more likely to have employer-provided health coverage and four times more likely to have pensions. 
   We need to ensure protections are in place to allow employees to form unions without harassment so that they can negotiate for the well being of themselves and their families. 
   Madam Chairman, this legislation will provide workers with these protections and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Employee Free Choice Act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to show my support for the House rules, as we are dealing with them today, but I am also calling for an independent investigating arm for the House of Representatives.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to lend my full support to these changes to our House Rules. 
   These rules are the foundation that will govern how this body operates, but also serves as a reflection of our collective values and character. 
   I have served almost 6 years on the House Ethics Committee. 
   I have seen more investigations than I care to in the last 6 years of Members on both sides of the aisle. 
   These rule changes should restore a tone of civility and honesty in this chamber and that is why I am supporting this package and urge all my colleagues to do the same. 
   However, I would like to raise an issue that is not contained in this package today. 
   I strongly believe that the House Ethics Committee needs an independent investigative office. 
   Currently, my colleagues on the Ethics Committee and I are tasked with determining whether rumors and innuendos have any merit to launch investigations that at times bring disgrace to this body and end the careers of our colleagues. 
   We are the Court of Congress, yet we serve as both the investigators and the judges of our colleagues. This is no easy task. 
   Those of us on this Committee have accepted this position and stand poised to enforce the Rules of the House and preserve the integrity of this body. 
   However, it would be beneficial to the Members of the Ethics Committee and this House if we had an independent investigation arm so we may have unbiased, thorough information regarding any accusation of impropriety by a Member of this body. 
   I believe this would help remove any partisan sentiments regarding origination of investigations and may help restore America's faith in our ability to enforce our rules. 
   With this information the Members of the Committee would then determine whether or not there is sufficient information to further the investigation, or take action on the issue before the Committee. 
   Allowing an independent investigating office to begin investigating then bring information to the Ethics Committee would not make our job easier, but it would help us have this nonpartisan information to do our job better. 
   I strongly support the changes proposed today, but I believe it is necessary for us to begin a dialogue on creating an Independent Investigative Office to serve the House Ethics Committee and the House of Representatives.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today to raise awareness of an increasing problem with H2B Visa abuse in my hometown of Houston and elsewhere. 
   Fraudulent recruiters are increasingly bringing in foreign workers for temporary, low skill positions by claming there is a labor shortage for this type of work. 
   These recruiters frequently advertise positions with wages below what they should be paid, and when there are no responses the employers claim there is a labor shortage and bring in foreign workers to do that work. 
   The Immigration and Nationality Act requires that the hiring of foreign workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers working in the occupation in the area of intended employment. 
   However, these regulations are not being strictly enforced. 
   The Department of Labor has proposed new procedures based on its contention that its workload, and the workload of State workforce agencies, has greatly increased in recent years due to the H2B visa program and that an adequate rise in funding to meet that increased workload has not occurred. 
   The proposed changes would cover many aspects of the H2B visa application process, including the moving of filing of State workforce agencies to the National Processing Centers. New requirements for employers to report on the status of their H2B employees should be enforced.  
   I am extremely concerned about these changes, because current regulations are not being strictly enforced at the national level, or at the State workforce agency level and moving filings to the national processing center along with these other changes will not improve enforcement. 
   This lack of enforcement is driving down wages, and preventing individuals from gaining experience necessary to move into higher paying jobs. 
   Congress needs to act and should require recruiters to be certified or licensed to prevent temporary workers and their U.S. employers from being misled about the nature of their visas being defrauded or victimized by outrageous fees. 
   This would allow oversight of the recruiting process which is a much-needed addition to the program. 
   Madam Speaker, I plan to work to see that this issue is addressed, that these rules are corrected, and I urge my colleague to join me in fixing this problem.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the Bishop/Courtney/DeLauro Amendment. 
   The amendment would unfairly target a single liquefied natural gas project, ``Broadwater,'' that is mid-way through a very extensive Federal and State regulatory process. Interfering with this regulatory review would undermine the very process that is designed to provide a thorough assessment of environmental, safety, security and energy supply impacts of the project. 
   I understand the desire of the proponents of this amendment to ensure the ultimate security of their constituents, but I hope this amendment is not simply a red herring to utimately stop further efforts to site LNG terminals across the U.S. 
   LNG has a record of relative safety for the last 40 years, and no LNG tanker or land-based facility has been attacked by terrorists. Since September 11, 2001, the U.S. LNG industry and federal agencies have put new mesures in place to respond to the possibility of terrorism. Federal initiatives to secure LNG are still evolving, but a variety of industry and agency representatives suggest they are reducing the vulnerability of LNG to terrorism. 
   Here in America we only have two options to increase our supply of natural gas to meet our energy needs--we can build more LNG import plants and we can produce more gas offshore. There is no alternative to natural gas in many cases. 
   Unfortunately, the opponents of both options are often the same people--they oppose LNG and they oppose drilling for gas. Without increased exploration or LNG facilities, where will we receive the energy America needs in the immediate future?  
   Natural gas is the cleanest energy source we have besides solar or wind, and it is a critical fuel for industrial facilities and is a feedstock for the petrochemical industry that makes plastic. 
   If we cannot produce natural gas here, we are going to have to import gas to heat our homes and import more plastic in bulk or in consumer products. That hurts our balance of trade. 
   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Bishop-Courtney-DeLauro Amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the Hinchey-Wolf amendment. 
   Today, more than ever, America needs a transmission grid that will deliver reliable and affordable electricity to consumers across the Nation. The Energy Information Agency projects that electricity consumption will increase 43 percent by 2030. Other studies project growth and demand to grow by 19 percent over the next 10 years, while power capacity will grow by only 6 percent over that same time. It stands to reason we're going to have to move power where we have excess to where we need it. 
   Recognizing the fact the Energy Policy Act of 2005, EPACT, allowed for the designation of national interest corridors where congestion in the electricity grid is jeopardizing reliable service and raising the cost to electricity consumers, this designation is not a mandate that a transmission line be built but, instead, an incentive for stakeholders to address the grid capacity issues. FERC is authorized to get involved only if the State is unwilling to or cannot act, then only after exhaustive Federal considerations. 
   The Hinchey-Wolf amendment, unfortunately, seeks to block funding for the National Electricity Transmission Corridors as contained in the authorizing legislation. Failing to address congestion and transmission infrastructure will do absolutely nothing for electricity consumers who will see their energy bills continue to climb in the future. And more blackouts. 
   Our constituents deserve a robust energy transmission infrastructure, and EPACT encourages congested States to resolve the problems in a timely manner. And we know the issue of blackouts, particularly in mid-America to the Northeast. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose the Hinchey-Wolf amendment because all it will do is raise electric prices because we can't move power where we really need it.

It hurt the Energy and Commerce Committee. But it hurt this House. And that's what we're seeing in this House of Representatives. 
   We want to do things on a bipartisan basis. And there is not a closer friend I have in the House than Joe Barton. But as ranking member, we were stuck there for 2 days and couldn't even amend the bill without reading the whole bill. So to pass it in August we had to get it out of the committee.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague of the Rules Committee for allowing me to speak. 
   I rise today in support of the legislation to reauthorize the SCHIP program. With 6 million American children currently eligible for the program and yet unenrolled, it is time we quit playing politics with their health care and start covering these children. 
   This bill accomplishes both of these goals and is a true bipartisan, at least in the Senate, bicameral effort that will result in nearly 4 million additional children receiving health insurance coverage under the SCHIP program. This bill wisely retains the House formula and the incentives for States to implement outreach and enrollment tools, which offered the best combination for finding and enrolling eligible children. 
   However, I have to express regret and disappointment that the bill did not include the House bill's guarantee that children in families earning less than 200 percent of the poverty level will have 12 months of continuous eligibility under SCHIP. The enrollment and outreach package includes an incentive for States to provide this eligibility guarantee. But for a State like mine, we need to ensure that the State of Texas does right by our Texas children and doesn't use that flexibility inherent in the program to kick these kids off the rolls on a budgetary whim. The 175,000 Texas children who were kicked off the rolls in 2003 know all too well of the State's willingness to balance the State budget on their backs, and I hoped that this bill would take away the State's ability to do that in the future. 
   But like most pieces of compromise legislation, we have to consider the totality of the bill, and the bill should be celebrated for all that it does accomplish. 
   I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the legislation and sending a strong message to the President that we must abandon the partisan politics and reauthorize SCHIP for America's children whose parents are working but cannot afford or are not offered employer-based health insurance.

   Last Friday morning, a number of Members of Congress from Texas and I went to that office. I call on the adminstration and the State Department to take the necessary steps to alleviate the backlog. 
   I know in the Houston office, Jacqueline Harley-Bell, the regional director of the Houston Passport Agency, and the staff have been working long days and weekends, and I commend them for their efforts to serve the public because they are understaffed and overwhelmed by the number of applications they are getting. 
   The Houston office has already issued nearly 11 million passports in the first 5 1/2 months of 2007. That is 3 million more than the 7.9 million that were issued in all of 2006. 
   The administration needs to provide the resources necessary now for additional workers or funding, to clear the backlog due to the new requirement that folks traveling in North America by plane need to have a passport. 
   On Thursday the administration changed the requirement, or delayed it, that individuals flying into Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and Bermuda must only present a State Department receipt they have applied for a passport through the end of September. But this is much later than it should be. People are standing in line from 2 in the morning. People wait in line to get rock concert tickets, not a passport. I hope the State Department and administration will immediately address this problem.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague on the Energy and Commerce Committee for yielding to me. 
   I want to associate myself with the remarks of my colleague from Illinois (Mr. Kirk). That's why I'm here today. We have another opportunity today, Mr. Speaker, to give real hope to millions of Americans suffering from incurable diseases. 
   These are our constituents, our family members and our friends who cannot afford to wait much longer while this administration stubbornly refuses to accept the people's will. 
   Poll after poll shows that between 60 and 70 percent of the American people support the expansion of embryonic stem cell research to discover more effective cures and treatment for the diseases that plague our times--juvenile diabetes, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, just to name a few. 
   Every religion in the world teaches us to do all we can to ease the burden of human suffering. 
   The administration's current stem cell policy flies in the face of that shared goal and shuts the door of hope to too many Americans awaiting a cure. 
   I know a majority of my colleagues agree with me, and I hope the President hears us loud and clear and will finally respond to the Congress's, and the American people's, desire for expanded embryonic stem cell research. 
   Last week I saw what happens in research at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center. The private research is in one lab, and the NIH research is in a separate lab, duplicating facilities. What a waste of our scientific dollars, whether it comes from the taxpayers or from the individual and foundations. What a waste to have to do this, duplicate two labs, to be able to do this research. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, we know people, not just my colleague from Rhode Island, but I know a young lady 26 years old who had her spinal cord severed. Her only hope is embryonic stem cell research, and I'm glad to hear our colleague from Rhode Island talk about his experience. And he gives hope to this young lady who has no hope right now, except hopefully she'll be able to move her fingers.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 5715, The Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008. 
   I would also like to thank Chairman MILLER of the Education and Labor Committee and Chairman HINOJOSA of the Subcommittee on Higher Education, Lifelong Learning and Competitiveness for their work on this important piece of legislation. 
   Getting a college education has never been more important, and this bill will help ensure that students will still have access to the Federal loans they need to pay for college in the coming months. 
   In recent months, uncertainty in the U.S. credit markets has made it difficult for some lenders in the federally guaranteed student loan program to secure the capital needed to finance college loans. Because of this, some lenders have scaled back their lending activity. 
   While no student or college has reported any problems accessing Federal student aid to date, it is important that the Federal Government take steps to ensure that students will continue to have access to funds regardless of what happens in the U.S. credit markets. 
   A viable Federal Family Education Loan Program is extremely important in my home state of Texas. The FFELP participants provide nearly two-thirds of the student financial aid awarded annually to Texas postsecondary education students and parents contrasted to only 56 percent nationally. 
   Our students can now breathe a sigh of relief knowing that there will be liquidity and continued, uninterrupted access to Federal loans thanks to this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, thanking both Congressman Murtha and Congressman Obey for their work.  
   It has now been 4 years since this war started, over 3 years since we heard the phrase ``mission accomplished,'' and almost a year and half since the Iraqi elections for a permanent government--it is time for the Iraqi government to police, govern, and run its country. This bill also provides more support for our veterans and military healthcare. 
   This legislation will provide funding for our troops, but it will also force the Iraqis to take control of their own country, and bring our troops home within the next 18 months--possibly sooner, if the Iraqis do not meet benchmarks that demonstrate they are making progress. 
   Our commitment in Iraq, which grew under the President's surge plan last month, has strained our military, cost thousands of U.S. and Iraqi lives, and has created serious readiness problems in the Army and Marine Corps. 
   I don't like the idea of setting a timeline, but for 4 years we have had an open-ended commitment, and after those 4 years, we are still seeing some of the bloodiest attacks, and highest casualty numbers to date. We need to set benchmarks to force the Iraqis to take over their own country, and this bill does that. It is not pulling our troops out immediately--if Iraqis rise to this responsibility, we will have troops there for another 18 months, but if they don't, we will begin redeployment this year. 
   After 4 years, it is time Congress exercise authority over the way this war is being run. Congress is not 535 commanders in chief, but we must provide guidance on what we will ask the American taxpayers to fund. We have held dozens of hearings this year, and passed a non-binding resolution opposing the escalation or surge in U.S. troops. Our vote on this Supplemental will be another step in bringing a resolution to this conflict and will let the Iraqis know our commitment is not open-ended. 
   I applaud the leadership and Appropriations committee on bringing this bill to the floor, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   Mr. Speaker, before I get into my remarks, let me talk about some of the remarks and the comments that have been made. I know we've heard a study quoted about $3.50 natural gas. Right now if you can find $3.50 natural gas anywhere, we ought to buy it because now it's $6 to $7 per million cubic feet for natural gas right now. And so whatever studies talk about $3, $3.30, whatever, is really not relevant. 
   I represent a district that we actually have zero emitting natural gas wells in the Gulf of Mexico. Zero emitting for air pollution, zero emitting for water pollution. And I've offered many times to take colleagues who've never been to a natural gas offshore well to just come to the Gulf of Mexico, either off of Texas or Louisiana or maybe Mississippi or Alabama where folks also drill off the coast. 
   Natural gas is one of the cleanest producing fuels we can use. I'm a strong supporter of this Peterson amendment to allow the Department of the Interior to issue new leases for offshore natural gas in areas 25 miles off the coast. We're not talking about 3 miles off the coast. We're not talking about 10 miles. We're talking about 25 miles. 
   This amendment has less to do with fossil fuels and everything to do with helping Congress address our climate change and transition America to a clean energy future. If you are for renewables, if you're for cleaner power, if you're for low-emitting vehicles, if you're for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, then you should be increasing the access to the domestic natural gas supplies. 
   Demand for natural gas is already building across our economy, and proposals pushing cleaner energy will only accelerate the demand. That's because it takes a lot of natural gas to make the materials for our economy that make it more energy efficient. Insulation, weatherization materials, thermal windows, appliances, lightweight vehicle parts, low-resistance tires, compact fluorescent light bulbs, heat reflecting coatings, house wrap, the list goes on and on. All are made from materials that are directly made from natural gas. 
   It also takes natural gas to make materials that make wind turbine blades and solar panels to run biomass facilities and to run cleaner burn power plants. 
   One example is right here in the Capitol where our Speaker and majority leader directed the Chief Administrative Officer, our CAO of the House, to develop a green Capitol initiative. The CAO officer announced last week that his strategy to reduce CO  
   2 emissions from the Capitol power plant was to use natural gas instead of coal, which will lower CO 
   2 emissions by 30 percent from 2006 level. This is equivalent to taking 1,900 cars off the road each year. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to back up their support for addressing both climate change and by supporting domestically produced natural gas in the environmentally responsible Peterson amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my Pennsylvania colleague for yielding to me. 
   This is similar to the earlier amendment, although I rise in strong support of this because it is for new leases, offshore natural gas and oil, at least 100 miles of the U.S. coast. 
   Supply and demand for our energy is out of control and our Nation needs more energy from all sources. Demand for natural gas is already building across the economy and proposals pushing cleaner energy will only accelerate this demand. Natural gas, again, is the most abundant clean-burning fuel to heat and cool our homes and businesses. We also need a lot of natural gas to make the materials that we make wind turbine blades out of and solar blades. 
   Opening the OCS would save $300 billion in natural gas costs over 20 years for customers and manufacturers. High natural gas costs are sending manufacturing jobs overseas following the cheap gas. When I had the Shell CEO of Western Hemisphere two years ago sit in my office and say they transferred jobs from their chemical facilities in our country to the Netherlands because of the high cost of our natural gas, because the North Sea gas was so much cheaper, that is why we need the Peterson amendments. 
   Environmentally conscious nations like Norway, Denmark, Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom are safely producing natural gas in their coastal waters. Why can't we do it? 
   No other country in the world can it do as responsibly as we can. I have been on oil and gas rigs and have seen so few discharges into the ocean. A medium-sized fishing boat will leak more in a year than we will see off some of our rigs. 
   This amendment is a major opportunity for us to respond to today's energy crisis and the climate change with a national solution. I urge my colleagues to support the oil and gas production on the Outer Continental Shelf and support the Peterson amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is reminded that under the unanimous consent agreement, he need not remain standing after he yields during the debate.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of our Natural Resources Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, most Americans believe that dependence on foreign oil is a problem and alternative energy sources deserve our support, particularly after 9/11. The recent election season saw such high consumer gas prices and high anxiety about energy security. 
   But let us look at another industry. Very cold weather in southern California is causing loss of fruits and vegetables, and ranchers in the Midwest are losing cattle because of the cold weather. The farmers and ranchers who still have crops and livestock stand to make a lot of money from the price spikes that we are seeing literally as we stand here on the floor today. 
   Are we blaming those farmers and ranchers for the high prices? Are we going to cut farm benefits and raise taxes on the farmers? No. 
   But for some reason when we have cold winters and hot summers and hurricanes in the gulf that raise gas prices, we all get mad at energy suppliers. It is the easy way out to get mad at the industry, since most of our country just uses energy and does not produce it. 
   We have a budget deficit, and funds for new alternative energy programs are in short supply. So industry is being targeted for this purpose. 
   I understand why my colleagues are choosing to do this, but this plan carries a significant risk of being counterproductive, especially in the near future. 
   H.R. 6 exempts the oil and gas industry from a recent manufacturing tax benefit, cuts geological expense to major energy producers and requires new payments on 1998-1999 offshore leases to make up for serious government errors in the original contracts. 
   These provisions raise $14 billion over 10 years for clean alternative energy programs that Congress will establish through regular order. That is why I support this bill. That $14 billion will be used for alternatives through the regular order of this Congress, through our committee process. 
   These tax provisions reduce incentives for domestic production and could increase dependence on foreign oil and LNG which hurt national security. 
   With current high oil prices, we may not miss these incentives as much if prices were low, but the effects could be very real in the long term. 
   However, the 100 hours energy bill is a compromise within the Democratic Caucus to promote alternative energy. For the first time in my years in Congress, the Democratic leadership included the Members from energy producing States in the process. 
   The section 199 tax provision is most unfair because it singles out oil and gas as ineligible, as compared to other manufacturing operations. 
   The main royalty provision is based on the Jindal-Pombo bill that House Republicans overwhelmingly supported a few months ago in June. 
   I am also very concerned about the effects of the provision on contract certainty in U.S. oil and gas leasing, but for better or worse, there is a consensus among both parties to address this 1998-1999 lease issue. 
   While this bill is a far cry from my preferred energy policies, the Democratic leadership has been narrow and targeted. 
   After extensive discussions between our office and other Members' offices  from oil and gas producing States, this bill does not include more punitive measures that seek to alter long-standing oil and gas tax or accounting treatment that could destabilize our Nation's gasoline supply even more. 
   We do not repeal the refinery tax provision or the deductions for intangible drilling costs. We also do not eliminate LIFO accounting, impose a windfall profits tax, or repeal of natural gas distribution line depreciation. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a result and the good faith we have had in this 100 hours agenda, I am voting for the bill. 
   Before I close, I have two messages. First, you cannot hit an industry for $14 billion and go back time and time again. 
   And my second message is to the oil and gas industry. With the recent November elections, this bill should be a wake-up call to explain energy issues to Democratic Members who may have been ignored in recent years.  
   We also do not eliminate LIFO accounting, impose a windfall profits tax, or repeal of natural gas distribution line depreciation. 
   As a result, and as a show of good faith during this critical 100 hours period for our new majority, I am voting for this bill. 
   Before I close I have two messages, and the first is for the Democratic Caucus--when you hit one industry for $14 billion, you cannot go back for more later and expect enough gasoline in your cars and fuel to heat and cool our homes. 
   My second message for the oil and gas industry--the recent November election and this bill should be a wake-up call to explain energy issues to Democratic members that they may have ignored in recent years. We are going to need those members to prevent additional legislation of this type.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for allowing me to speak. 
   I rise today in support of this resolution. The President's escalation, or surge, as he calls it, is not a strategy that will quell the violence in Iraq. 
   We have heard for too long that change in Iraq is just around the corner, and we continue to spend billions of dollars and have taken thousands of U.S. casualties. 
   I supported our goals to bring democracy to Iraq, voted for the Iraq resolution, and voted for the billions of dollars to support that effort. And I will not vote to cut funding for our troops while they are in the field in Iraq and Afghanistan.     
   They are doing their best with a very flawed plan, and that doesn't come from just GENE GREEN saying it. I heard it less than a year after we went there, from e-mails that parents forwarded me. 
   Our goals were great in Iraq. The plan was not. The administration's plan has not worked since the first year. It is time we send a strong message to the President that we no longer support the administration's strategy. 
   President Bush addressed the Nation on January 10 of this year to announce his plans to send an additional 21,500 soldiers and marines to Iraq. This move ignores advice from the military and has been tried before without success. 
   General John Abizaid, former commander of the Central Command, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on November 15, 2006, that he and General George Casey, the Corps Commander, and Lieutenant General Martin Dempsey all agreed that more troops were not needed. The White House is continuing with the same flawed strategy to pacify the country that has not worked, and adding another 20,000 troops will not make it work. 
   March 19 of this year will mark 4 years since we went into Iraq. May 1 will mark 4 years since the President declared ``mission accomplished.'' But we turn on the news today and still see headlines, ``Car Bombers Kill 60 in Baghdad,'' ``Four More American Soldiers Killed in Gunfight With Militia.'' 
   We have made great strides in Iraq, but we are now trying to police a war between sectarian armies. Our troops have performed all that has been asked of them, and according to the National Security Council's analysis, we have achieved many of our initial objectives: removing Saddam Hussein from power, assisting Iraq with a constitution and free elections, and helping establish democratic institutions. 
   It is time for the Iraqis to take control of their own country and that we begin bringing our troops home. This is in the best interests of our military, the Iraqis and our national security. 
   Our forces cannot indefinitely sustain the demands we currently are placing on them. Joint Chiefs Chairman Peter Pace acknowledged last week when testifying before the House Armed Services Committee that nondeployed U.S. forces are not sufficiently equipped, echoing similar concerns expressed recently by Army Chief of Staff Peter Schoomaker and Lieutenant General Steven Blum, chief of the Pentagon's National Guard Bureau. 
   The Guard, nationwide, is only equipped to about 30 percent of their needs. Units are taking equipment with them into theatre and being forced to leave much of it for other units to use when they come home. It will cost about $25 billion to reequip the National Guard and Reserves to pre-Iraqi war levels. 
   We cannot continue to send troops to Iraq for 12-month deployments every other year and expect to maintain a well-equipped and experienced fighting force with high morale. 
   This resolution expresses the beliefs of many Members of this House that sending an additional 21,500 troops to Iraq is not in our Nation's interests and not a solution for the violence in Iraq. The solution is for the Iraqi Government, the elected government, to do what they need to do. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. I thank my colleague from the Rules Committee for allowing me to speak. 
   I have to admit, it is not very often I follow my colleague from Massachusetts and support a lot of what he said. The legislation before us today is the result of almost a year of hard work  and negotiation to compromise by the new majority to produce an energy bill that helps address the serious concern of climate change in our Nation. 
   For the first time in over 30 years, Democrats increase the fuel economy standards by 40 percent, as well as increase energy efficiency requirements and promote research and development of alternative sources of energy. 
   Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer and Chairman Dingell deserve special praise for their work in crafting this historic legislation. 
   Almost as important as what is included is what is not included. H.R. 6 omitted provisions from the previous energy bills that I feared could raise the cost of energy for consumers, including a Federal renewable electricity standard, new taxes on the energy industry outside of those carefully negotiated in the original H.R. 6 from January of this year that could tilt the competitive playing field against U.S. companies, and provisions that could hamper domestic oil and natural gas production. These changes are commendable and represent a more balanced proposal which I support. 
   What was unfortunately omitted was the opportunity to create a balanced energy policy that invests in our energy future without ignoring America's energy needs today. Energy security cannot be achieved by alternative energy and conservation alone. 
   The Energy Information Administration predicts that natural gas, oil, and coal will comprise approximately the same share of our total energy supply in 2030 as they did in 2005, even with new investments in renewable sources of energy. 
   Comprehensive energy legislation must be enacted that will increase America's domestic energy supply, particularly clean-burning natural gas which will play a critical role in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. 
   What's also lacking was the debate on renewable fuel standards, RFS, a provision not moved through the regular process of the House and that lacks a clear mechanism to reduce the mandate prior to taking effect in the case of environmental challenges, technological, feasibility or supply issues, or other adverse consequences. 
   There is no shortage of literature detailing the negative environmental impacts of corn-based ethanol, its questionable greenhouse gas emission reductions, its reduced fuel efficiency, and its effect on food and energy prices. 
   I hope in a few years down the road we don't find ourselves asking whether the supposed cure for our oil addiction is not worse than the disease. 
   In closing, I believe as Democrats we can craft a sensible energy policy that actually enhances our energy security. I hope our House leadership will continue to try to work with Democrats and Republicans together to address America's need to produce additional domestic energy, both conventional and renewable, and to ensure the reliability and affordability of our Nation's critical energy supplies.  
   Energy Policy 
   The energy bill passed by the U.S. House last week is more a political statement than a blueprint for U.S. energy policy. Titled the Energy Independence and Security Act, it misses many chances to attain those goals. 
   The bill's best feature is the requirement that automakers have a fleet average of 35 miles per gallon. The measure's proponents say the higher mileage standard would save the United States 1.1 million barrels of oil per day--about half of what the country imports from the Persian Gulf. With populations and demand for energy growing, more efficient cars and SUVs are essential. 
   The bill's reliance on the use of ethanol to cut crude imports is suspect, however. Most ethanol here is made from corn. The present mandate for gasoline blenders to use ethanol has driven up food prices, but the nation hasn't enjoyed a significant net gain in energy. The bill aims to force the development of efficient cellulosic ethanol, but the technology might be slow in coming. If House Democrats wanted to increase use of efficiently made ethanol, they would eliminate the tariff on imported ethanol made from sugar cane. 
   A requirement that utilities produce 15 percent of their electricity from renewable sources is arbitrary and does not suit every locality, but it would prompt market solutions. Texas, one of the leading producers of wind power, has a 5 percent renewable requirement, and the state's economy and consumers have benefited. 
   President Bush has voiced objection to the bill's new taxes applied to the oil industry, and he has good reason. Does it make sense to raise the tax burden on the companies that produce and distribute the energy the nation's prosperity rests on? The oil industry should be taxed as near as possible in the same manner as other corporations. 
   If Congress wanted to increase domestic oil and gas production, as it should, it would allow responsible drilling on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. There is no reason the Gulf of Mexico should bear the strain of providing the nation's only offshore energy. 
   Perhaps one day the Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate will agree on a compromise that would enhance efficiency and the nation's energy supply. For that to happen, both parties must decide policy based on the common good rather than on narrow competing interests.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (RESPONSIBLE FEDERAL OIL AND GAS LEASE ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise not necessarily in opposition to H.R. 6251. It is difficult to support or oppose something that is already current law. We already have use-it-or-lose-it. We have 10-year leases in this bill. That is what the law is. 
   Americans need Congress to look at real solutions in addressing energy needs, especially when we have $4 a gallon gas. We need answers, and not just slogans. We cannot drill our way to energy independence, we can't conserve our way, and we surely can't use alternatives to have energy independence. We need to do it all. 
   The legislation before us today was introduced a week ago with no committee hearings, no markups. And they raise a valid question: Are people really sitting on oil leases and not producing? 
   Now, there may be reasons for it, like there are not permits allowed to get it from the Navy Petroleum Reserve. I know in the Outer Continental Shelf, which I am real familiar with because it is off of Texas, a lot of those leases can't produce because there are no resources on it, but they still have that lease for 10 years. 
   Let me tell you, with $140 a barrel oil, everybody wants to drill everywhere that you can. But we already have 10-year leases. In fact, I would like to include for the Record a copy of a current lease that is from Minerals Management on section 4, diligence and rate of development. We already have a diligence requirement in the 10 year leases that are there. 
   What we need to do is actually do everything we can. We need to drill the leases we have, but we do need to get additional leases available in some of the most productive areas of the Outer Continental Shelf and make it available, because we need to make sure that our country is going to be energy independent and not dependent on Venezuela or Saudi Arabia or any other country. And we can do it. We have Senators going to Saudi Arabia begging for them to increase their production, but we won't increase ours in some of the most potential productive areas. 
   That is why we need solutions instead of slogans. That is why I have a hesitation to support the bill or oppose it, because it is already current law.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I wish to engage Subcommittee Chairman Mr. Visclosky in a colloquy for purposes of underscoring the strategic role of petroleum coke gasification to reduce dependence on the foreign supply of energy, and illustrating the technological feasibility of petroleum coke gasification projects to sequester carbon. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Energy and Policy Act of 2005, Public Law 109-58, has a specific provision, section 415, 42 U.S.C. 15975, authorizing the Secretary of Energy to provide loan guarantees for at least five petroleum coke gasification projects. Petroleum coke gasification projects are also qualified under title 17, the Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program under 1703 (c) 2 and (c) 3 as an industrial gasification project and pet coke gasification project, respectively. This provision of the law recognizes the critical importance of these projects in promoting efficient management of energy sources within the United States. 
   Domestic gasification of ``petcoke,'' as it is also called in the U.S. refining industry, will reduce foreign exports of this product. Reducing exports of petcoke will result in reduced emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and other gases resulting from production, transportation and burning of fossil fuels associated with energy sources currently being used instead of petcoke. Globally, it would also result in lower emissions from petcoke since this product often is not being burned in clean processes when it is exported. 
   Technology exists today to sequester carbon dioxide byproduct from the petcoke gasification process, pressurize the gas, and inject it underground as a  petroleum recovery enhancement technique.     
   Carbon sequestration can be a viable and compatible technology with petcoke gasification where the geology, ongoing field production, and relative distance to the location of a reliable source of carbon dioxide gas co-exist. 
   Petcoke gasification and carbon sequestration technologies would be in use more widely in key regions in our country if market-entry costs were not so high. 
   Mr. Chairman, reducing the cost of capital to place petcoke gasification technology into service is the very objective Congress recognized and set out to implement in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Department of Energy has not allocated sufficient funds for loan guarantees to demonstrate commercial readiness of the petcoke gasification technology, which will reduce dependence on foreign sources of energy. Adding carbon sequestration will require further allocation of Federal funds to implement this important technology. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge your consideration to expand the types of projects that receive funding under title XVII of the Energy and Water appropriations bill to include already authorized petcoke projects that will enhance U.S. energy independence. I also urge your support for appropriating sufficient resources for one to two petcoke gasification projects in the fiscal year 2008 funding bill for the Department of Energy and hope you can take this into consideration when negotiating in conference committee with the Senate.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleague, my good friend from Indiana and Chair of the subcommittee, for bringing up this important piece of legislation. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 2641. I am particularly pleased the committee has provided the Army Corps of Engineers with $5.6 billion, which is $713 million more than the President's request and $246 million more than last year's appropriations. These funds will help strengthen our Nation's flood control programs and navigation infrastructure, which is particularly important to my district. 
   Along the Houston Ship Channel, we have requested $35 million for operations and maintenance on the deepening and widening project. This continued O&M funding would be used to keep the channel at its authorized depth, which is critical to keeping the channel navigable for the tankers that bring in crude oil to our refineries. We also have submitted a request for the environmental mitigation required as a result of the deepening and widening project and would hope that the committee will give that request its full consideration in conference. 
   Our area relies heavily on Corps of Engineers' funding, since we're not only an energy-producing area but also a low-lying area in the middle of a flood plain. I am hopeful that a portion of the increased funding for the Army Corps of Engineers can be directed to Greens Bayou, Hunting Bayou and Halls Bayou, which were flooded during Tropical Storm Allison in 2001. These authorized projects are located in blue-collar residential areas in my district, where the threat of future flooding is all too real. We dodged Hurricane Rita in 2005, but we need to step up our flood control efforts on these projects to give our residents adequate protection when the next storm hits. I appreciate the committee's continued understanding of the pressing flood control needs in our area. 
   I am also hopeful funding can be provided for other meritorious projects in our district, including the University of Houston's Center for Clean Fuels and Power Generation, the Very High Differential Pressure Sub-sea Multiphase Pumping System, and the Texas Hydrogen Highway. 
   This bill also makes a significant investment in researching and developing alternative energy sources which will lead us away from our dependence on fossil fuels. The bill provides $1.6 billion for research into solar energy, biomass and bio-refinery systems, technologies to reduce vehicle emissions, and technologies to make buildings more energy efficient. It also provides much needed resources for weatherization assistance grants which will weather-proof the homes of low-income disabled and elderly individuals. 
   An investment in new sources of energy is critical to meeting our future energy needs, but in the interim we must continue to improve on the conventional sources of energy we use today. That is why I am pleased this bill funds the demonstration of technology that captures carbon exhaust, and researches how to make fossil fuels more efficient and sustainable. 
   These investments in both conventional and renewable energy research will help meet America's future energy needs and diversify our energy portfolio. The University of Houston's Center for Clean Fuels and Power Generation is contributing to this effort, and I have requested funding for the center's expansion. The center's work to conduct cross-disciplinary research and develop technology to spur the discovery and commercialization of new fuels to provide the Nation's transportation and construction sectors with low-cost, reliable and sustainable power sources. I hope the committee will work with us to include funding for this important project in conference. 
   I commend the Chairman, and also my good friend from Texas, Congressman Chet Edwards, for their hard work on this legislation, and urge my colleagues to support the bill.

   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 3074, the FY08 Transportation-HUD Appropriations bill. 
   I want to thank Chairman Obey, Chairman Olver, Ranking Member Knollenberg and the Appropriations Committee for their hard work on this piece of legislation. 
   This bill contains vital funding for the Houston METRO's North and Southeast New Starts projects. The New Starts project will allow METRO to continue funding implementation of rail and bus rapid transit portions in the North Corridor Project and the Southeast Corridor Projects that are in or service our district. 
   METRO will use this funding for final design, land acquisition and construction for the North Corridor Project and the Southeast Corridor Projects. 
   Houston is the Nation's fourth largest city and the region is becoming increasingly congested. We have a critical need for a comprehensive rapid transit system. 
   The funds that have been allocated for the New Starts Program will improve mobility and transportation options for my constituents and benefit the greater Houston area. 
   This bill also contains funding for an Economic Development Initiative for the Harris County Community and Economic Department's Community Transit Study. 
   This funding will allow HUD to study two areas in our district, the Northshore area and city of Galena Park, for transit improvements such as sidewalks, street lights, and transit shelters. 
   Unfortunately, this bill does not provide funding for several projects that I strongly support. 
   These projects are: the Harrisburg Grade Crossing, Texas Department of Transportation's Design and Construction of Direct Connectors from Beltway 8 to U.S. 59 North, the city of Baytown's Texas Avenue Streetscape Program, the Brays Bayou Bike/Pedestrian Bridge at Mason Park, the Houston Zoo's Enhanced Zoo Interpretives Project, and the Houston Port Region's Economic Recovery Task Force. 
   While it is impossible to fund all of the projects that we request, I believe that these programs need Federal funding.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3121, the Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act, that will help bring national flood insurance programs into the 21st century. I particularly want to thank the chairman of the committee, Barney Frank, as well as the sponsor of the bill and subcommittee Chair Maxine Waters for her hard work in bringing this bipartisan bill to the floor today. 
   Mr. Chairman, in June of 2001, Texas and other States witnessed damage wrought by Tropical Storm Allison after it swept through Texas and up the east coast causing substantial flood damage to thousands of my constituents, along with everyone else, both homes and businesses. 
   The good news was that some of these losses were protected by the National Flood Insurance Program. The bad news was that many of my constituents who needed flood insurance could not afford to purchase the policy. We all know that the flood insurance program plays a critical role in lessening the impact of major flooding disasters; but to make the program more effective, we need greater participation from Americans of all incomes. 
   H.R. 3121 requires FEMA to conduct a survey to review the Nation's flood maps. Inevitably, these updates will identify undesignated homes as being located in flood-prone areas. For many low-income families, such designation of their homes means having to purchase flood insurance that is either unaffordable or difficult to immediately budget for on modest means. Our amendment seeks to bridge that insurance gap between those who can afford a flood policy and those who cannot, and still be able to expand the people paying into the system. 
   The amendment is simple: it would provide a limited 5-year phase-in of flood insurance premiums for low-income homeowners or renters whose primary residence is placed within the floodplain through an updating of the flood insurance program maps. These homes can be valued at no more than 75 percent of the median home value for the State in which the property is located. 
   This amendment would make the National Flood Insurance Program more affordable for low-income homeowners, increase participation in the program and decrease the likelihood of an a taxpayer bailout in the event of a flood. I believe the amendment will bring security and peace of mind to many hardworking families who don't live in mansions, but live in their basic homes and that need help in obtaining protection that their homes deserve. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge support for the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Does any Member seek recognition in opposition to the amendment? 
   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.

   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this appropriations bill and thank Chairman Obey, Chairman Edwards, and our ranking members for their work in setting a new standard for funding our veterans program.  
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this appropriations bill, and to congratulate Chairman Edwards and Ranking Member and Chairman Obey for their work in crafting this bill that sets a new standard for funding veterans' programs. 
   For the first time since the veterans' service organizations began producing their independent budget, Congress has met and even exceeded their request in this bill. The bill appropriates a total of $87.7 billion for veterans' programs, which marks a $6.7 billion increase in funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs--the largest increase in veterans' health care funding in the 77-year history of the VA.  
   This level of funding lets veterans, our troops, and their families know this Congress is going to make sure the promises we made to the men and women who fight for our country will be fulfilled, even after they are done with their service. The wait times at VA medical facilities have increased in recent years; the number of veterans has increased and will continue to grow in the coming years as service members return from Iraq and Afghanistan; and unspeakable conditions at Walter Reed uncovered earlier this year all require attention, and this bill ensures there is funding to address these problems. 
   During a time of war, we need to demonstrate a strong commitment not only to our troops currently serving, but to those who have returned from service and those who fought to defend our country in previous conflicts. I would also like to offer my support for a project request to provide funding for a fire station at Ellington Field, and I hope the chairman will give it strong consideration as projects are funded. 
   The existing fire station at Ellington field is in a rapidly deteriorating condition and does not meet OSHA or Air Force standards. Roof leaks and lack of insulation result in equipment being destroyed and extremely high operating costs. New firefighting apparatus must be parked outside the station because they will not fit into the truck bays. 
   This fire station supports all flying operations at Ellington Field including Air National Guard, Army National Guard, U.S. Coast Guard, NASA, and civilian aircraft. Construction of a new fire station at Ellington is critical for the Texas Air National Guard and all units stationed at Ellington Field. 
   Mr. Chairman, I again applaud the leadership from the chairmen who drafted this bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, it is amazing because a lot of us sat here last night until 2 in the morning and watched the Republican minority file motion after motion for us to rise so we wouldn't take up a Homeland Security bill that has no earmarks. 
   What they did was slow us down on trying to have a bill passed by October 1, which they have had trouble when they were 12 years in the majority. That is why we had to live under continuing resolutions, and continue to live under one because of their governance last year. 
   The Homeland Security bill has 300 new Border Patrol agents. It would be nice on October 1 if this bill was signed into law so we would have those Border Patrol agents on the border, in our airports and in our ports. 
   They are delaying the planning for the first responders, whether in the city of Houston where I come from, or the State of Texas where my three colleagues who spoke earlier on how bad earmarks were, or the bill provides protection from explosive systems for our airports, including Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston. 
   This is delaying $400 million for port security, including the Port of Houston, the number one foreign-tonnage port. We are doing some great things in the Port of Houston. It is because we put the community together, the business community and all government agencies, Republican and Democrats. I wish we could see that in Washington. But we didn't see that last night. We saw delay after delay in not taking up this bill. So we are putting it off so they can make a point of how bad earmarks are. 
   But the House Republicans don't want to talk about those issues. They want to talk about how they want to bring the light of day into earmarks. Well, for 12 years they didn't want the light of day in earmarks. They were the king. They were the emperor of earmarks. I have watched for many years what happened over those 12 years with the earmarks and the ones that were shut out in the minority. 
   I think what they are concerned about is that we may do to them what they did to the Democrats for 12 years, but that is not our intent. All we want is to be able to see them, the public. 
   I have requested earmarks, and I am proud to say I have received them for our district. I don't mind publicizing them. In fact, I will do it in any manner required, instead of airdropping them in like they previously did in the appropriations bills. 
   I think that conversion we saw, maybe it started with the November election, but we are seeing it now, that conversion is almost as amazing as Saul's conversion on the road to Damascus, from Saul being a persecutor of Christians to becoming Paul, the Lord works in mysterious ways; but I don't think it is so mysterious. I think what we are seeing is after 12 years of being dictators in this House, now they are afraid the same rules are going to be used against them. 
   For 3 years, I have requested $250,000 in an earmark for a prenatal machine to treat mothers, poor mothers, to be able to get a new piece of equipment so we can do prenatal planning. $250,000. Health and Human Services has stripped out Democratic earmarks for a number of years. I don't intend to do that. I am not an appropriator, but I hope our Appropriations Committee doesn't do that. I am not ashamed to say that I asked for that earmark again this year for that prenatal machine. 
   Or for $250,000 for a diabetes program in Harris County to help what our local community is doing. I have asked for $250,000 for immunizations. The reason we have earmarks is that I don't want to appropriate all that money and send to Health and Human Services, and say, by the way, I sure would like you to help diabetes and immunizations in Harris County in Houston, Texas. Or maybe help pay for part of a machine for prenatal care. 
   Mr. Chairman, do I still control the time on the floor of the House? 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Texas has the time.

   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, we all have to obey the rules, whether Republican or Democrat; and that is what we are trying to say. We want to pass the appropriations bills before October 1. In the majority for 12 years, they couldn't do it. They put in earmarks all over the appropriations process, and yet stripped out Democrats. I don't want us to do that, but I do want us to have some legislative ability to say we have projects in our district that are important. If I am willing to say, yes, I want them and I will publicize them, then why shouldn't we be able to have an elected official make that decision instead of the bureaucracy that may still be under the President. But the now Republican minority put earmarks in even when they were in the majority, so that is what this debate is about. 
   They don't want us to pass these bills but we need to do it for the American people, particularly Homeland Security.

   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1700 the COPS Improvements Act of 2007. 
   Unfortunately, over the past several years funding for the hiring of additional police officers has been drastically reduced and the COPS program was basically eliminated. 
   The Community Oriented Policing Services Improvements Act revives the grant hiring program. These grants will allow local police departments to hire 50,000 additional police officers over the next 6 years. 
   I know in Houston after Hurricane Katrina we saw a significant rise in violent crime. This program will allow our local communities to hire additional police officers to protect their citizens. 
   This bill will also provide critical funding for technology grants and hiring community prosecutors. These are tools that our communities need to reduce our crime rates. 
   When the COPS program was eliminated our nation experienced a drastic increase in crime rates. By providing our law enforcement community with adequate funding and technology we will give them the ability to reduce crime rates. 
   I have strongly supported this program since it was first introduced during the 1990's. Today I urge my colleagues to support this critical piece of legislation today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Chair, I rise in support of the Democratic budget resolution.  
   The best word to describe this budget is ``balanced.'' 
   First, it balances our Nation's books by bringing our country back to surplus by 2012, thanks in large part to the PAYGO rules this Chamber passed as part of our fiscal responsibility package. 
   This budget also balances our Nation's many priorities by providing adequate funding for our defense and homeland security, while also paying much-needed attention to our deserving domestic priorities and social programs. 
   This budget proves that Democrats pay more than lip service to our Nation's veterans by providing $6.6 billion over last year's funding for veterans' services. 
   As a member of Energy and Commerce, I would like to thank the Budget Committee for including a $50 billion reserve fund for the expansion of the S-CHIP program. 
   Of course, we understand that our reauthorization bill will be subject to PAYGO rules, but this reserve fund is an important first step in increasing access to health care for the nearly 6 million children who are eligible for S-CHIP but not enrolled. 
   I applaud the Budget Committee for rejecting the administration's cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. 
   I also appreciate the budget's refusal to incorporate the administration's cuts to LIHEAP, which should be further expanded to ensure that millions of low-income folks in southern States receive the assistance they need to cool their homes during the oppressive summer months. 
   What a difference a year makes, Madam Chair, and I am proud to support Chairman SPRATT and this budget, which strikes the right balance between investing in the American people and their future and keeping our fiscal houses in order. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this budget.

   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, as cosponsor of this legislation, I rise in strong support and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. 
   This legislation corrects and clarifies a serious misinterpretation by the Supreme Court when it ruled earlier this year in the case of Ledbetter v. Goodyear. 
   In that 5-4 decision, the majority ruled that Lilly Ledbetter, the lone female supervisor at a tire plant in Gadsden, AL, did not file her lawsuit against Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. in the timely manner specified by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
   The court determined a victim of pay discrimination must file a charge within 180 days of the employer's decision to pay someone less for an unlawfully discriminatory reason, such as race, sex, religion, etc. 
   Prior to the Supreme Court's ruling, the widely accepted rule in employment discrimination law was that every discriminatory paycheck was a new violation that restarts the 180-day clock. 
   H.R. 2831 restores the law prior to the Supreme Court's Ledbetter decision, by clarifying that the clock for filing a discrimination charge starts when a discriminatory pay decision or practice is adopted, when a person becomes subject to the pay decision or practice, or when a person is affected by the pay decision or practice, including whenever she receives a discriminatory paycheck. 
   The Supreme Court must not be able to roll back workers' rights in one ruling. Congress must pass this legislation to ensure workers are protected and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2831.

   As cochair of the Democratic Israel Working Group, I want to thank my colleague, Congressman Reynolds, and other members of the Republican Israel Caucus for joining us in this effort to honor and recognize the contributions Israel has made during the last 60 years. 
   I've been to Israel several times and can personally vouch for Israel's contributions to the global community, particularly to agriculture techniques, solar power generation, seawater desalination, academia, telecommunications, and medical technology. 
   In my home State of Texas, we have an economic cooperative agreement with Israel, which is one of the oldest state-to-state relationships in our country. Israel's success in innovative programs constantly serve as ideas for addressing problems facing citizens in Texas. 
   In the last 60 years, Israel has faced many struggles, conflicts with its neighbors, terrorism on its borders and in its neighborhoods, and led peace efforts by leaving Gaza and southern Lebanon only to be attacked from these locations. 
   Despite these struggles, Israel has grown from a state of less than 1 million people in 1948 to a state of over 7 million people committed to promoting human rights, protecting the rule of law, and to open and fair elections. 
   Israel is truly an inspiration to people around the globe. And I would like to again congratulate the Israeli people and join them in celebrating the 60th anniversary of Israel's independence.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the chairman of our Health Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce for his patience with me over the last year and a half, and I think I sometimes wear out my welcome on hearings and on moving this bill. I rise in strong support of H.R. 1343, the Health Centers Renewal Act of 2008. 
   I would first like to thank Senator Kennedy and Senator Hatch for sponsoring and moving this reauthorization through the Senate, and also our fellow Energy and Commerce Committee member Chip Pickering for his work on this bill and his service to both his State of Mississippi and our country. 
   The Community Health Centers Program is one of the great health care successes of our country. Forty years after the program was first enacted at the urging of President Lyndon Johnson, health centers are located in 6,000 sites in all 50 States and serve as the medical home and family physician to 17 million people in medically underserved areas nationally. 
   Community health centers have helped fill the medical void for low-income and uninsured individuals and in 2006, community health centers provided care for over 700,000 Texans. But communities like my district in Houston are in dire need of more community health centers. Houston has approximately 1 million uninsured, but only 10 federally qualified health centers and is desperately in need of more community health centers. 
   We are not the only district in the country facing a medical crisis with the uninsured and underinsured. 
   The Health Centers Renewal Act of 2008 will reauthorize the Health Centers Program and provide over $2 billion a year for health community centers throughout the United States. This increased funding will allow more medically underserved communities to build new health centers, expand their health centers, and provide more services like dental and mental health care. In fact, this bill would allow health centers to expand their services to over 22 million patients in the next 5 years, which is almost 50 percent more than they serve today. That's exactly why every Member of this House should support this bill. 
   Community health centers have demonstrated time and again that if properly funded by Congress, they can meet the Nation's tremendous need for quality, affordable health care. Community health centers are a vital safety net for the uninsured and underinsured in the country. With nearly 40 million uninsured and a health care crisis in our country right now, it would almost be irresponsible for anyone to vote against this bill. 
   I thank you for this time.

   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6899, the Comprehensive American Energy Security and Taxpayer Protection Act. 
   I don't know why my Republican colleagues can't take yes for an answer. We are opening up over 305 million acres. Now, granted, it's a compromise. But when you were in charge, we opened up 8 million acres in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. I'd like to open up more, but, again, like you had to make compromises, we have. But for the first time we're going to open up more Outer Continental Shelf opportunity than anytime in history, even under years of Republican House control, Senate control and the President. 
   I support opening ANWR, but that didn't happen even when the Republicans were in control. 
   The royalty share, I'd love to share royalties with our States who allow drilling, but CBO won't let us. Maybe the Senate will bring up that point. 
   But I don't know why we can't take yes for an answer. If you want to drill in our country, this is the bill. Now, if you want a political issue that you think you'll ride into the November election on like you tried in August, which was more theatrics than anything else then vote ``no.'' But I'll tell you what, the American people are going to see this for what it is. And it's a comprehensive bill that will go forward. 
   We're going to invest that royalty into renewable energy research. I don't think it's economically feasible now, but we need to get there. But we're going to produce domestically, and send that message to the world which, you know, maybe a bill on the floor has helped us with that oil prices going down every day per barrel. 
   I want to thank my esteemed colleagues, Chairman Rahall, Chairman Miller and Chairman Dingell, as well as Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader HOYER and the entire Democratic Caucus for working together to craft legislation that our majority, our Congress and our country can be proud of. 
   Now, I know some of my friends in Congress and maybe the energy industry and the environmental community may be asking themselves one question: ``How in the world can an unholy alliance of GREEN, MILLER and RAHALL ever come together to introduce a comprehensive energy plan. The answer is very simple. America's energy needs demand it. We need to do what's environmentally good, but we also need to make sure we can keep the prices of our current fuel costs low, and whether it's for lighting our homes or cooling or heating our homes or running our vehicles or running our industry. 
   All sides of this debate can no longer insist my way or the highway approach to energy. We need all energy sources, both conventional and renewable, and everyone must be willing to sacrifice to reach a common good. 
   I personally have questions about this, some of the things in this bill. But again, this is the first step. Why would you kill it right now when we still have to work with the Senate and also get a bill passed that the President will sign? 
   So this is the first time we're opening this much Outer Continental Shelf drilling in the Democratic majority House of Representatives. Maybe it's just response to say no to everything that comes up because we're doing it many, many times more than what they did when they had the majority. 
   Our legislation improves on the original H.R. 6 from last year, at least freezing independent oil and natural gas producers at their current section 199 manufacturing. It removes the arbitrary proposals for raising royalty. There was a proposal to go to 21 percent. This administration already increased it to 16 percent. But we don't need to go to 21. It retains accountability for the tainted royalty in kind that I support. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will place the remainder of my statement into the Record, but let me just say one last thing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. President Bush waited 7 1/2 years to eliminate the executive moratorium. And the Democratic Congress has only taken 1 1/2 years.  
   It improves the management of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve--an idea first offered by my good friend from Texas, NICK LAMPSON--by allowing a swap for heavy crude which could immediately lower prices for consumers. 
   Most dramatically, our proposal will help utilize our own domestic oil and natural gas resources in the Outer Continental Shelf. 
   Our legislation incorporates many of the offshore drilling provisions I and other ``Energy Democrats'' first introduced in the LEASE Act by directing the immediate opening of all areas beyond 100 miles off our coasts. 
   That's over 305 million acres in the OCS that are automatically opened for oil and natural gas leasing. 
   States are also given discretion to ``opt-in'' to additional drilling from 50 to 100 miles off their coasts estimated at an additional 90 million acres for production. 
   My friends from the other side of the aisle will argue this bill does not open up enough acreage offshore. 
   In some instances, as in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, I agree. 
   But let's not forget one fact: during the height of Republican rule, under both a Republican President and Congress, Republicans were only able to direct the opening of 8.3 million acres for leasing in the Gulf of Mexico. President Bush after almost 7 1/2 years in office removed the Presidential moritorium. 
   Today, Democrats are directing the opening of over 305 million acres with state concurrence. 
   This is hundreds of millions more acres that are directly opened than in the Senate's ``Gang of 20'' proposal, or in Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell's ``Gas Price Reduction Act'', which has the support of 44 Republican Senators. 
   Most importantly, we use the revenues from oil and gas production to transition America to a clean energy future. 
   Our bill will create a fund to invest in clean renewable energy, energy efficiency, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, carbon capture sequestration, and the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. 
   And we extend many of the critical tax credits for wind, solar, and other renewable energy sources that expire this year. 
   While I believe it's also fundamental to allow states to share in any offshore revenues, ``pay-go'' rules require any revenue sharing-provisions to be offset--whether it's included in this legislation or any other OCS proposal. 
   Mr. Speaker, our legislation isn't perfect. But we cannot make the perfect the enemy of the good. Let's pass this bill and for the first time a Democratic Congress. 
   Our constituents, and our Nation, can no longer wait for Congress to act on a balanced energy policy that will provide the conventional energy we need to fuel our economy and to develop the clean energy sources of tomorrow. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Rahall-Green-Miller legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 6899, COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank our Chair of the Rules Committee for yielding to me. I rise in strong support of our legislation H.R. 6899, The Comprehensive American Energy Security and Taxpayer Protection Act and this rule. 
   Why we identify this as a comprehensive bill is very simple. Our country needs a comprehensive legislation that deals with energy. We need everything for our country to both be energy efficient but also to be able to afford it. All sides of debate can longer insist on the ``it's my way or the highway'' approach to energy. We need all energy resources, both conventional and renewable. And everyone must be willing to sacrifice to reach that common ground. 
   I do not believe our bill goes far enough to address all of our domestic energy resources, especially nuclear energy. But however in every shortcoming there are positive concessions. Our legislation improves on a provision included in the original H.R. 6 by at least freezing independent oil and natural gas producers at their current section 199 manufacturing deduction rate instead of a complete repeal. Our bill modifies provisions from the flawed use of ``use it or lose it'' legislation which necessarily hammered future lease acquisitions. It retains but adds accountability to the tainted Royalty-In-Kind Program that we all read about. 
   It improves the management of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve with an idea offered by my good friend from Texas, Nick Lampson, by allowing a swap for heavy crude which could immediately lower prices for consumers. 
   Most dramatically, our proposal will help utilize our domestic oil and natural gas resources in the outer continental shelf. Our legislation incorporates most of the offshore drilling provision that I and other ``Energy Democrats'' first introduced in the LEASE Act by directing the immediate opening of all areas beyond 100 miles off our coasts. That is over 300 million acres of outer continental shelf that are automatically open to oil and natural gas leasing. States are given the option to opt in the additional 50 to 100 miles off their coast, an estimated 90 million acres for production. 
   My friends on the other side of the aisle argue that this does not open enough acreage in the Gulf of Mexico. I agree. I would like to open up the eastern Gulf of Mexico. But there was an agreement made by the Republican Congress in 2006 for Florida, and we are not going to break that agreement on the House side. 
   But let's not forget the fact that during the height of the Republican rule under both the Republican President and Congress, Republicans were only able to open 8.3 million acres of leasing in the Gulf of Mexico. And President Bush took 7 1/2 years, almost 7 1/2 years of his administrations to actually decide to take off the moratorium. So who really wants to drill? 
   Over 350 million acres will be open. This bill is hundreds of millions more acres that are directly opened in contrast to the Senate ``Gang of 20,'' or in the Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell's bill, his Gas Price Reduction Act, which has the support of only 44 Republican senators. We open so many more than even the Republican leadership and the Senate wanted to, more acreage for exploration and production. 
   Most importantly, we use the revenues from oil and gas production to transition to a clean energy future. Our bill would create a fund to invest in renewable, clean energy efficiency, land and water conservation and LIHEAP. Mr. Speaker, I could go on and on, and I will continue as we go to the debate. This bill is a drilling bill, but it's also a future bill for comprehensive energy production.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleagues, my good friend from Indiana and chair of the subcommittee, Mr. Visclosky, and Chairman Obey, for bringing up this important piece of legislation. 
   I rise in support of the supplemental report on H.R. 2641. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the subcommittee leadership for their inclusion of $18.3 million for the Houston Ship Channel Navigation project, which is $2 million more than the President's budget, and for including $15.442 million in operations and maintenance  for the Houston Ship Channel, which is $1 million over the President's request. 
   While I understand the tight fiscal constraints this Congress is under, I hope we increase funding for these projects in the future. 
   The continued O&M funding would be used to keep the channel at its authorized depth, which is critical to keeping the channel navigable for the tankers that bring in crude oil to our refineries. The navigation funding goes towards important environmental restoration work in the deepening and widening project. We are at the end of that project now. 
   Our area relies heavily on Corps of Engineers' funding, since we're not only an energy-producing area but also a low-lying area in the middle of a flood plain. 
   I requested funding through the Army Corps of Engineers for Greens Bayou, Hunting Bayou and Halls Bayou, which were flooded during Tropical Storm Allison in 2001. These authorized projects are located in blue-collar residential areas in my district, where the threat of future flooding is all too real. 
   I am grateful the subcommittee included $588,000 for Greens Bayou, which will help conclude the study portion of the project and now the project is fast approaching its construction phase. The Greens Bayou project has a high 3.7 benefit to cost ratio, and in 2001, over 15,000 homes in this watershed flooded in Tropical Storm Allison. 
   I appreciate the committee's continued understanding of the pressing flood control needs in our area, but am disappointed only Greens Bayou received funding in this appropriations cycle. 
   Hunting Bayou has already started construction and a cut-off of Federal funding threatens to put this project into danger of falling further behind schedule. Fortunately, this is a 211 (f) project which provides the local sponsor--the Harris County Flood Control District--flexibility to continue work on the project. 
   The Hunting Bayou project will reduce the number of homes and businesses in the 100-year flood plain by 85 percent, from 7,400 structures to 1,000. Eight thousand homes flooded in this area during Tropical Storm Allison as well. 
   I also hope Halls Bayou will receive funding in the future; this project is authorized in WRDA 1990 and is included in the pending WRDA legislation to become a Sec. 211(t) project. 
   Greens Bayou, Hunting Bayou, and Halls Bayou are not projects to protect vacation homes or homes in obvious flood hazard areas. Most of these areas were outside the flood plain until upstream development expanded the flood plains. 
   In closing, I want to commend the Chairman, and especially my good friend from Texas, Congressman Chet Edwards, for their hard work on this legislation, and hope they will continue their progress on funding critical needs across the Nation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the supplemental report.

   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Wings Over Houston Airshow in Houston, Texas for its contribution to the city of Houston, local communities, and the military by fully supporting H. Res. 691. 
   Wings Over Houston is about to give its 23rd annual show and in those 23 years, the show has continued to bring attention to the history and future of the United States Armed Forces, and its veterans and active duty members while becoming one of the top events of its kind in the country and one of the largest in Metropolitan Houston. An estimated 70,000 to 90,000 people are expected to enjoy the air and static displays this year which will not only help to support many non-profit and charitable organizations, but help to fund the Wings Over Houston Scholarship Program and Aviation Career Education summer camp. 
   This family-oriented international event is housed at Ellington Field. Originally built in 1917, the field was integral in flight training for both world wars and was one of the airfields selected to maintain a large military force after the end of WWII. It currently is home to local presence of NASA, Texas Air National Guard, Coast Guard, the National Guard, as well as being used for other aviation purposes. 
   Wings Over Houston not only brings local and international tourists to Houston, but also generates awareness of U.S. Armed Forces by showing a vested interest in education and supporting local students through the scholarship program. That is why I support H. Res. 691.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (COMBUSTIBLE DUST EXPLOSION AND FIRE PREVENTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of this bill to improve worker protections. 
   The Combustible Dust Explosion and Fire Prevention Act would force the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration to issue rules regulating combustible industrial dusts, like sugar dust, that can build up to hazardous levels and explode. 
   While OSHA already has the authority to issue such a rule without Congress passing new legislation, the agency has failed to act despite the fact that the dangers of combustible dust have been well known for years. 
   In 2006, following a series of fatal combustible dust explosions, the U.S. Chemical Safety Board conducted a major study of combustible dust hazards. 
   It identified 281 combustible dust incidents between 1980 and 2005 that killed 119 workers, injured 718 others, and extensively damaged industrial facilities. 
   Time and time again we have seen this administration fail to take necessary actions to protect workers, and without action by Congress, it appears OSHA has no plans to act on combustible dust regulation. 
   As recently as February of this year, we saw the tragedy that can be caused by combustible dust explosions. The combustible dust explosion at the Imperial Sugar Company in Port Wentworth, Georgia, was a senseless tragedy that, like similar incidents, could have been prevented with OSHA regulation and oversight. 
   The bill has three main components. First, it directs OSHA to issue interim rules on combustible dust within 90 days. Second, it directs OSHA to issue final rules within 18 months. The rules would be based on effective voluntary standards devised by the National Fire Protection Association, a nonprofit organization, and in addition to items required in the interim rules, would include requirements for building design and explosion protection. Lastly, it directs OSHA to revise the Hazard Communication Standard to include combustible dusts. 
   Madam Chairman, I urge my colleague to join me in supporting this resolution to make sure OSHA takes necessary actions to protect workers.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (MARKING CESAR CHAVEZ'S BIRTHDAY -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and colleagues. 
   Today I rise to honor a hardworking labor leader, Cesar Chavez, who founded the United Farm Workers Union and dedicated his life to promote nonviolence through boycotts and strikes that would protect farm workers from the dangers of pesticides, low wages, and the denial of fair and free elections. 
   I met Cesar Chavez in the 1970s when he came to organize farm workers in Texas. I was a young Texas State Representative and was inspired by his leadership then and as he inspires people today in this century. 
   Cesar Estrada Chavez was born on March 31, 1927, in Yuma, Arizona. It was 10 years later in 1937 that like many other migrant families, his parents lost their farm and their home. This was a hardship that led them to join thousands of other migrant farmer workers to toil in the California fields. 
   In 1944 Cesar Chavez enlisted in the U.S. Navy where he served and fought for the United States in the Pacific during World War II. He later married Helen Fabela and fathered eight children. Although Cesar Chavez was not able to complete high school because his family required his helping hands in the California fields, he not only endured the hardships of migrant working conditions but experienced the injustices that he later made into a personal crusade for the migrant farm workers. 
   His personal struggles as a migrant farm worker led him to find a nonviolent way to help Hispanic farm workers. In the 1950s, Cesar quietly began to study and work for the better working conditions of migrant workers. His persistent struggle to help Hispanics led him to organize the National Farm Worker group in Fresno, California. Cesar Chavez was one of the first Hispanic activists that begun what was a series of boycotts and strikes against California grape growers. Most notably, he called a boycott against Schenley Industries, a major California grape producer. His series of boycotts and strikes caused a national awareness that provoked the late Senate Robert F. Kennedy to criticize local officials after uncovering strike-breaking practices against farm workers. The National Farm Workers Union later reached a groundbreaking settlement with Schenley Industries that marked the first contract ever signed for farm workers in the United States.  
    This was a monumental achievement that the United Farm Workers would not have been able to accomplish without the hard work and determination of this courageous individual. 
    As the struggle to protect farm workers continued, Cesar Chavez even sacrificed his health several times by fasting. He saw his fight as a personal fight to end the terrible suffering of the farm workers and their children. 
    Cesar Chavez worked tirelessly to improve the lives of America's farm workers by securing their rights to organize and bargain collectively for fair working conditions. Chavez showed us that together we can make a safe and prosperous America with a strong and vibrant economy--an America with good jobs and good pay. Fifteen years after his passing, his life's work and legacy continues to inspire millions.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2900, legislation to reauthorize important user fee programs at the Food and Drug Administration and enact critical drug safety reforms at the agency. 
   This legislation is the result of years of hard work by the Energy and Commerce Committee and particularly the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee and the Health Subcommittee. I am proud to serve on both of these subcommittees. The Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee has worked on a bi-partisan basis to investigate the drug safety concerns brought to light by scandals associated with drugs such as Vioxx, Ketek and Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, or SSRIs, which are typically used to treat depression. These investigations uncovered significant safety lapses at the FDA and shed a bright light on the FDA's bias toward drug approval with too little attention paid to post-market safety concerns. 
   The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 makes important changes at the FDA to place a greater emphasis on post-market surveillance within the agency. Specifically, this legislation would establish a Risk, Evaluation, and Mitigation Strategy whereby drugs approved by the agency are monitored throughout their life-cycle for adverse events or other signs of safety concerns. A critical aspect of this strategy is the additional authority this bill gives the Secretary of HHS to mandate that drug manufacturers conduct post-market studies. 
   Under this bill, the additional post-market activities extend to the user fee programs that help fund the drug approval process. Specifically, this bill directs drug manufacturers utilizing the FDA's drug approval process to dedicate an additional $225 million over five years for post-market surveillance activities at the FDA. This additional funding represents an important investment by the pharmaceutical industry in the FDA's postmarket safety activities, while also ensuring that pre-market user fees are adequate to bring potentially life-saving medicines to market in a reasonable time. 
   This legislation also reauthorizes the Medical Device User Fee Act, as well as the Best Pharmaceuticals For Children Act and the Pediatric Research Equity Act. The unanimous support of the committee for this bill is a testament to the open process and bi-partisan nature in which the committee members and staff on both sides of the aisle conducted these negotiations. 
   I would like to thank our Chairman, Mr. Dingell, and our Health Subcommittee Chairman, Mr. Pallone, for their work on this important legislation, and encourage my colleagues to support this important bill. These necessary changes at the FDA will go a long way toward restoring the American public's confidence in the agency and its ability to ensure the safety of the nation's drug supply.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the College Reduction Act of 2007, and I thank the chairman and the committee for bringing this bill to the floor. I think it is a great step forward for our college students.  
   This important piece of legislation will strengthen the middle class by making college more affordable in several ways at no additional cost to taxpayers. 
   First, it will increase the maximum Pell grant scholarship by at least $500 over the next 5 years, and expand student eligibility for other grants like the National SMART grant. Both of these things will increase the purchasing power for students who otherwise would not be able to afford going to college. 
   In Texas alone, over 475,000 students will benefit from a $500 increase in the Pell grant. 
   In addition, this bill will cut interest rates on need-based Federal student loans from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent over the next 5 years. 
   All of this will be done at no additional cost to the taxpayers by cutting excess subsidies paid by the Federal Government to lenders in the student loan industry. 
   Four of the six offsets were already approved by the House this year, when it overwhelmingly voted to pass the College Student Relief Act of 2007 this past January. 
   During the past few years, student lenders have been able to increase their efficiencies through market-driven mechanisms, but the Government's subsidization has continued unchecked. 
   The Congress has a chance to help the American people at no additional cost for the taxpayer. How can we resist doing this? 
   In our district, financial barriers often inhibit the ability of high school graduates to go to college. 
   By reducing student loan interest rates and increasing Federal grants, we are encouraging families and students to get a college education. 
   When we pass this legislation, we are investing in the future of our economy, because we will have more college graduates with a lower debt burden. This will enable graduates to do things like buy homes, invest, and fuel our economy. 
   This is such a critical bill, and it's important that this body approach this bill in a manner that shows bipartisan support for educating our children. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this extremely important legislation for America's workers. The last 10 years we have seen these tired old Republican arguments against increasing the minimum wage while the huge wealth of the highest paid in our country increases. We have not raised the minimum wage since 1997. When adjusted for inflation, the minimum wage is the lowest it has been in 50 years. That is 10 years of wasted opportunity on this floor that is being corrected today. 
   A minimum wage worker full-time makes $10,700 a year. That is well below the poverty level. We need to provide a lift for these hardworking Americans. I agree with the late U.S. Senator from Texas, Ralph Yarborough, when he said, ``Let's put the jam on the lower shelf for the people.'' 
   This increase will provide much needed help to the lowest wage earners in our country. Their needs and dreams are no different from anyone else's. These wage earners want to earn a decent wage to be able to put dinner on the table for their families. It is not too much to ask that we raise the minimum wage after a decade of taking no action on this important part of the American economy. 
   Passing this bill today is the right step, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5.  
   This bill cuts student loan interest rates to a fixed 3.4 percent over 5 years. 
   Right now, the average student loan debt is around $13,800. By passing this bill, we are saving a student with average debt $4,400 over the life of their loan. 
   Also, this legislation targets middle-class America. Half of the students that take on federally subsidized loans have incomes between $26,000 and $68,000 a year. 
   This benefits millions of lower income families, but also hardworking middle-class Americans that are trying to give their children a leg up in living the American dream. 
   College tuition has risen 41 percent since 2001. Just this year, the percentage of students relying on loans to get through school hit 52 percent. 
   This is a direct result of rising tuition costs in both public and private institutions. 
   These families need help and we should give it to them. Twice a year, our office holds a Paying for College workshop. 
   We bring in lenders and experts on filling out the FAFSA to help our students navigate through the application process and to come to terms with the amount of debt they may take on. 
   The most important consideration for families in our Congressional District is what the cost of going to college will be. 
   Financial barriers inhibit the ability of high school graduates to go to college. 
   By reducing student loan interest rates, we are encouraging families and students to get a college education. 
   When we pass this legislation, we are investing in the future of our economy because we will have more college graduates with a lower debt burden. 
   This will enable graduates to do things like buy homes, invest and fuel our economy. 
   To offset the costs of reducing interest rates, we are reducing the amount the Federal Government guarantees lenders. 
   While this is not a popular idea with large lenders, smaller lenders will not be impacted by this legislation. 
   Student loans are not the bread and butter of large financial institutions, but smaller local banks and credit unions often provide student loans in smaller communities. 
   This is why lower volume lenders will not be impacted. 
   Madam Speaker, this is a win for middle class America, future generations of college students and our Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Head Start is a critical part of this country's effort to combat the effects of poverty and ensure that all of our children have the opportunity and skills they need to thrive. 
   Since its creation in 1965, it has proven to be our most valuable school readiness program in the history of this country--especially, now that we know more about the importance of early-childhood education. 
   Study after study demonstrates that by age 6, a child's capacity to learn is largely formed, and time after time, we have seen reports that prove students who attend Head Start perform better than those who don't. 
   By doing this, Head Start is helping to close the achievement gap between students of differing socio-economic status across our country, and helping the children in our communities by providing opportunities that they might not otherwise have. 
   Additionally, people often forget the wonderful things that this program does for the parents. 
   The key to Head Start's approach is its level of actively involving parents and the community in all aspects of the program--and this reauthorization would further this goal. 
   Parents are a child's first teachers, and Head Start helps build and foster a person's parenting skills in various ways. 
   Parents are also urged to improve their literacy skills, obtain adult basic education, and make their homes a place where reading is part of everyday life. 
   Head Start also tackles a wide range of poverty issues through its family and community partnerships, including: substance abuse, violence, HIV, homelessness, single-parent households, inadequate child care, unemployment, and numerous other stressors that challenge families' resources. 
   This program is clearly instrumental to our country. 
   The Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007 will reinvigorate Head Start and help more children arrive at kindergarten ready to succeed. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this report.

   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring forward H.R. 3668, the TMA Abstinence, Education, and QI Programs Extension Act of 2007, a bill to protect the health of Americans, both young and old. 
   The Transitional Medical Assistance program assists mothers who are transitioning off of welfare and into the workforce. Unfortunately, these working parents often find themselves in low-income jobs that do not offer health insurance. The TMA program extends Medicaid coverage to these vulnerable individuals for up to 1 year. The TMA expires on September 30, and this bill extends it for one additional quarter. 
   Along with the TMA extension is a one-quarter extension of the Abstinence Education program. In addition, the bill provides a one-quarter extension of the Qualifying Individual (QI) program. The QI program provides Medicare part B premium assistance to low-income seniors, helping ensure Medicare remains affordable for more than 200,000 seniors. 
   The legislation also includes provisions that will provide immediate relief to hospitals threatened by regulatory cuts, and a 6-month delay of the recently enacted requirement that all Medicaid prescriptions be written on tamper-resistant paper in order to be eligible for reimbursement. This latter provision postpones what would otherwise take effect on October 1, causing significant disruption in access to medicines. This will give pharmacies and physicians more time to prepare for the new requirement. 
   Finally, the bill invests an additional $385 million into the Medicare Physician Assistance and Quality Initiative Fund. This funding is used to improve care for millions of seniors and people with disabilities in Medicare. 
   These critical programs are fully funded under PAYGO by an item in the President's budget that extends the current Web-based SSI Asset Demonstration program to Medicaid in the two States in which it is currently operating. This demonstration program would be funded for 5 years. 
   Finally, this legislation extends and improves programs that are of critical importance to Americans young and old, and I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Representative McCaul actually represents the Johnson family in Congress. Their bipartisan efforts have helped move this bill to the floor, and I think they should be congratulated for the efforts. 
   I would say one thing, though. Former Congressman Jack Brooks is not deceased. He is still much alive, and Congressman Barton, I suspect you will be getting a call very shortly from Jack Brooks, as we all know, former dean of the Texas delegation.  
   I did have the opportunity at a very young age to meet President Johnson. In January 1973, I was a young State Representative in Austin, Texas, my first term. President Johnson came to our swearing in my first term in 1973, and I actually got a very candid photo with him that I hang proudly in our office here in Washington. He passed away a week later, and I was honored to be able to go to his funeral and his burial there at the Johnson Ranch. 
   President Johnson was a proud Texan, and back in those days, many of my Republican friends were Democrats as well. President Johnson pioneered issues such as civil rights and voting rights, but his educational leadership stands out even among these accomplishments. President Johnson passed away over 30 years ago, and to this day, he has no Federal buildings in his name in the Capitol area. So we believe the Education Building is a fitting honor. Presidents Reagan and Bush have been honored with the International Trade Center for President Reagan and the Central Intelligence Agency building for President Bush reflecting their priorities and contributions. 
   President Johnson presided during turbulent times in our Nation's history. He ascended to the presidency after the Kennedy assassination and faced a difficult conflict in Southeast Asia. President Johnson was a very human figure, but his legacy is with us in many ways today. 
   Lyndon Johnson's first priority in life was education. He was the first ``Education President.'' Before Johnson, educational opportunity in America was not a national priority, as it continues to be today for both our parties, including current President George W. Bush. 
   In 1927, Lyndon Baines Johnson's career and education began when he went to Southwest Texas State Teachers College in San Marcos, Texas. He earned money as a janitor and taught the fifth, sixth, and seventh grades at the Mexican-American School in the South Texas town of Cotulla. He taught later at Sam Houston High School, which is part of our congressional district. 
   As a Jeff Davis High School student, which Madam Speaker, you actually visited a few years ago, in 1965 and 1966, I saw the impact of the first Federal dollars that came to my high school firsthand. 
   In his memoirs, President Johnson declared, ``There is an old saying that kids is where the money ain't.'' And I need to repeat that. That may be true today, Madam Speaker, ``That kids is where the money ain't, which summed up one of the major problems confronting the American educational system when I became President.'' And that is a direct quote. 
   Continuing the quote, ``because of these convictions, I made a personal decision during the 1964 Presidential campaign to make education a fundamental issue and to put it high on the Nation's agenda. 
   ``I proposed to act on my belief that, regardless of a family's financial condition, education should be available to every child in the United States, as much education as he or she could absorb. I had no intention of walking away from this fight.'' 
   President Johnson succeeded in his fight to improve education for all Americans. He signed into law 60 education bills, including the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, which established the Head Start program, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, the Higher Education Act of 1965. 
   The Elementary and Secondary Education Act was the first real Federal assistance to grade school education, and it is widely supported today. The President actually signed that in a one-room schoolhouse in Stonewall, Texas, with his elementary school teacher. 
   In large part, President Johnson's education priorities are accepted by both political parties, as some of them were then. The Higher Education Act passed by 368-22 in the House and 79-3 in the Senate, strong bipartisanship votes. 
   In discussing President Johnson's education legacy, we have to recognize First Lady, Lady Bird Johnson, who was also a major contributor and strong advocate for his educational initiatives. During her White House years, Ms. Johnson served as honorary chair of the National Head Start program, the program for underprivileged school children which prepares them to take their places in the classroom on par with their peers. 
   In part for her education efforts, President Ford presented her with the country's highest civilian award, the Medal of Freedom. Mrs. Johnson turned 94 last December, and hopefully she is listening to this debate. 
   Mrs. Johnson also received the Congressional Gold Medal from President Reagan in 1988. This legislation is a fitting honor for both President Lyndon Baines Johnson and also First Lady, Lady Bird Johnson.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am proud to come from a state that has an impressive renewable energy standard--or RES--that was developed by Texans, for Texans, and that meets the needs of our state. 
   Unlike most state RES plans, which are based on a specific percentage of sales, the Texas RES plan has a fixed statewide renewable capacity requirement of 5,880 megawatts (MW) by 2015, which would represent about 5 percent of the state's energy capacity. 
   This isn't a question of whether or not we should encourage states to produce more electricity from renewable sources--we should. The question is whether a one-size-fits-all federal mandate is the best way to accomplish this goal. 
   States like ours are already encouraging the development of renewable energy resources. Because of the diversity of state RES plans, any federal RES mandate could undercut or preempt those efforts. Some states promote resources--like nuclear, fuel cells, biogas, or bio-diesel--that are not considered an eligible resource under this amendment. 
   I am most concerned with the impact on my constituents' electricity bills with a federal RES. I represent an underserved area where hard-working families cannot afford to face higher energy costs. 
   In order to meet a 15 percent Federal RES by 2020, based on a 30 percent capacity factor, Texas would need 29,159 MW of intermittent renewable capacity in operation by 2020. This is a 953 percent increase over its existing wind capacity, a 767 percent increase over its existing non-hydro renewable capacity, and a 396 percent increase over the 2015 state RES requirement of 5,880 MW. 
   Texas utilities will likely be forced to make payments to the Federal Government to meet this federal mandate. 
   Voting against this amendment doesn't mean you're against renewable electricity generation. It only means you believe each state should decide for themselves the goals and targets that meet each state's unique capabilities.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. 
   I don't know how many times this Congress has to vote against this. It's been defeated twice during the appropriations process. 
   Every analysis of the past decade has confirmed the critical need to expand and upgrade our Nation's transmission infrastructure, a need that's already raising the cost of electricity to many Americans and proving a barrier to diversifying our energy resources. Now is not the time to take a step backward. 
   I think it's interesting our three colleagues from New York, if it's an interstate line, it doesn't matter, but you may have problems getting it to New York. But also, New York was the last place that had a blackout simply because there was a problem in Ohio. 
   We need to have these transmission corridors across our country.  
   This amendment removes from federal law the grant of eminent domain authority that comes with the issuance of a construction permit by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, to a critical transmission project located in severely congested areas. 
   The Arcuri amendment would eliminate from the Energy Policy Act of 2005 the incentive provided for states to cure gaps in their state siting laws that are especially apparent when interstate projects are needed. 
   Nowhere else has Congress authorized FERC to grant approval for energy projects--such as natural gas pipelines--without also assuring the necessary federal eminent domain authority accompanies the permit, license, or certificate. 
   Under EPAct 2005, the only projects FERC will consider are those that are critically needed and for which States could not or would not act to approve in timely manner. 
   Yet, the Arcuri-Hinchey-Hall amendment would establish greater barriers to the success of these projects than any other energy project. 
   The same grant of eminent domain authority that is available to all other energy projects approved by FERC should be available to these critical transmission projects. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, rise today in strong support of this legislation. 
   This legislation along with the passage of the Rest and Recuperation for Troops Act yesterday and the Military Construction and VA Appropriations bill earlier this year, continues a strong record in this Congress of providing our troops with the funding and equipment they need in the field, and ensuring they have the healthcare and rest they need when they come home. 
   I applaud the Appropriations Committee's work to provide more than the President's request for combat equipment depleted in Iraq, operational training, National Guard and reserves' battle gear, support services for military families, and shipbuilding. 
   This bill appropriates $459.6 billion for Defense Department programs in FY 2008. The bill's total is $3.5 billion, just 1 percent less than the President's request, but $39.7 billion, or 9 percent more than comparable levels for last year's regular defense appropriations--not accounting for $165 billion in FY 2007 emergency supplemental defense funds for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan we sent the President earlier this year. 
   I thank the Committee for including an important project being worked on by a consortium of universities in Texas in collaboration with the Air Force, the Consortium for Nanotechnology in Aerospace Commerce and Technology (CONTACT). Through collaborations among the universities, the Air Force Research Laboratory, and the aerospace commercial sector, this unique partnership will develop leading-edge nanotechnology aerospace applications faster and better than could be achieved individually at each institution. 
   I hope to work with the Committee as they move to conference and in next year's cycle to highlight the importance of three other projects I requested that did not get funded. 
   The Radar/Video Fusion Vessel and Port Security Demonstration Project will develop a sensor package integrated to provide surveillance, warning, monitoring and tracking of ships, vessels, and integrate into current and future Houston Ship Channel surveillance capability. Increased security at ports and waterways, landside and waterside, is now an essential part of homeland defense. This is particularly true in Houston where ships and barges have direct access to high value sites where destruction of assets will cause major casualties and/or economic impact. 
   Two other projects, the Battleship TEXAS Restoration Project, and the Manganese Health Research Project, have each been funded in the past, and I hope the Chairman would work with me to see that these important projects receive the funding necessary to complete the projects in the future. 
   Again, I strongly support this bill which will provide essential funding for the military and our troops, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY CONSERVATION TAX ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. And if I had known we had so much time on our side, Jim, I would have asked you for time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I begin by stating how disappointed I am to come to the House floor today and speak against one of this Congress's first major energy initiatives. It pains me because I truly support the bill's goals of promoting clean, domestic, renewable energy. 
   What I disagree with is how this Congress chooses to pay for these worthy initiatives. I understand we have a budget deficit and funds for new alternative energy programs are in short supply, but like a broken record, this Congress continues to raid the piggybank of America's energy producers. 
   Now I know it makes great press releases to say this Congress is taking away the record profits of big oil to invest in renewable energy. But are we drafting press releases or are we drafting sound policy? 
   Earlier this year, I stood on the floor and supported H.R. 6, the Clean Energy Act, which included many of the same tax provisions as the bill today, and I encouraged my colleagues at that time to do the same. While I had concerns, it could reduce incentives for domestic production, the bill did not include more punitive measures that could destabilize our Nation's gasoline supply even further. 
   As a show of good faith during that critical 100 hours for our new majority, I voted for that bill. But I expressed my support for H.R. 6 on the floor concluding with my remarks with one important message: If we hit one industry for billions and billions of dollars, you can't go back for more and more and expect enough gasoline for our cars and fuel to heat and cool our homes. 
   Only 6 months later, here we are again, only this time we are almost doubling the amount of taxes on U.S. oil and gas companies. I am not here to protect the interest of big oil, I am here to protect the interests of the American consumer who relies on those critical energy supplies. And I'm here to protect the jobs of U.S. workers. 
   Neither of these interests are advanced if we in Congress continue to view America's energy industry as the ATM for Congress. 
   Everyone agrees we must invest more in renewable sources of energy, but this isn't a buffet. We don't have the luxury to pick and choose which energy resources our Nation will rely on. The Energy Information Administration predicts that natural gas, oil and coal will comprise approximately the same share of our total energy supply in 2030 as it did in 2005, even with the new investments for renewable energy. That is why our Nation's energy security requires tax policies that promote greater supplies of these fuels, not policies that hinder domestic production and refinery capacity.  
   H.R. 6 included tax provisions that brought in $7.7 billion, mostly from the section 199 repeal. That same section now scores $11.4. In only 6 months, the same proposal has increased in cost by an additional $4 billion. 
   This large increase in new taxes targeted at the U.S. energy industry will reduce our Nation's energy security by discouraging domestic oil and gas production, discouraging new investments in refining capacity, and actually tilting the competitive playing field for global energy resources against U.S.-based oil and gas companies.  
   I've heard many Members of this chamber preach to the energy industry on the need to reduce the cost of gasoline for consumers and invest more in refinary capacity. 
   Can anyone tell me how increasing their taxes could possibly accomplish these twin goals? 
   From 1992-2006 the five major oil companies invested $765 billion in new capital energy infrastructure, compared to their net income of $662 billion. 
   These companies invested more than they earned, and less money in their coffers means less money for critical infrastructure investments. 
   And finally, let's talk about jobs. In the United States, there are almost 1.9 million Americans directly employed in the oil and natural gas industry and almost 6 million total U.S. jobs resulting from oil and gas activity when indirect and other employment is considered. 
   Increasing costs on the domestic oil and gas industry, and on U.S. based oil and gas companies operating abroad, will jeopardize these highpaying jobs. 
   So before this Congress makes yet another ATM withdrawal from the oil and gas industry, let us not ignore the big picture of ensuring Americans have a stable supply of energy to help move us towards our long term goals of cleaner energy sources. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for sound energy policy and vote against this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, the energy package before us today--H.R. 3221 and H.R. 2776--includes legislation passed by eleven House committees with the goals to address global warming and America's ``energy independence.'' 
   H.R. 3221 includes bills I supported in the Energy and Commerce Committee on which I serve. The Energy and Commerce Committee bills will improve the Nation's energy efficiency, develop a ``smart'' electricity grid, improve the Department of Energy's Loan Guarantee program, increase the availability of renewable fuels, and encourage the development of advanced technology vehicles and components. 
   I do have reservations about Title VII, the Natural Resources Committee provisions, which would scale back and repeal several important provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 that help encourage new domestic production of oil and natural gas. 
   While I have reservations with these provisions, I appreciate the efforts of House Leadership for bringing together several Members of Congress that represent energy-producing Districts to review and improve the legislation. While not perfect, we reduced agency timeframes to approve or reject drilling permits and coastal energy projects, as well as removed provisions that would delay energy corridors and eliminate the royalty-in-kind program. 
   While I intend to support H.R. 3221, I will oppose the Renewable Electricity Standard. We should encourage states to produce more electricity from renewable sources; the question is whether a ``one-size-fits-all'' Federal mandate is the best way to accomplish this goal, which could raise electricity rates for Texas consumers. 
   I will oppose H.R. 2776--a $15 billion tax package--because it includes additional provisions above those carefully negotiated in H.R. 6, the CLEAN Energy Act. While it includes important renewable energy provisions, we cannot keep taxing American's energy industry and expect to have adequate supplies of energy. 
   The Energy Information Administration predicts that natural gas, oil, and coal will compromise approximately the same share of our total energy supply in 2030 that they did in 2005, even with new investments in renewable sources of energy. 
   This large increase in new taxes targeted at the U.S. energy industry could reduce our Nation's energy security by discouraging new domestic oil and gas production, discouraging new investments in refinery capacity, and actually tilting the competitive playing field for global energy resources against U.S. based oil and gas companies. 
   As we move forward in this Congress, I hope the House of Representatives will address America's need to produce additional domestic energy, both conventional and renewable, to ensure the reliability and affordability of our Nation's critical energy supplies.

   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today to show my support for H. Res. 1024. 
   This resolution recognizes the 187th anniversary of the independence of Greece and celebrates Greek and American democracy. 
   On March 25, 1821, Greece declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire, and the United States and Greece have had a longstanding relationship ever since. 
   The Greek community is particularly active in our own country. 
   Greece shares our democratic values and principles and has been an important ally to the United States, particularly since World War I. 
   As the most senior EU and NATO country in their region, they serve as a great role model for democracy, stability, and security for other countries in their region. 
   I look forward to continued bilateral relations and friendship with Greece as we work together to address the issues in Southeast Europe.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - November 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, its unfortunate we have to be here today to override the president's veto of H.R. 1495 (WRDA), a bill which has such overwhelming support in our districts across the country. 
   Now is not the time for inaction on our nation's infrastructure and environment. The previous three Congresses have failed to do so, and because of that, much needed flood control projects in Houston, Texas have been delayed. 
   WRDA includes language for the Halls Bayou Federal Flood Control Project in Houston which will allow the Harris County Flood Control District (HCFCD) to start work on this project in the near future. 
   Historic flooding along Halls Bayou has been severe and frequent in some neighborhoods. During Tropical Storm Allison in June 2001, Halls Bayou was hit very hard, with more than 8,000 homes flooding within the watershed. No project can keep all homes from flooding but a project can help reduce the risk of flooding for a significant number of families, reducing the need for federal assistance, property damage, and loss of life. 
   The purpose of section 5157 of this legislation which pertains to Halls Bayou is to allow the HCFCD to conduct the General Reevaluation Review (GRR) and any subsequent federal interest project on Halls Bayou. The Corps is limited in its staff, resources, and time with the many projects in the Galveston District and the Southwest Division. Local project sponsors with the necessary expertise, like Harris County, can provide efficiency by becoming more involved. 
   Halls Bayou, a major tributary of Greens Bayou, was authorized in WRDA 1990 as part of the Buffalo Bayou and Tributaries Project. The original Halls Bayou authorization assumed the Greens Bayou project in place, which is now finishing a GRR. Results indicate that the work on Greens Bayou downstream of Halls Bayou will not have federal work although it will have significant local projects. Therefore, a GRR is now needed for Halls Bayou as well. 
   While conducting the GRR to find a possible federal interest, Harris County can begin project implementation in order to reduce future flood damage as soon as possible. Adding Halls Bayou to Section 211(f) allows Harris County to be reimbursed if the project is later approved by the Secretary. I want to thank the Chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Chairman OBEY, and my good friend from Texas, Subcommittee Chairwoman EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON, for including this and other meritorious projects for Harris County. 
   I support this bill and the balance that it strikes between the need to improve water resources for human purposes and to preserve our water uses for the environment and future generations. The projects in this bill are much needed, and I hope the Senate will also soon vote to override the President's veto so these projects can become law.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the conference report accompanying the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill funding the Departments of Labor, HHS, and Education, as well as Military Construction and the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
   On the domestic side, this legislation makes important investments in our health care and education programs. After many years of flat funding and small increases that have resulted in funding reductions when taking inflation into account, the National Institutes of Health would receive a 4 percent increase over current funding levels. This legislation provides $30 billion for life-saving medical research, much of which is performed in my back yard at the Baylor College of Medicine, the MD Anderson Cancer Center, UT Health Science Center, and many other impressive research facilities located in the Texas Medical Center. 
   I am also pleased that the bill provides a 35 percent increase for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. The $2.4 billion in LIHEAP funding that this bill provides will better ensure that LIHEAP funding is more equitably distributed among cold weather and hot weather states. By providing LIHEAP funding above the threshold of $1.975 billion, this legislation ensures that the funding will be sufficient to meet the historical needs of cold weather states while also recognizing the unmet needs of hot weather states, which experience higher levels of weather-related deaths. 
   I would also like to thank the conference committee for retaining House-passed funding for two projects in our district. The conference committee generously provided funding for Gateway to Care, the community health care access collaborative in Harris County. Gateway to Care will utilize this funding to help coordinate the deployment of health information technology among the county's health care clinics. The bill also provides much-needed funding for the Harris County Hospital District's Diabetes Program, which offers a culturally-sensitive, interdisciplinary, and educational approach to the treatment of diabetes in our community, which experiences higher than normal rates of this devastating disease. 
   As Veterans' Day approaches, we should also highlight the significant funding increases made in the Military Construction/VA portion of the bill. The conference agreement provides a total of $109.2 billion for veterans' affairs and military construction programs, roughly $18 billion more than the current level and $4 billion more than the president's request. For the last 11 months, this Congress has demonstrated its commitment to fulfilling the promises made to our veterans, and this bill reaffirms that commitment in the strongest terms by providing the largest funding increase in VA history. With the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan creating hundreds of thousands of new veterans, this level of funding reassures our veterans, our troops, and their families that this Congress will fulfill the promises we made to those who fight for our country, even after they are done with their service. 
   I would also like to offer my thanks for the inclusion of funding for a new fire station at Ellington Field. I have supported this project for several years, and am glad to see it funded in this bill. The existing fire station at Ellington field is in a rapidly deteriorating condition and does not meet OSHA or Air Force Standards. Roof leaks and lack of insulation have resulted in equipment being destroyed and extremely high operating costs. New firefighting apparatus must be parked outside the station because they will not fit into the truck bays. This fire station supports all flying operations at Ellington Field including Air National Guard, Army National Guard, US Coast Guard, NASA, and civilian aircraft. Construction of the new fire station at Ellington is critical for the Texas Air National Guard and all units stationed at Ellington Field, and I am pleased funding for this project was included. 
   Madam Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this conference report.

   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague and both the Government Reform Committee and Rules Committee for allowing this resolution to be considered today. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it. 
   The Dynamo soccer team arrived in Houston just 2 years ago, and in the team's first two seasons, they won back-to-back MLS Cups. The Dynamo are the first team to do so in over a decade and have immediately drawn a huge fan base in Houston for their success. 
   Dynamo coach Dominic Kinnear has guided the team to 26 wins, 20 draws, and 16 losses in its first two seasons in Houston. The Cup win this season came over the New England Revolution, the same team the Dynamo defeated in 2006 to win their first MLS Cup and the 2007 match to an attendance of merely 40,000. The 2007 Cup win was a come-from-behind victory in which Dwayne De Rosario assisted on the tying goal to Joseph Ngwenya, and scored the winning goal to take home the most valuable player honors from the match. 
   The Dynamo managed to accomplish this without the most valuable player from their 2006 Cup win, Brian Ching, who was sidelined with an injury. 
   Texas and Houston have a long history of being a football State and town, but I first learned about soccer when I was in college playing goalie just during college sports. My two children grew up playing soccer in the 1980s when they were young in Houston. Over the years, I watched soccer grow not only in the suburbs but also in the very inner city, and you can hardly have a flat field, flat surface, without having soccer goals put up. 
   Today in our district and throughout the Houston area, countless numbers of children have played and become soccer fans, and the Dynamos' success since arriving in Houston greatly increased the interest in the game. 
   Four of the Dynamo stars, Brad Davis, Eddie Robinson, Ricardo Clark, and Stuart Holden, have been selected for the U.S. Men's National Team roster that will face Team Mexico at Reliant Stadium tonight in Houston. This is the most players of any club represented on our national team, and it includes the Houston native, Stuart Holden, who played his high school soccer in Houston.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (EXTENDING PARITY IN APPLICATION OF CERTAIN LIMITS TO MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4848. This legislation is an extension of the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996. 
   This bill requires that annual and lifetime dollar limits for mental health treatment under group health plans offering mental health coverage be no less than that for physical illnesses. 
   Mental disorders are the leading cause of disability in the U.S. for individuals between the ages of 15-44. In fact, 54 million Americans currently suffer from mental illness. 
   Unfortunately, the stigma of mental illness prevents millions of Americans from receiving the health care they need. Arbitrary limits on insurance benefits also serve as a significant barrier to many Americans seeking help. 
   The original Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 was an important first step toward mental health parity and mandated that annual and lifetime limits in mental health coverage be equal to those applied to medical and surgical benefits. 
   While I support this bill, I strongly believe that we must pass H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2007. 
   The scientific community has long told us that mental illness and substance abuse are biologically-based, and the Surgeon General recognized that fact in the 1999 Surgeon General's report. 
   The sad reality, however, is that the health insurance market still does not provide true parity to mental health and substance abuse coverage. 
   Individuals who struggle with mental illness or substance abuse have no guarantee they'll get the treatment they need--even if they have health insurance. 
   Mental illness and substance abuse are serious issues for many Americans who too often do not receive the appropriate treatment. Twenty-six million Americans struggle with substance abuse addictions. 
   I hope that we will recognize the struggles that individuals with substance abuse addictions face in seeking treatment. 
   I strongly support H.R. 4848 and hope that we will build on this piece of legislation by considering H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2007 sometime this session.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I gave a 1-minute earlier that compared the hope for embryonic research with the new research that is being done on other stem cells. But, in all honesty, we need to be looking at everything to deal with the illnesses that we have. 
   Embryonic stem cell research is the hope for millions of Americans. Embryonic stem cell research is now supported by educational and religious affiliated institutions, but they need Federal Government help to find the cures for spinal cord injuries, Alzheimer's and many other illnesses. 
   Let me talk about two personal examples of the imperative need for this Federal assistance to find these cures. I know of a young lady named Monica who had her spinal cord severed in an auto accident. She is young enough to benefit from aggressive research on a cure. We need all the research dollars we can get into embryonic stem cell, adult stem cells and others to be able to deal with this young lady who has the possibility that her spinal cord could be regenerated. It may be next year. It may be 10 years or 20 years. But let's don't take that hope away. 
   Another example is my mother-in-law. She was diagnosed in 1996 with Alzheimer's. And my wife and I have lived for the last 10 years watching my mother-in-law die. She died the day after Christmas. She hasn't known either of us for over 2 years. She was in a research facility in Houston, at Baylor College of Medicine, that could just monitor her progress on a yearly basis. For the last 2 years, we couldn't take her to the hospital or to the doctor's office. And we watched Alzheimers make that happen. 
   It is too late for my mother-in-law's generation. But it is not too late to change it for the next generation, Mr. Speaker, and Members. And to stand up here today and say it is a sin to do this research, it is a sin not to do the research. It is not a sin to try and use embryonic cells. It is a sin not to do this research.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (IN SUPPORT OF EMBRYONIC STEM CELL RESEARCH -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today, we will vote on a bill to provide changes to a merciless Federal stem cell policy, changes that are still relevant and still necessary despite the recent discovery of stem cells derived from amniotic fluid cells. 
   To be sure, this is an important discovery, but the same scientists championing this research have stressed the amniotic cells are not a substitute for embryonic stem cells. While they hold the great promise of turning into some cell types, only embryonic stem cells can divide indefinitely and evolve into any cell type in the body. 
   If anything, the recent amniotic stem cell study proves that it is critical to explore all kinds of stem cell research, since advancements in one area of stem cell research could lead to lifesaving discoveries in others. By prohibiting Federal funds of more embryonic stem cell research, the current policy shuts the door on this collaborative research and slams it in the face of millions of Americans suffering from incurable diseases. 
   We have the opportunity today to advance this promising research that could offer cures for the scourges of our times. To purposefully keep the doors to a cure closed is a patent failure of our responsibility to ease human suffering from scores of incurable diseases.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND MEDICARE PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act. 
   This is the best piece of legislation since 1997 when the children's health care was created, but this time we will cover 5 million more children if we vote ``yes'' today for this bill. 
   I want to particularly thank the committee, although we didn't get to have a markup in ours because the Republican minority refused to let us even have votes on our amendments, so we have to have it on the floor today. We have to have that discussion. I am just glad they included that it would cover 12 months of insurability for our children, because some States have made 6 months the way to cut children off of health care. 
   Let me say one other thing. I have heard, particularly last night, I think it was insulting to say that this bill takes money away from seniors to give to illegal alien children. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. That's just outrageous. When you look at the bill and actually current law that we don't change, it prohibits undocumented children from getting any assistance. 
   Now the States are going to be the ones that have to prove that. If the States can't do it, they have to pay for it. It is just outrageous that you throw out the ``illegals'' every time you don't have any other argument.  
   I am particularly proud of the SCHIP provisions in this legislation, which would provide much-needed health insurance coverage to low-income children in need. 
   Currently, the SCHIP program provides coverage to 6 million low-income American children. 
   Unfortunately, an additional 6 million children are eligible for SCHIP benefits, yet remain uninsured. 
   This legislation would reach about 5 million of those children by putting in place a more efficient funding formula based on projected enrollment and providing states with incentives to find eligible children and get them enrolled. 
   I am particularly thankful for the committee's support of our language to ensure that children in SCHIP get 12 months of continuous eligibility. 
   This provision is critical to ensuring that eligible SCHIP children remain in the program and are not dropped due to cumbersome bureaucratic requirements imposed on families whose primary focus is on making ends meet. 
   A recent Health Affairs article underscores the importance of continuous eligibility in addressing retention problems in SCHIP. 
   Of the policy options suggested, the authors state that ``[f]irst and foremost, the renewal process should be simplified as much as possible, by reducing the frequency of renewal to once a year.'' 
   This bill does just that. 
   For many states, this bill reaffirms the compassionate and effective policies currently in place. 
   But for a state like mine, this bill will ensure that the State of Texas does right by Texas children and doesn't use the flexibility inherent in the program to kick them off the rolls on a budgetary whim. 
   I encourage my colleagues to stand up for low-income children and pass this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1495, WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the Subcommittee on Water Resources and the full Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for reporting out the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) and getting through conference so we can send a bill to the President. 
   The previous two Congresses have failed to do so, and because of that, much needed flood control projects in Houston, TX, had been put on hold. I appreciate the inclusion of our language for the Halls Bayou Federal Flood Control Project in Houston, which will allow the Harris County Flood Control District, HCFCD, to start work on this project in the near future. 
   Historic flooding along Halls Bayou has been severe and frequent in some neighborhoods. During Tropical Storm Allison in June 2001, Halls Bayou was hit very hard, with more than 8,000 homes flooding within the watershed. No project can keep all homes from flooding, but a project can help reduce the risk of flooding for a significant number of families, reducing the need for Federal assistance, property damage, and loss of life. 
   The purpose of section 5157 of this legislation which pertains to Halls Bayou is to allow the HCFCD to conduct the General Reevaluation Review, GRR, and any subsequent Federal interest project on Halls Bayou. The Corps is limited in its staff, resources, and time with the many projects in the Galveston District and the Southwest Division. Local project sponsors with the necessary expertise, like Harris County, can provide efficiency by becoming more involved. 
   Halls Bayou, a major tributary of Greens Bayou, was authorized in WRDA 1990 as part of the Buffalo Bayou and Tributaries Project. The original Halls Bayou authorization assumed the Greens Bayou project in place, which is now finishing a GRR. Results indicate that the work on Greens Bayou downstream of Halls Bayou will not have Federal work, although it will have significant local projects. Therefore, a GRR is now needed for Halls Bayou as well. 
   While conducting the GRR to find a possible Federal interest, Harris County can begin project implementation in order to reduce future flood damage as soon as possible. Adding Halls Bayou to Section 211(f) allows Harris County to be reimbursed if the project is later approved by the Secretary. I thank the Subcommittee, full Committee, and the Conference for their work on this Issue. 
   I support this bill and the balance that it strikes between the need to improve water resources for human purposes and to preserve our water uses for the environment and future generations. The projects in this bill are much needed, and I'm pleased the conference committee was able to complete its work so we can get a bill to the President.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON S. CON. RES. 21, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I support the conference committee report and thank both the chairman and the Budget Committee for their good work.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the conference report accompanying the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution. This budget resolution represents a return to fiscal soundness for our country, which has operated without a budget resolution in 3 of the last 5 years. This budget will help our country emerge from a sea of red ink and put us on a path toward a budget surplus in the next 5 years, with a $41 billion surplus projected for 2012. 
   Key to the fiscal responsibility in this budget is the inclusion of critical budget enforcement provisions known as PAYGO. This budget extends to the Senate the PAYGO rules adopted earlier this year in the House, which ensure that any future tax cuts or increases in mandatory spending are offset elsewhere in the budget. This budget hews to that principle and does not include any new mandatory spending that is not offset. 
   Mr. Speaker, I also applaud our House and Senate Budget Committee Chairmen for their attention to the domestic needs of this country and the resources this budget dedicates for health care programs and research that have suffered in previous budgets. The conference  report provides a reserve fund of up to $50 billion for the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program. As a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which is working to reauthorize the SCHIP program, I want to make sure the program is available to the 6 million American children who are currently eligible but not enrolled in the program. The reserve fund in this budget will allow us to expand the program for these children while also maintaining fiscal discipline under PAYGO. 
   On the discretionary side, the budget resolution includes an additional $20 billion over last year's level for health programs. In years past, worthy health care programs like trauma systems funding, Emergency Medical Services for Children, Health Centers and NIH research funding have been forced to compete for funding that was not sufficient to meet our health care needs. This budget recognizes the importance of adequately funding domestic priorities like health care and education programs that are true investments in our country's future. 
   I thank our House conferees for their work on this budget resolution and congratulate them on this truly balanced budget, in terms of both the deficit and the needs of the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my support for the Head Start Reauthorization Bill that was sent to this Chamber. 
   Head Start is one of the best programs we offer our youngest students. 
   Since its creation in 1965, it has proven to be our most valuable school readiness program in the history of this country. 
   Especially, now that we know more about the importance of early-childhood education. 
   Time after time, we have seen reports that prove students who attend Head Start perform better than those who don't. 
   It has also proven to help close the achievement gap between students of differing socioeconomic status. 
   The Republican amendment to this bill would repeal existing civil rights protections that ensure programs cannot use federal funds to discriminate in their hiring practices. 
   Head Start teachers should be chosen because they are qualified and effective teachers who will help children succeed and thrive. 
   Discrimination should not be supported with public funds. 
   National religious organizations, civil rights groups, national labor organizations, and the education groups all oppose any roll back of civil rights protections. 
   This is such a critical program, and it's important that this body reauthorize this program in a manner that shows bipartisan support for educating our children. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
   Thousands of children in my district benefit from Head Start and it's essential that we reauthorize this program with a bipartisan plan that will help this program serve more children effectively.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Georgia. 
   I rise in support of the resolution and to pay tribute to my friend and fellow member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Dr. Charlie Norwood. 
   Charlie came to Congress after my first term as part of the class of 1994, and it seems a year did not go by that we did not serve on a committee together. 
   I honorably served with him at first on the Education and Workforce Committee and then later on the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
   Charlie and I shared a passion for health care issues, and I particularly enjoyed our work together on the Health Subcommittee. 
   A dentist by training, Charlie was devoted to improving the health care system, not only for providers like himself but also for the patients that rely on our health care system to keep them well. 
   The phrase Patients' Bill of Rights would not have been coined if Charlie and our chairman, JOHN DINGELL, had not teamed up to give patients an ability to fight back against the HMOs that too often make health care decisions based on the bottom line, rather than a physician's recommendation. 
   I note Charlie's last legislative act before leaving Washington and returning to Georgia was to reintroduce the Patients' Bill of Rights in this Congress as H.R. 979. 
   There is no doubt in my mind that this legislation will be Charlie's legacy and will honor him and his work in this esteemed Chamber by finally making his vision of patients' rights a reality. 
   Last July 4 recess, Charlie and I joined two other members of the Health Subcommittee as we visited the impressive trauma facilities utilized by our brave military doctors to treat our wounded service personnel in Balad and Baghdad, Iraq and Kabul, Afghanistan. 
   I knew there was a good reason Charlie and I got along, despite being different parties, but I also realized that  trip that Charlie and I shared a lot of interests, and one of them in firearms. I met few people with more enthusiasm for firearms than Charlie Norwood. 
   In fact, I will mention that how he cared about people, and Chairman DEAL understands that, he presented a book to those of us who went. It has a picture of Charlie Norwood with a .50-caliber machine gun in a helicopter we were flying in, but Charlie was not really happy because he was not sitting behind that .50-caliber machine gun. 
   Charlie was a good doctor and honorable Member of Congress and a great friend. He always thought of others, and I will always remember him for his friendship for these years. Our thoughts are with his family, and his wife Gloria has become a good friend of my wife Helen through the Congressional Spouses, and I will miss Charlie, and we all will. We honor his memory and his contributions to our country.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (MERCURY EXPORT BAN ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1534, the Mercury Export Ban of 2007. This bill is a bipartisan effort that will effectively reduce the amount of elemental mercury in the atmosphere. 
   Mercury is a neurotoxin that is very harmful to children, fetuses, and pregnant women. It took us many years to realize there are negative health effects associated with mercury. Once the true health effects of mercury were realized in the US its use for manufacturing and products was decreased. 
   The decrease in the use of mercury has left us burdened with reserves of commercial mercury that is being sold to recyclers who have no means of disposing of the mercury. The recyclers sell this mercury to brokers who distribute this mercury on the global market. 
   Once on the global market this mercury is used by small scale gold miners who unknowingly allow their miners to unsafely expose themselves to mercury. 
   Once the mercury is released into the atmosphere or water we are allowing other countries to contribute to a global mercury contamination problem. 
   We essentially are selling mercury to other countries in an attempt to get rid of it only to have the mercury come back to us in the form of contamination. 
   This bill would ban exporting elemental mercury by 2010 and the sale, distribution, or transfer of elemental mercury between state and local government, Federal agency, or private entity except for storage purposes. 
   It would also require the EPA issue a report to Congress one year after the ban to address the issue of mercury in the U.S. and create an Excess Mercury Storage Committee so that we can address the storage and health issues related to elemental mercury in the U.S. 
   This is a good bill and I strongly urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 493, the Genetic Non-Discrimination Act. This bill is the product of 10 years of hard work by my colleague Ms. SLAUGHTER and I applaud her for her efforts to pass this bill. 
   The sequencing of the human genome was an amazing scientific advancement, and has contributed to the rise of genetic testing to inform patients of their proclivity for disease. 
   Thanks to genetic testing, individuals with a risk of an illness can take precautionary steps ahead of time to ward off disease, which will contribute to lower health care costs over time. 
   However, it is critical that we protect individuals from any discrimination that could result from the information these tests reveal. 
   The results should not be used by health insurers to deny anyone coverage or increase their premiums because of a pre-disposition to a certain disease. 
   And the results should not be used by employers to discriminate against employees based on their predisposition to disease. 
   The passage of this bill will encourage individuals to seek genetic testing if they so desire without fear of losing their health insurance and give them the ability to seek early medical treatment. 
   One segment of the health care marketplace was excluded from the bill's protections--the long-term care insurance market. This bill was never intended to regulate the long-term care insurance market, and I understand that current statute treats long-term care insurance differently. 
   However, individuals that determine that they are at high-risk for developing Alzheimer's disease will undoubtedly begin planning for their long-term care and probably purchase long-term care insurance. 
   Despite all of the good intentions in this legislation, the bill would allow long-term care insurance underwriters to refuse to cover or charge individuals predisposed to such disease higher premiums for a disease they have yet to develop and may never develop. 
   As we move forward, Congress should ensure that future legislation extends the patient protections inherent in this bill to consumers who want to plan for their future and purchase long-term care. 
   With that, I am pleased to support this important legislation and send this bill to the President.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY CONSERVATION TAX ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I've always believed as a Nation we should wean ourselves from our dependence on fossil fuels and invest in the energy of the future. However, I also believe we must promote the technologies of tomorrow in a way that will benefit, not harm, our constituents and our long-term energy security. 
   Today, the House is making its fourth attempt this Congress to pass a renewable energy tax package, H.R. 5351. I supported the first attempt last January, H.R. 6, even though I feared it could reduce incentives for domestic production. 
   Every House package since includes a new or different combination of revenue raisers that target the energy industry and extract billions more than prior versions. If Congress singles out one industry for billions of dollars, you cannot go back for more and expect enough gasoline for our cars and fuel to heat and cool our homes. 
   Compared to the original H.R. 6, H.R. 5351 includes $17.6 billion in new taxes on the energy industry. That's an increase of over $10 billion in just 1 year. House debates on these measures have been filled with misinformation and unwillingness to review the facts. If Congress took a moment to inject objective analysis in the debate, we could see that the profit margins of energy industries are in line with and, in many cases, below that of other industries. 
   For every dollar of sales in the third quarter of 2007, the oil and natural gas industry earned 7.6 cents in profit margin, compared to 21.6 cents for the beverage and tobacco industry, 18.8 cents for the pharmaceutical industry, 14.6 cents for the electrical equipment industry, and 14.5 cents for the computer equipment industry. 
   Again, nationwide, all manufacturing companies, excluding the struggling automotive industry, earned 9.2 cents per dollar of sales, as compared to energy that was 7.6. So there may be great profits in it, but there are also great profits in other corporations. 
   So are the profits of the energy industry disproportionate with most U.S. industries? Clearly the answer is no. If you evaluate industry tax contributions, we would see that companies are paying more than their fair share and growing the numbers in the coffers of State, Federal and local governments.  
   In 2006 the effective tax rate for the top energy companies was 37 percent, more than the top corporate tax rate of 35 percent. Between 2004 and 2006, the total current income taxes paid by the 27 top energy companies nearly doubled, nearly doubled in 2 years, growing from $44 billion to $81 billion. So we do have a progressive tax, and it has doubled with the profits. 
   Recently, the amount that ExxonMobil, a frequent target of criticism, paid in U.S. taxes actually exceeded their U.S. earnings by $18.7 billion. So ExxonMobil is paying a lot of taxes. And I'm not so sure that ExxonMobil or Chevron or ConocoPhillips, or any of the energy industry, if they pay more taxes in this bill, that it will actually not go back to the bottom line that we're already paying at the pump, or to pay to heat and cool our homes. 
   I wish I could tell you they're going to take it out of their profits, but they're not required to do that. They could just raise prices, and so we'll see even more price increases. 
   Despite these figures, no industry is as heavily scrutinized as America's oil and natural gas companies. That's probably because most of the production in our country comes from Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Alaska. Most States don't want it. But they always want their lights to be turned on and their cars to be filled up. 
   What's most concerning is we continue to move tax packages that target this industry and expect different results. 
   The Senate has twice failed to reach cloture on these provisions, and the President continues to issue veto threats. 
   We're debating press releases and not actually legislating. We did legislate last January and we had a tax package that passed this House with only four negative democratic votes. But since then we've had problems with it. 
   It's time we get serious about our renewable energy and conservation policy. Let's put rhetoric aside for a moment and find a way to move forward on a renewable energy package that can actually become law without jeopardizing our energy security.  
   Mr. Speaker, I have always believed that as a Nation we should wean ourselves from our dependence on fossil fuels and invest in the energy of the future.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, as cosponsor of this legislation for multiple Congresses, I rise in strong support and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Paycheck Fairness Act. 
   This legislation would take meaningful steps to empower women to negotiate for equal pay, to create strong incentives for employers to follow the law, and to strengthen federal outreach and lenforcement efforts. 
   According to the 2006 Census Bureau, women still earned only about 77 percent as much as men did. Women of color were worse off--African American women made 66 cents on the dollar compared to the highest earners, white men, while Hispanic women made only 55 cents. As a result, according to the Institute of Women's Policy Research, working women stand to lose anywhere between $400,000 and $2 million dollars over the course of their career because of unequal pay practices. While women's wages and educational attainment hve been rising, there is still a sizeable gender wage gap. Only a portion of the difference in pay can be explained by experience, education, or qualifications. 
   Using data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau between 2004-2006, my own state of Texas ranked 7th in the nation in gender based wage equity, with women earning on average 80.7 percent of what their male counterparts earned. Although this is slightly better than the national average, it is obvious that there is still work to be done. At the current rate of wage growth for men and women in Texas, the National Committee on Pay Equity estimates that it will take another 38 years before this wage gap is closed. 
   It is well past time for something be done to close the gender wage gap so that men and women have the same opportunity to a decent working wage. The original Equal Pay Act signed by President Kennedy 45 years ago called for ``equal pay for equal work''. Although it has come a long way, the fight for equal pay and treatment is still an ongoing struggle. 
   The Paycheck Fairness Act would help address these conditions by amending and strengthening the EPA, so that it will be a more effective tool in combating gender-based pay discrimination. H.R. 1338 will close numerous loopholes in the 45-year-old law that has enabled employers to evade liability. It will also create a new grant program to help strengthen the negotiation skills of girls and women. 
   Congress must pass this legislation to help ensure that this goal becomes a reality, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1338.

   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 493, the Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act. 
   The sequencing of the human genome was an amazing scientific advancement, and has contributed to the rise of genetic testing to inform patients of their proclivity for disease. Thanks to genetic testing, individuals with a risk of an illness can take precautionary steps ahead of time to ward off disease, which will contribute to lower health care costs over time. 
   As we take advantage of this scientific progress, however, it is critical that we protect individuals from any discrimination that could result from the information these tests reveal. The results should not be used by health insurers to deny anyone coverage or increase their premiums because of a pre-disposition to a certain disease. Likewise, the results should not be used by employers to discriminate against employees based on their predisposition to disease. 
   I am proud to be a co-sponsor of this legislation, which our colleagues Ms. Slaughter and Mrs. Biggert have been working on for over a decade now. The health care marketplace has changed significantly since the bill's original introduction, and important changes were made to the bill during the 108th Congress to refine the bill's definitions and scope. 
   During the Energy and Commerce Committee's consideration of the bill, we learned about one segment of the health care marketplace that was excluded from the bill's protections--the long-term care insurance market. The bill sponsors and supporters all agreed that this bill was never intended to regulate the long-term care insurance market, and I understand that current statute treats long-term care insurance differently. 
   Regardless of the bill's original intent, the fact remains that the long-term care exclusion in this bill would allow a long-term care insurer to discriminate against an individual on the basis of genetic information. If an individual determines that she is at high-risk for developing Alzheimer's disease, the next obvious step is to plan her future care for Alzheimer's, including the purchase of long-term care insurance. Despite all of the good intentions in this legislation, the bill would allow long-term care insurance underwriters to refuse to cover her or charge her higher premiums for a disease she has yet to develop and may never develop. 
   As a Congress that continues to encourage Americans to plan for their future, we should ensure that future legislation extends the patient protections inherent in this bill to consumers who want to plan for their future and purchase long-term care. With that, Madam Speaker, I am pleased to support this important legislation and encourage my colleagues to vote for its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (VISION CARE FOR KIDS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I'd like to thank my colleague on our Energy and Commerce Committee and Health Subcommittee for allowing me to rush in from the airport to be able to put a statement on this bill. 
   I rise, obviously, in support of H.R. 507, the Vision Care for Kids Act. This bill has been crafted in a very bipartisan fashion with the leadership of my colleagues, Mr. Fossella, Mr. Pascrell, Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Engel, and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. I'd like to thank them for their dedication to children's vision issues in this legislation in particular. 
   The Vision Care for Kids Act establishes a much-needed grant program to provide follow-up vision care to uninsured children with vision disorders. As we tried to target the program to the children most in need, we learned very quickly that a child's access to vision screening and comprehensive vision care varies widely depending on individual State laws. For example, some States have no vision screening requirements, whereas 30 States currently mandate vision screening. Twenty-eight of these States with screening mandates, however, do not have or offer any guarantee that children who fail the screening will receive a follow-up eye exam. 
   On a nationwide basis, as many as 80 percent of the children who fail a vision screening do not get the follow-up care they need. Among the parents of these children, 25 percent cite financial constraints as a primary reason their child does not receive important follow-up care more than any other factor influencing their lack of care. 
   This lack of vision care jeopardizes a child's development and can unfortunately lead to lifelong vision impairment. These children deserve a healthy start to their educational and social development, yet the reality is that nearly two of three children entering elementary school have never received preventive vision care. Unfortunately, the lack of health experience presents a barrier to the delivery of appropriate vision care in this country. For many children who are lucky enough to have health insurance for medical care, their policy doesn't cover vision coverage. This is precisely why this bill is necessary.     
   By targeting the program toward children who are school age, uninsured, and at risk for vision disorders, the bill is designed to spend scarce health care dollars in the wisest manner possible. A portion of the grant funds will also be used to increase education and awareness of vision disorders so that the warning signs can be recognized and any problems can be detected in a timely fashion. 
   During the committee consideration of this legislation, we made several changes in the underlying bill. Specifically, we clarified that the Secretary should consult with professional and patient organizations when developing the criteria associated with the grant program's operations and data collection. This amendment also specifies an authorization level of $65 million over 5 years and includes a State-matching requirement of 25 percent. 
   The compromise could not have been developed without the dedication of key members of the vision community, including the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the American Optometric Association, the Vision Council of America, and Prevent Blindness America.  
   As a founding member of the Congressional Vision Caucus, I am particularly pleased to see this bill on the House floor today and consider it a milestone for our very young caucus. In 2003, I joined my colleagues David Price, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and Pat Tiberi in establishing the Congressional Vision Caucus. Today the Vision Caucus is comprised of more than 100 Members of the House, both Republican and Democrat, House Members and Senators. While our initial goal was to raise the awareness of vision disorders in Congress, the caucus has developed and endorsed two key pieces of vision legislation, including the Vision Care for Kids Act before us today. 
   It is particularly gratifying to see our efforts result in legislative success, and I thank the members of the Vision Caucus and the 152 cosponsors of this legislation for their support. I would also like to thank Chairman Dingell and Ranking Member Barton of the Energy and Commerce Committee, as well as the chairman and ranking member of the Health Subcommittee, Mr. Pallone and Mr. Deal, for their support of this legislation. 
   And I would also like to thank John Ford and William Garner of the committee's majority staff for their expertise, as well as Ryan Long and Katherine Martin of the minority staff for their willingness to work with us in a bipartisan fashion on this legislation. 
   With that, I encourage my colleagues to join us in passing this important bill to improve vision care for America's children.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE FILL SUSPENSION AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of H.R. 6022, Strategic Petroleum Reserve Fill Suspension and Consumer Protection Act, introduced by my good friend from Texas, Representative Nick Lampson, and Representative Peter Welch. 
   Today's rising petroleum and gasoline prices are set by a complex mix of factors, including global crude prices, increased world and U.S. demand, refinery capacity and maintenance schedules, gasoline imports, prescriptive fuel mandates, and geopolitical events. Most of these factors are out of our effective control. For those that aren't, like the proper management of fuel supplies in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, SPR, I believe Congress should do all we can to help reduce the cost of energy to American consumers. 
   H.R. 6022 requires the Interior and Energy Departments to discontinue the acquisition of oil and shipments to the SPR until the end of this year, and permits fill to resume if the average price of oil does not exceed $75 a barrel. The bill also allows petroleum shipments ordered under existing Interior Department contracts to be shipped to the reserve. 
   This legislation is strongly needed because the current administration has also not been properly managing the SPR for American consumers. The SPR exists to protect us during an energy crisis, and is almost full to its 727 million barrels of oil capacity. But while the cost per barrel of oil continues to skyrocket, the administration continues to purchase high-priced oil off the market to put into the SPR, limiting the amount of oil available. 
   When oil prices are very high, we should release SPR oil into the market to increase supply, as the Department of Energy did in response to Hurricane Katrina. While not expected to significantly reduce prices, some studies suggest suspending the purchase of oil for the reserve could reduce gas prices anywhere between 5 to 24 cents a gallon. Every cent helps. 
   While there is no quick fix for gasoline prices, I hope Congress will also address America's need to produce additional domestic energy, both conventional and renewable, to ensure the reliability and affordability of our Nation's critical energy supplies.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (PROTECTING THE MEDICAID SAFETY NET ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5613, the Protecting Medicaid Safety Net Act. The rules issued by CMS in August were said to be cost saving measures and a way to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse. 
   If these 7 regulations go into effect Texas would lose $3.4 billion in Federal Medicaid funding over the next 5 years and nationwide cuts to Medicaid funding could total around $50 billion. These regulations attack the core mission of Medicaid by eliminating much needed services for children, the elderly, and the poor. 
   These cuts will also have a devastating impact on state's Medicaid funds; consequently hurting the most vulnerable populations who are helped by the Medicaid safety net. This population accesses services and support care from Medicaid because they cannot access services elsewhere due to costs or restrictions on benefits. 
   If these regulations go into effect, I don't know where the states will find the funds to continue operating programs such as school administrative and transportation services, coverage for rehabilitative services, and outpatient hospital services. Especially since the lack of Medicaid funding will create budget crises in most states as they scramble to pay for services or eliminate them altogether. 
   This bill gives Congress enough time to understand the consequences of these regulations and come up with a solution we all can agree on rather than cutting these necessary services. 
   I am disappointed that the Administration has threatened to veto this bill. This piece of legislation is the result of a lot of hard work on both sides of the aisle. 
   I am particularly upset that the Administration seems to have forgotten once again about its Texas roots. Texas, along with California and New York stand to lose the largest amount of funding from these Medicaid cuts and this is money our states cannot afford to lose. 
   This bill has the support of 2,000 organizations and the National Governors Association. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and stop these cuts.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (TRAUMA CARE SYSTEMS PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of H.R. 727, legislation to reauthorize the Trauma Systems Planning and Development Act. This program, under the Public Health Service Act, was first authorized in 1990 to improve and coordinate trauma care in our country. 
   Since then, this program has provided $30 million to States to establish state-wide and regional trauma systems. Injury related to trauma is the leading cause of death for younger Americans, ages 1 through 44. Trauma also causes more than 300,000 permanent disabilities each year. 
   For seriously injured individuals, the first hour after an injury is when medical care is most effective in saving lives and function. This hour is also often referred to as the ``golden hour,'' during which trauma and emergency systems must respond both quickly and efficiently. 
   This golden hour is also the goal that our military has for getting medical attention to our soldiers injured on the battlefield. The military has an impressive, streamlined trauma system that my colleagues Dr. Burgess; our ranking member at that time, Congressman Deal from Georgia; and our late colleague Dr. Norwood from Georgia and I marveled at during our trip last summer to Iraq, where we toured the military's trauma facilities in Balad. 
   Unfortunately, the military's trauma system is not replicated in civilian health care, and too many Americans do not benefit from trauma systems that facilitate medical intervention during this critical time frame. 
   While the death rate from trauma is 50 percent higher in rural areas than in urban locations, trauma affects each corner of this country. In fact, nearly 25 percent of all Americans sustain injuries each year that require medical attention. Yet without coordinated trauma systems and quick access to care, injuries are too often fatal. 
   In Houston, we learned this lesson the hard way when the lack of trauma  coordination forced a young man to wait more than 4 hours to receive care after he was hit by a car on Halloween night in 2001. With serious head, chest and leg injuries, this patient was clearly medically unstable and should have received immediate care at one of Houston's two level-one trauma centers. But with the trauma centers increasingly on diversion, this young man was transported to Austin where he died the next day. 
   It was clear that we needed better trauma systems in the Houston area, and we quickly learned that the problem was felt throughout our Nation. We also learned that the effective trauma systems would help prevent nearly 25,000 deaths each year. 
   As a response, we developed this legislation to build on the program's initial success since 1990, and we authorized it through 2012. 
   This bill includes changes to the program to ensure that scarce health care dollars go to the communities most in need, ensuring that Federal funds are utilized to strengthen trauma systems and improve communication and coordination among different trauma systems. 
   It specifically ensures that grants go to States that coordinate planning for trauma systems with State disaster emergency planning and bioterrorism hospital preparedness planning. 
   In addition, this legislation would require the Secretary to update the model plan for the designation of trauma centers and set triage, transfer, and transportation policies. 
   The legislation also reauthorizes the Residency Training Program in Emergency Medicine in an effort to ensure an adequate level of ER physicians to treat patients in need of care from America's trauma centers. 
   I would like to thank Mr. Burgess from Texas for his leadership on this legislation and for helping to craft the compromise before us today. 
   I would also like to thank Chairman Dingell and our Health Subcommittee Chairman Pallone for their interest in this issue. We have been working on this bill for 5 years. 
   Until now, this important issue failed to receive the attention it deserved, so I appreciate my chairman including this bill on our first markup in this Congress. 
   I also appreciate the hard work that John Ford, William Garner and Pete Goodloe of the committee staff put in to guide this bill through the committee to ensure that we have a consensus product to approve today, and also my own staff who has worked on this for at least 3 years.     
   I also appreciate the support of the American College of Surgeons, the American Osteopathic Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, the American Trauma Society, the Coalition for American Trauma Care and the Emergency Nurses Association. 
   The members of these groups are on the front lines and know that coordinated trauma systems can literally save lives. We thank them for all they do for our communities. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for this important legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2830, the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act of 2008. 
   I would like to thank both the Chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Chairman OBERSTAR, and especially the Chairman of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, Chairman CUMMINGS, for their leadership in crafting this important piece of legislation. 
   I have always been a strong supporter of the Coast Guard and providing it with the resources necessary to protect our Nation's coasts, ports and waterways, particularly the Port of Houston which I represent. 
   H.R. 2830 is also important to me because it contains provisions relating to the security of vessels and facilities that transport or process Liquefied Natural Gas--or LNG--in the United States. Demand for clean-burning natural gas is building up across our economy, and energy proposals Congress has passed and is currently considering will only accelerate this demand. I believe all of us here agree on the need to ensure the safety of LNG shipments to the U.S., but Congress should do so in a responsible way that does not unnecessarily impede future shipments of this clean-burning fuel. 
   Chairman CUMMINGS understood these concerns and included new language that would maximize the resources available to the Coast Guard for enforcing LNG security zones; maintain the multi-mission function of the Coast Guard; and mitigate bureaucratic hurdles in the LNG security process. While not perfect,  these changes are an improvement from the original bill and reflect a more workable approach than first proposed. 
   I want to again thank my good friends Chairman CUMMINGS and Chairman OBERSTAR for working with me and other Members to consider America's need for both energy security and homeland security when crafting this legislation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2830.

   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1. The 9/11 Commission made its recommendations over two and a half years ago, and I am pleased this legislation to implement those recommendations is a top priority in this Congress. 
   Among other things, this legislation will address the allocation of Homeland Security grants to ensure risk-based distribution of funds to provide the most vulnerable areas with the resources necessary to protect citizens and infrastructure. Section 2001 of this bill defines what critical sectors should be used to determine high risk areas, and representing a district that is home to many of these sectors, I have long supported these changes. 
   This bill will also improve information sharing among different levels of law enforcement, improve the interoperability of communications for first responders, and strengthen aviation and cargo security. 
   As the 9/11 Commission pointed out, these are all important steps toward securing our homeland. But I am concerned about how some of these objectives are accomplished and the jurisdictional implications in this bill. 
   In particular, this bill provides the Department of Homeland Security with broad authority over public health, electric transmission, site security, and communications. The agencies and departments that currently oversee these areas have expertise working with these issues and it is not clear that DHS is better prepared to regulate, advise or award grants in these areas. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure these issues are worked out either in conference or through committee oversight.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 42, recognizing Ann. Richards extraordinary contributions to Texas and American public life. 
   Ann Richards and I worked together when I served in Texas State Senate in 1991 and 1992 before I was elected to the House of Representatives in 1993. At that time, she was serving as the Governor of Texas. During our tenure in the state house we worked together to support stronger environmental laws for our district and Texas. 
   Governor Richards was a teacher who started out in politics as a volunteer on the campaigns of Sarah Weddington, Henry B. Gonzalez, and Ralph Yarborough. She began her own political career in 1976 when she was elected to serve as a County Commissioner in Travis County. 
   Six years later in 1982, she was elected Texas State Treasurer and served two terms. Ann made history by becoming the first woman elected to statewide office in Texas in fifty years. 
   In 1990, Ann ran for governor and promised to increase the role of minorities and women in state government as part of her plan for a ``New Texas.'' When Governor Richards was elected she made it a priority as governor to appoint more women and minorities to state boards and commissions and followed through on her promise. 
   During her tenure, Governor Richards had many accomplishments including revitalizing the Texas economy, reforming the prison system, and instituting the state lottery. Once she left public office, Ann continued to be an inspiration to us all when she bravely battled osteoporosis and esophageal cancer. 
   Ann wasn't only the governor of one of the greatest states in America, but she was one of America's greatest governors in terms of her personality, sense of humor, and trailblazing accomplishments. Governor Richards was the First Lady of Texas politics and her extraordinary accomplishments make her not only a Texas hero, but also an American hero.

   This important piece of legislation would amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide all low-income students with the same opportunity to receive a Pell grant by eliminating the tuition sensitivity provision in the Pell grant program. 
   Current law prohibits maximum Pell grant awards to students attending low-tuition higher education institutions even if their income is low enough to otherwise qualify for the maximum award. 
   As the husband of a retired high-school teacher, I have always been a strong advocate for education. 
   Unfortunately, the high costs of a college education prohibit many low-income students from receiving a higher degree. 
   Pell grants provide low-income students with their best opportunity to attend college, and we must support financial aid programs like this in order to help as many students as possible succeed and receive a college degree. 
   Higher education is the best way to ensure our children and grandchildren have a promising future regardless of socio-economic status.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I thank our Chair of the committee for allowing me to speak. Sitting here, waiting in line and listening, I am amazed at the rhetoric I hear. We had Members from our minority side talk about we have to worry about saving for the stimulus next week, and we want to vote for that. But it is amazing they want to save money from the SCHIP program to pay for a stimulus, and at the same time they don't worry about paying for the billions of dollars a month that we are spending in Iraq. It is amazing how frugal they are when they want to be. 
   Madam Speaker, the President's veto of the children's health care bill once again shows it is playing politics rather than embracing an opportunity to fix a system that is in need of repair. The reason we are here is over 10 years ago this House and Senate and the President at that time signed the bill. The issue was we need to cover the children first. Instead of signing this piece of legislation into law, President Bush twice vetoed a bill to provide insurance coverage to 10 million low-income American children of working parents. 
   The administration's reason for this veto just doesn't stand up. No Federal funding will be spent on undocumented immigrants in this bill. If they are, they are on the State's, the State of Texas or whoever else, to pay for it if they allow illegal immigrants on the CHIP plan. In 1 year, childless adults are taken off the SCHIP program, even though this administration issued waivers to allow them to be on it. Only lowest income children are covered, with a prohibition on coverage for over 300 percent of poverty, and still the President vetoed it. 
   We continue to spend billions of dollars a month in Iraq, and we can't even cover the lowest income children. Energy costs are up. Everything is up. Our economy is weakening, and the number of unemployed and uninsured in this country are rising. Let's at least cover the children with health care. Let's vote to override this misguided veto.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I support this effort to override the President's veto of the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill funding the Departments of Labor, HHS, and Education. 
   After years of too little attention to our important domestic programs, this legislation makes important investments in our health care and education programs. Several years of flat funding and small increases have resulted in funding reductions for the health, education and labor programs that Americans rely on every day. 
   I am pleased that the bill provides the National Institutes of Health with a 4-percent increase over current funding levels. The $30 billion in this legislation will help expand our nation's commitment to life-saving medical research, much of which is performed in my back yard at the Baylor College of Medicine, the MD Anderson Cancer Center and many other impressive research facilities located in the Texas Medical Center. 
   I also support the legislation's $225 million increase for the Health Centers program. I know the administration supports this program, but by vetoing this bill, the President puts in jeopardy our goal to expand the program to a level that will provide 30 million Americans with a health care home. 
   H.R. 3043 also provides $200,000 in funding for Gateway to Care, for the Community Health Center Technology Improvement Program. Gateway to Care is the community health care access collaborative in Harris County. 
   Gateway to Care will utilize this funding to help coordinate the deployment of health information technology among the county's health care clinics. This funding will allow Gateway to Care to offer technical support to the developing health centers in Harris Co. during the implementation of a common Management Information System. 
   Additionally, this funding will allow Gateway to Care staff to lead workforce development and training activities at health centers to utilize technology to improve the business management and health care delivery in area health centers. 
   In this bill, the appropriators also generously dedicated $415,000 in equipment funding for the Harris County Hospital District's Diabetes Program. 
   This project would help the Harris County Hospital District procure the necessary equipment to establish a Diabetes Program, which will provide comprehensive diabetes care in an appropriate setting for a multi-ethnic, indigent population. 
   The interdisciplinary program will include an outpatient referral center, diabetes specialists, educators, nurses, nutritionists, social workers, case managers and specialist services related to the screening and treatment of diabetes complications. 
   Houston is the only large city in the U.S. without a single comprehensive diabetes program, which is why this funding is so important to our community. The establishment the diabetes program at the Harris County Hospital District would improve health outcomes for its 40,000 patients with diabetes. 
   I want to thank the Appropriations Committee for all of their hard work on this bill. This piece of legislation provides critical and necessary funding for programs that all of our districts need. 
   Madam Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this veto override.

   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Peru Free Trade Agreement. 
   While I applaud the efforts to improve worker rights in the Peru FTA, the protections in the agreement fall short of addressing the concerns of workers that have been adversely affected by the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Central American Free Trade Agreement, and other recent FTAs. 
   The absence of clear, enforceable labor standards as detailed by the International Labor Organization, ILO, in the Peru FTA make this an agreement I cannot support. These include prohibitions of child labor and guaranteeing the right of workers in Peru to form independent labor unions. 
   The Peru FTA and the passage of Trade Adjustment Assistance, TAA, last week does not represent the kind of comprehensive policy that workers need to ensure that our globalization policies not only benefit multinational corporations, but workers as well. 
   I am not opposed to free trade agreements as long as they are fair trade agreements that benefit and protect workers in both countries, however, I have long opposed free trade agreements with countries with significantly lower standards of living, and fewer labor protections than we have here in the U.S. 
   I am proud to represent one of the most blue-collar districts in the country. The workers in our district benefit from the labor laws on the books in the U.S, and while our labor laws could certainly be strengthened, they ensure that our blue-collar workers receive a living wage and make up a thriving middle class in this country. 
   I have no doubts whatsoever about the skills and productivity of American workers, but the significant differences in the standard of living puts the American worker--and American products--at a competitive disadvantage, one that this country should not allow to be exploited through a free trade agreement. 
   U.S. trade policy over the last decade has resulted in the loss of millions of jobs and has led to 5 consecutive years with record setting trade deficits. 
   I am concerned this trade agreement does not go far enough to address the issues that caused these problems, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing H.R. 3688.

   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1086 recognizing today, May 6, through May 12 as National Nurses Week. As a cosponsor of this resolution, I am proud to lend my voice in support of our Nation's nurses. 
   Continuing in the illustrious tradition of Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing, nurses today continue to attend to our Armed Forces overseas. These brave men and women place themselves at risk in war zones, including the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, to tend to our injured soldiers. Besides tending to the wounded abroad, nurses are also on the front lines of our health care system here at home. Whether their primary function is to care for our aging population or to provide immediate aid to the sick and injured, our nurses provide quality patient care and support to keep our health care system running. 
   As the Nation continues to face a nursing shortage, with a projected 1 million new nurses needed by 2016, it is especially important that everyone is aware of the sacrifices nurses make on a daily basis for our country. We must continue to encourage more young people and those seeking a change in career to join the nursing profession. 
   The resolution before us encourages all Americans to observe this week as National Nurses Week by showing appropriate recognition to nurses and creating programs and activities during the week to demonstrate the importance of nurses.  
   I would like to thank my colleagues and former nurses, Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy, and Congresswoman Lois Capps, for their leadership on this measure. Again, I reiterate, they are former nurses, although I don't know if you are ever a former nurse. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in support of the resolution and its adoption.

   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. This is my first term on the Foreign Affairs Committee. But I am not here necessarily as a committee member. I am here as a Member of Congress from Texas concerning the relationship Texas has had with Mexico for generations, if not centuries, and the relationship that we need to continue. 
   There is literally a battle going on in Mexico, our closest neighbor, and there has been an effort to try and support them in their battle with narcotics and narco-terrorism, and that is what this bill is about. 
   Whatever Mexico has been doing in their country is actually protecting those of us in Texas and California and all over the United States, because if they slow that situation down or win that battle, it makes our citizens and our people a lot safer. 
   We should help our local police even more. We should do a lot of things. But that is a whole separate piece of legislation. What we are talking about here is stepping up to the plate and helping a neighbor who is our closest neighbor and one who is in the middle of a war and losing police chiefs, law enforcement officers, the military. Whatever they do in their own country to take  care of thisi problem will make us safer in our own. 
   There are some concerns about human rights, and I want to address that, but I would hope we would address it with members of Congress from Mexico. When I met with those members from both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies in Mexico, they were concerned about some of the human rights violations in our country. We have to share that information and work with each other. Again, we are not moving, Mexico is not moving, and we need to make sure we work as a partnership with Mexico in their efforts to control their own country. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (SUPPORTING THE OBSERVANCE OF COLORECTAL CANCER AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - March 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of a resolution offered by a fellow Texan, Congresswoman Granger, recognizing the month of March as Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month. 
   There are few diagnoses that strike more fear into Americans than being diagnosed with cancer. More than 10 million Americans currently live with cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, more than 1.4 million new cancer cases will be diagnosed this year. 
   In the United States, colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men and women. If it is caught early, it is often curable. Regular colorectal cancer screening or testing is one of the best ways to prevent colorectal cancer. 
   Once abnormal cells start to grow, it takes approximately 10 to 15 years to develop into colorectal cancer. Regular colorectal cancer screening can prevent colorectal cancer altogether because some polyps and growths are identified and removed before they turn into cancer. Screening can also result in finding colorectal cancer early, when it is highly curable. 
   Houston's MD Anderson Cancer Center is located near my district so I have seen the effectiveness of research and treatments that have come from investment in cancer research programs. However, the easiest way to prevent, treat, and recover from cancer is to find it early. 
   That is why recognizing the month of March as Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month is important. Letting people know that they should be regularly tested for colorectal cancer is the first step in saving lives. 
   I want to thank my colleague, Representative GRANGER, and urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 3074, the FY08 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. 
   I want to thank the Chairman OBEY, Chairman MOLLOHAN, Ranking Member FRELINGHUYSEN, and the Appropriations Committee for their hard work on this piece of legislation. 
   This bill will keep our communities safe by providing increased funding for the Community Oriented Policing Services Grants Program and the Byrne Justice Assistance Grants Program. 
   Both of these programs assist our law enforcement agencies by providing grants for the hiring of additional police officers. 
   The CJS Appropriations bill also provides assistance for the Office on Violence Against Women. 
   The COPS program, Byrne Justice Assistance Program, and the Office on Violence Against Women would not have been severely under funded in the President's budget and I commend the committee for their work to fund these vital programs. 
   This bill also contains vital funding for two projects in my district: the Houston YMCA of Greater Houston's Apartment Outreach Project and the Harris County Integrated In-Car Mobile Technology Project. 
   The YMCA's Apartment Outreach Project will provide for staffing and supply costs for this program which combats youth crime and gang activity in Houston's apartment complexes. 
   The Harris County Integrated In-Car Mobile Technology Project will provide county sheriff officers with mobile data computers to link with license plate recognition technology. 
   Unfortunately, this bill does not provide funding for several projects that I strongly support. 
   These projects would have provided funding for the Harris County, TX to acquire a 10 acre tract of land for the Buffalo Bayou Partnership plan to redevelop the bayou and funding for Houston Community College to purchase equipment for training programs conducted by its Public Safety Institute. 
   While it is impossible to fund all of the projects that we request, I believe that these programs need federal funding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   Members, I have sat in my office and got caught up on a lot of work and I was listening to the debate, and I guess I am concerned about the tenor of the debate because I am serving in this Congress and I am in my eighth term, one term in the majority, the last 12 years in the minority, and I have never seen a display of what we are seeing on the floor today. 
   Because I served with Speaker HASTERT and many speakers, and it is frustrating to see this activity. My concern is what we are portraying to the American people. And I think the chairman of the Science Committee pointed out the White House statement on the use of the plane. 
   I was here on the floor after 9/11, and I know that not one Member on the Democratic side questioned whether Speaker Hastert needed the security, needed a nonstop to his district. And I think that is far beyond anything we should be considering. 
   I want to save energy, although I have to admit, I have a district where we produce a lot, and I am glad people use it. But I also know that we have more important things in this House to do than to pick at one person who happens to be the Speaker of the House. I could go back and find lots of things from former Speakers of the minority party and talk about it, but again, we didn't do that. I didn't, and I don't remember any of my colleagues doing it. But I also know that if we are going to seriously be legislators, then we need to pass this bill. 
   I was concerned with some of the amendments that were brought up earlier literally by members of my Energy and Commerce Committee that were not germane because their amendments would have been germane if this had been an Energy and Commerce bill, but it is not. It is a Science bill. That is why I think if we are serious about dealing with global warming, more efficiency in fuel, there are lots of ways we can do it. I know the Science Committee is doing their job, and I know the Energy and Commerce Committee will; and if there are tax issues that need to be dealt with, I know the Ways and Means Committee will deal with it. 
   Mr. Chairman and Members, I would hope we would realize that the actions today do not reflect good on the House itself.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today in Lebanon, protesters are rioting, burning tires and cars, and crippling Beirut to oppose the government of Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Saniora. 
   The majority of the opposition comes from Hezbollah and its supporters seeking more influence in Lebanon's government. 
   At the same time, one of our close allies is forced to watch these riots as a recurring threat is building on its borders. 
   Last summer we watched as the terrorist group Hezbollah kidnapped two Israeli soldiers and killed eight others and began firing missiles into Israeli cities intentionally targeting civilian populations and infrastructure. 
   This group was supplied by Syria and Iran for years, and built up stockpiles of weapons after Israel completely withdrew from southern Lebanon in 2000 in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 425. 
   Israel responded in self-defense and launched an offensive in southern Lebanon to destroy the weapons caches and Hezbollah's bunkers. Fortunately, the Israeli Air Force was able to destroy many of the longer range rockets Hezbollah possessed, but thousands of shorter-range rockets were indiscriminately fired at Israeli towns and villages. 
   After 2 months of fighting, United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 was passed. Among other things, 1701 called for a U.N. peacekeeping force of up to 50,000 troops to assist the Lebanese military to prevent Hezbollah's resurgence and rearmament in southern Lebanon. 
   Unfortunately, these troops have not stopped Syria and Iran from rearming Hezbollah, and Israel must watch as this threat is re-emerging just miles from its border.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (TRANSITIONAL MEDICAL ASSISTANCE AND ABSTINENCE EDUCATION PROGRAM EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation that provides a 3-month extension to the transitional medical assistance program under Medicaid. 
   TMA provides vital support for low-income American families moving off welfare and into work. Under the TMA program, families whose earnings would otherwise make them ineligible for Medicaid can receive up to 12 months of Medicaid coverage. Without TMA, many families transitioning from welfare to work would go without health insurance and could end up back on welfare. 
   Families leaving welfare often encounter difficulties such as securing health insurance because they have taken low-wage jobs that do not offer employer-sponsored health coverage. In some cases this choice could serve as a deterrent to returning to work, and we want to provide folks with as many incentives as possible to return to work. According to the Congressional Research Service, 79 percent of people with incomes of at least 200 percent of the Federal poverty level benefit from employer-sponsored health insurance, yet only 19 percent of working-age individuals with incomes below the poverty line receive health care coverage through employment. These are folks who earn $10,210 or less a year. If they can't get coverage through their employer, it is essentially cost-prohibitive for them to purchase health insurance. 
   No one should be made to choose between a job and health insurance. Thanks to TMA, many Americans are spared this tough choice and allowed to move off welfare and into a job while maintaining their health coverage. Without TMA, many of our most vulnerable Americans would be unable to access the health coverage they need. 
   In my State of Texas, TMA helps provide more than 111,000 people each month continued treatment for ongoing health care needs. A gap in care would be particularly problematic for the one out of four mothers in the program who are in poor or fair health yet transitioning from welfare to work. The extensions of the program is critical to their continued access to necessary health care. 
   Again in Texas, TMA also reimburses medical providers for more than $300 million in annual expenses for acute medical care, prescription drugs, and other approved Medicaid services. Without TMA, these costs for medically necessary services would be shifted to local governments or charitable organizations, or worse, the client may not receive needed care at all. 
   Mr. Speaker, TMA enjoys wide-ranging bipartisan support. The National Governors Association strongly supports TMA and its extension. According to the National Governors Association, ``without access to regular health care, health problems of a new worker or the worker's family members are likely to lead to greater absenteeism and possibly job loss.'' 
   TMA is also supported by the National Conference of State Legislatures, the American Public Health Association, and the National Association of State Medicaid Directors. The administration also supports this vital program as evidenced by the fact that the President included a 1-year extension of TMA in his fiscal year 2008 budget proposal. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the past Congress has always acted in bipartisan fashion to extend TMA in combination with an equal extension of Federal abstinence education programs. While there is no shortage of debate or opinion on the merits of abstinence education programs, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this approach, at least for the short term, so we can ensure that hardworking American families don't lose their health care under  the transitional medical assistance program. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   C&#233;sar Ch&#225;vez dedicated his life to teaching others that persistence, hard work, faith, and willingness to sacrifice oneself breaks down barriers. He committed himself to achieving justice and equality for all farm workers, and paved the way for momentous social change. 
   In 1962, C&#233;sar Ch&#225;vez formed what is known as the United Farm Workers. His efforts initiated one of the greatest social movements of our time. He dedicated himself to fighting for safe working conditions, reasonable wages, decent housing and the outlawing of child labor for farm workers everywhere. 
   Mr. Ch&#225;vez embraced nonviolent tactics to help focus national attention on the problems that existed for farm workers. Mr. Ch&#225;vez was said to have given his last ounce of strength defending the farm workers before he died in his sleep on April 23, 1993. 
   C&#233;sar Ch&#225;vez is honored throughout America for his tireless work to help those who could not help themselves. 
   In my hometown of Houston and my district every year we celebrate the life and times of C&#233;sar Ch&#225;vez by holding a Hispanic heritage parade and day of celebration. A national holiday in honor of C&#233;sar Ch&#225;vez would serve as an inspiration to those who seek to create a better world in the legacy of one who served to remind us that together all things are possible; in Spanish, ``si se puede.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Chairman, I rise today to show my support for H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. This important bill will aim to address the devastating effects of AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis on our global community. 
   Numbers from the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS show that since AIDS was identified in 1981, about 65 million people have been infected with HIV and more than 30 million have died from AIDS. These numbers include the figures from 2005 that show more than 2 million of those living with HIV/AIDS were children and the daily infection of an estimated 1,500 children worldwide was due in large part to inadequate access to drugs that prevent the transmission from mother to child. 
   Additionally, programs within the Department of Health and Human Services account for 71 percent of the total amount spent, with the U.S. as the largest single contributor to the Global Fund, an independent foundation dedicated to disbursing new resources in developing countries aimed at combating AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. 
   This bill will further these efforts that we started 5 years ago by raising the United States' contribution to $50 billion over the next 5 years. I am also encouraged that this bill will encourage the development of a TB vaccine. 
   The TB germ is constantly changing and drug resistant strains have been found in 28 countries on 6 continents, including right here in the United States, where it is estimated that 10 to 15 million people in the U.S. have latent TB. These drug resistant forms of TB have severe implications both internationally and domestically. 
   The World Health Organization recently released its new tuberculosis drug resistance surveillance report. The WHO found that the MDR and XDR strains of TB are at their highest levels ever. Both of these strains are far deadlier than normal TB, and are much more difficult and expensive to treat. 
   In fact, the Department of Homeland Security recently identified XDR-TB as an ``emerging threat to the homeland.'' For this reason, we need to devote resources to stopping this disease and developing a new vaccine is the first step. This is not a partisan issue. 
   Some of my colleagues might ask why an AIDS reauthorization bill should be the vehicle for doing this; there is a very simple reason. TB is the number one infectious killer among people living with HIV/AIDS, and accounts for up to half of HIV/AIDS deaths in some parts of Africa. If we do not address TB in a systematic way and work to develop a vaccine, then much of the progress that we have made on addressing HIV/AIDS globally will be undone. 
   Studies also show that the 10-year economic benefits of a TB vaccine that was only 75 percent effective could result in an estimated savings of $25 billion dollars. There is no denying that this is a significant amount. Our current TB vaccine, BCG, is more than 85 years old and is not compatible against pulmonary TB, which accounts for most TB cases. 
   This legislation is a good start in our critical battle against TB. Finally, I am happy to see that this bill will encourage public-private partnerships in combating these diseases. The Baylor Pediatric AIDS Initiative has been working in Africa for several years, and the government should work with this and similar programs to leverage the expertise that they can provide. 
   I support these strong health initiatives across the globe and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.

   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I thank my Chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
   The legislation before us today is not about politics. It's about providing children's health care coverage to 10 million low-income American children. 
   This bill is paid for. It's paid for more than the $190 billion the President's asking for a supplemental to support the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is for the ten million children and parents who are hardworking Americans but cannot afford private health insurance. 
   The bill is clear on undocumented children. No Federal funding will be spent on undocumented immigrants. 
   The bill is clear on childless adults. For 1 year they get coverage, and these adults actually got a waiver, these States got a waiver to cover these adults. So they're going to have 1 year, and then they're off of it. 
   The bill is clear on family income. Only the lowest-income children are covered with a prohibition on coverage of children above 300 percent. You can't go above 300 percent. Most are at 200 percent, but some are at 300. 
   Madam Speaker, 4 months of spending in Iraq is enough to provide SCHIP to 10 million children for 5 years. More than 80 percent of the American people support it, and I urge my colleagues to support it.  
   We've prioritized it to the low-income. 
   We've prioritized it to citizens. 
   We've prioritized children. 
   It's about priorities, not politics, and the Congress should be able to put aside politics and unite behind these priorities for our children.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1343, the Health Centers Renewal Act of 2008. 
   The health centers program was first enacted 40 years ago. Today, health centers are located in 6,000 sites in all 50 States serving as the medical home and family physician to 17 million people nationally. 
   Over the years, the health centers program has gained tremendous support from Democrats, Republicans, the Congress and the President. We don't all agree on much, but there is no doubt that the health centers program has been a great success. 
   The overwhelming support for the health centers program may be attributed to the impact health centers have made on the health and well-being of our country's most vulnerable populations. 
   Federally qualified health centers are local, nonprofit or public entity, community-owned health care provider serving low-income and medically underserved areas as designated by the Federal Government. 
   Health centers provide comprehensive primary and preventive health care, with services available to all community residents where they are located, regardless of the patients' ability to pay. 
   Community health centers have helped fill the medical void for low-income communities and uninsured individuals. 
   The health centers program's focus on primary and preventive care has garnered savings for our health care system because the health centers provide the uninsured and underserved with access to care they would usually receive at hospital emergency rooms. 
   By providing access to affordable primary care, health centers have also reduced the need for in-patient and specialty care in hospitals, because medical problems in health center patients are treated earlier, before they require in-patient hospital care. 
   Studies suggest that health centers save Medicaid approximately 30 percent in annual spending for health centers due to reduced specialty care referrals, fewer hospital admissions, and emergency room visits. 
   Forty percent of health center patients are uninsured, and 35 percent depend on Medicaid, making health centers a critical feature of our country's safety net and, for many individuals, their only source for health care services. 
   Unfortunately, the number of uninsured in our country is 47 million and has been steadily rising, and in turn, the need for health centers are increasing. 
   Our district in Texas and many other communities nationwide are desperately in need of more health centers. Houston has approximately 1 million uninsured but only 10 federally qualified health centers. 
   As the fourth largest city in the United States, Houston lags far behind the number of health centers located in our area when compared to Chicago, with over 80 community health centers and the third largest city in the country. 
   Houston is not alone in this need for more health centers. Studies show that 56 million Americans lack access to primary care or a health care home. 
   The Health Centers Renewal Act will reauthorize the health centers program, which would address the growing need for community health centers in not only my area but throughout the United States. 
   This legislation would authorize the increased funding necessary for our community to build on the success of the health centers program and develop additional health centers to meet our tremendous need for affordable and quality health care. 
   This bill would allow health centers to serve approximately 23 million patients in the next 5 years. 
   I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Pickering, who is the original cosponsor, along with the Energy and Commerce Committee and my subcommittee for their full support of this legislation. 
   I believe the bill is truly an investment in the future of health centers for the medically underserved communities throughout our country. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   First, to comment on my colleague from Georgia. Coming from Houston, Texas, I have some pipeline companies that would love to have that contract from Mars to Houston to bring oil if we discover it drilling through that ice there. 
   I appreciate, as a physician, your devotion to community-based health clinics, because that's what this bill is about, it's about reauthorizing. In fact, as we stand here today, Madam Speaker, we're actually expanding one in our district. Like I said earlier, we only have 10 in the Houston area, and our next largest city close to us has 80. So we have a job to do in Houston, in Texas--and my colleague from Fort Worth mentioned it--to expand community-based health centers. This bill will allow us to do that because it will go to the underserved community, areas in the country that really don't even have access to a community-based health center now and will have with this legislation, also with the additional authorization funds. 
   Of course we have to go back and ask the Appropriations Committee every year for additional funding that we authorize. But that's something that we do. This is very bipartisan support for community-based health centers. That's why I would hope that we would have almost unanimous support for this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. I thank the Chair of our Energy and Commerce Committee. 
   Madam Speaker, we have a health care crisis in our country. And the President vetoing the SCHIP bill has made bad policy based on bad information. We've heard it from the floor today from the minority. 
   The President should know we target low-income children below 200 percent of poverty. The President should know that we focus SCHIP on children and phase out parents and childless adults that were allowed by this administration to be covered. The President should know that the bill covers 4 million children who are eligible for SCHIP but not enrolled. The President should know that we do not cover illegal alien children. It's frustrating, when we have a health care crisis in our country, that we can't cover the children. 
   When the White House asked Congress just recently for a special $190 billion for the war in Iraq, over and above the hundreds of billions we've already spent, why can't we find much less than that for covering 10 million  low-income children, parents who are working in this country? 
   We have a health care crisis, and the Republican minority and the President have turned their back on that crisis, especially to the children.  
   Mr. Speaker we have a health care crisis in our country. In vetoing our SCHIP bill, the President has invoked a bad policy based on bad information. 
   The President should know we target low-income children below 200 percent of poverty. 
   The President should know we focus SCHIP on children, and phase out parents and childless adults that were allowed by his administration. 
   The President should know the bill covers 4 million children who are eligible for SCHIP but not enrolled. 
   The President should know this does not cover undocumented children. Under the President's proposal, 6 million of our children eligible for SCHIP would remain without health insurance. 
   And, an additional 700,000 children currently in the program would join them in the ranks of the uninsured. 
   If the President is so concerned about adults and middle income families in the SCHIP program, he should sign this bill which effectively addresses those concerns. 
   America's low-income children shouldn't suffer because the President can't get his facts straight. 
   More than 8 in 10 Americans support this legislation to expand SCHIP for children. 
   When the White House asks Congress for a special $190 billion for the war in Iraq, over and above hundreds of billions already spent why can't they find much less to cover 10 million low-income children. 
   This is the people's House, and it is our duty to override this veto and listen to the American people.

   This bill, the law, put the pharmaceutical industry ahead of our seniors. It put the health insurance industry ahead of our seniors. The bill will correct those mistakes. Opponents of this bill raise the charges of big government saying, let the market work. That is exactly what this bill will do. It will leverage the buying power of 42 million American seniors that negotiate costs of prescription drugs under Medicare. 
   Negotiation of drug prices is alive and well in every sector of the health care industry. States negotiate for lower prices on their Medicare programs. Pharmacy chains do the same thing for the drugs they purchase. They don't have formularies. They purchase drugs for their customers, so pharmacy chains can do the same thing. 
   All this bill does is allow the Medicare program to use a tool for free market bargaining best prices for its beneficiaries. Rarely will you see overwhelming support for an issue like we have seen on this one. Ninety-two percent of Americans agree that we should take off the handcuffs that have been restraining the Medicare program and give it a chance to achieve greater discounts. 
   The alternative is increasing drug costs and increasing premiums that make the benefit harder for our seniors to afford. The numbers don't lie. Under the current structure, 77 percent of seniors saw their premium part D increase in 2006 and 2007, and more than one-quarter of them saw their premiums rise more than 25 percent. 
   Drug prices under part D are increasing too with costs for the top 20 drugs increasing 3.7 percent in the last 6 months.  
   When Congress created the Medicare prescription drug benefit over three years ago, it failed to put our seniors first. It put the pharmaceutical industry ahead of our seniors. And it put the health insurance industry ahead of our seniors. This bill will correct those mistakes. 
   Opponents of this bill raise charges of big government, saying to let the market work. That's exactly what this bill does by leveraging the buying power of 42 million American seniors to negotiate the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare. 
   Negotiation for drug prices is alive and well in every other sector of the health care industry. States negotiate for lower prices under their Medicaid programs. Pharmacy chains do the same for the drugs they purchase. 
   All this bill does is allow the Medicare program to use a tool of the free market--bargaining--to obtain the best prices for its beneficiaries. Rarely do we see overwhelming support for an issue like we've seen for this one. 92 percent of Americans agree that we should take off the handcuffs that have restrained the Medicare program and give it a chance to achieve greater discounts. 
   The alternative is increasing drug costs and increasing premiums that make the benefit harder for seniors to afford. The numbers don't lie. Under the current structure, 77 percent of seniors saw their Part D premiums increase from 2006-2007. And more than one-quarter of them saw their premiums rise more than 25 percent. 
   Drug prices under Part D are increasing too, with costs for the top 20 drugs increasing 3.7 percent over six months. That's 7.4 percent over a year--an increase twice the rate of inflation and one that will cause our seniors to hit the doughnut hole even sooner. 
   We have a chance today to do better by our seniors. It's about time we put our seniors first and let Medicare work for them.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee for allowing me to speak. 
   Before I get into my prepared remarks, part of the resolution, if my colleagues would go to page 5 of the resolution, says as part of the justification required, the President shall, at a minimum, address whether it is necessary for the Armed Forces to carry out the following missions: protecting U.S. diplomatic facilities and U.S. citizens, including Armed Forces who are engaged in carrying out other missions; serving in roles consistent with customary diplomatic positions; but also, engaging in actions to disrupt and eliminate al Qaeda and its affiliated organizations in Iraq. 
   So while I sat here on the floor listened and heard, ``we are bailing out of attacking al Qaeda,'' we are not doing that. This resolution says we will still be there. The President has to certify, though, that is what we are doing. We are not shoring up the Iraqi Government; we are fighting al Qaeda, who brought us September 11. So anybody who says we are leaving is just wrong. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution and this legislation, and thank Chairman Skelton for his work on the bill. Like Chairman Skelton, I want to thank our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines and their families who are serving our country.  
   I have stated before, we must let the Iraqi Government know our commitment is not open-ended. I have not supported efforts for immediate withdrawal, but this bill, just like our first supplemental sent to the President, which he vetoed, lets the Iraqi Government know that they need to make some tough choices to stabilize their country within the next several months. 
   It also gives our administration time to have a comprehensive strategy in Iraq, and allows the troops to remain to protect our diplomatic facilities and fight al Qaeda, and training and equipping the Iraqi security forces. 
   As this legislation states, we give the President the authority to use the Armed Forces to defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by the Iraqi government at that time. But we won that battle. The government was removed. The power and its leader indicted, tried and convicted, and executed by the newly elected, now-democratic government of Iraq.  
   This bill will bring our troops home by April 1 of next year--that will be more than 5 years since the war began. U.S. taxpayers have spent billions of dollars, and thousands of troops have given their lives to bring security and stability to Iraq. 
   While the current Iraqi government has been organizing and security forces have been training, our forces have been responsible for every facet of security in Iraq. Our troops defeated Saddam's Army, worked to control the country, policed Iraq's streets, protected the transitional and elected governments, and trained Iraq security forces. 
   Our military has given the Iraqi government, the Iraqi security forces, and the Iraqi people every opportunity to have a stable, democratic country. It is time to let the Iraqi people know that 5 years is long enough--they must take responsibility for the future of their country. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill to bring our troops home in a safe, responsible timeframe.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (TEXAS INDEPENDENCE DAY -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, last Friday, March 2, 2007, marked Texas Independence Day. 171 years ago that day the Texas Declaration of Independence was ratified by the Convention of 1836 at Washington-on-the-Brazos in Texas. 
   The Texas Declaration of Independence was produced literally overnight. Its urgency was paramount because while it was being prepared, the Alamo in San Antonio was under siege by Santa Anna's army of Mexico. 
   Immediately upon the assemblage of the Convention of 1836 on March 1, a committee of five delegates were appointed to draft the document. The committee consisted of George C. Childress, Edward Conrad, James Gaines, Bailey Hardeman, and Colin McKinney. It was briefly reviewed then adopted by the delegates the following day. 
   It started off echoing the lines of the American counterpart with the words: ``When a government has ceased to protect the lives and liberty and property of the people ..... '' 
   It spoke of numerous injustices inflicted upon the people of the State,  then known as Coahuila y Tejas: the elimination of the State's legislative body; the denial of religious freedom; the elimination of the civil justice system; and the confiscation of firearms, which was one particularly intolerable act among Texans.  
   Finally, it stated that because of the injustice of Santa Anna's tyrannical government, Texans were severing their connection with the Mexican nation and declaring themselves ``a free, sovereign, and independent republic ..... fully invested with all the rights and attributes'' that belong to independent nations; and a declaration that they ``fearlessly and confidently'' committed their decision to ``the Supreme Arbiter of the destinies of nations.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope that Congress and this whole country join all Texans in honoring these brave men who stood up for liberty and freedom 171 years ago.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (AWARDING A CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL TO MICHAEL ELLIS <em>DeBAKEY</em>, M.D. -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this legislation to award Dr. Michael E. DeBakey with the Congressional Gold Medal. I would also like to thank my friend and neighbor, AL GREEN, as well as my fellow Texan, Dr. BURGESS, for introducing this bill to honor and celebrate the life and achievements of Dr. Michael DeBakey. 
   Over the course of his long life, Dr. DeBakey has been a tremendous asset to his long-time home of Houston and has made a considerable contribution to the advancement of medicine. His accomplishments are numerous, both in traditional medicine and military medicine. Dr. DeBakey volunteered for enlistment in World War II where he helped to develop mobile army surgical hospitals. His commitment to military medicine continued with his work to establish both the Veterans Affairs Medical Center System and the establishment of the Commission on Veterans Medical Problems of the National Research Council. In recognition of his service to the U.S. Armed Forces and our country's wounded soldiers and veterans, the VA Medical Center in Houston is formally known as the Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center.  
   Dr. DeBakey is a medical pioneer in the area of cardiac surgery, which is his expertise. His career is highlighted by a number of ``firsts.'' While still a student, he invented a roller pump for blood transfusions. He performed the first successful coronary bypass; he was the first to successfully use a partial artificial heart; he supervised the first successful multi-organ transplant and then led the way for telemedicine with the first demonstration of open-heart surgery broadcasted overseas by satellite. 
   Mr. Speaker, this list represents only a snapshot of Dr. DeBakey's service. He also was the first president of Baylor College of Medicine where he developed the fellowship and residency programs at his namesake Department of Surgery. Today, Baylor is one of the jewels of the Texas Medical Center, in large part due to Dr. DeBakey's leadership, and has been the site of countless medical miracles for patients from Texas and around the world. A true testament to Dr. DeBakey's impact is the admiration he has earned from the Houston community, more than 60,000 members of which count Dr. DeBakey as their physician. 
   Internationally, Dr. DeBakey has been recognized and honored by well over a dozen governments and even inducted into the Academy of Athens, a society founded by Plato. His many awards include the U.S. Army Legion of Merit and the Presidential Medal of Freedom awarded by President Johnson and the National Medal of Science awarded by President Reagan. 
   I can think of no physician better suited for the Congressional Gold Medal, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill to bestow that honor upon Dr. DeBakey.

<DOCNO>Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. (STATEMENT ON HURRICANE IKE -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker and Members, I want to use my 1 minute today to talk about the disaster from Hurricane Ike in the district I represent. 
   These two pictures behind me are two separate homes that were hit by the wave action, the storm surge. You can see, this house is totally destroyed, and in this home, literally the waves went right through the home, knocked down the brick and everything else. 
   That is not counting the thousands of homes and businesses and even industry that the power is out. Certain zip codes are more than 50 percent out of power, and when you have a Houston September, which is really summertime, I have folks living outside their homes literally for the last 10 days. 
   Mr. Speaker, the supplemental today for the CR is something that is so important to my area and all of Southeast Texas. I want to thank both the Speaker and Chairman Obey and my colleagues for helping work on funding for that for the initial disaster assistance, $22 billion for disaster relief activities, including $6.5 billion for CDBG funding and $8 billion for FEMA assistance, which is just the down payment. 
   You have the fourth largest city in the country. Southeast Texas is devastated. To get that community back up, we need the assistance. Just like we helped California with the fires and the earthquakes, the floods in the Midwest and everywhere else, our community needs that help too, and I want to thank the leadership for doing it. 
   These two homes are in Baytown, Texas, in East Harris County, that I share with Congressman TED POE. This is actually in our district that I saw Monday morning with the mayor, Steve DonCarlos, and a city council member. 
   You can see what just the storm surge did. Just think about what hurricane force winds did to people's homes. We are a Pine trees area, so we have a lot of those trees that have fallen on houses and powerlines.
