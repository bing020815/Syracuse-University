<TEXT>
   Mr. TOWNS. Thank you very much for yielding time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 964, the SPY Act, which would greatly improve the privacy of consumers' online computer use. The time has come for this bill to pass. 
   A lot of hard work has been put into this legislation. First and foremost, I  would like to commend Congresswoman Mary Bono, the Republican sponsor of the bill. Of course, without her hard work, insight and persistence on this issue, we would not be where we are today. I have been proud to work with her on this bill, and I salute her for all of her efforts. 
   Of course, we have been down this road a few times now with several hearings; and, of course, we passed it before. But this time I think that people realize how important this legislation is, and I do feel that it should go all the way. 
   I also want to commend Chairman Dingell and Ranking Member Barton for their strong commitment to this issue and leadership in getting our bill to the floor. I would like to thank my very good friend, the subcommittee chairman, Chairman Rush of Chicago, Illinois, Ranking Member Stearns, who has been a friend for many, many years as well, for their hard work on this legislation. They have stayed with it and gone through the process over and over again because they recognize how important this legislation is to our country. 
   Finally, I would like to acknowledge all of the staff for their hard work, especially Consuela Washington and David Cavicke for their hard work and, of course, their suggestions and ideas and recommendations. I would like to just take this opportunity to thank them. 
   There is no question that spyware is a serious problem. Spyware software, which is downloaded without a computer owner's knowledge, invades one's privacy by recording and transmitting personal information, monitoring the Web site someone visits, or even stealing documents from an individual's computer. Other programs hijack a computer by changing home pages or forcing a person to click through multiple screens until a spyware program is downloaded. 
   In fact, problems related to spyware have become so widespread that I cannot run into someone who hasn't been negatively affected by it. This is a big change from when we first began this effort a few years ago. There were only a few people complaining, but now we have a lot of people complaining. Now we know the seriousness of the problem and that we need Federal legislation to safeguard privacy, as well as to ensure the long-term integrity of e-commerce. 
   Today's legislation provides consumers with new tools to protect themselves from unwanted, harmful software. Under the bill, consumers would have to receive a clear and concise warning about the spyware program. Second, consumers would have to provide their affirmative consent before the program could operate on their computer. Finally, Mr. Speaker, consumers must have the option to easily disable any harmful spyware programs to their computer. While some consumers may want to share their information to receive free games other discount offers, all consumers have the right to make that choice. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, and this time I really mean finally, any time we legislate on highly technical matters there is always a danger of stifling innovation and making the use of legitimate software too burdensome. It is a very difficult tightrope to walk. But I think we have done an excellent job in walking that tightrope. 
   This bill addresses many of the concerns raised, while at the same time retaining a meaningful notice and consent regime to protect consumer privacy. 
   Through much hard work, we have carefully crafted a strong bipartisan consumer protection bill, and I would urge my colleagues to support this. This is a quality piece of legislation, and I hope that we are able to move it through both Houses very quickly and that the President would sign it into law.

   Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to say farewell to a great friend and a great American, Jack Valenti, who passed away last Thursday. 
   When Jack spoke, people listened. His soaring eloquence and remarkable intellect made this town a better place and all of us better legislators. How lucky we were to know him and to have him as a resource and a friend. 
   Jack served in President Lyndon Johnson's administration, and made his name and reputation early. Jack quickly became known as a hard worker, making friends with both Democrats and Republicans alike. When Jack resigned his White House position and became president of the Motion Picture Association of America, his star really began to shine. 
   We are going to miss Jack Valenti, a person that had the ability to bring people together, a person that had the ability to let people understand that we all need each other. 
   Jack, we are going to miss you, but I am certain you will be screening pictures in heaven.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TOWNS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Rev. Dr. Suzan Johnson Cook. Rev. Cook is the pastor at the Believers' Christian Fellowship Church, which she founded in 1996 after serving as pastor of the Mariners' Temple Baptist Church in downtown Manhattan for 13 years. In 2002, Rev. Cook became the first woman elected president of the 10,000-member Hampton, Virginia, University Ministers Conference, which represents all the historically African American denominations. Her list of other ``firsts'' includes: first woman appointed Chaplain of the New York Police Department and the first female baptist minister from the Bronx to receive a White House fellowship. 
   A woman of promise, passion, diligence, and determination, Rev. Cook is the author of eight successful books. In 1997 Rev. Cook was featured by Ebony Magazine as one of the Nation's top 15 women in ministry. 
   Rev. Cook has toured nationally with Bishop T.D. Jakes and the ``God's Leading Ladies Conference.'' Her motto is ``If I can help somebody, then my living is not in vain.'' 
   A faculty member and graduate of Harvard University, she also received a doctorate of ministry degree from Union Theological Seminary, a master of divinity degree from Union Theological Seminary, and a master of arts degree from Columbia University. 
   Rev. Cook is married to Ronald Cook, and they reside in New York City with their two sons. 
   Dr. Cook is a powerful orator and was recently described in the New York Times as ``Billy Graham and Oprah rolled into one.'' Her mentoring and leadership skills have now charged her to form The Woman in Ministry International Summit, which supports and advocates for women church leaders. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like to recognize this magnificent minister, scholar, and dynamic leader, and urge my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to this outstanding member of the clergy.

<DOCNO>Mr. TOWNS. (CLOSE THE CONTRACTOR FRAUD LOOPHOLE ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 5712, the Close the Contractor Fraud Loophole Act, is a commonsense solution to a problem that we never should have had in the first place. When the administration wrote a new rule requiring Federal contractors to report fraud and over billing on government contracts, for some reason contracts performed overseas and commercial item contracts were exempted from that requirement. 
   That didn't make sense to my colleague on the Subcommittee on Government Management, Congressman Welch, because so much contract fraud and waste has been seen on contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan. He introduced this bill which will close these loopholes, and I salute him for that. 
   The Justice Department believes the new rule is necessary because few government contractors voluntarily disclose suspected instances of fraud. But the exemptions in the rule as written would leave out contractors like those in Iraq and Afghanistan, where we have spent billions on reconstruction contracts over the past 5 years. Over that period, the Justice Department has uncovered at least $14 million in contract bribes in those two countries alone. Contractors must be held to the same standards no matter where they perform their work. 
   Since Congressman Welch brought attention to this loophole, introduced this bill, and called for the hearing our subcommittee held last week, the administration has said it is leaning toward including overseas and commercial item contracts in the final fraud reporting rule. I am happy to hear that, but we cannot get them to guarantee that these loopholes would be closed. That is why Mr. Welch's bill is necessary, to make sure that loopholes are closed for good. Another way to put it, this legislation will help them deal with a problem that should not have occurred. 
   I want to thank Congressman Welch for bringing this problem to the attention of the subcommittee. I would also like to thank the chairman of our full committee, Congressman Waxman, and also thank the ranking member of the full committee, Congressman Davis. And I would like to thank the ranking member of the subcommittee, Congressman Bilbray, for helping us bring this bill to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, at a time when our national security is of paramount concern, criminals who cheat the government must be identified, stopped and punished. H.R. 5712 will help make sure that taxpayer dollars are used for their intended purpose, and not to line the pockets of corrupt individuals or companies. So I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3928) to require certain large government contractors that receive more than 80 percent of their annual gross  revenue from Federal contracts to disclose the names and salaries of their most highly compensated officers, and for other purposes, as amended. 
   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. TOWNS. (GOVERNMENT FUNDING TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3928, the Government Funding Transparency Act of 2008, will provide more information about executive pay at large organizations that get almost all of their revenue from Federal taxpayers' dollars. It closes a loophole in the current law. 
   Right now, the salaries of most people who are paid from Federal funds are public information. The salaries of every Member of Congress is public information. However, large private companies that draw most of their revenue from Federal funds have no such requirements. As a result, nobody knows  if the taxpayers are funding enormous executive pay packages. 
   This bill is intended to apply the same standards of transparency to these large companies that apply to other people and groups that benefit from Federal expenditures. For example, each year the Federal Government spends hundreds of billions of dollars on contracts. In 2006 alone, the Federal Government spent over $400 billion. 
   This increase in spending has enriched Federal contractors by way of record-breaking profits and escalating executive compensation. Yet, although the government spends billions of dollars on private contractors, the American taxpayers and Congress know very little about the financial and compensation policies of these firms. 
   This bill is very narrowly targeted. It requires disclosure of executive pay only from private companies that bring in more than $25 million a year in Federal funds and only if those Federal funds are more than 80 percent of the company's revenue. 
   The executives of companies falling into that category are basically being paid by the taxpayers, and the taxpayers have a right to know where their money is going. I don't have a problem with people making money. That's okay. That is not what this bill is about. It is about getting the information needed to see if taxpayers' dollars are being well spent. That is important. 
   If a company whose revenue is primarily from government funds can pay its executives millions of dollars, it raises questions about whether the government is getting a good bargain. It suggests the government could spend its money more efficiently through more competition or more different requirements. Enormous taxpayer-funded pay packages should be a trigger for more oversight of the programs involved. 
   The sponsor of this bill, Mr. Murphy from Connecticut, has put in a lot of work on this bill because he recognizes the importance of greater transparency and the need of safeguarding tax bill dollars from waste, fraud, and abuse. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is an important step towards our goal of improving accountability and transparency in Federal spending. We should know whether taxpayers are footing the bill for high salaries paid to executives. I fully support its passage, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. TOWNS. (CONTRACTORS AND FEDERAL SPENDING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3033, the Contractors and Federal Spending Accountability Act of 2008, will help give Federal contracting officials the information they need to award contracts to most deserving companies. The Federal Government must spend taxpayer dollars as efficiently and responsibly as possible, and it is our job to make sure that happens. This bill will help Federal officials to decide whether or not a company bidding for a contract is responsible enough to get it. 
   If someone has to spend a lot of money on something, like a car, the responsible thing to do is to make sure that the person or dealership you will be doing business with is responsible and won't rip you off. You would want to find all the information that you can about how they do business. 
   The Federal Government must spend taxpayer dollars as efficiently and responsibly as possible, and it is our job to make sure that happens. This bill will help Federal officials to decide whether or not a company bidding for a contract is responsible enough to get it. 
   H.R. 3033 mandates the creation of a database that will record legal proceedings brought by the Federal Government and State governments against contractors. It will also record suspensions and debarments, whether previous contracts have been terminated for cause, and any previous finding by contracting officials that a company does not have a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics. All Federal officials who award contracts will have access to this data, and it will go a long way to help them make informed decisions about the companies they are considering. 
   The bill also requires that if the database shows that someone is a repeat offender, two or more serious convictions or judgments for the same issue within 3 years, then the contracting officer has to explain in writing why they believe the contractor is currently responsible before a new contract can be awarded. This is another commonsense idea that will save money for the taxpayers. 
   I want to thank my friend and colleague from New York, Carolyn Maloney, for sponsoring this bill and for putting so much work into it. When she was on the New York City Council, she passed a similar law. The New York City database, called Vendex, has been a great success, and it is the model of the Federal database that this bill creates. 
   I also want to thank the chairman of our full committee, Congressman Waxman. Of course, I want to thank Ranking Member Davis, and I want to thank the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Bilbray, for his support as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3033 will be an important tool to help Federal officials make the best use of taxpayer dollars when awarding contracts. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment which also goes to the heart of my concerns that certain technologies were excluded from receiving loan guarantees. Nuclear power emits no greenhouse gases and needs to be part of the solution towards addressing the concerns of climate change. In some cases, companies have stated that without loan guarantees, plans for new nuclear plants will be abandoned in favor of other forms of generating capacity to meet the growing demand for baseload electricity. This will not serve our nation's energy security and environmental interests. The Export-Import Bank has billions of dollars of loan guarantees available for financing these types of projects overseas.

   Mr. TOWNS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of S. 1046, the Senior Professional Performance Act of 2008, introduced by Senator George Voinovich of Ohio. 
   This legislation passed the Senate with an amendment by unanimous consent on July 11, 2008, and was referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. 
   This legislation amends Federal pay provisions to raise the cap on base pay for certain senior-level scientific and professional government employees while eliminating locality-based comparability payments for the employees. 
   The legislation makes small changes in the procedures for new appointments of senior-level scientific and professional provisions classified above GS-15. The legislation also allows the director of the Office of Personnel Management to extend the certification of an agency's performance appraisal system, which is otherwise limited to 24 months under the bill, for up to 6 months. 
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that implementing this legislation would cost the Federal Government roughly $7 million between 2008 and 2012, which would be paid from discretionary appropriations. This legislation would not affect direct spending or revenues. 
   In 2003, Congress enacted legislation to reform the pay-for-performance management system for the Senior Executive Service. This legislation, as amended, authorizes agencies to develop and implement similar pay and performance management systems for senior level scientific and professional personnel in order to retain these talented and capable employees. 
   With the prediction on the high numbers of Federal workers eligible for retirement, it is important that the Federal Government have tools in place to recruit and retain a highly skilled workforce. S. 1046 provides agencies with the flexibility needed to meet future workforce needs of the Federal Government. We recognize that pay-for-performance systems are still under review. However, this bill serves as a first step to improving innovative Federal compensation systems. 
   Therefore, Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation by agreeing to pass S. 1046.

   Mr. TOWNS. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 928, the Inspector General Reform Act of 2008, focuses on the important role of the Inspectors General in providing independent oversight within Federal agencies. By investigating and reporting waste, fraud and abuse to both agency leaders and to the Congress, Inspectors General play a critical role in maintaining checks and balances in the Federal Government. 
   This bill strengthens and reforms the Inspector General system by providing greater independence and accountability for IG offices. H.R. 928 first passed this House last October with more than 400 votes. The other body passed a similar bill sponsored by Senator McCaskill earlier this year. We have worked with the Senate to resolve the differences between the two bills and produce the amended bill now under consideration. It passed the Senate by unanimous consent last night. 
   H.R. 928 enhances the rank and pay of IGs within their agencies, and requires that Congress be promptly informed if an IG is transferred or removed from office. It provides a mechanism for IGs to report to Congress if their budgets are inadequate to perform their responsibilities and sets aside funding for training. And the bill establishes an Inspectors General Council, and sets procedures for investigating potential IG misconduct. 
   I would like to commend the sponsor of this bill, my good friend Mr. Cooper from the great State of Tennessee, for his work in crafting this legislation. He has worked on it for several years as part of his work on improving government accountability. 
   I also thank Chairman Waxman and Ranking Member Davis as well as the subcommittee Ranking Member Bilbray for their work in moving this bill forward. 
   H.R. 928 will make sure that the IGs have the legal authority and tools necessary to continue their role as nonpartisan, professional, honest brokers on behalf of the people.

   Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1021, supporting the goals, ideals, and history of National Women's History Month. 
   As recently as the 1970s, women's history was largely unaddressed in school curriculum and among the general public. In 1987, the National Women's History Project petitioned Congress to expand the national celebration of Women's History from 1 week to the entire month of March. Since then, the National Women's History Month Resolution has passed both Chambers of Congress with bipartisan support each year. 
   Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have been a strong supporter of Women's Rights, such as guaranteeing that women and families have adequate time to care for themselves and family members when they become ill, without facing the loss of job security and wages. As a member of the Health Subcommittee, I have worked diligently with my colleagues in Congress to bring increased awareness and services for women's health issues, such as early detection and treatment of ovarian cancer. Since its inception in 1987, Women's History Month, under the guidance of the National Women's History Project, has become a renowned celebration of the accomplishments of women everywhere, recognizing the limitless opportunities that women have in the modern world, and generating a renewed interest in the rich cultural heritage of women. 
   This year during Women's History Month, we celebrate female artists and their contribution of originality, beauty, and imagination to the art world. I hope that we will continue to work together in Congress to support the cultural contributions of women, and critical women's rights and women's health issues, not only during Women's History Month, but year round.

   Harriet Tubman was not only an abolitionist, leading more than 700 slaves to freedom, but served nobly in the Union Army during the Civil War as the first female to head an armed expedition. 
   Following her accomplishments in the Civil War, Harriet Tubman went on to be a leader in the women's suffrage movement, diligently fighting for women's right to vote, and founded the Harriet Tubman Home for the Sick and Aged, a home and hospital to care for elderly and ailing African-Americans in New York. 
   Her bravery and dedication to the principles of freedom and equality serve as a positive example to us today, as we continue working together to provide quality education, healthcare, housing, and opportunity to all Americans, regardless of race, gender or income.

   Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, I believe that we have a good bill that will help provide needed health insurance for 5 million more low-income children, that helps us reduce health disparities, equalizes payments under Medicare to allied health professions, acknowleges the role of schools in health care service delivery and protects senior citizens from deceptive and aggressive marketing tactics by private Medicare sales people. I applaud the inclusion of health information technology in this bill. I have a draft bill in this area related to connecting medically underserved communities to reduce health disparities and I believe this bill could further that process. 
   I applaud this bill for making a number of efforts to collect racial and ethnic health data. Numerous groups including the Rand Corporation, the Congressional Black Caucus, and the Kaiser Family Foundation and others have stressed that efforts to reduce and eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities cannot proceed without comprehensive data collection. 
   I am pleased that this bill creates payment fixes under Medicare for a number of allied health professions, including midwives and marriage and family therapists. I had hoped a similar provision for physicians' assistants could have been included. However, this bill can address the ability of physicians to delegate hospice care to physicians' assistants without any further cost considerations. 
   I am particularly pleased that the overall tone of the bill is to help children improve their lives and their health by offering a guaranteed dental benefit and helping States enroll and retain more eligible children, including the children of legal immigrants. I am fully supportive of the idea of allowing ``qualifying States'' to use their CHIP allotments for Medicaid if that will cover more kids. 
   I believe that the attempt to categorize this bill as cutting Medicare is nothing more than a sham. Thousands of seniors who need part ``D'' assistance will benefit from easier enrollement procedures. Almost 550,000 seniors in my State will be protected on limitations to out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs. Companies have for 3 years overcharged Medicare from 19 to 70 percent and have told seniors that cutting these over payments will cut their benefits. That is simply not true. It is not necessary to choose between funding health care for children and health care for seniors. This legislation does both. 
   Urban and rural districts will benefit from the proactive approach in this bill to reach out to ``hard-to-reach'' communities to spread the word about enrolling in SCHIP. That makes good sense and is supported by a wide range of groups in our community, including the National Medical Association. 
   My city, State and many stakeholder groups are also fully supportive of simplifying the applications process and speeding up and streamlining eligibility determinations. In addition, States like New York that fund SCHIP beyond 200 percent of Federal poverty levels are appreciative of the ability to earn bonus payments available to States that have implemented 5 of 7 practices that would increase outreach, enrollment, and retention efforts. 
   In addition, I am supportive of the option to enroll children who would otherwise age out of Medicaid or CHIP. 
   The majority tried very hard to include all medically necessary services, but cost factors did not make that fully possible. Indeed, I am appreciative that you were able to include dental and mental health services in this bill as a State mandate because these services are predictors of good health status. In fact when these services are not readily available it can be tragic. We witnessed the unfortunate demise of young Deamonte Driver in Maryland from a tooth abscess this past winter, preventable by extracting a tooth at the cost of about $80. Instead, he suffered a brain infection that cost the system $250,000 in surgery bills and Deamonte his life because he could not receive treatment in time. This bill will help avoid these types of tragedies. 
   I am very supportive of the creation of the Children's Access Payment and Equity Commission because I believe that with a good balance of commissioners, including those from medically underserved communities, we can more closely monitor access to care from these communities. 
   Other features of this bill that I fully support include: coverage of pregnant women; the increase for allowable resources for asset testing; continuous enrollment and the encouragement of culturally appropriate enrollment and retention practices. 
   I do, however, have a number of concerns. I am very concerned that New York's public hospital system stands to lose up to $350 million if the moratorium on intergovernment tax transfers is not extended. In addition, our State and city will lose even more than that if we eliminate graduate medical education payments. I hope that we can work together to prevent this tragedy, not rust for my own State and city, but for others as well. 
   I am still concerned that we need to give a date certain to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to begin an additional compendia to support coverage of off-label uses of cancer drugs.  
   I am concerned that the freeze on payments to the home health industry will continue to have negative effects in my State and city. 
   I am also concerned that Medicare beneficiaries will not receive all of the necessary treatments available to them. Further, I would prefer they have the broadest formulary coverage so that seniors are not forced to switch to other medications which are not rated as therapeutic equivalents.

<DOCNO>Mr. TOWNS. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOWNS. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for yielding time to me, and to say that I thank the leadership of this House. I thank Speaker  Nancy Pelosi and I thank IKE SKELTON for bringing this resolution forward. 
   You know, I served in the military, and I have great admiration and respect for the military, and I also cannot understand why people are saying that if you support this resolution you are not supporting the troops. I can't make that connection because I support the troops, but I must admit I also support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, 4 years have passed since this administration began its ill-fated war in Iraq. No weapons of mass destruction have been found, no coalition of nations has fought in the war, and the American people are still waiting for a plan for a real war against terrorism. 
   Though Saddam Hussein is now dead, this fact alone has not been worth nearly $400 billion in taxpayer funds, the loss of 3,000 lives, and 26,000 casualties. What message does this send to the American people? I have been hearing this all day long coming from the minority side. 
   Let me tell you what the message is that we are sending to the American people: That our priorities are upside down, and we need to fix them.     
   I have opposed this war from the very beginning, because I was concerned that we would come to this point where we would spend all the money on the war and not have the resources to do the things to keep our Nation and to make our Nation strong. 
   Almost all the speakers on the other side expressed their support for the troops. I want you to know that on this side we also express our support for the troops. This administration has asked us to cut funding for children, for children's health insurance. We were asked to cut critical funds for Medicaid and Medicare, a loss of dollars that may cripple our public health system. Many of our hospitals are actually closing, and we are asked to provide token funding so No Child Left Behind becomes ``most children now are left behind.'' 
   This war and its budgetary requirements are squeezing the American people, and I say that enough is enough. But, no, the administration is asking  for 20,000 more combat troops and approximately 15,000 support troops. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that it will cost approximately $13 billion. 
   This administration has had troop surges in the past; this is not new. What is different about this troop surge? It is more of the same, just more targets we are sending. 
   In October, the administration sent more combat troops into Baghdad to attempt to end the growing violence; however, the violence in Baghdad has only grown worse. Now the United States military is caught up in a very violent civil war, something they are neither trained nor equipped to deal with. Sending additional troops to Iraq actually makes things worse for Iraqi civilians and for our troops. 
   Our military is already stretched too thin. Many soldiers are doing two and three and four tours of duty. The administration now plans to send additional troops into a city almost the size of New York City, and they may have to go house to house in order to keep warring sides from killing each other. 
   What message does this send to the American people when we tell them we have no more money for children's health insurance, no more money for Medicaid, no more money for Medicare, no more money for senior programs and no more money for children's education? And how do you think the American people will react to more fatalities and more wounded? How long will Congress keep supporting a war that has nothing to do with ending terrorism? 
   I ask the question tonight, how long will this administration keep ignoring the real needs of the American people? It is time for America to withdraw from Iraq and focus on the real business of the American people: better health care, more jobs, education for all of our children. We should not send an additional 21,500 troops. That only means we are sending additional targets into the area.

<DOCNO>Mr. TOWNS. (HOUSE REPUBLICANS SHOULD WALK AWAY FROM PRESIDENT BUSH ON CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, last week most of the Republicans once again marched in lockstep with the Bush administration. I have just been informed that the President has vetoed the CHIP bill. That is a shame and it is a disgrace. Despite the fact that this Democratic Congress crafted a bipartisan bill with Republican input, most Republican Members chose to ignore the health care needs of 10 million children. It is a shame and a national disgrace. 
   The Children's Health Insurance Program has helped our Nation reduce the number of uninsured children. During each of the 8 years of the program, the number of uninsured children decreased, but over the last 2 years these numbers have actually gone up. Based on these troubling trends, this Democratic Congress did not believe that a straight reauthorization was enough. We needed to strengthen the CHIP program, and that is exactly what we did. 
   And now I have been informed that the President has vetoed it. That's a disgrace.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 928, the Improving Government Accountability Act, focuses on the important role of the Inspector General in providing independent oversight within Federal agencies. By investigating and reporting waste, fraud and abuse to both agency leaders and to the Congress, Inspectors General play a critical role in maintaining checks and balances in the Federal Government. 
   When Congress created the Inspectors General nearly 30 years ago, the idea was that having independent officials inside the Federal agency would help detect and prevent wasteful spending and mismanagement. This concept has been a tremendous success. Investigations by IGs have resulted in the recovery of billions of dollars from companies and individuals who defrauded the Federal Government.     
   These investigations have led to thousands of criminal prosecutions, contractor debarments, employee suspensions, and in some instances, dismissals. 
   In sum, the work of IGs to expose criminal and abusive action in government has gone a long way to create the cleaner and more efficient government the taxpaying public expects and deserves.  
   Of course, even the best systems need some improvement from time to time, and that is the reason for this bill today, to effectively carry out that mission. Inspectors General must be independent and objective, which requires that they be insulated from improper management and political pressure. 
   To preserve the credibility of the office, Inspectors General must also perform their duties with integrity and apply the same standards of conduct and accountability to themselves as they apply to the agencies that they audit and investigate. 
   In recent years, there have been several episodes which raised questions about the independence and accountability of IGs. These episodes have been well documented in hearings of the Oversight Committee as well as other standing committees of the House. In some instances, IGs who are seen as too aggressive in pursuing waste at their agencies had their budget cut or were threatened with dismissal. In other cases, IGs who abused their authority remained in office in part because there were no statutory standards or procedures for removal. This bill is designed to address both of those problems. H.R. 928 creates fixed terms of office for Inspectors General and specific reasons for their removal. It allows IGs to submit their budget requests directly to the Congress. The bill establishes an Inspector General council and sets procedures for investigation of potential IG misconduct. And the bill increases the rank and pay of IGs as well. 
   This is a strong bill and a necessary bill. Passing this bill will send a message that Congress values the work of the Inspectors General and the oversight that they provide. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Chairman, this is a well thought-out amendment. I want to  commend the gentleman from North Carolina for this. It makes it clear that the bill is not intended to protect poorly performing IGs from removal. 
   There was some question about an IG who managed his office so poorly that it caused most of the senior career staff to quit, and then the IG would still be there. At least this amendment addresses that issue as well by adding gross mismanagement and gross waste of funds and abuse of authority as grounds for removal. This amendment clarifies that an IG who is not an effective leader can be removed for that reason. 
   We also support the technical and procedural changes that Mr. Miller has included in this amendment. This is a very, very good amendment, and I hope that it has support coming from both sides of the aisle, because this is an amendment that is long overdue.

   Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Chairman, the committee also supports this amendment by Mr. Miller. One of the problems that we have seen is that recent IG appointments have had far more experience in politics than they have had in investigating and auditing. 
   The council created by this amendment is advisory, but it will provide an independent evaluation of whether a candidate for appointment has the professional background and experience to succeed in the IG role. This information should be valuable to the President and to the Senate as they fill IG vacancies. 
   Mr. Chairman, I think this is a fine amendment and I am hoping that both sides of the aisle will support it. This is what strengthening legislation is all about, dialogue on both sides and then supporting. So I am hoping this amendment gets a strong, strong vote. It is a good amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TOWNS. Madam Speaker, Sylvia's Restaurant of Harlem is known as one of this country's greatest restaurants which has a selection of mouth-watering dishes that each time will leave you wanting more. This is one of the best-known restaurants in New York and serves its patrons good southern cooking with a dash of Sylvia's secret seasoning. 
   Sylvia Woods worked at Johnson's Luncheonette as a waitress. Her opportunity came when the owner offered to sell her the business. She purchased the original luncheonette by borrowing $20,000 from her mother who had to mortgage her farm in Hemingway, SC. 
   The establishment, which consists of not only the restaurant but catering and banquet facilities, was started in July of 1962. back then the menu consisted of very simple things; pigtails, lima beans, hamhocks, and neck bones. There was only one cook on staff and they picked their food up in the trunk of a car.  
   In 1981, they bought an adjoining building on Lenox Avenue, renovated it and turned it into a dining room. In 1992, Sylvia's son, Van Woods, launched a line of Sylvia's Soul Food Proucts. The line consists of Sylvia's world famous all-purpose sauces, pre-seasoned vegetables, spices, syrup, cornbread, pancake mixes, and several other items that can be found on the shelves at any grocery store. 
   With the help of some great investors, Sylvia's was able to open its second restaurant in Atlanta, Georgia in 1997. Sylvia's of Atlanta is located right across from City Hall. Plans are in the works to open additional Sylvia's restaurants in Texas, Kansas, Illinois, California, South Carolina, and Paris, France. 
   This well-known restaurant attracts a clientele that ranges from harlem locals to visiting celebrities including President Bill Clinton, Nelson Mandela, and Magic Johnson. 
   However, Sylvia's success is not based solely on her restaurants and food product line. Recently, the family launched a line of beauty products for hair and skin. Sylvia's beauty products consist of two brands: Sylvia's Beauty and Soul Products; and African Vision Products. 
   Sylvia and her husband Herbert will tell you the secret of their success is love, family and hard work, love of God, love of family, love of friends, customers, and love of work. 
   Sylvia and Herbert met in a bean field when they were 11 and 12 years old, respectively. They attended the same school and church and have now been married for nearly 65 years. 
   I would like to honor Sylvia's Soul Food Restaurant where I have eaten on many occasions and where I plan to eat again.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 3179, the Local Preparedness Acquisition Act. This is a bipartisan, good government bill that will permit state apd local governments to purchase homeland security and public safety equipment using General Services Administration contract schedules. 
   H.R. 3179 has the support of many state and local governments and the National Association of Counties. It will make it easier for  local officials to purchase the items they need to improve safety in their communities, while saving money at the same time. 
   The GSA Schedules are catalogues of more than 4 million commercial goods and services currently available to federal agencies at negotiated discount prices. Since 2002, Congress has enacted ``cooperative purchasing'' legislation that authorized state and local governments to purchase IT equipment and disaster recovery items from GSA schedules. 
   This bill further expands that authority to purchase items such as bomb detection equipment, perimeter security systems, and other homeland security goods and services from GSA Schedule 84. 
   It is important to note that this bill imposes no federal mandate and requires no new spending. Participation in the cooperative purchasing program is voluntary for both state and local governments and vendors. The analysis prepared by the Congressional Budget Office indicates that the bill has no net impact on federal spending and is the opposite of an unfunded mandate--in fact, it is a benefit to state and local governments. 
   This bill was developed jointly with the ranking member of the Government Management Subcommittee, Mr. BILBRAY. I thank him for his contribution to this legislation. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 3179.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of H. Res. 981, recognizing March 6, 2008, as the first-ever World Glaucoma Day. As a cosponsor of this resolution, I am proud to speak out in favor of greater support for glaucoma awareness and prevention. 
   Glaucoma is the second leading cause of preventable vision loss in the United States and the leading cause of permanent blindness worldwide. It afflicts 67 million people by some estimates. While glaucoma affects all age groups, it is of special concern to me because it disproportionately affects underserved minority populations, particularly African Americans over age 40 and Mexican Americans over 60. 
   The resolution before us supports the observance of World Glaucoma Day, which would raise awareness about glaucoma on a global scale. Awareness is especially important since nearly 90 percent of individuals with glaucoma are unaware that they have it. Moreover, regular comprehensive eye exams can lead to early diagnosis and treatment that can lessen the impact of this devastating disease. 
   The resolution also supports the efforts of the National Eye Institute and its commitment to continue research on the causes of glaucoma. By learning more about the causes of this insidious disease, we may one day find a cure. 
   The resolution also congratulates the American Glaucoma Society for its efforts to raise awareness about the prevalence of the disease. The American Glaucoma Society helps to preserve vision by supporting glaucoma specialists and scientists through the advancement of education and research.  
   I also wish to thank the Friends of the Congressional Glaucoma Caucus Foundation, a nonprofit foundation funded in part by the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention, for its outstanding contributions in providing free glaucoma screening for 200,000 people from 2001 to date, while administering the programs that include follow-up and treatment services across the country. Further, I must point out that I am a cosponsor of H.R. 3005, the Glaucoma Screening Act of 2007. This measure was introduced by Representatives Serrano and Boozman and Mr. Menendez of the Senate. I urge my colleagues on the House Energy and Commerce Committee to hold a hearing on this bill soon. 
   Finally, I want to thank my colleague, Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin, for her leadership on H. Res. 981, which recognizes March 6, 2008, as the first-ever World Glaucoma Day. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of its adoption. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   This is very important legislation to me. In the early part of my life, I worked for the Industrial Home for the Blind, which is now referred to as the Helen Keller Foundation. I had the opportunity to see and to talk to people, in many instances who were blind because they did not get the attention at an early stage and as a result they lost their vision. 
   So I think what we are doing here today is so important, that we pass this legislation which encourages people to seek treatment, encourages people to get eye exams. I think that is the thing we need to do. Because as my colleague indicated, early detection sometimes can prevent this. 
   On that note, I reserve the balance of my time.

I also would like to thank Congresswoman Baldwin for her outstanding work as well, who has been detained and not able to get here. But she has worked real hard on this because she understands how important it is in terms of early detection.  
   Ms. BALDWIN, Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 981, which recognizes March 6, 2008, as the first-ever World Glaucoma Day and I wish to thank my colleague, Mr. SESSIONS, for joining me in introducing this resolution. 
   Glaucoma is the second leading cause of preventable vision loss in the United States. It is a group of diseases that damages the optic nerve and leads to vision loss. An estimated 2.2 million Americans have glaucoma. An additional 2 million have glaucoma, but do not know it, as glaucoma often has no symptoms until vision loss occurs. 
   If left untreated, glaucoma leads to blindness, which has occurred in about 120,000 Americans. Worldwide, nearly 70 million people are affected by the disease. 
   Every American over the age of 60 is at risk of developing glaucoma, which also disproportionately affects minority populations. African Americans have a three times greater risk of developing this disease than white Americans, and it is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss in African Americans and Hispanics.  
   With early diagnosis and ongoing treatment, however, 90 percent of the cases where blindness occurs can be avoided. Awareness is crucial, so that individuals with known risk factors for glaucoma and those over the age of 40 should have regular, comprehensive eye examinations that include careful evaluation of the optic nerve and measurement of eye pressure. 
   So Mr. Speaker, I am happy today that the House of Representatives is considering this resolution, which seeks to expand global awareness about the incidence and burden of glaucoma. 
   In addition, Mr. Speaker, I also want to recognize the American Glaucoma Society for its efforts to expand awareness of the prevalence and economic burden of glaucoma. Their advocacy surrounding the first-ever World Glaucoma Day has been truly valuable in promoting eye health.

   Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 323, expressing congressional support for the goals and ideals of National Health Care Decisions Day. 
   As a cosponsor of this resolution, I understand the importance of making our health decisions clear to our family members and other loved ones through advanced directives. While it is very difficult for us to face the prospects of our own mortality, many of us write wills in order to ensure that our loved ones are adequately provided for in our absence. Unfortunately, we often do not take that care in making provisions regarding our end-of-life medical care. 
   Nobody can predict when disease, tragedy, or other medical conditions will render one unable to make medical decisions for ourselves. Accordingly, we must plan ahead in case of such a tragedy to ensure that our wishes are properly carried out. 
   Advanced directives are an integral part of any care-delivery plan. They are simply a statement by a competent person that articulates the medical, legal, and personal wishes regarding medical treatment in the event of future incapacity. 
   Where advanced directives are present, medical professionals, families, and loved ones are best able to make critical care decisions should a patient become unable to make sound judgments about their health care. 
   The resolution before us commemorates National Health Care Decisions Day on April 16, 2008. Although this specific day occurred last week, the goals and ideals of today should be recognized perpetually.     
   This resolution encourages those 18 years of age and older to prepare advance directives. It also encourages medical, civic, educational, religious and other nonprofit organizations to promote advance directive preparation, particularly among their constituents. 
   I would like to thank my colleague on the other side of the aisle, Representative PHIL GINGREY, for his work in raising this important issue. Our colleagues in the Senate have already recognized the need to highlight advance directives, and I urge us here in the House to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Pallone very much for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate East New York's Transit Technical High School boy's basketball team for winning the PSAL New York City Championship. 
   The East New York Transit defeated Thomas Edison High School of Queens with a score of 52-46. This is only the second time in the school's history that the Transit boys' basketball team made it to the State playoff. The first time was in 1993 when the team still played in the ``B'' division. 
   I would also like to congratulate the staff of New York Transit Tech and its principal, Larry Kalvar, and its basketball coach, Michael Perazzo. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask that you please join me in honoring the boys' basketball team at East New York Transit Tech High School for its outstanding accomplishment. 
   I also rise to congratulate Brooklyn's Thomas Jefferson High School girls' basketball team for winning the PSAL A-league championship. The girls at Jefferson defeated New Town High School championship team to win the title, finishing with an overall 17-1 record, making this the first girls' basketball team to represent the borough of Brooklyn in the State playoffs. 
   My congratulations also goes out to the Jefferson High School principal, Michael Alexander, and the girls' basketball team coach, Calvin Young, for doing a marvelous job with the team. We need to recognize him as well. 
   I ask that you all please join me in honoring the girls' basketball team at Brooklyn's Thomas Jefferson High School for this outstanding accomplishment. 
   Sometimes we criticize our young people about not doing what we feel is right, but here is a situation where some young people have done a very positive thing, and I think we should pause to salute them for that.

<DOCNO>Mr. TOWNS. (NATIONAL PROFESSIONAL SOCIAL WORK MONTH -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to honor America's social workers. This month provides us an opportunity to highlight the essential role that social workers play in alleviating some of America's most difficult problems. 
   Professional social workers are found in every facet of community life, including our schools, our hospitals, mental health clinics, senior citizen facilities, elected office, private practices, prisons, among our military personnel, and the list goes on and on.  
   I have had the opportunity to work with some outstanding social workers or to be involved professionally with them. I have been involved with Dr. Roger Witherspoon, who is a great social worker, Mr. Levander Lilly, Ruby Bullock, Betty Williams, Mark Handelman, Ed Pitt, Dr. Joe Jackson, Sam Hodes, and I can go on and on because of my many years of being involved in the field of social work. 
   This year's theme for National Professional Social Workers Month is ``Hope and Health; Help Starts Here.'' This theme reflects the important work being done by social workers in the health care field. 
   Social workers involved in health care often work within a multidisciplinary team which includes doctors, nurses and other medical professionals. This is an approach to ensure quality care for patients and their families. 
   I am grateful for the leadership and expertise that the members of the National Association of Social Workers provide to the people of America and, of course, around the world. Social workers in all disciplines use their collective power every day to strengthen our Nation's families and communities, help individuals overcome adversity, and advance sound social policies. The commitment and dedication of social workers to create a more positive environment for all of our people is to be commended. 
   Last year, the National Association of Social Workers released the results of a national study which warns of an impending shortage of social workers that threatens future services for all Americans, especially the most vulnerable among us, our children and our senior citizens. 
   Throughout history, social workers have addressed the needs of society and brought our Nation's social problems to the public's attention. As one of the 10 proud social workers of the House of Representatives, today I know firsthand how social workers across this country advocate for the humane, fair and beneficial policies for all of our citizens. 
   So I salute all social workers during this National Professional Social Work Month; and I say to my colleagues around the board, social workers make a great contribution to the improvement of the quality of life for so many people in this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. TOWNS. (NATIONAL SCHOOL COUNSELING WEEK -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOWNS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H Res. 932, Honoring National School Counseling Week. First, I'd like to thank my colleague, Representative LINDA S&#193;NCHEZ, for introducing this important resolution. 
   As a social worker, I recognize the invaluable role that guidance counselors and other social services personnel play in our schools. 
   These dedicated men and women devote their lives to ensuring the bright futures of our Nation's children, supporting them both academically and socially, and assisting them on the great journey towards higher education and a successful career. 
   Guidance counselors also play a vital role in our efforts to increase high school graduation and college enrollment rates. 
   However, despite our reliance on these important individuals for doing the crucial work of preparing our Nation's youth for entry into college and the real world, we often fail to give school counselors the support they need to do their jobs effectively. 
   Many of our schools are under-staffed with guidance counselors, and these hardworking individuals are tasked with serving an overwhelming number of students with a limited amount of resources. The average counselor-to-student ratio in our Nation's public schools is 1 to 436. We must acknowledge this reality, and direct our efforts in Congress toward increasing both our support and recognition of these hardworking men and women in our schools. 
   For these reasons, I am a proud co-sponsor of House Resolution 932, to recognize the important work of school guidance counselors, inspiring the youth of America, and providing them with much-needed support in their journey toward high school graduation and a prosperous future. 
   My fellow colleagues in Congress, I urge you to support House Resolution 932, so that we may celebrate the accomplishments and diligent efforts of guidance counselors in our Nation's schools.

<DOCNO>Mr. TOWNS. (FACILITATING PRESERVATION OF CERTAIN AFFORDABLE HOUSING DWELLING UNITS -- (House of Representatives - May 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOWNS. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding time to me, and I appreciate his help on this bill. I think it is an important piece of legislation. 
   I also thank Congresswoman Nydia Vel&#225;zquez. I guess I better also thank the chairman of the committee, Barney Frank, who also worked very hard on this, and the chairperson of the committee, Maxine Waters, on their assistance in getting us to this point. 
   Access to affordable housing is a serious problem across America, particularly with the weakening economy and rising gas, utility and food costs. 
   With a rise in mortgage foreclosures leading to people losing their homes and unprecedented waiting lists for public housing--and the list gets longer and longer and longer--the ability to find affordable housing is crucial. Every time I go back to my district, this is the subject that comes up: What can we do about finding an affordable apartment? 
   Along with my colleagues in New York, I have been working to ensure access to affordable housing throughout my tenure in the United States Congress. But as neighborhoods developed, residents have been priced out of their homes and neighborhoods. And more and more, this is a cry coming from across the land. 
   For these reasons, along with my colleagues Congressman King, Congressman Frank, Congresswoman Waters, and Congresswoman Vel&#225;zquez, we introduced H.R. 5937 which will facilitate the preservation of affordable housing units. 
   This bill will convert HUD contracts into a new 20-year housing assistance payment contract under the Multifamily Housing Restructuring and Affordability Act of 1997. Conversion of these HUD contracts will allow purchasers of certain affordable housing developments to secure the long-term financing necessary to purchase the property.  
   By making these properties affordable to the owners, they can in turn keep the housing affordable for the tenants. I hope that you will join us today in voting ``yes'' on H.R. 5937 to help preserve affordable housing. 
   And let me just say to my good friends throughout this body that there is no additional cost. I think what we are doing here is being creative and making it possible that people who are having difficulty will be able to have apartments. I think that during this difficult time of foreclosures and the problems we are having, I think this legislation is crucial. I want to thank my colleagues for supporting this.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I rise to support my colleague for bringing this resolution forward. I want to congratulate him on that. 
   I rise today in support of H. Res. 1086, recognizing National Nurses Week on May 6 through May 12. As a cosponsor of this resolution, I'm proud to speak out in honor of our valiant, committed nurses who make our Nation and our loved ones safe and well. I pay special tribute to my esteemed colleagues in Congress who introduced this resolution and who are, themselves, nurses: The Honorable Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, the Honorable Lois Capps of California, and the Honorable Carolyn McCarthy of my home State, New York. 
   Additionally, I want to pay special tribute to the nurses who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan and the nurses who generally attend to those who suffer wounds from those conflicts. 
   Along with other health care professionals, a nurse is responsible for the treatment, safety, and recovery of acutely or chronically ill people. They also help to maintain a patient's health and provide treatment to those who are facing life-threatening emergencies like 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina. Nurses are also involved in medical and nursing research and provide a wide range of nonclinical functions. 
   Today, there are 2.4 million registered nurses in the United States; 92 percent of the registered nurses are women. There are 531,000 licensed vocational nurses; 1.8 million is the number of nursing psychiatric and home health aides. We cannot do without them. 
   I greatly commend the American Nurses Association and the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners, and all of the nursing associations and academic institutions who train nurses and promote the advancement of the profession. I look forward to working with members of the associations, academia, and others in making certain that we continue to increase the amount of nurses. 
   In closing, I wish to thank my colleagues again, Congresswoman Johnson, Congresswoman Capps, and Congresswoman McCarthy for their leadership on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution. And I want to thank very much my colleague from Texas (Mr. Green) and, of course, others who have been involved in this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by thanking you for allowing me to speak on this resolution. 
   Fraud and abuse is very prevalent, and, of course, we need to do something about it. So I would like to say to the committee members that too long have we allowed this fraud and abuse to go without speaking out on it in the fashion that we should. 
   People are being abused. Family members are being abused as a result of fraud and abuse. So I think that we need to send a message to those that are out there who are doing these kind of things to say that we will not sit back and allow you to do this. 
   We have people that are taking another person's identity and going out, making bills and creating problems and creating situations where the person's credit is bad, and when they begin to move forward to try to do something on behalf of their family,  they can't do it because somebody else has done some things that they should not have done and make this family have to suffer. 
   So I would like to just thank the sponsors of this resolution, and to say to you that I think it will draw the attention of those who might not be fully aware of what is going on. I think it will let law enforcement also know that the Members of the United States Congress are very concerned about these issues. 
   And I would like to salute the sponsors. I would like to salute the Energy and Commerce Committee for bringing this resolution forward so quickly because the time is now that we must send a statement, make a statement to let people know that we are not going to sit back and let them do these kind of things to create problems for people. 
   So I would say to you, on that note, I look forward to working with the committee to see what we can do to further dramatize and to highlight this very serious situation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, this is a healing moment in the long struggle for full and fair recognition for the African American victims of HIV and AIDS. I am proud that the Congress and our Nation continues to recognize the changing face of the HIV and AIDS. And I urge you to unanimously support this resolution. 
   In the previous Congress, we spent much time and energy on the issue of HIV and AIDS, and rightfully so. I am glad that the Nation and the Congress have come together today to support a House resolution that recognizes the importance of supporting awareness in African American communities across this Nation. 
   This is a special moment for me, because the HIV/AIDS crisis has hit the national African American community, and my own district in Brooklyn, New York has been hit real hard. So it is critical for Congress today to say to the Nation that this issue at this time is important, just as we did in the last session when we included for the first time the Minority AIDS Initiative in the Ryan White reauthorization. 
   I am particularly pleased that today's Congress is recognizing the goals and ideals of National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. The importance of prevention and testing in African American communities is very, very important, the need for full and equitable treatment of the disease in communities of color. 
   My colleagues will speak to other aspects of the resolution. However, we are united in our support for strengthening the public health infrastructure to assist African American communities in fighting this epidemic. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for this critical resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   But let me just say I would like to thank the staff members. I would like to thank the leadership of the committees, who, of course, have been very involved in this issue because this is a very serious issue. 
   People are dying because of the fact that we are not paying enough attention to this disease. So I want to thank people like Congresswoman Barbara Lee from California, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, and, of course, many others who have been there in the forefront indicating the fact that the time to do something is now. 
   This resolution sort of highlights how important this issue is and that we must begin to address it. So I am hoping that the Members of the United States Congress will join us in supporting this resolution and not only that but to help us get information out to people. 
   People need to be tested but not only to be tested. When they are tested, they need to have treatment. It is one  thing to test; it is another thing to have treatment. Just a test to be testing does not make a lot of sense. But when you test and then you have a treatment program and you get education out, then it makes a lot of sense.

Not only our churches but also our 501(c)(3) organizations. They need to be involved in this as well because we are talking about life and death. And the fact is that if we get involved, I think that we can begin to turn this around. 
   Right now we are not winning the battle, and I think that we need to win. In order to win, we have to get all the soldiers involved. And I think that the church is crucial. They need to be involved in this issue. So we need to try to get the word out to them and hope that they will respond in a major kind of way because people are dying that really don't have to die if we get this information to them.

<DOCNO>Mr. TOWNS. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - June 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOWNS. I want to talk about the energy situation tonight. When I go back to my district, the number one subject today is that people are talking about the cost of fuel. Of course, the other one is affordable housing. But when you look at it, they are all connected. 
   Of course, when you talk to the taxi drivers, they are saying we cannot make a living because of the fact that gasoline is so high. The bus drivers, the same thing. Hardworking people are finding it almost impossible to make it today because of the price of fuel. 
   Of course, this is something that has happened all of a sudden. In 2005, gasoline was $2.20 per gallon in December of 2005. Now, today the price of gasoline is $4.10 per gallon. That is June 19, 2008, according to the Energy Information Administration, the agency that collects official energy statistics for the United States Government. In other words, gas is just creating a tremendous problem in this Nation. 
   Now I know people will say, Well, here's the solution. But let me just say to you there is no silver bullet here, that there is no single solution to this problem. But I think the worst thing in the world to do is to continue to ignore the problem. 
   You have people saying, Well, ethanol is the solution. Then you have others will say that the fact that ethanol might not be the solution, but we need to make certain that we create cars that will go further. All these things are good, but when we are dealing with a problem like this, whenever you make a decision or make an adjustment, there's always something else that is going to happen. 
   Hybrid cars. People are coming in now saying that, Look, we are having problems. The blind, in particular. We travel by sound. We can't hear. We are getting knocked down in the parking lots. Senior citizens are getting knocked down. 
   So we need to look at all these things to be able to bring about safety, but at the same time we have to be able to make certain that the fuel prices come down so people don't have to make a decision as to whether they buy gas or whether they buy food. I mean that is where we are. People who have been volunteering, providing care for seniors, driving them to the shopping mall and driving them to various places, are now saying, I can't do it any more because of the price of gasoline. That, to me, is a shame and a disgrace in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, that we are not paying more attention to our seniors, and of course, as a result, things are getting worse. 
   What I would like to do now is to yield some time to the gentlewoman from Texas, who has been very involved in these issues over the years. Of course, it's my pleasure to yield to her because she understands how important this issue is, the gentlewoman from Texas, Sheila Jackson-Lee.

   Of course, the gentleman from Georgia has been out at the forefront talking about this issue, and, of course, we are delighted he has joined us in this discussion tonight. We are happy to have Hank Johnson from the great State of Georgia, who is a leader on this 
   issue as well. Thank you for joining us. I yield to you.

   We look at the fact that there has been a 5-year trend of record oil profits under this administration. In 2007, the big five oil companies raked in a profit of $127 billion. That's ``B'' as in ``boy.'' It is simply unacceptable that consumers are bearing these costs while corporations continue to profit. 
   Now, the gentlewoman from California, to whom I'm getting ready to yield, has been at the forefront. She has been saying this now for a number of years. Of course, I would say to you that I wish that the country had listened to her because I'm certain, if they had listened to her, we would not have the mess that we have now.

There is no single solution to the problem. It is going to require less dependence on foreign oil. We must recognize that. We must promote market-based programs that recognize and reward clean energy technology. We need to do that. And we must launch a cleaner, smarter energy future for America that lowers costs for consumers. 
   We must look at ethanol and consider wind and look at all of these different things in order to make certain that the problem is solved.

   Mr. TOWNS. It affects a lot of things. First of all, when you look at young people and you talk about the gas prices and what it costs for them to go to work, it prevents them from purchasing a home. They can't afford to buy a home and pay all of these high prices for gas. And of course the fact that some buses are not running, which as you indicated means children are going to have to walk to school because of the fact that these buses are saying we are not making a profit because of the gas prices. 
   So when you look at the facts, they do not have affordable housing, and the fact that they can't afford to buy a home because of the gas prices, and of course we need to look at tax incentives and things that will bring about this discussion that we need to have because this is a serious problem. And to ignore it, it is not going to go away. It is going to get bigger and it is going to get worse. 
   We have to come together with a policy that is going to protect not only the seniors, the young, and the middle-aged, to protect America. This is something that we must do. We can no longer allow and have the rich continue to get richer and at the same time having people in a position to have to make a decision whether they are going to buy gasoline or whether they are going to buy food. That is wrong, and we should not stand for it. 
   I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee).

So in this regard, the rise in fuel costs is felt not only at the pump but at the grocery store as well because people are paying more for our gas.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, it is becoming clear day by day that the President's troop escalation plan is not in the best interest of this Nation. 
   First, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the President's troop escalation plan would take substantially more troops and more money than the President has suggested. 
   The President says 21,500 troops are needed; the CBO says 48,000 troops are necessary to conduct the mission. The President says it will cost about $5.6 billion, but CBO says that the number could be four times higher than that. 
   Second, the administration's intelligence agencies concluded last week that violence would continue in Iraq for at least another 18 months, but the President says his plan will calm the violence in 6 months. 
   And, third, Pentagon officials admitted last week that they do not have enough armored vehicles, armored kits and other equipment needed to protect these additional troops. 
   Mr. Speaker, after hearing these three different facts, how can anyone believe the President's troop escalation plan is in the best interests of this country?

   Mr. TOWNS. Yesterday, I introduced legislation with LEE TERRY from Nebraska to provide for the reauthorization of the Poison Control Center. Since being codified into law in 2000, the Poison Control Centers must undergo reauthorization every 3 years. These centers provide immediate value to the public, providing free medical facilities that are staffed by toxicologists, nurses, and other professionals. 
   Each year, poisoning results in 285,000 hospitalizations, 1,200 days of acute hospital care, and 1,300 fatalities. H.R. 5669 will reauthorize these critical Poison Control Centers to keep our national public health infrastructure in tact. I would like to thank Congressman Terry for this support. 
   The 24-hour emergency and information hotline services that are provided for this legislation are given by the National Poison Center Toll-Free Telephone number. By providing direct patient care services to residential callers, health care professionals and institutions, Poison Control Centers save lives and help avoid costly hospitalizations. Let us keep that in mind as we move forward and reauthorize the Poison Control Centers.

   Mr. TOWNS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 6406 will elevate the Inspector General of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to a Presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed position. This bill strengthens the integrity of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission by giving the Inspector General more authority and independence to investigate CFTC's regulation of commodity futures and option markets. 
   H.R. 6406 builds upon legislation recently passed by the House to give the CFTC more authority to investigate and regulate speculations in all and future markets. In light of the current financial crisis, this bill is an important step in boosting the independence, accountability, and credibility of a key financial regulator. 
   Under current law, the Inspector General is hired by the chairman of the CFTC. This process may prevent the IG from conducting a thorough investigation into CFTC's programs and operations. This bill will separate the IG's oversight function from day-to-day management by the chairman and commissioners and reassure market users and the public that they are being protected from fraud, manipulation, and abusive practices related to the sale of commodity and financial futures. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill is a small but important step towards improving public trust in the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. I fully support its passage and urge my colleagues to do the same.

   Mr. TOWNS. Madam Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I stand with my colleagues from the State of Georgia in support of H.R. 6847, which designates a postal facility in Ellijay, Georgia, in honor of First Lieutenant Noah Harris. 
   H.R. 6847 enjoys the support of the entire House congressional delegation  from Georgia and was introduced by my colleague, Representative Nathan Deal of Georgia, on September 9, 2008. 
   H.R. 6847 calls for honoring First Lieutenant Harris and his service for our country by designating the post office in his hometown of Ellijay, Georgia, as the ``Noah Harris Post Office.'' 
   First Lieutenant Noah Harris was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment, 3rd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division out of Fort Benning, Georgia, when he died on June 18, 2005 in Iraq of injuries sustained on June 17 when he was on mounted patrol and his Humvee was attacked by enemy forces using rocket-propelled grenades. Also killed was First Lieutenant Harris' friend and comrade, Corporal William A. Long. 
   Madam Speaker, in honor of First Lieutenant Noah Harris, his sacrifice and service to this Nation, I urge my colleagues to join in support in the passage of H.R. 6847. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. TOWNS. Madam Speaker, let me join my colleague in saying that it is  also important that we recognize people that do outstanding things. And, of course, even at a young age, he was able to accomplish quite a bit. To name a post office in his honor I think is a great thing to do. I want to commend Congressman Deal and the entire Georgia delegation for taking the time to name a post office in honor of this young lieutenant. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
