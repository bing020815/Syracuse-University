<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, on Sunday night a football player, a young man named Taylor Bradford on the University of Memphis football team, was murdered on our campus. The football team, the City of Memphis, and the  university mourn the passing of this fine young man. 
   We play a game tonight on ESPN2 against Marshall, and there will be a moment of silence, a moment of silence for that young man's memory. 
   But while it is a national news event because he was a football player, he is an example of people who have senselessly been killed in this country, and there are crime problems everywhere. That is why we need to pass the COPS bill that this House has passed and the Senate should pass to provide community policing and aid for local governments to hire more policemen, to have feet on the streets to protect our citizenry. 
   While there are horror stories in Baghdad, there are horror stories in America; and we need to protect our own. 
   I will remember Taylor Bradford, and I will remember all victims of senseless crime tonight.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, the United States Postal Service, and I use that term because that's their formal name, has announced that they're going to stop using, having vending machines at the post office. That means that Americans will not be able to go to the post office when they need to get a stamp this holiday season, tax time or whatever, and realize they need stamps and be able to go to the postal service to buy a stamp. It seems the U.S. Postal Service is taking service out of their name. 
   Older people can't just very easily decide to learn how to use the Internet or have an Internet and poor people don't either. The postal service says people can buy stamps online. They can call an 800 number. They can buy them by mail. But if you need something for an immediate postage, if you don't have the Internet, if you're old, and it's difficult to stand in line because you're handicapped or disabled, this is a great disservice to America. 
   They say the machines aren't working. Well, Federal Express wouldn't do something like this. They'd improve the machines or find a new machine. And if the machines didn't work at Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola would buy new machines. 
   The United States Postal Service should be for service and for the customer and maintain the vending machines. I'm preparing legislation, and I'll be sending a Dear Colleague out, Mr. Speaker, and hope all will join us in putting service back in the USPS.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, as Democrats take control of Congress this week, the American people are going to see some stark differences in how we run this institution compared to the way it has been run for the last 6 years. 
   First, the House is actually going to be in session 5 days a week most weeks. Last year, the Republican Congress was known as the do-nothing Congress because it met fewer days than any Congress in 6 decades. 
   Not only is this House going to be in session more often, it is actually going to do its job while we are here. For years, Republican Congresses refused to conduct proper oversight of the Bush administration, instead choosing to rubber-stamp its policies. 
   Democrats take oversight responsibility seriously, and are prepared to hold this administration accountable for its successes and its failures. In hearings, we're going to ask administration officials some tough questions so that we can make government work again for all Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, at a time when our Nation is at war and with so many domestic and international issues that must be addressed, the American people rightly want us here doing our job. The new Democratic Congress will not disappoint. 
   On a personal note, as one of the new freshmen elected here, America, you have a great freshman class, a great deal of talent, and I think you can feel proud of your new Speaker, Madam PELOSI.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, Saturday night Memphis, Tennessee, will celebrate the 50th anniversary of ALSAC, which is the fund-raising arm of St. Jude Hospital, an institution of which I am extremely proud. 
   St. Jude has used science to bring cures to cancer and to fight cancer for children. It is a leading institution in our country. President Bush has a stem cell bill before him that this House and the Senate have passed. It needs his signature to become law. 
   I plead to the President to allow that bill to become law, as Nancy Reagan has pleaded to the President when she saw her husband suffering from Alzheimer's; as Christopher Reeve pleaded when he had spinal cord injuries and some hope for his future, but didn't see it and died; as people with Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis and cancer hope. 
   Today I speak to you as a victim of polio. I wish we had stem cell research 50 years ago so we could regrow the muscle in my leg, and I would be whole, and I could play on the baseball team that the Congress has going to play next month. But I can't do it. 
   We didn't have that research. We didn't have stem cells. We have it today. We need to invest it for the people of the 20th century and to cure illness. Please, Mr. President, sign the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, it came up in the point of order about a question of an earmark, and it was raised by the Republican side that that earmark was in my district. And they questioned something that maybe I should have done. 
   The fact is that part of the bill is in my district. It's The Med, a public hospital that renders charity care to people in Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, and the boothill of Missouri; a hospital almost out of business because of how much charity care that it renders to the folks in those States. 
   I have no interest in that hospital but that as a congressman who supports that hospital. No personal interest whatsoever. I have great political interest in it because it serves my constituents, the people of Mississippi, and Arkansas. It is questionable whether that is an earmark or not. It was put in with the help of people across the aisle, and I appreciate my Republican colleagues from the State of Tennessee who helped get this in the bill because they see the need to help folks from Mississippi and Arkansas get health care that is provided at The Med and is not reimbursed to The Med. They lost $20 million in funding last year, the citizens of Shelby County who provided that funding at The Med for people in Mississippi and Arkansas, and that funding should continue. 
   Patients don't stop at State lines and neither should funding. And all this provision does is allow States to request Medicaid reimbursement for their citizens being treated at The Med in Memphis, Tennessee, the ``City of Good Abode.'' I am proud to be a Congressman from Tennessee, and I am proud to represent The Med and take umbrage at any suggestion that I violated any rules in seeing that I worked with my colleagues from Tennessee on the Republican and Democrat side to see that this inequity was corrected.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, this morning's Memphis ComercialAppeal had distressing news for our city. Delta Airlines had canceled part of its contract with Pinnacle Airlines, an airline that had 1,000 jobs in our community. The stock price fell 25 percent, and the newspaper reported that stockholders are concerned about the continued existence of the business. 
   If the merger takes place and Delta and Northwest merge, it is entirely possible that Delta will cancel the remaining portion of Pinnacle's business with Northwest Airlink, where they serve many customers through Northwest Airlines. That would be devastating to the Memphis economy and possibly cost us thousands of jobs. 
   I am very concerned, and plan to call Delta Airlines to find out why this contract was cancelled, what possibly could happen, how this merger would affect those 1,000 people, and if possibly re-regulation of the airlines is in order to make sure that abrupt changes in contracts that might cause irreparable harm and immediate damage can't take place if they threaten an industry and an employer in my district such as Pinnacle Airlines. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am concerned about the future of this large business in my community, and plan to look into it for the benefit of the employers and my overall business community.

We need to see that the COPS bill becomes law and we have an opportunity to help fund the policemen on our streets in our urban centers, and all over this country.

   It was a difficult decision for me not to be here for I haven't missed a day in my 2 years that I've been in the Congress, but a very dear friend of mine, Thomas Boggs, passed away, and I was asked to be a pallbearer at his funeral, which I was honored to do. 
   Thomas Boggs was one of the finest people that I've had the pleasure of knowing, nearly 35 years. He was a leading citizen in Memphis, Tennessee, giving much to the community and charitable works to people, regardless of income, status or race. No matter where they came from, Thomas reached out to try to be good to them. 
   He was very helpful with the Memphis Food Bank, with the Memphis Zoo, with raising money for the church health center that gives health care to people in need. 
   And his death was met with a lot of notice, notice that's not normally reserved for an individual: above-the-fold first page of the Memphis Commercial Appeal, a lead editorial, and a cartoon. 
   He was a wonderful human being. He has a great family. He was a good father, and he had many great friends. Even though we're Congresspeople, we need to remember we're citizens and humans and remember our friends on their last day.

Congress is part of a system of government that involves the executive and a two-part legislature that includes the Senate and the House. Our system of government is the best ever known to man, and it's working; although slowly, it's working. 
   The country has told the Congress and the President what the American people want, and that is to bring our troops home from Iraq, or to redeploy them to fight al Qaeda in Afghanistan and other places where there is terrorism. 
   We have increased the minimum wage. We have put more money into Pell Grants. We have reduced the cost of college loans. We are going to try to pass a bill, which I think we will today, on stem cell research to give people with catastrophic illnesses hope for the future. 
   This Congress is doing things to make America better. We are doing it in a responsible way with a balanced budget. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a Member of this Congress, and I want this country to know that this Congress is working hard and doing its job to put America on the right course. We are draining the swamp to make this a more ethical place.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dropped over 10 percent, and all economic indicators indicate that we are in serious financial trouble. This Congress needs to respond on behalf of the American people. Unfortunately, in the past this Congress has responded by giving tax breaks to the wealthiest, and it has created the largest gap in income between the upper 1 percent and the other 99 percent, probably in the history of this country. 
   We need to work in a bipartisan fashion. We need to work together. The previous speaker was correct: We need to give money back to taxpayers. But they need to be the working taxpayers, who are suffering the most, the people who are now unemployed, not able to pay taxes because they have lost their jobs, or people who need help with food stamps, and people who will immediately put that money into the economy, not the wealthiest who have savings in the hundreds and thousands and millions of dollars and can live on through this and survive it and won't put that money back into the economy. 
   The tax breaks of the past were mistakes. The spending needs to be for people who are suffering. They are the people who know the hard economic times we have. I read my e-mails on a daily basis and there are many people out there suffering who need economic help now. We need to act in a bipartisan fashion, but remember those who suffer the most.

   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, there are many issues that face America that are of great importance, from the Iraq War to global warming. These global issues must be dealt with, but we have lacked the leadership in this administration to make the world proud of America and see us as a leader on such issues. 
   On Wednesday, this House will vote on an embryonic stem cell research bill sent from the Senate which the President has threatened to veto. I don't think there is a more important bill that this House could pass and send to the President and for the President to sign than embryonic stem cell research. 
   Mr. Speaker, if you or anybody in your family has Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, spinal cord injury, cancer, stroke, burns, heart disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, you could have relief and possibly a cure for that illness because of embryonic stem cell research. America could reestablish itself as a country that has the best scientific research and provides the world with hope for cures for these catastrophic illnesses. 
   Last night in the Republican debate, one of the candidates said we need to find a cure for cancer. He's right, and the way to do it is through embryonic stem cell research. I urge this House to pass the bill, and I urge the President to have the courage to do the right thing and be pro-life and extend life for people on this planet.

   Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, as many as 2.8 million Americans could lose their homes in the next 5 years due to the subprime mortgage crisis, yet the Bush administration refuses to properly address the crisis. 
   Last month the administration was willing to bail out Bear Stearns, but when they announced their plans to overhaul the regulation of financial institutions, they failed to properly address any of the needs of families who face the loss of their homes in the coming months. 
   The housing crisis demands bold action, and this House has already responded by passing legislation that would expand affordable mortgage loans opportunities to families at risk of foreclosure. 
   We've also passed bills that would raise Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loan limits to increase liquidity in the mortgage market and that would increase the supply of affordable housing. And now we have a plan that would help 1.5 million homeowners afford foreclosure. 
   Madam Speaker, we hope the administration will join us in supporting these important bills that will provide necessary relief to those families feeling the impact of the housing crisis.

   Four years ago, when the President announced ``Mission Accomplished,'' he was right if he was talking about Saddam Hussein's government being toppled; but otherwise, he was wrong and he has been channeling Warren Zevon who said, ``I'm caught between a rock and a hard place. Send lawyers, guns, and money. The Shiites have hit the fan.''

He lived in Bethesda, Maryland, a 210-pound strapping man that you would want on your side in a fight, and I have had on my side in a fight, and this country had on its side in a fight in the Vietnam War. 
   When he had pancreatic cancer, he smoked marijuana. And his 88-year-old Irish Catholic mother said to me, ``Thank God for the marijuana. It is the only thing that makes Oral smile or eat.'' 
   I watched that man go down to 115 pounds and die. And Mrs. Mitchell was correct. As he was dying of pancreatic cancer, if he was in a State that made it legal, States' rights say they should have some authority, and Brandeis said States are the laboratories of democracy. And as laboratories of democracy, we ought to experiment and find out if it works and if it is good for people who are dying, if it gives them some relief. If it is glaucoma, if it is cancer, whatever the illness, they should have that relief. 
   I would ask that we not have the Federal Government and DEA infringe on the laws of the States that have had changes in their laws, oftentimes through referenda of their people, and we allow those States to be the laboratories of democracy and not interfere with people who are dying, people who might have given their lives for this country, but who are dying and get some respite and some relief.

   Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, the City of Memphis, Tennessee, has lost one of its finest citizens, Kenneth Whalum, Sr. 
   Kenneth Whalum, Sr., passed away last night. He was a pastor, he was a two-time city councilman, he was a father, he was a family man, he was a leader in our community. 
   For 30 years, he was the pastor of the Olivet Baptist Church and very highly respected in the community and among the clergy. For 8 years, he was a city councilman, one time as a district councilman in a community known as Orange Mound. Then when he saw a higher calling and the need to address a higher subject, he ran against an incumbent city councilman, at the time  unheard of, and was elected at large, one of the first African Americans elected at large to the Memphis City Council. 
   He was also a postal service employee and had a career there and rose through the ranks to director of personnel. For that reason, this House, and this week with the President's action, the post office at Third Street in Memphis, Tennessee, will be named the Kenneth T. Whalum, Sr., Postal Building. That is a tribute to his work and all postal employees. 
   He had a family of which the City of Memphis is proud. His son Kenneth, Jr., is a pastor and a member of the school board. His son Kirk Whalum is a world-renowned saxophonist, and his other son Kevin is a musician with a contract and a poet. 
   There have been many great families in the City of Memphis to get involved in politics, but none greater than the Whalums. The hair of the hypocrite never was upon this family, and the idea of discrimination and bigotry or intolerance never disgraced them either. He was a leader in biracial politics and activities in the City of Memphis. He was a leader in being bipartisan as well. 
   There have been few people like Kenneth Whalum, Sr., in the City of Memphis. There will be few to come. I share his loss greatly. He was a supporter of mine who, although he had a stroke and had difficulty walking, came down and did a political ad for me when he could hardly get up the stairs, and on television it was like an angel speaking. When John Conyers came to Memphis in February, he made it up a whole flight of stairs to see John Conyers, and a happier man I have not seen. He knew the post office was being named for him before he passed. I am happy he knew that and I am happy I knew him. We have lost a great leader.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, today is the fourth anniversary of our invasion of Iraq. We still don't necessarily know why we went to war in Iraq; I certainly don't. This is my first year in Congress, and we have a very serious and important matter coming up this week which we have to vote on. I haven't decided exactly how I am going to vote. I know I want us out of Iraq. I want our troops to be safe, but be protected, and I want our veterans to be looked after. 
   There is a proposal to come up to suggest we should have a definite date, September 1 of 2008, to have our troops out of Iraq, and to have certain benchmarks which the Iraqi Government has to meet, and have our President certify they have met them at different times in the summer and next fall. 
   There are certain restrictions on the troops that says that the military can't send folks in if they haven't had a year off, they are not properly trained and don't have proper equipment, which is kind of hard for me to fathom, that after 4 years of war, we are only now getting around to saying our troops should have proper equipment, proper training and proper rest. It's hard for me to imagine what's gone on the last 4 years, what type of oversight or undersight has taken place in this Congress, and what type of concern that the administration has had for our troops, sending them into Iraq without proper training and without proper equipment. 
   It borders on malfeasance, and it makes me wonder, in voting for $100 billion in the supplemental budget, if it's not negligence, and Mr. Speaker knows as a lawyer it may be beyond that. It may be gross negligence of this administration, which has shown it doesn't know how to handle money, particularly in sending it to Iraq, where $10 billion is totally missing, other monies have just disappeared, to give them $100 billion and to give them the care and custody of American men and women, great patriots who have volunteered for military duty. 
   We have had 3,200 Americans die in Iraq, over 3,200 now, and casualties in the area of 20,000. For every day we stay there longer, there will be more and more casualties and more and more deaths. 
   I understand the proposal being put forth is an advancement, and it's more than the Senate will do, and it's more  than the administration will permit, because they have said they will veto anything with a date, anything with conditions, anything that is reasonable, that reflects what the American people want to have, which is the same policy in Iraq to get our troops home and to find a way to end America's nightmare, which has, indeed, been a nightmare. 
   We were told the mission was accomplished. I don't know what has been accomplished. I have read newspapers today, and everybody, people in Iraq, have no medical care, they have very little electricity, they are living in squalor, and they say life was better with Saddam Hussein than it is now. We have not improved the lives of the Iraqi people. We have pretty much destroyed their country, and we claim we did it for freedom. 
   But one of the conditions upon which we will measure the benchmarks is if they give us their oil and give it to some of our multinational companies, which makes you wonder if they hate us because of our love for freedom, or if they hate us because we want to take their oil. Maybe that is what it was all about was oil, blood for oil. 
   It's hard for me not to support a progressive measure, which I know Speaker Pelosi and I know my party's leadership is going to advance, to try to bring some end to this nightmare. But at the same time it's difficult for me to give another dollar and another life to the care and custody of this administration. I do think it's gross negligence probably to do so when you look at what they have done over the last 4 years. 
   I read about death this weekend in Iraq, soldiers who died who were 20 years old, 19 years old, 21 years old, and I thought about how young they were. They are children basically, children with guns, going over to Iraq, and they are dying because they fall, they have an IED blow them up. It's not mano a mano, it is not being shot by Iraqis. It's IEDs. Every day we stay, there will be more and more American men and women being blown up, being sent to inadequate facilities such as Walter Reed because we haven't gotten out. 
   I don't know that the situation there will get any better. The President today called a press conference and spoke and said we need to keep going forward; we won't know in weeks, we won't know in months, we won't know until longer if this surge or escalation will work. 
   It's not going to work. You learn from history. If you don't learn from history, you are a fool. The fact is you look at the past, you can look at the Sunnis and the Shi'a and the situation over there and the insurgents, and our being there has not made a difference. It just means that American men and women have died, and the dollars that should have been spent in cities in America to help children with education and health care hasn't been spent. 
   I am conflicted. I hope the people in my district will let me know what they think. Should we spend another dollar and sacrifice another life, or should we get out as soon as possible?

   Mr. COHEN. Thank you. I appreciate the gentleman from Colorado posing the question and the gentleman from New Hampshire yielding time. 
   Mr. Speaker, indeed the people of the Ninth District in Tennessee have felt the differences in this Congress. It has been a great honor to be here as a representative of the Ninth District of Tennessee. Bob Dylan said, ``Senators, Congressmen, please heed the call.'' I think this class has heeded the call. The call is, people felt that Congress was not a place that the American people intended it to be and our Founding Fathers intended it to be. It had fallen to one of the lowest levels of appreciation or lack of appreciation of any body or group in this country. It had a 34 percent, 33 percent approval rate. That is going to go up. The reason is, I think, because this Congress is going to look to the future and the Democratic Party looks to the future. 
   Most of y'all probably have heard the same stories I have heard. Politics is kind of like cars. If you want to go forward, you put your car in D like Democrat, in drive. And if you want to go in reverse, you put it in R like Republican, you go in reverse. We are in D and the Democrats are going forward and it is about the future. Most of this legislation has been about the future. It has been about the future of people never having to work for $5.15 an hour. 
   People have come up in this well, Mr. Speaker, and they have talked about watch out for your pocketbook or watch out for your wallet. Folks making $5.15 an hour can't hardly afford a wallet. So when they are talking about look out for your wallet, they are not thinking about the people that are performing the jobs that are necessary to keep this country moving forward that most of us don't want to participate in. Those people will be getting $7.25 in a couple of years and they will have something to put in their pocketbook. 
   Regarding stem cell research, the gentleman from Colorado mentioned his child. My father had Alzheimer's. Lots of people have family members or friends who have had illnesses that might be cured. That is the future. There will be cures or there will be treatments for diseases because of the legislation that was taken and passed during this 100 hours by this House, and we hope the Senate will concur. 
   If you look at stem cell research, that is the future. The minimum wage, that is the future. Certainly on oil and fuels and new ideas on energy and getting us independent of Middle Eastern oil, that is defense. That is the future. So if you want to go forward, you put your car in D, you support Democrats and go forward. I am happy to be a part of this Democratic class. It has been an exciting experience. It has been a great 100 hours. We have got a great Speaker, historic, the first woman Speaker. Next week when the President delivers his State of the Union address, there will be a woman behind him. Behind every successful man, there is a woman, and even behind this President there is going to be a woman, and there is going to be a great woman, Speaker Pelosi.

<DOCNO>Mr. COHEN. (IRAQ WAR IS COSTING US MILLIONS AT HOME -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, every day that we spend money in Iraq means missed opportunities to invest in priorities here at home. While the Bush administration spends $339 million a day in Iraq, we are diverting money from our Nation's needs. 
   With that $339 million that we spend today, we could instead ensure that 2.6 million Americans have access to medical and dental care at community health centers. We can provide 955,000 families with help for their energy bills, and we could hire 50,000 more cops to protect our citizens on our streets. 
   With the funds we are spending in Iraq today we could also provide 937,000 grants for research into diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's and diabetes, provide 317,000 kids with vaccinations and could send 18,000 more students to school. 
   The millions we are pumping into Iraq today is desperately needed here at home as this country stares recession in the face. Yet President Bush continues to recommend nothing but the status quo in Iraq. 
   Put America first.

<DOCNO>Mr. COHEN. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, you like I am a freshman in this body and today we will begin the debate on one of the most important topics that this Congress has debated and that is America's involvement in the Middle East and Iraq and eventually in Afghanistan in dealing with the whole terrorist situation. 
   I have been in this House, Mr. Speaker, and listened to the Republicans and listened to the Democrats and the Democrats, of which I am a member, have talked about protecting the troops and opposing the President's surge, which is really an escalation, and the Republicans have come in here today and said that we need to in essence stay the course, we need to put in more troops and we're doing wrong by opposing the President's escalation or surge. 
   Mr. Speaker, from what I have heard from the American people, the American people realize this war has been a failure, that American men and women are dying, and dying for what purpose? For the purpose theoretically of trying to bring democracy to Iraq where the people in Iraq don't even want us to be there, where the Iraqi government is almost nonexistent, where calling what is going on in Iraq a civil war is almost a misnomer, for a civil war connotes a nation and there really is not a nation in Iraq. The ministries are not working. The government is not working. Many of the people in Iraq of the highest caliber have left Iraq and gotten out of what is a zone where there have been tens of thousands of Iraqis die. What the people across the aisle talk about in bringing democracy to these people, in bringing democracy to these people we have killed tens of thousands of Iraqis, we have destroyed their nation, and we have put casualties among tens of thousands of Iraqis. What a price to pay to bring democracy to a country, to destroy the country. 
   Mr. Skelton, who will bring forth the Democratic response, has said that this, quote-unquote, surge is 100,000 troops too few and 3 years too late. I don't have anybody in this House I respect more on this position than the head of the Armed Forces Committee, Mr. Skelton from Missouri. 
   The fact is this war was started under false pretenses and much of that information has come out lately. Many of the people who voted to give the President the power to go into Iraq did so under facts, or appearance of facts that were given the American people and this Congress that were false. I remember being at home and watching on television when the President addressed this Congress and talked about Osama bin Laden and talked about what he said were connections between Iraq and 9/11 and it made everybody feel like if you were a red-blooded American, you wanted to do something about Iraq because they had destroyed the Twin Towers, they had killed 2,000 people, Americans and others, and put a devastation in this world that we hadn't seen except in movies. 
   Well, that information given us was false. There wasn't a connection between Iraq and 9/11. We went to war for reasons that are still not quite clear and known, and this United States of America went to war against a country that was not at war with us and we were an aggressor nation. This is something we shouldn't have done. It is not about cut and run, as the people on the Republican side say, but it is, as President Clinton says often, it is about stop and think. And when you stop and think, do you support the troops by continuing to send them in harm's way? 
   Mr. Speaker, I am a prizefight fan and one of my favorite fighters was Floyd Patterson. At one time Floyd Patterson fought Muhammad Ali and Muhammad Ali was just whooping him and whooping him and whooping him. And his trainers kept putting him back in the ring and Floyd kept going in there and trying to fight. But Floyd Patterson didn't belong in the ring with Muhammad Ali. He could beat a lot of fighters, but he couldn't beat Muhammad Ali. He was in the wrong fight at the wrong time and he just got beat and beat and beat. And what a good trainer would do is throw in the towel, and say, We quit. It's a technical knockout. We'll fight another day. We'll figure out a new way to fight Muhammad Ali maybe or maybe that's just somebody we can't fight. It just wasn't our fight. 
   To support our troops isn't to continue to send more troops into Iraq and have more American men and women die and more American men and women come back as casualties and be in veterans hospitals but is to get them out of a war they can't win and out of a situation where all they are is fodder for a civil war, where Iraqis are killing Iraqis and Iraqis are killing Americans and whether the Americans are there or not, the Iraqis are going to have their civil war and there is going to be bloodshed. The only issue left, Mr. Speaker, is how much American blood will be spilled on this foreign soil on a foreign policy folly that is somewhat  akin to Napoleon's entries into Russia, to Hitler's entries into Russia and in the Danish countries' efforts to go into Russia. There are certain places you can't go and you can't win, and after 4 1/2 years this country should know it. To put more troops there, to waste more blood, and to give up more lives is simply wrong. To support our troops is to bring them home. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for this time. I hope that not more American men and women will lose their blood or lose their limbs in what is an impossible war. We need to bring America home, bring our resources home, and bring our troops home.

   Mr. COHEN. I had the distinct honor of presiding during the last 2 1/2 hours, and I heard some verbiage that was thrown out to the freshmen about how we were not having participation in this process. And the gentleman who asked that question said nobody had answered his response. There is a rule that the Speaker cannot respond, and as a freshman it was difficult, but I restrained myself and now have an opportunity to respond. 
   The freshmen are happy with the procedures that are going on, and the processes, and are glad to be part of this Democratic majority. 
   We are funding more money in the budget for Pell Grants, which is an issue that I have great concern with. I know that Mr. Altmire also does, and so does Dr. Kagen. And we are also funding money for the COPS program and for Head Start. There are wonderful things for veterans and health care in the budget. The freshmen had input and feel comfortable with it.

<DOCNO>Mr. COHEN. (PRESIDENT'S HEALTH CARE PROPOSAL IS A BAD PLAN -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, in the President's State of the Union address last week, he made proposals for what is essentially a tax increase on more than 30 million Americans. That's right, if Congress were to pass the President's health care plan, more than 30 million Americans, many of whom are middle-class workers who have fought hard to negotiate comprehensive health care plans with their employers, would be taxed by the Federal Government. Good health insurance, for those lucky enough to have it, would be jeopardized as many Americans would be pushed into the individual insurance market where insurers can refuse coverage to workers based on their health. 
   That brings me to the least of these, those without insurance, a number which will grow under the President's plan. The Regional Medical Center at Memphis, the Med, a hospital that provides a disproportionate amount of service to the poor, could lose as much as $30 million a year. Tennessee could see Federal revenue to support hospitals, nursing homes and other health providers by as much as $300 million, and that would be an increase of taxes at the local level. 
   The Med plays a critical role in delivering health care to the poor. Losing the specialty services of the Med would leave serious gaps in our health care system that serves the entire region around Memphis, including Mississippi and Arkansas.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, this month the Democratic Congress will approve a final budget plan that, unlike the President's budget, will actually be balanced over the next 5 years, and we do it without raising taxes. Now the President likes to claim that his budget proposal achieves balance by 2012 and does not increase taxes, but that's simply not true. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the President's budget will still be running a $9 billion deficit 5 years from now. 
   The President's broken promises don't stop there. His budget would also cost middle-class families $247 billion in tax increases over the next 5 years under the alternative minimum tax, and $500 billion in taxes on employer-provided health insurance. 
   Fortunately, Democrats rejected the President's budget. Instead, we restore fiscal integrity to our Nation, protect middle-income families from tax increases and actually reach balance by the year 2012. The American people asked us to take this Nation in a new direction, and our budget answers their call. 
   And by the way, Mr. Speaker, give peace a chance.

   I thought of the children's health plan that would give six million more children around this country health care, and the fact that the President vetoed their opportunity to have health care. 
   I thought about No Child Left Behind to help them in education. But that bill has been $50 billion underfunded, and basically teaches teachers to teach a test and not to teach these children. 
   I thought about the war in Iraq and John McCain's thought that it's going to be a hundred-year war, and how many of them might have to go to Iraq and maybe lose their lives and continue to suck moneys out of our economy and hinder their future with a budget that is out of balance and that they'll have to pay for. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm concerned about the children at Hawkins Mill Elementary and all the other children and the future we leave them. 
   Mr. Speaker, November's the answer. We need to have a new Senate and a new President that think about the children and the future.

   Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I just returned on a codel from Baghdad, among other places, with four other Members, a bipartisan trip. I am proud to report that our troops are doing a marvelous job under the circumstances in which they have been placed. 
   To ride in a C-130 with American soldiers going into combat, seeing their faces and realizing that they were going into harm's way was very, very emotional; to ride in a Humvee with soldiers who faced an enemy that they didn't know who it was because friends and enemy look alike; and to be in the streets of Baghdad. 
   I was buoyed by the enthusiasm of our troops but know they are going to need help over the years with veterans benefits. We were in Landstuhl, Germany hospital today with a soldier who lost his leg on Friday. Continuing injuries will cause a continuing commitment from the American people and a continuing commitment to make sure that Iran does not exercise undue influence. 
   Prime Minister Maliki reasserted his desire to provide defense for his own country with help from America with equipment and not to have Iran interfere. I wasn't as extremely enthusiastic about what I saw in the country of Iraq, which has been ravaged, or their government, which needs much improvement.

   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, today is June 19. June 19 is an important day in history. To African Americans, and to all Americans it should be, but to African Americans in particular, it is known as Juneteenth. 
   Juneteenth is the first day I got involved in politics and learned about it. I didn't know much about it. I thought, why is Juneteenth a holiday to African Americans, and I learned. It's a holiday because that's the day in 1865 that the slaves in east Texas learned that they were free. 
   The news of the Emancipation Proclamation did not get to Texas for 2 years, and that was the day that all slaves in America were free. The idea of our country having slavery as an institution was wrong. It was a crime against humanity. 
   There is nothing more valuable to any of us than freedom, the opportunity to go where we want, to do what we want, and to associate with whom we want. That's what makes America great. Unfortunately, we had that institution, and later we had Jim Crow for 100 years. 
   That's why I have introduced H. Res. 194 to apologize for slavery and Jim Crow, a crime against humanity that this government and this House permitted and allowed to occur. We must apologize for our errors.

   This is a very difficult vote, as it was on Monday, because there is medicine that's bitter that you don't want to take but that you need. Sir Edmund Burke, a great member of parliament in Britain in the 1700s, said a legislator has a duty to his constituents to listen to them, but also to vote in what he believes from what he learns is their best interest. A good legislator has to make that decision.

   This time, we are going to do what the American economy needs. It's difficult but correct.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. I thank the gentlelady from Florida for making this time available. 
   My father was a physician. After being a pediatrician for many years, he chose to change his specialty and go into psychiatry, and then child adolescent psychiatry. As a result of that, I was exposed to mental health issues and mental health treatment and the need for mental health professionals throughout this country. 
   There has been a misconception in this country about people needing mental health treatment and their being adequately covered by insurance. In the same way that a physical illness affects people, mental illnesses do. And mental health treatment has been woefully undercovered and underserved, people who suffer from that in our country. 
   I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill and to join with the gentleman from Minnesota and the gentleman from Rhode Island who brought the bill and other cosponsors, because I think it shows that this Congress understands that mental health treatment needs to be covered, that diseases of the mind are similar to diseases of the body, the effect they can have on a person's overall well-being, but that their mental health and their physical health are also intertwined, and if mental health is not treated, physical health is affected. 
   We need to be concerned about all of our fellow citizens, our brothers and sisters who might suffer from any illness. And it's time that we came out from the cloak of an ancient time when we looked upon mental health treatment as something to be shunned, to be embarrassed about if it was somebody  in our families, our friends, or even ourselves. And so I wholeheartedly endorse this bill and feel that the passage of this bill will be a great day for Americans and for science.

   And he was so much like so many people in America in that he was passionate about politics, passionate about government, passionate about sports, and passionate about being an American. He loved his Buffalo Bills, Buffalo Sabers, he loved baseball and he loved horse racing. He loved politics, and he had two great mentors in Senator Patrick Moynihan and in Governor Mario Cuomo, two of the great people in political life to ever have the opportunity to work for. 
   And he was a success story, climbing from the ranks of a government official in the media and perfecting that trade and going to the heights of his profession. He was diligent in doing his research and in quizzing everybody, I think, in an even-handed manner that you really didn't know exactly where Tim Russert was coming from. I had the pleasure of meeting him at a Vanity Fair dinner, which I was invited to last year, and we were at a small table. At the time, I didn't know his wife worked for Vanity Fair. I thought Tim Russert was just there because he was Tim Russert, and that was a good enough reason for him to be there. And he was nice as he could be, just a regular guy, and we had a delightful conversation. 
   He loved his father. And the book about his dad, Russ, has been well spoken about. But I think what's amazing is I have a very good friend in Memphis named Ted Donaldson. And Ted had written a letter to Tim Russert to be included in the book. And Ted's not a bashful guy at all, and Ted came up to Tim Russert at a function, I think it was in New York, and he said, ``Hi, I'm Ted Donaldson, I'm from Memphis and I wrote you about my dad.'' And he said, ``Yup, page 45.'' He knew exactly the page in the book that it was. He knew his book. He appreciated the people who remembered their fathers and wrote and shared with him. And that book will go on forever remembering the relationship of fathers and sons. I'm sure his son Luke has a great tribute, what he lived and what he remembers from his father and will have a great life. I mourn with him and I'm sorry that he lost his father.

   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, the Homeland Security Appropriations bill addresses not only the threat of terrorist activity, but funding for States and communities to confront the threat and real consequences of natural disasters and emergency situations. 
   Hurricane Katrina was one disaster. The response of the Federal Government to Katrina was another disaster. While the world watched, our citizens were left to fend for themselves. I live in a city that sits at the epicenter of the New Madrid fault zone. Historically, this area has been the site of some of the largest earthquakes in North America. Scientists believe we could be overdue for a large earthquake and through research and public awareness may be able to prevent terrible losses of life and property. 
   Also, Memphis is built on the banks of the Mississippi, and as every river town knows, we must be vigilant to ensure that the river remains our friend. And Tennessee is one of the States most frequently hit with tornadoes and destructive straight-line winds. 
   I am pleased to support the Homeland Security Appropriations bill because it provides for the needs of our citizens to ensure that their government will be vigilant in protecting them not only from terrorists, imagined and real, but by preparing for emergencies and being there in the aftermath of disasters. We don't need to just say, there's been a ``heckuva job'' done, but we need to make sure that the job is done. 
   Mr. Chairman, we were here until 2 o'clock this morning because of dilatory moves on the other side.

This is a bill we need to pass for America and make America proud of this United States Congress.

   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, it's been an interesting process these last, give or take, 24 hours. As a freshman legislator who spent 24 years in the Tennessee State senate, in those 24 years in the senate I saw the parties work together. Democrats and Republicans worked together for the betterment of our State. We had Republican governors. We had Democratic governors. We had Republican and Democratic legislators. 
   What America wants is for the parties to work together. On most of the bills we've had, they were brought by Democrats, and it's been called a Democratic Congress, but many of the bills that were passed by this Congress were done in a bipartisan way. 
   There were Republicans who voted for stem cell, not a majority, I believe, but Republicans voted for the stem cell research. There were some Republicans who even voted for the minimum wage. There were Republicans who thought prescription drug prices should come down. There were Republicans who even cared about college loans being brought down. There were bipartisan efforts to bring about progress. 
   There was much less bipartisanship in the effort to save lives in Iraq and end that wasteful and unfortunate policy we have in the Middle East, but--however, there was bipartisanship. 
   During this debate, one of the most serious requests debates we could have, the Homeland Security bill to protect us from natural disasters, to protect us from foreign enemies and terrorists, we have gotten into the most divisive partisan debate that I've seen in this Congress in the 5 months I've been here. 
   Much of the debate has not been about the Homeland Security bill, unfortunately, Mr. Chairman. It's been about attempts to attack our Speaker, the first woman ever elected Speaker of this House of Representatives, a great day in this country when the glass ceiling was broken, when a great lady was put in this position, the highest position a woman has ever been in in the legislative body in the history of the United States. To try to tear down the Speaker, trying to tear down the party and trying to bring up other issues, rather than talking about Homeland Security. 
   Yesterday, Congressman Arcuri spoke, a former prosecutor. He said, you know, in opening statements if a person talks about the facts, they've got a case. And if they talk about things other than the facts, they don't. And the opposition party has not talked about the facts. They've brought up everything but the facts of the Homeland Security bill. They really haven't shown where there are problems with this bill. 
   The previous speaker, Mr. Chairman, talked about, used all the buzz words, the buzz words of ``slush fund,'' ``pet projects,'' ``pork'' and others. 
   The truth of the matter is, Mr. Chairman, and he knows it as well as everybody else knows it, he's not against those things. He just wants his slush fund, his pet projects and his pork. And when people throw those terms out, because that's not what they are, they are Congress citing specific needs to be placed in the law to that represent their districts. But then what he does is disparage government. 
   I have spent my life in government, my entire life, and I've found it a great calling, and I think we should all try to make people think more and better about government and have young people see this as a high calling, Mr. Chairman. There are young people in our audience. They should see this as a place where they want to serve and see government as working, and I think some of them do. 
   But to use these terms in a disparaging way when what the party's trying to do is to say, we want our share, we want our earmarks, not pork, but our earmarks, is wrong. And it's wrong when you take the oath of office to uphold the Constitution. You should be upholding government and supporting government. 
   And it's unfortunate we've seen this. This has been a low point in the Congress since I've been here. 
   I am proud to be a part of this Congress. There are many Members on the other side of the aisle that I'm proud to serve with as well. There are some very, very fine people, and I'm sure the gentlemen who have spoken today are all fine people. 
   But we need to rise above some of this partisanship, try to pass this Homeland Security bill, protect our country, and inspire people to serve in government and realize that it's a process, and the process involves the Senate, and it involves the executive, it involves both sides of the aisle. And to try to tear down one side tears down government in general. We're all part of the process, and I wish we'd work together and pass this bill. 
   We were up till 2 o'clock this morning because of seven moves to rise and have the committee adjourn. All seven failed. They knew they were all going to fail. And it was a burden on the staff, it was a burden on the Congress, and probably a burden on people that wanted to watch something else on C-SPAN last night. 
   But with that, Mr. Chairman, I just encourage our colleagues to support this bill, to protect America and to have a debate that is germane to the issues concerning homeland security.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the recognition. It's a great honor to be a member of this class and a Member of this Congress. 
   I can testify, having spent really a lifetime in local and State government, about the talent level that exists in this class and, to be honest, this Congress. There are numerous people who are committed to issues and have a wealth of talent and knowledge, and they put that to work on a daily basis to try to come up with the best solutions for the American people for a new direction in this country. 
   The gentlemen I'm with are four of the leaders in this class and in this Congress. I really want to commend the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth) for bringing this article I issue to the fore. The op-ed written in the New York Times by Mr. Adam Cohen really brought forth all the points that Congressman Yarmuth thought about when he brought this campaign to our attention and the freshman class adopted it. 
   Article I does make it clear that Congress makes the laws and Congress is where the power starts. It's really supposed to be the strongest arm of government because it truly represents the people, and this House has 435 Members. Each Member in the history of this House, and there have been about 10,000 people who have served in this House over the history, have been elected. Nobody, if there's a vacancy, gets appointed. In this place, not like the United States Senate or your State legislature, there aren't any interim appointments. Every person is elected by the people at home and they're supposed to represent those people, and I think it happens here. 
   This House needs to assert its power, and one of the areas where it's been doing it, particularly in the Government Reform Committee which Mr. Waxman chairs, and looking into actions of this administration is also the Judiciary Committee, where I'm blessed to be a member with Chairman John Conyers. We've had the opportunity to look into the Justice Department, which Mr. Hodes brought up. The Justice Department we found has politicized that office to the extent that it's really embarrassing I think to us as members of the committee, Members of us particularly who are attorneys and know what the attorneys and judges are supposed to be in terms of being impartial in the way they mete out justice, and I think to the judiciary at large in this country. 
   The politicization of that office has been greater than I think at anytime in the history of this country. The cases that have been brought we have found have been based, oftentimes, on the politics of who the defendant is. 
   We had the discussion last week of the case in Mississippi where one gentleman was indicted and another gentleman was not investigated. The gentlemen did the same exact thing. They each guaranteed loans, which was legal in Mississippi, to a justice, a Justice Diaz of the Supreme Court. 
   One gentleman made contributions that guaranteed a contribution of $65,000. Another gentleman guaranteed contributions of $80,000. The gentleman who guaranteed the $65,000 was indicted and tried in a Federal court. The gentleman that made the $80,000 contribution wasn't indicted or even investigated. 
   They each loaned a home to Justice Diaz when he had family problems and needed a new place to stay. They were co-owners of the home, Mr. Scruggs and Mr. Minor. The one gentleman who was the man that made the $65,000 loan and was indicted was indicted for loaning his home to the Supreme Court justice. The other gentleman wasn't. 
   What were the differences in the gentlemen? Well, one man was one of the top ten contributors to John Edwards for President, a Democrat. One man supported Democrats and trial lawyer issues in Mississippi. He was indicted. He was convicted the second time, and he's spending now, started serving 11 years in jail and was fined $4.5 million, 15 times what was recommended. 
   The other gentleman, man named Dickie Scruggs, is also a trial lawyer. He wasn't even investigated. He did the same exact thing. He donated a half a million dollars to Republican activity, a quarter of a million dollars to the Bush-Cheney reelection effort, and he, for whatever reason, may have nothing to do with it, he happens to be the brother-in-law of one of our colleagues in the Senate, Trent Lott. 
   So if you look at that case, and it's hard for anybody to look at it and think that there wasn't politically selective prosecutions, which makes  Lady Justice have to turn her eyes and maybe shed tears at what's happened in Mississippi. That's happened in Alabama where a Governor was indicted and convicted of things that ordinarily wouldn't even be investigated. 
   We've seen U.S. attorneys, Republicans, appointed by President Bush fired because they didn't go after Democrats or they didn't go after voting actions that people in the Republican Party wanted pursued. 
   So oversight's real important in the Judiciary Committee. We've seen it. And the Justice Department, I mean, that's an area where Caesar's wife should be beyond reproach. Every area of government should be beyond reproach, but justice first. Justice is supposed to be blind, and justice has not been blind, and the work of Chairman Conyers and his staff and the members of that committee exposed much of that. 
   This Congress has done a lot of good. The idea that Mr. Yarmuth brought up from the President where he suggested we've been wasting time, that's ridiculous. The fact he's tried to veto bills or has vetoed bills and threatened vetoes shows we've been doing some things that are effective and good.     
   The minimum wage should have happened years ago. We finally got a minimum wage. The people at the bottom of the economic ladder needed that step up. We passed the minimum wage. 
   People that need a step up and to start college educations, they got Pell Grant increases, they got the cost of their loans reduced so they won't be saddled with high interest rates in the future on their loans. To help kids get a start and go to a college and to not, when they get out, have a tremendous debt to pay back is important. To be able to have Pell Grant money to give them a better start is important. These are two of the best initiatives that I think we have seen. 
   When I was a State Senator I worked on college scholarships, and I worked on minimum wage. I am happy to be in a Congress that have seen both of them effectuated and made a change. 
   We have looked at global warming, we have passed some bills that require renewable energies, and we have looked at bills that will help clean up our environment, which is definitely in jeopardy. And we have looked at the budget. We have put our future generations in debt, this administration and this Congress, by spending, spending, spending, not having a PAYGO bill. 
   The future of this country is in jeopardy because of the recklessness of the past Republican Congress and this President for spending too much money, sacrificing our goodwill overseas with a foreign policy that has been reckless after we had a President in Bill Clinton who had a balanced budget, a surplus, in fact, and the respect of the world for this country. We have lost the respect of the world, we have lost our budget surplus, and, finally, we have restored a modicum of fairness by giving an increase in the minimum wage, increases to kids going to college, help with health care and work on the environment. 
   I am very proud to be a Member of this Congress, this class and this Congress, and the differences you see are healthy and good. Rubber stamp shouldn't exist in government. There should be healthy debate. The conflict of ideas produces better ideas. That's why this Democratic Congress is so important to the future of this country.

   I think when I first addressed this group and, Mr. Speaker, I mentioned how proud I was to be a Member of this body and this class, and I think the people who have listened to this discussion realize why I'm so proud to be a member of the class. The talent is here, as some people have State legislative experience, some come straight from the private sector, and each brings a different perspective but a concern for the people and a concern for change and direction of this country and for the middle class. 
   Mr. Hodes talked about Ms. Miers and Mr. Rove not obeying the subpoena that was issued for them to come to testify before the Congress. This Congress is looking at having a contempt charge brought against them, which I think we should have done earlier. We need to have a contempt charge brought, and we need to have them be punished for their contempt of this Congress, which, in essence, is a contempt of the American people and a contempt of the Constitution and of all things good that the American people stand for. 
   I am proud to be a member of this class, to support SCHIP, for health care for children and for all Americans.

<DOCNO>Mr. COHEN. (THE ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, today would have been the end of the 110th Congress. It appears it won't be for we will be returning to work on the bill that failed to pass today. I am a first-year Member, Madam Speaker, as you well know. And this was probably the most important and most difficult vote that any of us had to cast. 
   I came in today not knowing how I was going to vote. I listened to my constituents. I listened to economists. I listened to members of my party and members of the other party and tried to study on the issue. I ended up voting for the bill because I think it was the right thing to do for our country which I do believe, after reading Thomas Friedman and listening to others, is on the brink of an economic disaster. 
   The fact is, we need action. This Congress should have acted in a bipartisan fashion to take action. It was difficult to vote for the bill, just like it's difficult sometimes to take medicine that doesn't taste good or to have the doctor give you a shot or to go through a medical procedure. Sometimes you need it when you're sick. You want to avoid it because you don't want the bad taste or the pain of the surgery or the shot, but you know it's going to do you good. To do things that would allow people who have caused us this problem, people on Wall Street and investment bankers who are living all too well, to have some of their bad debts taken from them and to give them some relief was difficult. 
   But the bottom line is it affects everybody in America. It affects everybody's pension. It affects everybody's savings. It affects people's jobs. It affects the basic economic structure of our country. And to have capitalism and an economic system that works, you have got to have a financial system, an economic system which bankers are part of. And it has to be one that works. 
   We're interrelated. We had banks in Europe close. Two British banks and a German bank closed yesterday. And Wachovia was taken over today. Other banks in America are in trouble. A banker whom I have confidence in and respect for called me and suggested that if this Congress didn't take action, that there would be runs on banks and bank failures. There would be conduct that would be reminiscent of the 1920s. 
   On Saturday I had some time and I went out and visited the Franklin Roosevelt Memorial. And I looked at the sculptures of the people in lines, the people that were affected by the Depression and the quote from Franklin Roosevelt that is inscribed on those walls that said ``The test of our progress is not whether we add to the abundance of those who have much. It is whether we provide enough to those who have little. 
   And I thought about that and the failure of the Senate to pass the economic stimulus bill that we had passed here in this House to help people with food stamps, with Medicaid and with unemployment compensation that have already been affected, that while the bill we had today would have helped everybody, it would have most directly affected people who have much in abundance. And yet the Senate wasn't willing to help those who had too little. And I thought it ran counter to what Franklin Roosevelt spoke about. 
   There was lots in the bill I didn't like. There were things that could have been better considering the judicial standards and courts having more authority and more oversight. There were things in the bill that could have helped people who are in their homes now with bankruptcy options for judges to allow people to remain in their homes. And those things weren't there. 
   But on balance, I think we have to avert a disaster which I think we can be coming very close to experiencing. And I think the failure of this House to act in a bipartisan fashion, which it should have, is unfortunate for America. 
   It was a difficult vote, but I'm proud to have cast it. I hope that when we come back, and we will on Thursday, that the Republicans will come with more votes. They didn't deliver the votes they were supposed to. I was proud of their leadership as well as I was with mine in trying to do something right for America on the last day of this 110th Congress. 
   Madam Speaker, like you I'm very proud to be a Member of this Congress and to represent my country. I cast a vote that I know some people in my district might question because of the failures of the bill. But not to act would have been wrong. And on balance I felt like the right thing to do for our country to avert economic disaster was to vote for the bill. I hope we come back and have a better bill. Whether it is FDIC insurance going up to $200,000 or more, which I have recommended, whether it is part of the economic stimulus package being added to the bill, or options for bankruptcy judges to keep people in their homes, those are all ways that we can improve the bill. Hopefully we will improve it. And hopefully we will save our economy, the savings of our constituents and jobs of our constituents and keep America a strong and great country which I know it will be. 
   Madam Speaker, God bless America.

   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, this Democratic Congress has been successful in raising the minimum wage with help from people on the other side of the aisle, and the President signed that into law. 
   It has also passed stem cell research with some help from people on the other side of the aisle. The President has threatened to veto that bill and that's unfortunate. 
   The biggest issue hanging over this Congress is the war in Iraq; and while this Congress has made moves to have timetables and benchmarks, it hasn't achieved a consensus that the President will agree to and effectuate policy that brings our troops home. 
   It will take colleagues on the other side of the aisle, people who have been wedded to this war, President Bush's war, and have been unable to get themselves derailed from that train that's on a collision course. Until Republicans come forward and heed America's call to bring our troops home, more and more Americans will die in Iraq, more and more American dollars will be spent in Iraq where they shouldn't be. 
   We need to redeploy our troops to fight terrorists in Afghanistan and other places and keep our country safe. I ask my Republican colleagues, Mr. Speaker, to join us.

   Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I join my colleagues in asking that we pass the COPS Program. I started my career after law school as the attorney for the Memphis Police Department, and I learned then that patrol was the major deterrent to crime. 
   When I campaigned this year in the City of Memphis and met with the Afro-American Police Association, they came to me and the thing they asked me to do was to get more COPS dollars, saying that community policing was an effective tool in the fight against crime; that it wasn't just arresting, but it was knowing people in the community and encouraging them to find ways to interrelate to the police and have a better attitude. 
   By working with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and Ranking Member Smith, we came up with an amendment that will be part of the bill that will give Iraqi and Afghanistan veterans priority in the COPS Program so that when we bring our troops home we can have them effectively police our neighborhoods, just as they have been policing the neighborhoods in Baghdad. 
   We need policemen and cops on the streets in our hometowns, in Memphis, Tennessee, to fight crime. We need them home today in our towns, and not in Baghdad. The COPS Program will help.

   Crime is the number one issue in Memphis, Tennessee, and I think it is the number one issue in most areas in this country. I spoke with the Afro-American Police Association, and the issue they raised to me was the COPS Program, that community policing works. 
   I spoke with people in the district and they knew that the COPS Program had been successful, that it worked with community policing, and they knew it had been cut by this Congress and they couldn't understand why, and I couldn't tell them. I told them I was going to come to Congress and do what I could to see that the COPS program was reimplemented, that it was funded in a proper fashion, and that it helped cut crime. 
   In this bill we have an opportunity to work together to bring our troops home and to support our troops because veterans from Afghanistan and Iraq will be given priorities when feasible to get these positions, to come back and render their abilities and their experience for our people rather than the people of Baghdad. 
   Support our troops, support the COPS Program and make our streets safer.

Mr. Speaker, in my remarks in support of H.R. 1700, the ``COPS Improvements Act of 2007,'' I refer to amended language in the bill that would have required COPS grant recipients participating in the ``Troops-to-Cops'' program to give special hiring preference to former members of the Armed Forces who served in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. I first introduced this provision in an amendment during the Judiciary Committee markup of H.R. 1700. I withdrew that amendment with the understanding that, after working with Ranking Member Lamar Smith upon the committee's urging to craft mutually agreeable language, this provision was to be included in the final version of H.R. 1700. 
   Through what I believe to have been an inadvertent omission, the hiring preference for veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom was not included in the final version of H.R. 1700 that has been presented to the full House of Representatives. It is my understanding that the language will be added either in the Senate bill or at conference and, therefore, will be contained in the bill sent to the President for his signature.

During this holiday, Jews remember others who have been enslaved and call on Jews to remember and never forget and to try to see that others are not enslaved. 
   Partly for that reason, I introduced some time ago H.R. 194 to have our country make an apology for the history of slavery and Jim Crow laws we had in this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. COHEN. (CLIFFORD DAVIS/ODELL HORTON FEDERAL BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - March 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 753, sponsored by the entire Tennessee delegation of both the House and the Senate, is to designate the Federal building in Memphis, Tennessee, located at 167 North Main Street as the Clifford Davis and Odell Horton Federal Building. 
   Judge Odell Horton was appointed to the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee by President Jimmy Carter on May 12, 1980. He was brought to the attention of President Carter by then-Senator Jim Sasser and through a proposal by Lieutenant Governor John Wilder who represented the district that Judge Horton grew up in Bolivar, Tennessee. 
   Judge Horton in 1980 was the first African American Federal judge appointed to the bench in Tennessee since Reconstruction. He has many firsts as an African American, but he has more regard simply as an outstanding jurist, attorney, soldier and human being. 
   He was born May 13, 1929, in Bolivar, Tennessee, and grew up during the Depression and the Second World War. His father was a laborer and his mother took in laundry. The children, four boys and a girl, picked cotton, stacked lumber, and took other odd jobs to make ends meet. 
   Judge Horton graduated from Bolivar High School in 1946 and enlisted in the Marine Corps ``as a vehicle to find a way out of Bolivar.'' After an early discharge, he enrolled in Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia, using Federal aid under the GI bill to finance his tuition. The Korean War was under way by the time he graduated in 1951, and he returned for a second tour with the Marines. After a second tour, during which he graduated from the U.S. Navy School of Journalism, Horton entered Howard University Law School in Washington, DC. He received his degree from Howard in 1956, then moved to Memphis to begin private practice in a one-room office upstairs at 145 Beale Street in Memphis, the legendary Beale Street in Memphis. 
   He served in private practice for 5 years from 1957 until 1962 and then was appointed Assistant U.S. Attorney in Memphis. After being Assistant U.S. Attorney, he served in other capacities. First of all, during Mayor Henry Lobe's city administration, he was the first African American member of that administration, head of health and hospitals. That was a tumultuous time in Memphis' history. During that time, Dr. King was killed in Memphis on April 4, 1968, and we will observe that tragedy soon in Memphis. But Judge Horton, as an African American, had a difficult task. As such, he ordered the desegregation of the Bowld Hospital which was the public hospital. That was a great thing that he did in bringing Memphis forward. 
   A year after he did that in 1968, he received the L.M. Graves Memorial Health Award for his efforts to advance the cause of health care in Memphis. He later became a criminal court judge appointed by then-Governor Buford Ellington. After serving on the criminal court bench, he went on to serve as president of LeMoyne-Owen College, an historically black college in Memphis, a liberal arts school where he served for 4 years from 1970 to 1974. 
   In 1974, Judge Horton ran for Shelby County district attorney general. Although he lost by just about 4,000 votes, he came very close, and it was a historic election that set a precedent for other individuals running for office and being elected on their merits and not based on their race. He received over 23 percent of the Caucasian vote, which was unheard of at the time, and it showed the respect that he had from all sections of the community. 
   He returned to Federal service after being at LeMoyne-Owen and after having unsuccessfully sought the DA's job as reporter for the Speedy Trial Act Implementation Committee by the Western District Court. After that, he served as a U.S. bankruptcy judge from 1976 to 1980. Then he received the appointment from President Carter. Then from January 1, 1987, until December 31, 1993, he served as the chief judge for the Western District of Tennessee. On May 16, 1995, he took senior judge status, and 2 years later closed his Memphis office. 
   He is remembered in Memphis as a calm and patient judge who carefully and deliberately explained legal concepts to jurors. He was a model for judges because of his judicial temperament and set a standard in such regards. Judge Horton and his wife, Evie Randolf, were married for over 50 years and have two sons, Odell Horton, Jr., and Christopher, who graduated from his alma mater, Morehouse College in Atlanta. Judge Horton's widow spoke for so many in his profession and personal life when she stated after his death, ``He was a rare and precious jewel in the crown of humanity and made all of our lives richer and better because he passed this way.'' Indeed, Mrs. Horton was correct. 
   Judge Horton received many honors for his work from different bar associations and institutions. He was a member of the American Bar Association and Chair of the National Conference of Federal Trial Judges. He served as a member of the Judicial Conference Committee on Defender Services, and Morehouse College awarded him an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws. 
   In the year 2000, the Memphis Bar Association awarded Judge Horton with a Public Service Award. He died February 22, 2006. In honor of Judge Horton's significant contributions to the legal community in Memphis and his pioneering career, it is both fitting and proper to designate the courthouse located at 167 North Main Street in Memphis as the Clifford Davis and Odell Horton Federal Building. 
   As Senator Alexander mentioned on the Senate floor, it is appropriate that  this building have both the names of Judge Horton, a great pioneer of the latter half of the 20th century, and Clifford Davis, who was part of the first half of the 20th century, served as United States Congressman from 1940 to 1965. It shows a continuum of history, a growth of history, and history is a process. The naming of this building for Judge Horton as well as former Congressman Clifford Davis shows progress in Memphis, progress in race relations, and progress among human beings. 
   Accordingly, I ask for unanimous passage of the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1019 is a bill to designate the United States Customhouse Building located at 31 Gonzalez Clemente Avenue in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, as the Rafael Martinez Nadal United States Customhouse Building. 
   Although Don Rafael Martinez Nadal was born in the city of Mayaguez on April 22, 1877, he resided and passed away in Guaynabo. He received his college degree in philosophy and letters from the Provincial Institute of Secondary Education in San Juan. At 16, he was sent to Barcelona, Spain, to study law. 
   In August, 1904, he returned to Mayaguez and began to study coffee growing agriculture. Simultaneously, he began his first successful attempts in the media and politics with the Puerto Rican Republican Party. In 1908, he founded the political newspaper El Combate. In 1912, he obtained his law degree and became one of the most  prominent men in the Puerto Rican political arena. He was considered one of the most famous criminal lawyers of the time. 
   In 1914, he was elected as a member of the Chamber of Delegates for the city of Ponce by the Puerto Rican Republican Party. In 1920, he was chosen by the same party to serve in the Senate and was re-elected in the next five general elections. When the alliance of the Union of Puerto Rico Party and the Puerto Rican Republican Party formed in 1924, Nadal left the Republican Party and initiated a political movement called the Pure Republican Party, which registered officially as the Historical Constitutional Party. 
   Later, he founded the Republican Union, working to advance the ideal of statehood for Puerto Rico. In coalition with the Socialist Party, the Republican Union triumphed in the general elections of 1932 and 1936. In both terms, Nadal presided over the Senate. Before the election of 1940, because of a serious illness, he returned to his Guaynabo residence. He died there on July 6, 1941. 
   In honor of Rafael Martinez Nadal's outstanding contributions to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and his exemplary professional writing career, it is both fitting and proper to designate the courthouse located at 31 Gonzalez Clemente Avenue in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, as the ``Rafael Martinez Nadal United States Customhouse Building.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Virginia for this time. 
   This is my first year in the Congress. In my 24 years in the State senate, I was the leading spokesperson for animal welfare legislation, and I took great pride in that. So I am particularly appreciative of standing up on this bill. 
   I incorporate by reference all the things that have been said about the harmful effects of this practice, and they are well known. I think that the spread of avian flu and all the other pertinent conduct is to be prohibited. 
   But the main thing is, dogs are our best friends. Harry Truman said, if you want a friend in Washington, get a dog. So far, I haven't been here 90 days, I have made lots of friends. I haven't needed a dog yet, but I have thought about the day. I saw a Congressman come in the other day, Congressman Whitfield from Kentucky, he had his dog with him. He has been here more years than me. 
   Dogs are our friends. We all have dogs that we feel that are part of our families. We shouldn't treat any of God's creatures the way that people treat dogs and cocks; and I guess if I was from Kentucky, Congressman Yarmuth, I could speak more fondly about chickens, because the Colonel and KFC have done a lot for his district. 
   But my particular interest is dogs, and we should treat them well. They are our friends. You can go back in TV lore, Lassie and Asta, and you think about Snoopy. To teach them to fight, to require them to fight, to watch them die is just not what God intended and not what we should encourage and condone. 
   Children shouldn't be exposed to this, and sometimes they are. This type of conduct leads to other types of harmful conduct and violence against women, violence against seniors. People who enjoy this type of violence and watching it are more often than not going to be the most likely people to pick on others who are unable to take care of themselves. 
   I am very proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 137. I look forward to its passage and the day that we don't have people who get some type of great enjoyment out of watching dogs, cocks or any other of God's creatures fight to the death and find pleasure and enjoyment in it and teach their children by that association that violence is something good, when it isn't.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, this Nation lost a great American this week. United States Congressman Tom Lantos passed at the age of 80. Last night on this floor, there was an hour of bipartisan agreement of what this man meant to this country and how much we've lost. There will be a memorial service tomorrow under the Capitol rotunda. 
   Tom Lantos was a Holocaust survivor who escaped from the Nazis twice and survived. He helped Jewish people survive the Holocaust through the good deeds of Raul Wallenberg, and he remembered that. He was a leader in this Congress and this Nation on human rights and civil rights, animal welfare rights, all living creatures. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a freshman Member of Congress, I was befriended by Tom Lantos, who told me to call him ``Tom,'' which was difficult to do. He was such a giant of a man. 
   There are great opportunities to speak out on policy in this body and to serve in the greatest deliberative body in the world, but there are human stories, too. 
   In my opinion, there are two saints that are Members or have been Members during this term that I have served. One is Congressman Lantos, and one is Congressman Lewis. They have overcome great adversity to go to great heights. I think this country owes a debt of gratitude to the Lantos family for his work. He will be sorely missed. I was fortunate to serve with him and to be able to call him a friend.

<DOCNO>Mr. COHEN. (HONORING AND PRAISING THE NAACP ON ITS 99TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Today I rise and join my colleague, the Honorable AL GREEN of Texas, in honoring the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People on the occasion of its 99th anniversary. As we celebrate Black History Month, it is only appropriate that we do so by recognizing our Nation's oldest and largest civil rights organization. 
   The NAACP was founded on February 12, 1909, by Ida Wells-Barnett, W.E.B. DuBois, Henry Moscowitz, Mary White Ovington, Oswald Garrison Villard, and William English Walling. 
   Since its inception, the NAACP has united students, laborers, professionals, scholars, officials, and others of all races to advance its vision of ``a society in which all individuals have equal rights and there is no racial hatred or racial discrimination.'' 
   Historically, the NAACP is probably best known for its role and that of Thurgood Marshall in the seminal case of Brown v. Board of Education, in which the Supreme Court held in 1954 that ``separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.'' Yet we must not forget that the NAACP has been at the forefront of all efforts to secure equality and justice for every American throughout the 20th century and now into the 21st century. 
   The NAACP spoke out against lynching, challenged racially biased Supreme Court Justice nominees as early as 1930, and pursued nondiscrimination policies in the military, war-related industries, and the Federal Government during the world wars. 
   At the height of the civil rights era, the NAACP fought battles on the ground, in the courtroom, and in Congress, where it lobbied for passage of civil rights legislation like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.     
   Since then and during our current session, NAACP has lobbied for hate crimes legislation and other legislation that protects minorities, not necessarily based on race, but based on discrimination. 
   Today, on the shoulders of distinguished members and leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Coretta Scott King, Rosa Parks, Medgar Evers, Merlie Evers-Williams, Benjamin Hooks, Julian Bond, Jesse Turner, Jr., Maxine Vasco Smith, and Kweisi Mfume, the NAACP continues to fight the good fight. 
   Most recently the NAACP is promoting African American graduation and college readiness, protecting and advancing voting rights, and identifying solutions to the subprime mortgage foreclosure crisis. I have the privilege of working with the association to further those important efforts. 
   So in recognizing the NAACP's past and present, I again salute the organization on its near centennial anniversary. I am confident the NAACP will remain an integral part of our Nation's efforts to protect and promote civil rights in the future and move society forward in a progressive manner on a wide array of issues. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 289. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   In my community of Memphis, the president of NAACP is Mrs. Johnnie Turner. We have had a great NAACP chapter. Ben Hooks, who is a former head of the agency, is a resident of my community, an outstanding individual who recently was honored by President Bush with a Medal of Freedom. And Maxine Vasco Smith and Jesse Turner who have been national officers of the NAACP are residents of my community as well. 
   The NAACP has been very important to Memphis but very important to this country. I thank Mr. Green for bringing the resolution to the floor, and I appreciate the remarks made here on the floor. I urge final passage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, if I may go on with my remarks. 
   I rise to support House Resolution 971, which is a resolution to express sympathy and support for the individuals and institutions affected by the powerful tornados that swept through the Southeastern Conference States of Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Kentucky and Tennessee just over 2 weeks ago. 
   Over 100 tornados landed, they killed over 50 people, destroyed hundreds of homes, schools and businesses, and left thousands of people without power. In true American spirit and resolve, hundreds of volunteers cared for the victims and provided shelter, food and clothing. 
   I express my heartfelt sympathy to all of our fellow citizens in the wake of Mother Nature's wrath, and to commend the men and women who serve this Nation as first responders, police officers, firefighters and emergency medical personnel who place themselves in great danger every day but did on this day as well to protect us and the people that were in harm's way. Our neighbors and friends deserve our sympathy and prayers, and the first responders deserve our deepest thanks and respect. 
   On the occasion of the day after the tornados, Congresswoman Blackburn joined me in Memphis, and we toured around Hickory Hills and met with some individuals, the mayors of Wharton and Harrington and other city officials in Memphis to make sure that the proper procedures were followed. 
   I talked to the FEMA Director, Mr. Paulison, and he assured me, and he's followed through on his promise that FEMA would do all they could to help the residents in Tennessee and in the other States as well. 
   I would like to commend President Bush for his quick response. He responded to Governor Bredeson's request to have Tennessee and other areas declared disaster areas, and that was done. And FEMA is on the ground, already issuing checks and helping people. 
   We've seen a great response from the Federal Government when it was needed, and we're looking for more response, which we're working on now, to provide to our people throughout that district. 
   I appreciate the gentlelady from Oklahoma (Ms. Fallin) indulging me and allowing Mr. Tanner to speak and make his important appointment. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlelady from Oklahoma for her management and Mr. Wamp, Mrs. Blackburn, Mr. Davis who spoke, and Mr. Gordon and Mr. Oberstar who provided statements. 
   Abraham Lincoln was a great supporter of government and knew that government could do things for people in need and was an important instrument of good in society. Abraham Lincoln might have best expressed it. In a crisis like this, we realize how important government can be when first responders come to the rescue and do jobs of heroic proportion. 
   Too many times when we are not faced with tragedies and catastrophic events, we don't reflect on the importance of government. And government is the policeman on the street. And it's the paramedic, and it's the firefighter. And it shouldn't just be on 9/11 or on days when you think about 9/11 or tornados you think about these people. But they are government, and they show government works, and they show government worked in this particular situation. It's still working as FEMA's helping people get compensation for their losses and seeing they have habitable places to live in and that the Small Business Administration is helping get businesses started. 
   Indeed, as Mr. Wamp and others said, it's the volunteer spirit that was shown by people in Tennessee and Alabama and Arkansas and throughout the South. They showed their care for their neighbors. There were people from Georgia and the Red Cross who came into Memphis to help people there. 
   I want to thank everybody who's helped all of the victims and thank Mr. Gordon for being the proud sponsor on this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would ask that everybody join in voting for the passage of this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, this weekend tens or hundreds of thousands of Americans came to Washington to protest the war. It was reminiscent of Vietnam, as so much of this war is reminiscent of Vietnam. 
   What these people did was an act of patriotism and courage, exercising their first amendment rights and expressing their opinion that the policy of this administration and this country is wrong. As they protested, and throughout the weekend, American soldiers lost their lives. It is unfortunate that it seems that the calls of the people are not being heeded. 
   It is particularly distressing, Mr. Speaker, to hear one of the Cabinet members suggest that people who disagree with the administration are lending aid and solace to the enemy. That is wrong. The first amendment is about free speech. The demonstrations, the protests that happened this week were correct. Samuel Johnson said: ``The last refuge to which a scoundrel clings is patriotism.'' I think we saw people try to find patriotism to be the refuge rather than response to protests and analytical discussions of the policies in Iraq.

   Whose fault it is--I think the American people know whose fault it is. There were 6 years of a Republican President, a Republican Senate, a Republican House, and a lack of regulations and a lack of regard to the economic conditions that brought about this situation, but now is the time to fix the mess. 
   Whether you are a first-year Member, a senior Member, a Democrat or Republican, when you make a mess, you clean it up. It's our responsibility to do it in the proper way with oversight, with the American taxpayer at the base of our concerns to make sure we do it right. 
   We are in for historic times. The Democratic Party and the Republican Party need to come together, and we need to have a solution to keep America strong. 
   God bless the United States of America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to reference today's New York Times editorial, not a Member of this body but the editorial page. It is titled, ``Ms. Pelosi Compromise.'' 
   ``This is obviously not the best moment for Congress to rush through an energy bill. The country is caught up in a heated Presidential campaign. Voters are furious at high gas prices. Republicans are happily pandering to that anger, while the Democrats fear it. And at the end of this month, just before Congress heads home for the election recess, the long-standing moratorium on offshore drilling is scheduled to expire--providing an opportunity for more grandstanding.'' 
   The editorial continues that ``these are not sensible times, which means that Congressional Democrats, particularly House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, must try hard to make the best of a bad situation. 
   ``The situation, briefly, is this: the Republicans have been bludgeoning the Democrats with the claim that Democratic opposition to offshore drilling is to blame for high fuel prices and that drilling is the answer, or one answer to the country's dependence on foreign oil. 
   ``We find it hard to imagine that they really believe what they say. Drilling will have no impact on fuel prices for at least 15 years, if then, and any number of efficiency measures will do more to reduce the country's dependence than drilling for America's modest offshore reserves. But the chant of 'drill, baby, drill!' is playing far too well on the campaign trail for the Republicans to let the facts get in the way. 
   ``The Republicans have offered bills that would provide broad access to the Outer Continental Shelf and in one case allow drilling as close as 12 miles from shore. So Ms. Pelosi is taking no chances. As early as Tuesday she is expected to unveil what she advertised as a grand compromise. The bill would allow drilling in all of the Outer Continental Shelf beyond 100 miles offshore from States that permit it.'' 
   The bottom line: ``Ms. Pelosi's compromise deserves support. If it fails, the Democrats must fight to renew the moratorium. Otherwise, there could well be oil rigs within 3 miles of American shore.'' 
   Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and thank you to the New York Times.

   Isaac Hayes, like Elvis, came to Memphis from the rural Midsouth, a poor person who was raised in the cotton fields and came to Memphis and got his education at Manassas High School. Elvis went to Sam Phillips and Sun Records. John Lennon said before Elvis there was nothing, but after Elvis there was Isaac Hayes. Isaac Hayes put a new form to music, pretty much created hip hop, received Oscars and Grammys and produced his signature song ``The Theme From Shaft,'' which began a kind of a new genre of music. 
   He was a wonderful human being to be around. He inspired greatness and wrote great songs with his dear friend and co-composer, David Porter, ``Hold On I'm Comin' '' and other great songs by Sam and Dave. ``Black Moses'' will be remembered for years to come. We're fortunate he has come our way and lent his talents to the world. We'll miss him. He was my friend.

<DOCNO>Mr. COHEN. (ENERGY PRICES RISING -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, our Nation is suffering. While many citizens are living paycheck to paycheck, energy prices have been rising, affecting the daily lives of Americans, getting to their jobs, getting children to school, and causing the cost of goods to increase significantly due to rising transportation costs. Rising energy costs affect individuals, families, and businesses, both large and small. 
   We must gain control of energy prices, and must do so in a reasonable and rational manner, with an eye toward the future and a plan which accomplishes energy independence while respecting our environment and providing real relief to individuals, not promoting yet another program that benefits Big Oil, at the expense of the taxpayer. 
   There are very real differences between Democrats and Republicans when we talk about energy issues. We are in the mess we are in now because the interests of Big Oil have, for far too long, been given priority over the needs of our citizens. Big Oil has reaped the rewards. Even now, while Americans struggle for ways they can reduce their individual energy consumption, ways they can survive while the price of gasoline, home energy costs, groceries, indeed almost everything has outstripped their income, the Republicans are touting a plan that, according to yesterday's and today's New York Times editorials, would do little to increase the supply or reduce the price of oil. 
   The New York Times editorial: ``It would do little to increase the supply or reduce the price of oil. Oil companies already have access to nearly 80 percent of all American offshore oil that is technically recoverable. This bill would probably open up less than half of the remaining 20 percent, amounting to approximately two-thirds of 1 percent of all globally recoverable sources. The Department of Energy has already stated that the effect on prices would be insignificant.'' 
   The very party which has led us down this path of dependence on Big Oil, that has repeatedly squelched innovation and interest in renewable resources and alternative forms of energy, now wishes to save us with the simple mantra: Drill, baby, drill.  
   According to another New York Times op-ed published yesterday, drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and from currently restricted offshore sites could translate into an extra million barrels of oil a day in the year 2025. That is 17 years from now, Madam Speaker. Please note that. An extra million barrels in 2008 or 2009? No. 2025. 
   Sure, it takes time to make real change. But 17 years from now we can expect the Republican fix to result in lowering the price of crude by only 1.3 percent. So the party of Bush and CHENEY, the party of Big Oil, the party that Texas gave us, is going to fix the situation they have created just 17 years from now, and with a 1.3 percent cut. In the meantime, Big Oil's profits will continue to rise. 
   The Republican record on energy programs which have helped Americans is poor indeed. Let's look at the facts and decide if we need another Republican energy plan. 
   According to the Energy Information Administration, the price of gas is now $3.65, up from $1.46 when President Bush took office. A 150 percent increase. The price of gas was $2.29 when Republicans adopted their energy plan. Today, it's a 59 percent increase. $3.65. 
   Republican energy policies have resulted in record profits for oil companies. The five largest companies have posted profits of $556 billion from 2001 to 2007, including $123 billion in 2007 alone. Yet, Republicans have voted against nearly every energy initiative brought to the House floor. 
   Madam Speaker, I submit to you we must do everything we can, and examine every option in our efforts to help American citizens and to change our energy culture. Yes, we must look at drilling, but we need to be responsible in our approach and ensure that we are making decisions that actually achieve our goals, and our goals must be to help the taxpayers, not the oil corporations. 
   We must look at alternative forms of energy, we must look at renewable energy, we must look at every aspect of energy consumption before we act. There are real differences here, and I hope Congress will do the heavy lifting and make the difficult choices necessary to do what is right for the American people. 
   It's long past the time for rhetoric. It's time to tackle this real challenge and come up with real solutions, not short-term fixes, which will lead the American public, once again, footing the bill for Big Oil. 
   Madam Speaker, today the New York Times had another editorial. The New York Times' independent observations: 
   ``Voters are furious at high gas prices. Republicans are happily pandering at their anger. Congress has sensibly renewed the moratorium each year for the last 26. Unfortunately, these are not sensible times, which means that congressional Democrats, particularly House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi, must try hard to make the best of a bad situation. The situation, briefly, is this: The Republicans have been bludgeoning the Democrats with the claim that Democrat opposition to offshore drilling is to blame for high fuel prices and that drilling is the answer, or one answer, to the country's dependence on foreign oil. We find it hard to imagine that they really believe what they say.

   Staff Sergeant Kennon joined the Army immediately after high school, hoping to earn enough money for college and eventually become a lawyer. He was guarding a bank in Mosul when he was killed. 
   His father said, ``He was a beautiful kid. He was a serious-minded youngster who was devoted to fulfilling his mother's wishes. If his mother needed anything, instead of being out in a park playing basketball, it was his joy to go out and do whatever he had to do to help her.'' 
   On 9/11, I received an e-mail from his sister, Miss Nicole Crawford. I will read it: 
   ``I am the sister of Staff Sergeant Morgan Kennon. I just wanted to know exactly what you and other Members of Congress and Members of the Senate are doing to bring our troops home. It has been almost 4 years since my brother was killed, and we still don't know why he was killed. 
   ``Mr. Cohen, it is not just hard for the soldiers serving in Iraq, it is hard for their families also who worry about them. It is especially hard for the families that have lost loved ones in Iraq. 
   ``Please don't take this the wrong way, but if the Democrats don't do something soon and force Mr. Bush's hand, there will not be a Democrat in the White House next year. The people of this country voted for the Democratic Party because they want change.'' 
   Ms. Crawford, I am for change. I am not going to vote for any additional funds but to redeploy our troops. I feel your pain.

   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, Democratic efforts to change direction in Iraq forced the President to issue a preliminary report showing that the Iraqis have not met the benchmarks that they were supposed to. The failure of the Iraqi Government to keep its promises, coupled with continued violence on the ground, the death of our soldiers and Iraqi civilians has led Senate Republicans, at least some of them, to join us in calling for a new direction in Iraq. 
   Some Senate Republicans see the writing on the wall, writing on the wall in both of our House cloakrooms, but is yet to be seen on the Republican side but for four of our colleagues, for the optometrist hasn't made his way over there. The situation is getting worse for our troops. We will see this week whether Senate Republicans mean what they say and they vote for the Levin-Reed amendment when it comes to the Senate floor tomorrow and bring our troops home. The amendment is close to identical with what the House passed with Democratic votes and four Republicans last week. 
   The Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki has said they can supply their own defense and they don't need us any longer. When a host says go home, it is only correct to go home. He says they don't need us. We aren't needed. We need to bring our troops home and not have them needlessly die.

   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, last night the Senate stayed in session and they're probably still in session because they can't get an agreement to discuss the resolution, the bill that this House has already passed, a similar one to end the war in Iraq and redeploy our troops and bring our troops home. 
   This House, on several occasions, has passed bills with benchmarks to respond to the American people's wishes and end this horrific war. The Senate hasn't been able to do it because they need 60 votes to avoid filibuster. That's what they have going on now. 
   And that's the problem, Mr. Speaker, is the procedures in the Senate, and that's why we're still in this horrific war, a war where the Prime Minister of Iraq has said he can provide for the security of his country by January 1 and he does not need our troops. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that Emily Post's rule should be invoked. When you're a visitor and your host says you're no longer needed and no longer wanted, you pack your bags and you go home. I would advise the President, Mr. Speaker, to listen to Emily Post and be a good visitor and bring our troops home and stop losing lives needlessly.

   In my communities, the finest public school students traditionally are desirous of going to Historically Black Colleges and Universities. We try to keep them in Tennessee with HOPE scholarships. We offer from $4,000 to $5,500 a year to stay in Tennessee. There are fine Historically Black Colleges and Universities: Lemoyne-Owen in my district, Fisk in Nashville, and Knoxville College up in East Tennessee. But most of them want to go out of State and go to Atlanta and come to this area to Historically Black Colleges and Universities. It is still the first choice for most African American students. 
   We need to fund these schools at a higher level. They have not received increased funding over the last 5 or 6 years to speak of. The need has become greater and greater. These are students who need educational opportunities to move out and into the American dream.

And yet when the Democrats, along with Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic majority, have asked the President to stop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is 97 percent full and which experts say could lower the price of gasoline by 5 to 24 cents a gallon, the President says he doesn't believe the cost benefit analysis of immediate action for consumers persuaded him. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that the President consider how Americans are suffering with the price of gasoline at the pump, how that's limiting their other choices in expenditures, and how it will reduce their opportunity for summer vacations. 
   Yesterday, Mr. Speaker, I signed on to a bill for a windfall profits tax on oil companies. Oil companies presently have subsidies given to them in the past, which this Congress tried to repeal but we didn't have bipartisan support to repeal those subsidies. So these companies making more money than ever have subsidies rather than windfall profit taxes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   This Friday, our Nation will recognize the 40th anniversary of a most infamous day in our country's history, the assassination of the great Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. 
   It's impossible to speak about Dr. King without remembering his eloquence and powerful oratory. Dr. King brought his brilliant mind and God-given speech to bear against mighty forces, forces which were entrenched and interwoven so powerfully in the very fabric of our country that the task to overcome seemed nearly impossible. But he was not deterred. And even from the distance of 40 years, what Martin Luther King, Jr., accomplished in his short number of years on this earth is awe-inspiring. He started a march to justice that he still inspires and which moves toward fulfillment. 
   An assassin's shot rang out in Memphis, silencing a most beautiful and eloquent man, but it didn't silence his dream. He was a man who worked with Bayard Rustin to take Gandhi's principles of nonviolence and change a country through different forms of civil disobedience that had not been seen in this country successfully. 
   He brought a march to Washington that's still the greatest march known to this day, a collection of individuals demanding a change of course for this country. And he changed this country and changed, his force made this Congress and the President of the United States, at that time, Lyndon Johnson, change its course and bring about great civil rights legislation. 
   A man whose life and death continues to define our country and our world, his dream survives his death, and will continue to survive as long as we know what is good and just about our Nation. 
   The man could be killed, but not the dream. The dream lives in each of us. Though the fires of progress sometimes seem to dwindle to embers, each time we declare that all people are equal, each time we fight against discrimination and intolerance, and each time we speak truth to power, each time we do those things we fan the flame of Martin Luther King's dream and his purpose and his passion lives on in us. 
   Martin Luther King spoke truth to power, and that is a great thing.

   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, this past week was our home work week, and we went to visit with our constituents and see what the people thought. 
   In the Ninth District of Tennessee, I found a people I know who felt that this war that we're engaging in is one that we need to bring our troops home from. They spoke of their family members who served in the previous war and said, there's no purpose in what we're doing, and we don't understand it. 
   I saw a people who saw the movie ``Sicko'' and came away amazed. And as I toured the Federal Correctional Institute, I felt like I was watching ``Sicko'' in live theater, for I saw that if you're in prison, you get all the health care you want, but if you don't commit a crime, you don't get health care in this country. And Michael Moore has made a valid point. 
   And I saw a people who feel like crime is a great problem in this country and their neighborhoods and who commend this Democratic Congress for passing the COPS bill and having more money for the hiring of policemen and for better technology. 
   And I saw a people that wondered what's going on with our President and our Vice President and asked more and more about impeachment. It's something that the American Congress needs to consider strongly, for our executive powers are out of control.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen that were watching or here in the gallery, I am a freshman Congressperson. I am from Tennessee. And last March I came up and I stood in that gallery and I looked down at this body and I wondered if I wanted to be a part of it. The decision was made partially by me by filing for office and waging a campaign. But the decision was eventually made by my voters in the 9th District in Tennessee who elected me. They elected 49 new Congresspeople, 41 of which are Democrats; and we have just completed our first week in office. 
   I felt like it was appropriate at the finish of this week, Mr. Speaker, to give some type of report to the people of what we have experienced as freshman Congresspeople. I don't come here like Alexander Haig might have and assume control. We have that freshman president, and I am not that freshman president, nor did I seek to be one. It is Paul Hodes from New Hampshire who is a very fine freshman legislator. 
   But a lot has happened in this week. We all came up here with a lot of interest in seeing America be better. And America is better. In just the one week we have been here, we have been privileged to be a part of this body. We have seen the first lady ever elected Speaker of a legislative body of this nature in the United States elected, NANCY PELOSI. It was a historic moment. 
   And earlier today one of our freshmen, Congressman Bilbray, talked about the fact that some years ago on this date the resolution was introduced to give women the right to vote. That resolution passed in my home State of Tennessee in 1920, when Tennessee was the perfect 36, and gave women the right to vote. 
   It has been a long time, and a change was coming, and a change has happened. And it is great to have a woman, an opportunity seen with the election of NANCY PELOSI. 
   This week, we have seen changes in the way lobbyists and legislators relate, and that is one of the reasons why I think Congress has one of the worst reputations of any collective group of professionals or government officials in this country and why some of us were elected, to see a change in that culture. And ties were cut between lobbyists and legislators which never should have existed. I was proud to vote for that and see that as part of the 100 hours of change that the Democratic leadership is bringing about. 
   The PAYGO policy brings some fiscal sanity to what has otherwise been a kind of runaway process where this country is in great economic distress. We have had three different bipartisan groups that we have had orientation sessions with. In each one of those classes we have been told that our economic situation is dire. The same about our foreign policy and the same about our environment and our health care system. 
   There are difficult times in America. It seems good, but it really isn't. The underpinnings are not there. 
   This week PAYGO is important. Cutting the ties between legislators and lobbyists was important. And it was also extremely important what we did today. We passed the minimum wage. 
   And I can't go without quoting President Franklin Roosevelt, one of my heroes, who said, ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have too much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.'' Today we provided for those that have too little and we did right. 
   And I want to quote Hubert Humphrey, a great American whose bust I looked at outside of the Senate, looked at with reverence. ``The moral test of government is how it treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the aged; and those who are in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the handicapped.'' 
   I think in the tradition of some great Americans we have acted today on the minimum wage. We will act on stem cell research and other issues. And we've acted on the 9/11 Commission reports. Most of this was done in a bipartisan manner. Not all of it. 
   And it has given me the opportunity, which I want to take today, to quote a line which I have read for years and thought about when I thought about these halls, not thinking of myself being a Member of this body, which is a great honor coming to me at a late time in life, after spending 24 years in the Tennessee State Senate. 
   ``Come Senators, Congressmen, please heed the call. Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.''     
   For he who gets hurt will be he who has stalled. There's a battle outside and it's raging. It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls. For the times they are a changin'. Bob Dylan, Robert Zimmerman, was right. The times they are a changin'. 
   There is a Democratic majority. I am proud to be of it, as are 41 other freshmen. I can testify today that America is in better shape than it was a week ago.

   America has become a land of the haves and the have-nots. The disparity of wealth among the richest and poorest in this country is the greatest it has been in nearly 100 years. We have laws which provide every sort of tax break for those who are thriving, while the people who are struggling daily to put food on the table and pay their utility bills have not seen a raise in the minimum wage in nearly 10 years. 
   Seven dollars and twenty-five cents. Seven dollars and twenty-five cents. Many haves in this country spend that much each day on their Starbucks with a dollop or a twist. Those of us who don't struggle to make ends meet, this is truly the time to walk in our brother's and our sister's shoes, shoes that need soling, not polishing. 
   This is not just an economic issue, it is a moral issue. Prosperity is not the property of the few, it should also be available to the least of us. 
   As I left the Memphis airport, a hardworking man for Northwest Airlines said to me, Congressman, will you pass the minimum wage? To him and many others, the thousands in District Nine, I say, yes, we will do that. 
   This is an opportunity for us to help people who need help. And I say to my fellow so-called ``do-gooders'' of the world, let us make America more fair, more humane and more just.

   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, as a State senator in Tennessee, I worked for  more than 20 years to pass a State lottery with proceeds benefiting education programs. The primary recipients of the proceeds are college students. In addition to keeping Tennessee's best and brightest in Tennessee, the purpose of the Lottery HOPE scholarship program is to provide students with a means to focus on their studies rather than having to take a second job to pay their tuition, and also to permit them to enter the workforce without the burden of student loans. 
   Tuition has risen sharply at both public and private universities, particularly at public institutions; interest rates on student loans have risen as well. This has been an onerous burden on students and their families, and for many Americans it has left them out in the cold in terms of pursuing a college education. 
   For the U.S. to be able to compete for jobs in the world, we must have an educated workforce. We are facing a shortage of up to 12 million college-educated workers by 2020. We need to remove roadblocks to education. There is nothing more important than the education of our citizenry, because it impacts every facet of our society.

   Forty Members of the Republican Party joined with us, but many Members of the Republican Party, just like the previous speaker, sensed that something was wrong with the bill because it was, quote-unquote, an earmark. That alleged earmark, not really  an earmark, was in my district. It says that the States of Mississippi and Arkansas can pay for the health care that their people receive at the Charity Hospital in the City of Memphis, Tennessee that is losing $20 million a year and more treating people from Mississippi and Arkansas who are indigent. 
   That is not an earmark. That is allowing a State the option to pay for care received by their citizens that they otherwise wouldn't receive and that another county taxpayer group or city people are paying for. It is equity. It is long due. It wasn't an earmark. And I hope my colleagues will refrain from continuing to refer to this in such a way. It is a calumny that shouldn't be repeated on this House floor.

<DOCNO>Mr. COHEN. (RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE NEGRO BASEBALL LEAGUES AND THEIR PLAYERS -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 162, which recognizes the contributions of Negro Baseball Leagues. 
   The Negro Baseball Leagues are part of our history when segregation was the rule, segregation was the law. It is an unfortunate, most unfortunate part of America's history, part of a blemish on the soul of America, part of the blemish on the Constitution, on our laws, and the basis of the founding of the country. 
   No Nation has a more distinguished, honorable, and respected foundation conceived in life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and equal justice for all. But in so many institutions it wasn't true, it wasn't real, until about the 1960s. The work of a great Democratic Congress and President Johnson and others, Republicans as well in a bipartisan move, overcame and repealed Jim Crow laws and passed amendments and laws that allowed people to use public facilities and to have integration in this country and to give everybody the American Dream, which had been denied for over 200 years in this country. 
   The baseball leagues that were reserved for Negroes were an example of that. There were great players who didn't have the opportunity to perform and achieve until integration. Branch Rickey of the Dodgers brought Jackie Robinson up in the 1940s, and there were great players that didn't have that opportunity. 
   I want to tell you one story about one particular baseball player who is in this resolution. He is in this resolution because he deserves to be in any resolution about baseball, about discrimination, and about kindness, Minnie Minoso. Minnie Minoso was a Cuban, African Cuban, who came to this country. I guess he would be an African American. 
   Minnie Minoso started his career in the Negro League, and didn't get to the Major Leagues until he was about 28 or 29 years of age. He had a great career. He led the American League in triples and doubles and stolen bases, one time in RBIs, received three or four Golden Glove awards, named to the All-Star games many, many times, and had statistics with home runs and batting average at nearly .300 for his career that should have qualified him for the Hall of Fame. But he hasn't gotten into the Hall of Fame, and he is not going to get in the Hall of Fame because he wasn't allowed to start in Major League Baseball until he was 28 or 29 because of discrimination. 
   Well, in 1955, at a spring training game in Memphis, Tennessee, at Russwood Park, I went to a ball game in Memphis. I had had polio the previous year, and I attended the game with my White Sox cap and White Sox T-shirt, on crutches. A player came up to me and offered me a baseball; I was down by the railing trying to get them. The player was named Tom Poholsky, who was white. And I thanked him, but he told me, You shouldn't thank me. You should thank that player over there, number 9, Minoso. Minoso gave Poholsky the ball and wanted me to have it. But because of segregation in this country, Minnie Minoso, one of 60 players, they hadn't cut the rosters yet for spring training, was the only player who had the kindness in his heart to see somebody who was a ball fan who couldn't play at the time because he was on crutches. But in a segregated South, he couldn't give me that ball. He couldn't have a decent act of kindness because of segregation. 
   Well, I got the ball, and I went down with my dad and we got to know Minnie Minoso, and it started a friendship that has continued to this day. Minnie Minoso was a class act, a wonderful human being who goes beyond baseball, the most popular player ever to wear a White Sox uniform, and a person who has given his life to baseball. But because of the denial of segregation, not allowing him to play in the Major Leagues until he was 28 or 29, he will not get the respect he is due, just like other players in the Negro Leagues didn't. So many of them who were great players, who would have led the majors in stolen bases, in doubles, in triples, in home runs, in RBIs, or average, as shown over the years by great players like Maury Wills and Bob Gibson and so many other great players who got the opportunity to play and show they could perform. 
   This year in Memphis on March 31, the major leagues are having a civil rights game. The last exhibition game of the season will be in Memphis at Auto Zone Park; it will be the Cleveland Indians and the St. Louis Cardinals play. There will be a special luncheon the day before the game where the widows of Roberto Clemente and Buck O'Neal will be honored, as well as Spike Lee, for contributions that baseball and civil rights have given to the growth of this country. 
   It is somewhat ironic in a way that we now see what baseball did to help integrate our country. And this resolution, which is part of the process of showing what this country has gone through, is about a time when we had segregation. Baseball helped integrate society. It helped get little young white kids to appreciate black players and see simple acts of kindness and see the absurdity of segregation. It gave me the opportunity in 1961 in Memphis to go to the Lorraine Hotel, then an all-Negro institution, and see a hero and other players like Walter Bond and Dick Powell staying in the segregated black hotel when the Caucasian players were at the Peabody, and see how ridiculous is this that my hero, an All-Star, a Golden Glove award winner, has to stay at the Lorraine Hotel which was not up to standards. 
   Baseball has come a long way. The Negro Leagues did a lot to give entertainment to Negroes and Caucasians who went to those games, and gave players an opportunity to play. And it is unfortunate they had to exist, but they did. They gave these players a great opportunity, from Josh Gibson, the great catcher, Satchel Paige, Buck O'Neal, and so many others who are enshrined in the Hall of Fame in Kansas City where there is a Negro League Baseball museum. But they also gave this country the opportunity to look at segregation for what it was, stupid, ignorant, retarded, and gave a process by which we overcame. 
   Sports have been a great vehicle to overcome discrimination and prejudice, and it was done in baseball, through heroic works by Branch Rickey, heroic at the time of Jackie Robinson who took all kinds of taunts. Now there is a Hall of Fame and there are players in there of both races, and you get there by talent. And that needs to happen all throughout this society and all throughout this country. 
   I was pleased to bring this resolution because of my experience with Minnie Minoso, my love of baseball, and the fact that baseball gave me an exposure to the horrors of segregation and what it did to my hero and a man who was kind to me through the years, Minnie  Minoso. But there were so many others. I went to games at Martin Stadium in Memphis, which is the home of the Memphis Red Sox, and it was all Negro players. They were great players. They didn't get an opportunity to show their skills. They later did. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support House Res. 162, recognizing the contributions of the Negro Baseball League, but at the same time reflect on how sad it was that there had to be a Negro Baseball League, and to reflect upon the need to make amends, not just to African Americans who were enslaved by this country's laws and limited and punished and enslaved by Jim Crow laws, but at the same time to think about the greatness of our country and mend a fault and a tear in our Constitution and our soul and civic justice, and put it together and apologize for slavery and Jim Crow, and make our country more whole and do the right thing. When you are wrong, you apologize. When you do evil, you do apologize, and you move forward. They are different bills, and I hate to mix them, but they are all part of the same story. 
   America needs to move forward, and progress has been made. We need to appreciate the past, but see where we were and move forward. And I am honored to be with the other sponsors of this bill, I think there are hundreds of them, and recognize the contributions of the Negro Baseball League and the story that baseball has played, and ask everybody in America to pay attention on March 31 to the final exhibition game of the season which will be televised on ESPN, a civil rights game that will highlight the civil rights heroes through sports, where Julian Bond will speak at a luncheon at the Peabody Hotel and tell a story of integration and success through sports that came too late in this country's history.

   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, our pastor today was Pastor W. James Thomas, II. 
   Pastor Thomas is God's visionary for Shiloh Church of Memphis, located in Memphis, Tennessee. Serving as pastor since 1994, his consistent obedience to God has taken the Shiloh congregation from glory to glory. The membership has grown from 75 to 600 and counting. During these years, Pastor Thomas has been preaching and teaching God's uncompromising Word with a boldness that has changed the lives of the people at Shiloh and throughout the country. 
   To accommodate the vision and growth of the church membership, Pastor Thomas led the congregation in the acquisition of a 19,000 square foot worship and educational facility in 1998. In  2003, the sanctuary was completely renovated and office complex expanded. 
   Spiritually, Pastor Thomas was saved and received much of his spiritual development in the Church of God in Christ. He was called to the ministry at the age of 14 and began pastoring at the age of 18 in Knoxville, Tennessee. He graduated cum laude from Crichton College in Memphis with a bachelor of science degree in Biblical studies and is currently a candidate for the master of divinity degree. He has also attended and received degrees from Harvard University and Yale University, where he had completed the first Graduate School of Theological Studies' special intensive course at Harvard Divinity School in Cambridge and the Yale School of Divinity in September 2006. 
   He's very active in our community in Memphis, Tennessee. He is married to Minister Antonia R. Thomas, who serves alongside him in the ministry. And even possibly as important or more important than this congregation, he has two children. One is Private First Class Reginald Cleveland, who is an officer and security person for this Chamber, from Memphis, Tennessee, who is here today; and he has a daughter in middle school. 
   I appreciate Pastor Thomas serving the United States House of Representatives as our pastor this morning.

Mr. Speaker, I think it has well been addressed here the dangers that this side of the aisle and possibly some well-meaning folks on the other side of the aisle have about the encroachment on the Constitution that this bill will have. What it basically does is take judges out of the process. When we fear judges, we have got a real problem in this country, and from a court that routinely approves all requests made of it, the FISA court. 
   On our walls enshrined forever are the words of Judge Lewis Brandeis in 1928. Judge Brandeis said: ``The greatest danger to liberty lurks in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning, but without understanding.'' 
   The greatest danger to liberty lurks in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning, without understanding. I am afraid in Attorney General Gonzales we have somebody without understanding and maybe not even well-meaning. And the problem is, he should resign, because he is jeopardizing the security of this country, because the people of this country and most of the Members of this Congress don't trust him with additional powers. He should resign.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I had the opportunity about a month ago to visit Iraq. When I did, I traveled on a C-130 with troops into Baghdad and drove in a Humvee through the city with our troops. 
   While there, I made the decision that I would do everything I could to support the troops. The troops are giving all they can; and because of that, whichever side of the aisle you sit on, you need to support the troops and support the veterans funding bill that's coming before this House, in whatever manner it comes, because the troops come first. 
   This veterans bill gives veterans the increases in medical care, in benefits for veterans and increases in their pay and increases for the soldiers' salaries that they need. This veterans bill is important. 
   When we were in Qatar, the general there, General North, said, Do one thing when you go home, don't forget the troops, don't forget the veterans who have been injured, and fund them and fund their veterans bill. 
   No matter how it is presented, we should support the veterans and vote for the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. COHEN. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady from Colorado for her efforts on this issue which are so important to America. 
   Mr. Speaker, when I think of stem cell research, I think of Ronald Reagan slumbering through the twilight of his life with Alzheimer's, and I think of Christopher Reeve, Superman, laid low by paralysis and the host of physical ailments that accompany paralysis. Those are images we all share in our national consciousness. 
   When I think of my father's struggles with Alzheimer's, I think how science might one day through stem cell research find a way to prevent others from suffering as he did and as my mother did as his caretaker. 
   Many people like to frame the stem cell debate as pro-life and pro-choice. For Ronald Reagan and Christopher Reeve, the question was a matter that they had no choice in. And for each public face of a political leader or a movie star, there are thousands of ordinary citizens like my father who suffer daily from diseases for which there are no cures. 
   My hometown, Memphis, Tennessee, is the proud home of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. St. Jude is the patron saint of forgotten and impossible causes. Saint Jude's Hospital has given hope where no hope existed. It has made possible the impossible. This is because St. Jude is a research hospital focused on medical advancement. 
   Let us each remember that science is our friend, not our foe, and we must embrace science. The issue of stem cell research should not be a political football tossed about with callous disregard for the very real suffering of people with Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, spinal cord injuries, cancer, stroke, burns, heart disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. We must not tie the hands of scientists and physicians with the bureaucracy and red tape. We must commit ourselves to the health of our citizenry. Like St. Jude, we must remember the forgotten, and we must have the vision to see possibilities in what appears impossible. 
   I ask all of my Members to join in voting for this bill.

   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, during the break, I was home in my district in  Memphis, Tennessee, and I spoke to 40 soldiers who had been to the Middle East. They were being honored. I asked many of them if they wanted to return. Most, nearly all, said, ``No. Why are we there and what are we accomplishing?'' 
   I asked groups about their thoughts, and almost to a one, they said, ``Bring the troops home; don't stay the course.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I would submit to the President that he went to war under Donald Rumsfeld's opinion that you fight the war with the troops you have got. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that the President should support the troops with the bill that the Congress sends him. We have sent him a bill that supports the troops, supports the veterans and, yet, brings our troops home. We must end this foolishness in Iraq, the loss of American lives and the spending of our tax dollars in a country where we are not wanted.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, conditions on the ground in Iraq are not getting any better. In fact, things are getting worse. 
   During a 48-hour period last week, 14 of our soldiers were killed, and then over the weekend another eight were killed in one day. April and May were two of the most violent months for our troops since the beginning of the war. It is clear the President's troop surge or escalation plan is not working. In fact, last week General David Petraeus acknowledged there would not be any significant improvements in Iraq by September. 
   Why is that significant? Because that's when President Bush said we would be able to see if the plan was working. The fact is we won't know in September because it's not working, according to the President's own general. 
   Then this week, two respected Republican Senators, Senator Lugar and Senator Voinovich, said the current policy is not working and a significant change is needed. The comments of these Senators, coupled with those of General Petraeus, should serve as a wake-up call to congressional Republicans. Join us in ending this war, bringing our troops home, and saving America's face.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, it's a bit confusing sometimes to listen to the rhetoric. The Republicans have had the Presidency now for nearly 8 years, and they have had the majority in this House since 1994, I think. And if you watched the Republican convention, you would think they were the Democrats talking about change and the problems we have in Washington. They're so against Washington, it's the Washington they have created and cultivated. And the corruption that we've seen here has mostly been on that particular side of the aisle. The failure of our having a children's health plan, which this country should have as a cornerstone of its policy, was the fault of the Republican side that was more interested in tobacco interests than children's interests. And too many times we see the corporate interests of the oil corporations take over the interests of the American society and getting us to be truly energy independent. 
   I submit to you, Mr. Speaker, that the parties have differences, but if you want change, you want the Democratic Party. BARACK OBAMA was a community organizer like Jesus, whom our minister prayed about. Pontius Pilate was a Governor.

   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I am astonished at what I have heard from the other side of the aisle: disingenuous talk about great deficit; the deficit caused by the Republican majority's work or lack of work over the last 12 years; giving tax breaks to the rich while sending our troops to a war that has cost us half a trillion dollars and approaching a trillion dollars. That is where the deficit has come from, and this disingenuous talk is shocking to hear. 
   And the admission that they are against giving children of middle-class families health care. The Republican party, Mr. Speaker, used to say they cared about the middle class. Now they say they don't want to give health benefits to their children. That is amazing. And doctors, who used to be one of their main interest groups, would get reimbursement that they are entitled so that they can continue to participate in Medicare under this plan, and they oppose that. 
   I would ask you to look at the wall and Daniel Webster, who says, engraved in stone here: Do something of monumental proportions. Do something that generations will remember, something great. 
   That is what this bill will do. I am happy to be here in support of the CHAMP bill. Hubert Humphrey was a champion of children, and I am happy to stand here for him.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, some time ago this House passed the Hate Crime Bill, and I was one of the sponsors and one of the supporters. Since that time, there has been a group of right-winged evangelical Republicans, national in scale, who have tried to influence preachers in my district, particularly African American preachers, and make them think that that bill will somehow quell their first amendment rights to speak what they think about the Bible and about people's conduct. That's not true whatsoever. That bill contained in it an amendment by ARTUR DAVIS that said this in no way affects anybody's first amendment right, and it doesn't. That Hate Crime Bill affects acts of violence, not acts of thought or speech; never has in this country's history and never will. 
   There are the Ten Commandments that we have and we've honored for many years, and one of the Commandments is, ``Thou shalt not bear false witness.'' Well, in Memphis, Tennessee, that group has borne false witness in trying to question the Hate Crimes Bill and the votes of the Members of this House and, hopefully, the Senate when they pass that bill. It only affects violence, and violence aimed at any group is wrong. And if it's aimed at a group to intimidate, it's even more wrong.

   When you look at the laws and the type of activities that we are looking at, discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, or disabilities, you are looking at the same people that the Nazis tried to exterminate. If you were Jewish, if you were black, if you were disabled, if you were gay, the Nazis made a systematic attempt to eliminate you. And people who do that, even if they are not governments, should be punished, because that is the type of conduct that this world has seen and abhors and went to war for; and our U.S. attorneys should be given the ammunition to go to war against people that perpetrate those type of crimes. 
   And if you stand against this, what's going to happen? Certain villainous hooligans will maybe get less time. These are the people we need to lock up and put away, because this is a country about life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness and everybody gets an opportunity.

<DOCNO>Mr. COHEN. (DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. -- (House of Representatives - January 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, the subject of my Special Order today is the birthday of one of America's greatest citizens, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
   Dr. King's birthday will be celebrated next week with the national holiday on Monday, one of the only men or women to have a holiday named for them in this country. At one time, of course, we celebrated the birthdays of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, and now we celebrate Presidents Day. But we celebrate Dr. King's Day, a great American and an individual who changed this country for the better and whose life is a testament to fortitude and courage, faith, and a desire to make America better. 
   On April 4, 1968, 40 years ago this year, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated in my hometown of Memphis, Tennessee. That was a defining moment in the history of America, indeed, in the history of the world. While Dr. King's death should not and will not ever be forgotten, I think that today on what would have been his 79th  birthday, we should remember his life because it was his life, his actions and his eloquent words, that truly challenged us as a Nation to consider where we were and where we could go. 
   Martin Luther King, Jr. was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 15, 1929, the son of the Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr. and Alberta King. As we all know, Dr. King followed in his father's footsteps and became a minister at the age of 24 in Montgomery, Alabama, where just 2 years later Rosa Parks refused to comply with the Jim Crow laws, which required her to give up her seat on the bus to a white man. The subsequent Montgomery Bus Boycott, led by Rev. King, changed America. The boycott lasted over a year but resulted in the Supreme Court decision outlawing racial discrimination on public transportation. Only in his mid-20s, Martin Luther King's passion and commitment were already affecting the laws of our Nation. 
   During his life, Dr. King's house was bombed and his government wiretapped his conversations. But Dr. King never wavered from his commitment to nonviolent change. Dr. King turned a mirror on America, and the reflection was not good. It was ugly. America was not the land of the free but it was a land built by the enslaved. The very Capitol Building in which I speak and in which we make our laws was built by slaves. Dr. King pulled back the quasi-fiction that has so often been touted as patriotism as if to say, ``but what about these Americans?'' And those are his words: ``But what about these Americans?'' Jim Crow laws, which had created two Americas, which had denied access and opportunity for so long were held up for examination, and they failed the examination, as they should have. 
   We are not there, ladies and gentlemen. I wish we were. I wish we had achieved the dream where the content of one's character is what each person is judged by, not by the color of one's skin. We are not there, but the good news, the positive message that Dr. King has etched into our national conscience is that one man can make a difference. One young man can step forward and live his life with purpose and dignity, can become the voice of all those whose voices have been stilled, whose hope has been lost. No assassin's bullet could stop what Martin Luther King had begun. Today, as we celebrate a birth which has changed us and which continues to challenge us, let us remember his dream. 
   Dr. King's words are what he's best remembered for. And in his hometown of Memphis, Tennessee, his words will be played constantly over the weekend and through Monday as we remember how he challenged us, how he inspired us in the 1950s and in the 1960s. Radio station WLOK will be, I know, having a tribute to him in Memphis, and other places all over the country will do the same. And in Memphis there will be a basketball game, a national basketball game, that will celebrate civil rights victories of this country. Particularly Bob Lanier will be there and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and others. And we look at the steps which we have taken in this country to make the country better through sports and basketball, and I commend David Stern and the NBA for having that game in Memphis on Dr. King's birthday. 
   At this time I would like to read some quotes from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., as will be read and as will be heard throughout this country in the coming week and the coming weekend. Many of them resonate with the issues of today. 
   ``A genuine leader is not a searcher for consensus but a molder of consensus.'' And we need more leaders like that today who mold consensus. 
   ``A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual doom.'' Remember, Mr. 
   Speaker, Dr. King was speaking during the time of the Vietnam War. We have another Vietnam, I think, today in Iraq, and we are spending more money not on military defense but on military offense and leaving programs of social importance behind. And I question the spirituality of where this country presently is, spending so much in Iraq and so little in America. 
   ``A right delayed is a right denied.'' And there are so many rights which have not been granted to people and not just on the basis of race and religion and national origin but also of sexual orientation. ``A right delayed,'' Dr. King said, ``is a right denied.'' 
   Dr. King said, ``Almost always the creative, dedicated minority has made the world better.'' And indeed they have. We are a country of minorities making for a great majority, and when we don't respect the rights of the minorities, we endanger ourselves. 
   Dr. King said, ``An individual has not started living until he can rise above the narrow confines of his individualistic concerns to the broader concerns of all humanity.'' And I would ask each of my colleagues to hold that thought in their minds when they vote and to realize it's not just the nature of their districts and their individual concerns which are important but the broader concerns of this country, as Dr. King said, ``the broader concerns of all humanity.'' 
   Dr. King said, ``An individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice is in reality expressing the highest respect for the law.'' 
   Dr. King and many civil rights workers violated the law, the law of the country, mostly in the South, Jim Crow laws, that said people were separate and inherently unequal. He did that with Rosa Parks when they challenged the laws that said African Americans were to ride on the back of the bus. And he challenged, along with President Johnson and this Nation in the 1960s, the law that said there could be separate establishments and would be by law for people based on race for entertainment, different public facilities, eating establishments, hotels and motels, colleges and schools. Those were wrong laws. They needed to be challenged, and they were challenged by Dr. King and many civil rights leaders, and the world changed in the 1960s. 
   Dr. King said, ``At the center of nonviolence stands the principle of love.'' He also said, ``Have we not come to such an impasse in the modern world that we must love our enemies or else? The chain reaction of evil, hate begetting hate, wars producing more wars, must be broken or else we shall be plunged into the dark abyss of annihilation.'' And, Mr. Speaker, I reflect on this when I think about what we are doing in the Middle East. Hate begets hate. Wars produce more wars. And we are in an abyss. 
   Dr. King said, ``He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.'' One must actively oppose evil. And oftentimes in the debates in Congress, you have to remember Dante, and Dr. King has a quote similar to Dante, that the warmest spots in hell are reserved for people who in times of controversy stand on the sidelines. Certainly something Dr. King did not do. 
   In Dr. King's great speech just outside the Capitol on the mall, which I recall watching on television and which I am thrilled to be a Member of this House of Representatives so near to the mall where Dr. King gave his ``I have a dream'' speech, he said, ``I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a Nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. 
   ``I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together. 
   ``I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.'' 
   As I said earlier, Dr. King's dream has not totally been achieved, but we are getting closer to it. We are engaged in a Presidential debate where his words and actions are subject of much debate. But I have no doubt that Dr. King would be proud of all the candidates in the Democratic column who are running for this office and know that they are children of Dr. King's dream. To see an African American gentleman have a legitimate chance to be President of the United States and to see a woman have that same opportunity is what Dr. King talked about.  And they should be judged not by the color of their skin or by their gender but by the content of their character. 
   ``Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,'' Dr. King said. And that's something to be remembered when we see nooses hung in small towns or people being shot, tied behind cars because of aspects of their personage of which they had no choice. 
   ``It may be true,'' Dr. King said, ``that the law cannot make a man love me, but it can keep him from lynching me, and I think that's pretty important.'' And that is important. We have a Senate and a House that passed a condemnation of the lynching that took place in this country in the 20th century. And this House, hopefully, will pass another proposition that says that we apologize for having been part of a Nation that allowed for slavery to occur and had laws that permitted it and for Jim Crow laws that saddled this country with unjustice for 100 years thereafter. 
   Dr. King said, ``Life's most persistent and urgent question is what are you doing for others?'' And that's a question that my friend Irbin Salky has often said to me, that the purpose of why we are here on Earth is to help others. And it's part of the Judeo-Christian religion and creed to care for others, and that's why we are here. 
   Again, Iraq and Vietnam, they are parallels, and Dr. King's words ring true today. He said, ``One of the greatest casualties of the war in Vietnam is the Great Society shot down on the battlefield of Vietnam.''     
   Indeed, many of the hopes of people in our inner cities, people that are left behind by what has been considered a great economic opportunity for many Americans, mostly the richest, have been left behind because of the moneys we have spent in Iraq rather than spending them on the people in this country. 
   There are many parallels, and I think I know where Dr. King would be on the issue of war and peace, on the issue of choosing Iraq rather than choosing America, the cities that have been neglected, the inner cities, Appalachia, Katrina victims, and others. Dr. King said: ``The moral arc of the universe bends at the elbow of justice.'' He always felt that the arc was bending in the right direction, although slowly. And justice and change do move slowly but they do move. We have change. Change is not revolutionary; it's evolutionary. It happens, but it happens in increments. But Dr. King and people like him made it move at a stronger pace, and it's necessary to have agents of change. Agents of change have moved the society forward. 
   One of the most prophetic quotes that I think I saw, and there are so many to review in thinking about Dr. King, he said: ``The Negro needs the white man to free him from his fears. The white man needs the Negro to free him from his guilt.'' I know from my sponsorship of an apology for slavery and Jim Crow and some of the comments I have read, there's a lot of guilt in this country and it's making it difficult for people to engage in a dialog and understand and honestly see what slavery did for many people's lives. Not only did it cause the African Americans and have them be enslaved, but it caused a lot of people to make a lot of money and have a lot of great economic fortune at the expense of the enslaved, and then of the Jim Crow citizen that served their needs for 100 years. 
   The quality, not the longevity, of one's life is what is important. I think about Martin Luther King, who died at the age of 39; I think of John Kennedy, who served in this House and lived to the age of 46; I think of his brother, Robert Kennedy, who died at age 42, but affected so many of us. All of these three men affected me in a great way. Their assassinations in 1963 and 1968 affected this world, but it affected me in a great way. It was the quality, not the longevity, of their lives that was important. And they didn't wait for tomorrow. They had the fierce urgency of now that Dr. King talked about to make a change, to make a change and a difference while they were on this Earth and to affect their fellow man and fellow woman. 
   ``The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.'' Once again, Dr. King implores us to have moral character and fiber and to stand up for what is important for America. And he said: ``We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools.'' 
   Dr. Martin Luther King was a special man. He took his talents and he used them for his fellow man. He inspired us all. This country and this world is much the greater for his life. It is indeed a testament to him that this Congress under the unyielding leadership of Representative JOHN CONYERS passed a bill to make his birthday a national holiday. It's a national holiday that should be held in high esteem by all men and women in this country, because Dr. King was special and unique and stood up for all people and stood for the height of American ideals. 
   I hope that everybody will take a moment over the weekend and on Monday on the celebration of his birthday to think about some of the things that Dr. King stood for: challenging the system to make it better; for peace; for people who have been left behind in our society; doing for the least of these and trying to make the world a better place. 
   My city bears great scars for his death having taken place there. There was nothing unique to my city. It was something wrong with this country that somebody out there put a reward up for Dr. King's death and that somebody wanted to claim that reward and didn't have a regard for the humanity of Dr. King. In Memphis now there's a National Civil Rights Museum dedicated to the civil rights movement and to Dr. King's life and ideals, and I invite and encourage everyone to come to Memphis to visit the civil rights museum, which is at the spot where Dr. King was killed at the Lorraine Motel, which has been preserved, and to celebrate his life and to celebrate his values, not only on his birthday but on every day, for Dr. King was a great American. I am just lucky, as we all are, that he came my way. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the time, and I know that you, like me, will reflect on Dr. King's works and will keep him in our hearts as we try to do what's right for America in this 110th Congress.

   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about a gentleman who was Army Specialist Ervin Caradine, Jr. 
   Mr. Caradine would have been 36 years old today if he had lived. He was from my hometown of Memphis, Tennessee where we have lost nine veterans. He joined the Army to provide a better life for his family. He had graduated from Fairley High School and worked his way up to being a manager at the Steak-Out Restaurant in Memphis. He had a wife and he had four children. 
   Three years ago to this day, Army Specialist Ervin Caradine, Jr., died. He was in a convoy in Baghdad that was hit by an IED 3 years ago. Three days before his death, he called his wife and she said there was a change in his voice. He said, ``It's getting worse over here, it's not getting better.'' 
   Since then, nearly 3,000 more soldiers have died. Army Specialist Ervin Caradine, Jr., said something 3 years and 3 days ago that is still true: It's getting worse over here, it's not better.

   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Davis and particularly Congresswoman McCarthy for bringing H.R. 998. 
   I do represent Memphis, Tennessee, and much of the civil rights history of Memphis, for better and for worse purposes, have occurred in my district. It is important that the history of that struggle be maintained to teach people about the courageous struggle, the leadership that many, many people had to embark on to achieve their rights that should have been part of 18th century America, but the 18th century America was not complete, and all men were not created equal. Certainly women weren't created equal either, and people had to fight and risk their lives to attain rights for people who today are beneficiaries thereof. 
   In my community, many of these heroes of the civil rights movement have been dying lately. They're getting old. This bill I wish would have come earlier, but I really thank Representative McCarthy for bringing it. It's a start. And there are people like the great Reverend Benjamin Hooks, who's getting up in his years but who's got many stories to tell, and Russell Sugarman. We lost Mr. Ernest Withers, a great photographer of the civil rights movement, this past year. 
   Time goes by for all of us, and the opportunities to collect history become more difficult as each day passes. 
   So I'm proud to speak on behalf of this, but mostly as a Congressperson from the Ninth District in Tennessee, I want to express my appreciation to Representative McCarthy for having the leadership to bring this and for initiating this process.

<DOCNO>Mr. COHEN. (CELEBRATING 75 YEARS OF EFFECTIVE STATE-BASED ALCOHOL REGULATION -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res 415, which celebrates 75 years of successful State-based alcohol regulation. 
   I want to commend the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Coble) for introducing this measure. It's the same as H. Con. Res 341, introduced by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Stupak), which has 98 bipartisan cosponsors, and S. Res. 551, introduced by the senior Senator from Montana, Senator Baucus, which has 14 cosponsors, also in a bipartisan manner. 
   Seventy-five years ago--nearly to the day--on December 5, 1933, the 21st amendment to the Constitution of this country was passed. It repealed prohibition, a great mistake in the social era in this country, and the 21st amendment was ratified by the people in constitutional form. It brought an end to a misguided experiment and ushered in a new system of legal regulation of alcohol beverages. Previously, we had an illegal system that encouraged organized crime and worked against the public's wishes. 
   Section 2 of that amendment states that ``the transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors in violations of the laws thereof is hereby prohibited.'' The effect of section 2 was to entrust regulation of alcoholic beverages to the States. 
   Under the 21st amendment, and the terms of the Webb-Kenyon Act which implemented it, States have done an outstanding job exercising their primary authority to regulate this industry composed of producers, importers, wholesale distributors and retailers, often dubbed the ``three tier system'' by such knowledgeable and legendary individuals as Tom Hensley. 
   This has been a successful approach, and we have not had occasion to reconsider it. It is a system that provides transparency and accountability. It is one that prizes public safety in which the industry works with State lawmakers--of which I was one for 24 years and served on the State and local government committee in Tennessee that had the responsibility of ensuring that the three-tier system worked and the public was protected. 
   Public health officials and law enforcement people also worked on this to provide quality products to consumers and ensure the responsible use of alcoholic beverages. Through this partnership with the Federal Government, we have pursued efforts to eliminate alcohol abuse, underage drinking, drunk driving, and other problems associated with the abuse of alcoholic beverages. 
   I commend Mr. Stupak of Michigan and Mr. Coble of North Carolina for their leadership on this resolution, which commemorates the end of a failed experiment, prohibition, and the establishment of a system that served the citizens of this Nation well for over three-quarters of a century. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. COHEN. I appreciate Mr. Coble's and Mr. Smith's comments. 
   Mr. Smith, of course, comes from a city in Texas that my predecessor, the Congressman from West Tennessee in the 1800s--Davy Crockett--went to. Unfortunately, it was the last city that Congressman Davy Crockett went to. I was noticing, in going through the Halls here, that Sam Houston, who left my State, went to be Governor of your State. So Texas and Tennessee have a lot in common. If it weren't for Tennessee, we probably wouldn't have a Texas, so it's wonderful to work with you today on this particular resolution. 
   As I look around the Chamber here, there are great lawmakers, including Moses and Moses Maimonides. In Tennessee, we have a Bob Moses who had a lot to do with this three-tiered system, and he did a lot of work on it. 
   We don't have any further speakers. I'd like to inquire as to how many more speakers the gentleman from Texas might have.

   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, last June 6 I voted for a hate crimes bill in this session, and was proud to do it. Since that time, the black ministers association in my city has come out strongly against the hate crimes bill that provides protection to people against violent crimes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I addressed that group in Memphis Tuesday a week ago, and at that meeting one of the ministers got up and said to the press, ``The reason we're against this bill basically is because a white man can't represent black people.'' 
   I represent a black district. I am one of only two Members that do. I plan to represent my people, as I have, and show this country from my district in Memphis, Tennessee, that regardless of race or color, a person should be judged by the content of their character and not the color of their skin, and they can represent people in this country, for this is indeed one country under God, with liberty and justice for all. 
   We recently celebrated in my city the 50th anniversary of the 1957 civil rights bill and will have the 40th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. King. That event will be in Memphis, Tennessee. 
   We've come a long way, and we have a long way to go.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, it's my privilege and honor to speak on behalf of this bill. 
   The New York Times and many of the other leading publications of this country has said this is something that this Congress needs to do to correct an inequity, a wrong. When there's a wrong in law, there's always a right; and when it's not one that the courts have righted, it's the duty of the legislative body to right it if it's something that's in the public good. 
   Indeed, when there's discrimination in the workplace in pay and disparity, as there has been for years with women, for years we've known 69 cents is what a woman earns for every dollar, and when women are discriminated against doing the same job as a male, it's wrong and it needs to be changed. 
   And so I think this legislation is appropriately brought before us to correct a wrong when the courts didn't, and I'm pleased to speak on behalf of it. I will be pleased to vote for it, and I am thankful that Mr. Miller and Mr. McGovern brought this and thank them for bringing it to the House of Representatives

   Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, on Monday evening, the President hosted a holiday party for Members of Congress and others. A good time was had by all. It was a wonderful time and the President was a marvelous host, but I had to think in that moment about the holiday spirit and the idea of giving and caring for people who need something and providing for them. 
   I asked the President at that time to use some of his compassionate conservatism to help us get through this budget. There are people that need help with their heating bills this winter. There are people that need policemen and protection for their neighborhoods. There are people who have problems with illnesses in their families, whether it be cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes or heart disease, which research dollars could help them with. There are people that need help with Head Start and education in this country and children that need health care. 
   Madam Speaker, I think in this Christmas season we ought to think about why we're here, who we should be helping and what we ought to be doing. Part of it is helping others and people who need a little bit more. The President was elected on an idea of compassionate conservatism. It's time to be compassionate. Part of that is being compassionate to take care of people here in America. 
   Bring it home, Mr. President.

<DOCNO>Mr. COHEN. (CONDEMNATION OF NOOSE INTIMIDATION -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman and Mr. Green for bringing this legislation. 
   It is my honor to serve on the House Judiciary Committee, where this matter had a hearing. It is unfortunate that in 2007 we have to have a hearing on such matters, but as Mr. Baca, Mr. Cummings and others have so well expressed, these are symbols of racial hatred, of intolerance and intimidation and oppressive factors, trying to intimidate people into not exercising their rights. Predominantly, these have been used against African Americans, but also against other ethnic minorities. 
   Growing up, one of the stories I heard about many times was a man named Leo Frank. Leo Frank was accused and unjustly convicted of a crime in Georgia, taken out of his jail in 1915 in Marietta, Georgia, and hung by an angry mob. Mr. Frank was later found by the courts and the Georgia system of justice to have been illegally, improperly convicted and was given a posthumous pardon, but a little too late. 
   As with so many incidences with lynchings throughout the South against different minorities that people didn't understand and they showed their ignorance by employing vigilante tactics to take the law into their own hands, this couldn't be rectified, because Mr. Frank was dead. 
   This was an unfortunate part of our history. The Klan was a part of it, but there were people beyond the Klan that engaged in it. And rather than being like the Statue of Liberty and welcoming people to this country, this great land of opportunity where people could pursue happiness and enjoy freedom, the symbol of the noose has told people you are not welcome, you are not to exercise your rights, and you should be weary of trying to speak up and exercise your first amendment rights and be what America is all about. 
   This legislation needs to pass. When nooses are displayed, they are anti-American. They need to be investigated for criminal enforcement by our Justice Department, and they will, with this resolution's passage. I thank Mr. Green for bringing it. I want to say that, unfortunately, in my jurisdiction in Memphis, there was a situation in Germantown, Tennessee, where three people at the Germantown Performing Arts Center recently in August put a noose out. They were fired. They should have been prosecuted as well. The noose does not belong in America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Berman for bringing this legislation. 
   It is obvious we need such a bill, for America should never be a haven for people who commit crimes against mankind. And that is what genocide is, a crime against mankind. It is ironic that God's rightest creature, human beings, are the only species that God created that commits genocide. Animals attack each other out of need for food or for other reasons, but not to destroy and kill an entire other group of animals. Only man, with his ability to think, can create the most unhuman-like crime against mankind, which is the attempt to kill others because of ethnic differences. That is an irony and a shame. And the fact is that we should never be a country that does anything but try to make this world a better place. People should not find America a harbor when they escape from the area, whether it be Darfur or Rwanda or any other place where genocide has been committed. 
   As a Jewish person, I have known about genocide because we know about the Holocaust and Jewish people have had relatives and possible would-be relatives if our ancestors had not emigrated to this country who would have been victims of this Holocaust or who were. So many of us have been to the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, or other places or concentration camps and learned. 
   I would submit that this bill, as the previous bill about nooses, should make a strong statement from this Congress, Mr. Speaker, but to the American people and the educators of this country that what we need in this country is more education about tolerance, more education about the horrors that we have had in the past in history. Because if you don't learn from history, you will repeat it again. And here we are, almost 2008, talking about genocide and nooses and oppressive tactics used by groups to intimidate religious and ethnic minorities and people of different backgrounds. 
   I commend the authors for bringing the bill, and it is a bipartisan bill and that is what we need, but there are so many other aspects that we need to look into. 
   Elie Wiesel, who was cited just recently by a Member on the other side, said that people who hate, hate everyone. People who hate Jews hate blacks, hate Hispanics, hate gays. 
   We have had hate crimes come up in this Congress that have passed and hopefully we will have a hate crime that passes, because hate in any form, whether it is racial, religious, or sexual orientation is just that, it is hate, and it is un-American and it is something unfortunately unique to humankind that should be stamped out and abolished in this country, and this Congress should not allow it, countenance it, or in any way condone it. 
   And so I thank the chairman and Mr. Berman for their leadership and the other people who have worked on this bill, Mr. Forbes and others, and we should work together in a bipartisan fashion to make this country what it is supposed to be, and that is an area where we can work together and hopefully one day have the Age of Aquarius and a place where we don't have these problems that we have had in the past.

   Robin Williams had an album at one time, ``Reality, What a Concept.'' I thought about it while I was there. I saw a lot of reality. I saw our soldiers in life-and-death situations and doing it in a heroic fashion. They told me about their need to be redeployed over there not every 15 months, but every 12 months because the pressure is wearing on them and on their personal lives. The divorce rate is high, and it really takes a toll on their lives. They see the people working for the private companies over there making so much more money than them, the contractors, and they say, why should we re-enlist. But they do it because they're proud Americans. 
   But then we met with Prime Minister Maliki, and he said the sectarian war was over. Well, Prime Minister Maliki, it's not, and until the Iraqis deal with reality and deal with the Sunni and Shia differences, there won't be peace in Iraq and our soldiers will be working for a group that doesn't understand the problem, which is their own internal politics.

   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 2881, the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act of 2007, which would authorize $66 billion for Federal aviation programs. 
   This legislation would provide for the Airport Improvement Program, for FAA facilities and equipment to accelerate the implementation of NextGen, which will enable the FAA to replace and repair existing air traffic control facilities and equipment, as well as to provide for the development of high priority safety-related systems. 
   I must say, however, Mr. Chairman, that I'm extremely disappointed that this legislation includes language that would abolish 80 years of legislative and legal precedent by allowing FedEx Express workers to unionize under the National Labor Relations Act, as opposed to the Railway Labor Act which has traditionally covered all airline employees. And the Ninth Circuit United States District Court in California has reemphasized that, and it's the law of the land. 
   FedEx Express is the largest employer and economic driving force of the city of Memphis, which is predominantly the Ninth Congressional District, which I represent. 
   This provision raises a number of questions and concerns regarding the consequences of this precedent for other carrier employees and employers, and it could have been addressed during a hearing on the subject. Unfortunately, in a marked departure from T&I Subcommittee's normal practice, no hearings were held on this issue. 
   Mr. Chairman, I speak in opposition to FedEx Express language, not as an opponent of workers' rights to collective bargaining, but as an advocate of what I believe are the best economic interests of Tennessee's Ninth Congressional District and this Nation, which needs a steady stream of interstate commerce provided through the Railway Labor Act. 
   However, I signed on as an original cosponsor of this legislation because I support the vast majority of its provisions, including the language added by Aviation Subcommittee Chairman Costello, which provides for consumer rights, environmental and noise concerns, safety issues and flight attendant, air traffic controller and pilot work conditions. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the committee chairman and the Aviation Subcommittee chairman, as well as the committee ranking members for their hard work on this bill in bringing together an effective measure that includes input from a great number of expert stakeholders across the airline industry. The overall content of this bill is sound, and I believe the few provisions about which I remain concerned will be addressed in the conference. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

   The President is supposed to be vetoing the CHIP bill today which would give health care to children. That's not in the spirit of St. Nick or, I believe, in the tradition of the Christian religion or the Judeo-Christian religions. Nor is it in that same spirit that we would take away from people that need help with college education, with health care, and with research for diseases, and for responsible fiscal policies and for taking care of God's Earth.

When our country was founded, African Americans were slaves, and even after slavery ended in 1865, Jim Crow laws and others passed by this Congress and States didn't allow African Americans full privileges until about the 1960s.

<DOCNO>Mr. COHEN. (KENNETH T. WHALUM, SR. POST OFFICE -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2587, which would designate the postal facility at 555 South 3rd Street Lobby in Memphis, Tennessee, as the Kenneth T. Whalum, Sr. Post Office building. For a man who gave so many years to this facility and to the postal service, I cannot imagine a more fitting tribute. 
   I'm not sure if post offices in this country have been named in honor of people who worked in those facilities. If so, there have been very few. Most are named for political figures, war heroes. Kenneth Whalum was a political figure, a clergyman of great renown, but also a man who spent a career in the postal service and was respected by the rank-and-file and rose to prominence in the postal service. 
   For those reasons particularly, I think it's most fitting that this building be named for this gentleman as an  inspiration to the other employees at the postal service and to the postal service nationally. 
   Kenneth Twigg Whalum, Sr., was born to H.D. Whalum, Sr., and Thelma Twigg Whalum March 23, 1934. His lifelong dedication and service to the people of Memphis is matched by few others. He served in the United States Navy from 1950-1954 and was a Reservist until 1959. He worked for the United States Postal Service in various human resources capacities, eventually becoming the director of personnel for the main Memphis post office and director of employee relations for the southern region. He also served in Michigan, I believe, in Representative Conyers' district in the postal service as well. He served as a Memphis city councilman from 1988-1996. 
   And not only did he serve on the Memphis City Council, he was special. He's been special in everything he's ever done. He was first elected as a district councilman of the City of Memphis from the Orange Mound community, but dissatisfied with the representation of one of the at-large members, a Caucasian. Kenneth Whalum, an African American, ran for an at-large position, and he, like Myron Lowery, also African American, became the first two African Americans elected at-large to the Memphis City Council with a majority vote of the people, at a time when the City of Memphis was not majority African American. 
   His victory is a testament to his fortitude to give up a safe district seat to win an at-large seat, knowing that it meant more representation for issues of which he championed, and the fact that he risked his safe seat to make progress on progressive issues and put a progressive in that at-large position. 
   Rev. Whalum is well-respected as a man of faith in his community as well. He played a key role in convincing an alliance of local ministers to bring Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to Memphis, the city, my hometown, in which we all know he would give one of his most famous, yet ultimately final speeches. In 1969, Olivet Baptist Church called upon Kenneth Whalum to serve the people as senior pastor, a position he held until 1999. During his tenure, the church thrived and grew to a membership of thousands. 
   I personally was in his church on many occasions. I most remember being there when J.O. Patterson, Jr., was running for mayor of the City of Memphis, a position he held temporarily in an interim appointment, and when President Bill Clinton came there and we shared the podium. President Clinton gave one of his great speeches there. 
   Like Dr. King, Rev. Whalum was a strong proponent of diversity in the workplace. His advocacy led to the promotion of many qualified African Americans and women to supervisory and managerial positions in the Memphis post office. 
   After retirement, Rev. Whalum began to experience transient ischemic attacks, TIAs or ministrokes, the most recent of these occurring just a few months ago. Unfortunately, at this time, he's in a nursing facility, but he's improving. We hope he will regain all of his faculties. He's a strong man. One year he experienced 28 such TIAs, causing his family to reach out to the Stroke of Hope Foundation, which his son knew of through their work with the late Luther Vandross. Most recently, Rev. Whalum has been featured in Stroke of Hope's Survivor of the Month Spring 2007 column. 
   Rev. Whalum has received various honors and awards throughout his career. In the past, he has served on the board of directors of the Memphis branch of the NAACP, the Morehouse School of Religion of the Interdenominational Theological Center in Atlanta, the LeMoyne-Owen College Board and was a founding board member of the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, Tennessee. He has garnered certificates from the University of Texas at Austin Graduate School of Business, United States Postal Service Advanced Management Program, as well as the University of Michigan Graduate School of Business's Executive Development Program. 
   I'm honored that my eight cocolleagues from the State of Tennessee's congressional delegation could lend their full support through cosponsoring this measure. Kenneth Whalum was a dedicated public servant in the best sense of the phrase, and the rest of us can learn a great deal from the example he set. 
   Rev. Whalum has a wonderful, loyal wife in Dr. Rosie Richmond Whalum, as well as three remarkable sons. Memphis has many great families, some of whom have served in this body, but no family in Memphis, Tennessee, has given the city more pride and more service than the Whalum family. All three of his sons, as he said, grew up right behind him. They enjoyed the church, and as he said, they didn't have any choice. They enjoyed the church. 
   Of his three sons, Dr. Kenneth Whalum, Jr., the oldest, has followed in his father's footsteps in becoming a pastor and a dedicated public servant. He's taken over the church where Dr. Whalum was the pastor, and he's a member of the Memphis City School Board. He was elected in December 2006. 
   His son Kirk Whalum is one of the great saxophone players in the United States of America. He's had many top hits. He played this Friday at an event which I attended for the National Academy of the Recording Arts and Sciences in Memphis in a tribute to Booker T. and the MGs who were being honored with other musicians. Kirk Whalum made that saxophone sing, as he always does. I know Steve Cropper and ``Duck'' Dunn were in awe of the talent exhibited there. And what was even nicer, besides the fact that Kirk Whalum played such a great saxophone, as he always does, was that his son, another generation of Whalums, played the base, and they played it on ``Hip Hugger'' and ``Green Onions,'' two great Booker T. songs. Kirk Whalum has played backup on saxophone for such renowned artists as Whitney Houston and others. He's come back to Memphis to serve as an artist-in-residence at the Stax Soul Academy of Music in Memphis, Tennessee. 
   Kevin Whalum, another son, is a talented musical artist and poet, having signed a recording contract with Rendezvous Entertainment this past February. 
   Like his father, Kenneth, Jr., has three sons: Kenneth, III; Kortland; and Kameron. Kevin has twin daughters: Kellen and Kaylah. And Kirk has five children: Courtney, Kori, Kyle, Kobe and Evan. 
   For the Whalum family and the great many people of Memphis who have benefited from his decade of public service, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. This is a family of renown and a man who has had a great impact on the City of Memphis and the postal department, and it's justifiably fitting that this building be named for him.  
   I would like to add that Kirk Whalum's 1996 album, ``Joined at the Hip,'' earned him his first Grammy nomination. His 1998 release, For You, spent nearly two years at the top of the Billboard Contemporary Jazz Chart and yielded four Top Ten NAC hits. He earned a second Grammy nomination and critical acclaim with his self-produced album, Hymns in the Garden in 2000.

   September 11, 2001, is a day that will live in infamy. We survived that as a country. We are together in fighting terrorism, and we are together in support for this great country and democracy. 
   We have differences of opinion on how best to go about preserving our great country, our homeland security and defeating the terrorists; but people on both sides of the aisle are Americans. People in this Hall are patriotic. Although we have differences in how we analyze data and information given us by different officials and see events in different ways, we all see them with the same eventual outcome, and that is to hope that we have peace and prosperity here in this country and throughout the world. 
   In conclusion, I take a moment to honor the people who were so heroic in Pennsylvania and remember their words: Let's roll.

   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, we will hear from General Petraeus today and tomorrow. I think we all need to reflect, as we will this evening in a memorial for the victims of 9/11 and a day like December 7 that will live in infamy, that while we may disagree on how we should respond to the terrorist threats that we have in the Middle East, that we should disagree in an agreeable manner because we are all Americans and no matter what position we take, we all want the best for this country. We want peace and prosperity, and we want our soldiers to be safe and to be supported. 
   There were heroes on the airplane in Pennsylvania who tried and did deter the terrorists from possibly attacking this building or the White House. Their motto was: ``Let's roll.'' 
   As we remember them, I ask Members on both sides of the aisle if they disagree, which we will, to disagree in an agreeable way. Let's roll for the American public.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, today is the dreaded April 15, and I, like millions and millions of Americans, have filed my returns and those for my mother and others. 
   This Congress has tried to provide and has provided relief for middle-class taxpayers and middle-income taxpayers and extended those tax benefits. We have also passed relief for the people who pay the alternative minimum tax. 
   But with the stimulus package, we provide moneys for people to get a refund. But to get that refund, people have to file their taxes. Be sure and file your taxes, and if your income is $75,000 or less or $150,000 for a couple, you can get your stimulus relief package passed by this Congress. 
   We wish our moneys weren't going to rebuild Baghdad and for war efforts, but with the work of this Congress, one day we will have peace, we won't be spending the money in Baghdad, and we will be spending the money in America to rebuild our infrastructure.

   You cannot defeat beliefs with bullets. What we have in Iraq and in the Middle East are beliefs that are different from ours, and they can only be won by understanding and through changes, which God would put in people's hearts, and not through bullets.

   Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, millions of Americans all over the United States are struggling to put food on the table and gas in their cars. Imagine at the same time that these prices spike you lose your job and that your  unemployment benefits run out simply because there are not enough jobs to go around. This has happened to 1.6 million Americans. They need our help. 
   Last week, Congress overwhelmingly passed legislation to immediately extend unemployment insurance for an additional 13 weeks. Today, that bill will be included in the emergency supplemental. This important legislation deserves strong bipartisan support. 
   With 325,000 jobs lost already this year and 3.8 million workers out of a job, it is imperative we take action now. We must continue to look for immediate solutions to our economic troubles. Extending unemployment insurance is one of the most cost-effective and fast-acting ways to stimulate the economy because the money is spent quickly. 
   Madam Speaker, President Bush and his allies in Congress should drop their opposition to this bill so we can help millions of Americans who are struggling with this recession economy.

   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, we've heard on both sides today arguments about the energy crisis. The fact is these arguments are why Congress is held in such low esteem. There are just a couple of things that can be done immediately to help people with the price at the pump, and the major thing that can be done is releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That's been a proven success with President Bush I, President Clinton, and even this President Bush, and yet he refuses. 
   Why does he refuse? Because it would hurt the profits of the oil companies. And who gave us this President and this Vice President? The oil companies. This is government of the oil companies, by the oil companies, and for the oil companies. And the people of my district are tired of paying this high price. 
   Twenty years drilling, you might as well think about your child being born today and planning to see them have a car that gets 80 miles to the gallon in 20 years because that's when the oil that might be pumped today in the Outer Shelf would come to be.

He saw truth, he spoke truth, and he wrote truth; and he gained his first fame at the age of 30 when he received a Pulitzer Prize for reporting about a quagmire known as Vietnam, a misdirection of American energies in foreign policies that led us to lose over 30,000 lives and many casualties in a great blunder under American foreign policy. We have a similar situation today in Iraq, another mistaken folly, and lives are being lost.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce a resolution honoring Stax Records. 
   Soul music is a uniquely American art form that has enriched the Nation's cultural life. Indeed, its profound influences over popular music continues to be heard on today's music. 
   Stax Records, founded in Memphis 50 years ago, played a crucial role in soul music's rise to prominence. As such, it is an icon of the American recording industry. In fact, its iconic status was recognized by NARAS last night during the Grammys, when Stax legends Booker T. and the M.G.'s and their Green Onions, and Stax co-founder Estelle Axton were honored.  
   Isaac Hayes, Otis Redding, the Staple Singers, Wilson Pickett, Luther Ingram, Albert King, the Bar-Kays, Johnnie Taylor, and Rufus and Carla Thomas are just a few of the many singers and musicians who started at Stax. 
   This year, the Memphis Convention and Visitors Bureau, Concord Music Group, Stax Records, and the Soulful Foundation will be celebrating both Memphis soul music, American soul music, and the 50th anniversary of Stax's founding. Therefore, I am introducing this resolution today to recognize Stax's and soul music's enormous contribution to America's cultural fabric, and ask my colleagues, including Congressman Miller, to recognize Memphis and soul music.

<DOCNO>Mr. COHEN. (RAIL AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as necessary to make this presentation. 
   I rise today to offer an amendment to H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act. My amendment would call for the Department of Transportation to coordinate with related agencies as well as State and local governments to seek efforts that will minimize the transport of toxic inhalation hazardous materials. 
   Never has the danger of transporting hazardous materials been more clear than in this post-9/11 age. While rail is clearly the safest means of transport for such materials, we must work to ensure this transit is as secure, efficient and is as considerate towards the safety of our communities as possible. The U.S. Naval Research Lab has said an attack on such a rail car could kill 100,000 people. 
   Additionally, in 2005 testimony before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, the administration's deputy homeland security adviser at the time, Richard A. Falkenrath, told Congress in 2005 that ``toxic-by-inhalation industrial chemicals present a mass-casualty terrorist potential rivaled only by improvised nuclear devices, certain acts of bioterrorism, and the collapse of large, occupied buildings.'' Railroads carry 105,000 carloads of toxic chemicals a year and 1.6 million carloads of other hazardous materials such as explosives and radioactive items. 
   In mid-January of this year, several train cars carrying flammable liquid derailed and exploded south of Louisville, Kentucky, shutting down a nearby highway and forcing evacuations of nearby homes, businesses and a school, according to local authorities. Two years earlier, a train crash in South Carolina caused a release of chlorine gas resulting in deaths, injuries, and forcing the evacuation of people from the surrounding areas. Most recently, there was a Union Pacific derailment of 28 cars in Henderson County, Texas. 
   In the wake of these recent derailments, State and local officials nationwide have begun examining their regulatory authority over the transportation of hazardous materials by rail. Several localities nationwide have either introduced or enacted absolute bans on the transportation of certain toxic substances from trains that travel through their areas. 
   This action has prompted litigation from the rail industry due to alleged violations of the U.S. Constitution's commerce clause and Federal statutes concerning the transportation of hazardous materials. Rail companies fear such laws would force them to extend the travel of hazardous cargo by hundreds of miles around cities with the unintended effect of transferring the risk to other localities. This consensus amendment addresses the concerns of both rail companies and community advocates by seeking to cut the transport of these hazardous materials all together. 
   In a June 2006 statement before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, the president and CEO of the Association of American Railroads made several recommendations intended to reduce the risks associated with the manufacture and transport of highly hazardous materials. Among these recommendations was ``examining whether and how railroads can utilize coordinated routing arrangements to safely reduce hazmat transportation'' as well as ``examining whether hazmat consumers can source hazmat from closer suppliers.'' 
   My amendment would simply call upon the Department of Transportation to follow this recommendation by coordinating with localities to allow consumers to obtain TIH materials with the intended consequence of minimizing the time and frequency such materials are routed through our communities. 
   Last July, the Memphis Commercial Appeal identified train cars carrying chlorine, 2-Dimethylaminoethyl acrylate, acetone cyanohydrin, nickel carbonyl, and several other toxic inhalation hazard cargoes over a 2-day period in or near residential areas of Memphis. Not only hard to pronounce but very difficult to inhale I am sure of the things we would rather not inhale or pronounce. All of these chemicals are listed as potentially lethal if inhaled. 
   City council members and other community leaders in Memphis are calling on the Federal Government for assistance in deterring the transport of these materials through their residential areas. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am proud to support this amendment and support this legislation and current efforts under way to improve the safety of our rail system. To further ensure the safety of our railways, as well as the local communities they serve, I call upon my colleagues to pass this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Who claims time in opposition?

   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, last week the Democratic House delivered on its promise to move the Iraq war in a new direction. We approved a very serious piece of legislation that includes the recommendations of the President, the nonpartisan Iraq Study Group and the Pentagon. The President responded to our action by describing it as political theater and threatening a Presidential veto. 
   How can this be political theater if we are putting some real teeth into the benchmarks that the President himself established for the Iraqi government earlier this year? Let's not forget the President's own words: ``I've made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq's other leaders that America's commitment is not open-ended. If the Iraqi government does not follow through on its promises, it will lose the support of the American people,'' said President Bush. Those were his words. 
   This legislation passed last week puts in law the President's demands that the Iraqis meet his benchmarks. You would think the President would support such action. Instead, he calls it political theater. So much for holding the Iraqi government accountable. The President should reconsider his veto threat. It could be the theater of the absurd.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House, today I am going to introduce a bill to call on the United States Government to apologize for the history in this country of having a slave system and for Jim Crow laws that went on for a hundred additional years. 
   The State of Virginia is to be commended for its action this past week in making, in essence, an apology saying they regretted a system of slavery in this country. 
   For 246 years, our Constitution and our laws allowed a system that made people slaves, that divided people from their families and treated them as property. And for 100 years thereafter, a system of laws in many States throughout the country had Jim Crow laws that deprived people of the opportunity for equal access to education, health care, public facilities, and other types of programs. These ended by law in the sixties somewhat through the efforts of Thurgood Marshall and other attorneys in Brown v. Board of Education, but the effects are lingering. 
   This country needs to apologize for a brutal, inhumane system of slavery and Jim Crow laws. President Bush has made remarks similar to this in Senegal; President Clinton also in the State of Virginia most recently. 
   I hope we will have all our colleagues sign on and pass this unanimously, as the State of Virginia did, and make a proper apology for a harmful and unfortunate part of our history.

   To give rebates to people who are making a lot of money, people earning salaries such as we are in Congress, and others, is not the right thing to do. We need to give money to people who are suffering the most from the high gas prices, from the loss of employment, and from the other economic effects that are hurting the people at the bottom.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. I want to thank the chairman and the chairmen for the work they've done, and for the ranking member, on this bill. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 4279, the Prioritizing Resources and Organization for Intellectual Property Act of 2008, or the PRO-IP Act. 
   Our Nation's intellectual property is the basis for our economic success and security. That is something that can't be undermined by cheap labor prices overseas. It's an American product. Therefore, protecting our intellectual property must be among our highest priorities. 
   In addition to undermining our global economic primacy, counterfeit and pirated products can threaten the health and safety of American consumers, American pet owners, steal income from legitimate businesses, deprive American workers of good jobs, and undermine the necessary incentive for innovation and creativity which has made America the great country that it is. It is for these reasons I'm an original cosponsor of the PRO-IP Act. 
   The PRO-IP Act will help strengthen enforcement of intellectual property rights domestically and internationally through enhanced criminal and civil penalties for intellectual property crimes, better high-level coordination among Federal Government agencies, and increased resources to domestic and foreign law enforcement authorities. 
   This bill, Mr. Speaker, rightfully enjoys broad support from a wide range of industries, including the entertainment, pharmaceutical, food, automobile parts and software industries. It has such diverse partners as the Chamber of Commerce and the Teamsters. When the Chamber of Commerce and the Teamsters come together it's like E.F. Hutton--we listen. We've listened well and need to pass this bill. 
   This coalition that supports PRO-IP is indicative of the broad support and the need for passage of such legislation. I urge my colleagues to heed the words and vote in favor of this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1224, to commend the Tennessee Valley Authority on its 75th anniversary. My hometown of Memphis is the largest customer of the Tennessee Valley Authority. It supplies us with our energy. 
   The Tennessee Valley Authority over the years has had many, many great commissioners and has now a new form of administration. In the past, one of our predecessors from this House and the State of Tennessee, Bob Clement, served as a member of the board of directors of the TVA; and also a gentleman named Johnny Hayes, who passed away this past week, who was a great Tennessean and a great supporter of our previous Vice President Al Gore and a dear friend of mine. 
   The Tennessee Valley Authority was signed into law by Franklin Delano Roosevelt on May 18, 1933. At that time America was in the midst of a Great Depression, and the Tennessee Valley Authority was seen as a way to lift the country out of economic recession. 
   The establishment of TVA by the Federal Government was a sign of Congress' recognition of the importance of integrating regional and national resource management strategies and issues affecting multiple States. The TVA wove together Southeastern Conference members in a way that hasn't been done since other than the conference. More specifically, it was created to provide inland waterway navigation, flood control, affordable electricity and to bolster economic development in the Tennessee Valley region. TVA also helped farmers improve crop yields, replant forests and improve fish and wildlife habitation in the valley. 
   TVA's facilities now include 30 hydroelectric dams, 11 fossil fuel powered plants and three nuclear power plants. It is the Nation's largest public power company and provides reliable electricity to nearly 8.5 million customers in the Tennessee Valley. Near my home is Pickwick Dam, also a source of great opportunity for enjoyment and pleasures for people wanting to boat and enjoy outdoor life. 
   Today, TVA continues to support navigation along the Tennessee River, reduce the risk of flood damage to the surrounding area, and provide reliable electric power to its many customers. It does so while applying a unique problem-solving approach while fulfilling its mission of integrated resource management. 
   TVA has proven that it remains committed to fulfilling the needs of the region's businesses and citizens. This has been reflected in the development of hydroelectric facilities in the 1940s to support the war effort and the production of aluminum, to its present day development of renewable power sources. 
   I urge my colleagues in the House to join me in supporting this resolution and honor the Tennessee Valley Authority for helping to meet the needs of our country for the past 75 years. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. I want to thank the chairman for his courtesies and the ranking member in helping bring this bill to the floor today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6146, which I introduced with Congressman Issa of California. The bill is designed to address the phenomenon of libel tourism, whereby plaintiffs seek judgments from foreign courts from American authors and publishers for making allegedly defamatory statements. 
   The fact is, these statements in these cases would not be considered defamatory in American courts where the first amendment gives our authors and people the protection of the first amendment, but in certain jurisdictions, even countries that have similar legal systems to ours, the first amendment is not recognized, and the libel laws are much different, and plaintiffs have less burdens to prove to get judgments against defendants. 
   This threatens to undermine our Nation's core free speech principles, as embodied in the first amendment. U.S. law places this higher burden on defamation plaintiffs to safeguard our first amendment and protect our speech. We have seen problems with this, particularly in courts of England. The State of New York has already acted to pass a bill to protect authors and publishers in the first amendment, but there was a need to have such on a national basis. 
   Thomas Jefferson is memorialized with the monument here in Washington. My friend, Randy Wade, and I visited Thomas Jefferson recently. Around the top of the monument is a statement Thomas Jefferson is known for: 
   ``I have sworn upon the altar of almighty God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the minds of men.'' To infringe on the opportunity for people to write books and publish, which is what this does, is tyranny over the minds of men. I believe Jefferson would join with us today in support of this proposal. 
   H.R. 6146 will codify the principle that while U.S. courts will normally enforce judgments of foreign courts, they should not do so when the foreign judgments undermine our Constitution, particularly our precious first amendment. 
   Specifically, our bill prohibits U.S. courts from recognizing and enforcing foreign defamation judgments that do not comport with the first amendment. I believe that passage of this bill will dissuade those who would seek to circumvent our first amendment by filing actions in libel-friendly forums that do not share our protections and then threaten our authors with judgments. 
   I thank, again, Chairman Conyers and Ranking Member Smith for their assistance in bringing this bill to the floor on suspension. I also thank Congressman Issa for his help and Congressman Peter King. 
   Representative King had a different bill on the same subject. He has shown leadership on this issue for his home State of New York, and he joined with us in this particular bill to try to get it passed here in this Congress. 
   Adam Cohen, no relation to me in any way whatsoever, opined in The New York Times that this bill needed to become law immediately. We did go into warp speed to get this to the floor.     
   I am committed to working with Mr. King next year. I have talked to Chairman Conyers, and he is in agreement that we should have a public hearing next year on this legislation with Mr. King's ideas that go further than this bill to discuss how far libel tourism should go. And that hearing I think would satisfy Senator Specter's office and others on the Senate side, to go deeper to protect our authors and the freedom of speech. 
   I would also like to thank the Association of American Publishers, particularly former Congresswoman Pat Schroeder, the Media Law Resource Center, and Professor Michael Brode of Emory University Law School for their input on the bill. 
   I urge the bill's immediate passage. I thank my chairman from the bottom of my heart who I am fortunate to serve with, and my ranking member who has been so kind to me during my first term.

<DOCNO>Mr. COHEN. (RECOGNIZING THE HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE USS ``CONSTELLATION'' IN THE TRANSATLANTIC SLAVE TRADE -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. I thank Congressperson Jackson-Lee and Congressperson Cummings for their work on this resolution. 
   It is important that we remember our history, and we teach our history to our school children and our adults as well to know how far this country has come and where it has come from. There are things that have happened in history in this country and around the world that are not things that we are proud of. Nevertheless, we learn from them and we grow. 
   This is not the perfect Union that we hope it to be one day, but it is a more perfect Union each year. And amendments to the Constitution and laws have changed to make this a better country. 
   Earlier in this session, this Congress passed, by voice vote, an apology for slavery and Jim Crow, a long time in coming, but something that should have occurred and did occur. I hope that my colleagues in the Senate will pass the same resolution. 
   This is in the same vein, in remembering that this country did allow slavery for many years, and Jim Crow laws to follow. But while we did allow it, there was a time that it was outlawed, and there were efforts to suspend it and to stop it. And this ship and the people that manned the ship, captained the ship and served on the ship, did their jobs in seeing that the slave trade was defeated off the African coast. 
   It is appropriate that this ship be maintained as a museum and a tribute to those gentlemen and to the cause that they served, and to remind people of some of the horrors in our history, but the improvements that we have made. And I compliment Congressman Cummings on bringing the resolution, and the people involved in the City of Baltimore and elsewhere in preserving the USS Constellation.

<DOCNO>Mr. COHEN. (UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Thank you, Madam Speaker. 
   It is indeed an honor to join with the previous speakers and you, Madam Speaker, to speak on this subject that you and Chairman Conyers and others have brought to this fight. 
   It has been a long fight. Chairman Conyers and Mr. Dingell and Mr. Dingell's father I think have had sponsorship of issues such as this since the 1940s, 60-some-odd years of efforts and introduction of legislation and debate and discussion, but no bill yet. But we've come a long way. We've come a long way since the 1940s. 
   Madam Speaker talked about the individuals who suffer from cancer and should not have lost their lives because we didn't have adequate research. I have penned a letter to the Speaker and to Chairman Obey, who I know are concerned about this issue, asking that we increase NIH funding in the President's 2009 budget for research on cancer, diabetes, heart disease, AIDS, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease so that we double the amount that we had in the budget as requested by Congress. 
   In the President's fiscal year 2009 budget, the request for research at the National Institute of Health for cancer, diabetes, heart disease, HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's, this could be doubled, and only a day or so's worth of money that we use for our war efforts would have to be transferred to make this available. 
   You know, I think about what the Speaker was talking about, the loss of lives, and I had to think about Senator Kennedy. Not that one life is greater than another life. But Senator Kennedy is a colleague who has been in this hall and is fighting cancer. We hope he will have a successful fight. But when we see him struck with cancer, and others--and we know there are people dying every day of cancer--it just seems to me that it's a shame that we don't put more and more money into saving lives and we don't use the great wealth of this Nation, the intelligence of this Nation, the great scientific powers of this country to invest in medical research in saving lives rather than weapons of mass destruction often brought to us by people who benefit from them and have brought the military industrial complex that President Eisenhower warned us about, even President Nixon had concerns about; and that helped take us from 9/11 into an escalating budget expense of military weapons that caused this country's budget to be spent so much  and its great talent and abilities in a scientific way to be used on weapons of mass destruction and other arms of the military industrial complex rather than science and research to save lives and save humanity. 
   Who knows which person, which young person or older person, could do something to save other people's lives let alone give love and hope to families? 
   And so with national health care insurance, we could cover people, we could save lives because if we had insurance for the people, you could scope out illnesses earlier whether you're wealthy or poor. You would have the same opportunity to have preventative care, early treatment, and diagnosis of illnesses that can cause loss of life. And that early detection can save lives. 
   Right now if you're poor, you don't have the opportunity to have that early detection and your life is taken. And that's an inequity that this country should not allow to continue and shouldn't have permitted for all of these years. 
   There are so many accomplishments that we have seen in this country, particularly in this year. We've seen our Nation become a more perfect union in so many ways. But the fundamental right to health care is one that we have not recognized yet and we must. 
   We're all here because of the grace of God, and it seems like we should all have the--at our access and at our disposal what God's creatures have been able to discover, refine, produce, in the way of medical care to keep people alive. That just seems like a minimum thing. 
   And this country is the only great industrialized country on the face of the earth without some national health care policy. It seems like in this area, we are not the first in the Nation, in the world, but we're last in the world. And that's terrible. 
   There are doctors that serve in this body, and they're to be admired for giving their time. And I'm sure--I have many friends who are doctors who give a lot of charity care. But it shouldn't have to be doctors providing charity care to treat people that otherwise wouldn't be treated. It should be something that we all give. And I think that that's the real social need in this country. And when people talk about values and social consciousness and really religious thought and caring about others, it really begins with caring about people's health and sacrificing maybe some of our own resources to have a government system that can help others with their health care. 
   So I'm pleased, Madam Speaker, to speak as I have. You have inspired me with your remarks, the letters you read; and I'm just pleased that Chairman Conyers has this issue before us. 
   Madam Speaker, I enter the following for the Record. 
 Speaker Nancy Pelosi, H-232, U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC. Chairman David Obey, Committee on Appropriations, H-218, U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, today or sometime this week, this House will vote on additional funds for the wars in the Middle East, Iraq and Afghanistan. I wish there was an opportunity for me to vote for funds to support our troops in Afghanistan, who are making an effort in defeating the Taliban and seeking out Osama bin Laden, the perpetrators of 9/11. However, the bills are drawn together; so I will vote ``no.'' 
   And I feel at this time we know the war in Iraq is going in the wrong direction, but I also know that there are catastrophic illnesses and diseases on mankind and womenkind in our world, and a great country should use its resources for the best purposes, not weapons of war but use our science and our intelligence to find ways to conquer disease. 
   I had polio when I was a child, and if we had put more money into helping Jonas Salk, maybe I would not have had polio. It was months after Salk's vaccine was introduced. 
   I lost a friend to cancer last week, Thomas Boggs. There will be a time when people lose friends to cancer that could have been cured if we had put more money into research earlier. Diabetes, Parkinson's, heart disease. In Memphis we have St. Jude Children's Hospital looking for cures to illnesses and diseases. 
   A great country should do great things. I encourage us to not fund war but to fund science.

   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, last night, this House had a proposal before it to prohibit the DEA from enforcing Federal laws on medical marijuana patients in the 12 States where the public has legalized medical marijuana. Unfortunately, it failed. 
   I voted for the proposal. Why did I vote for the proposal? Yes, I'm compassionate about people who have multiple sclerosis and AIDS and cancer who can benefit, Parkinson's disease and glaucoma who can benefit from medical marijuana. Yes, I voted for it because I believe in States' rights and I believe in Justice Brandeis and the laboratories of democracy and to see how things work in other States and be able to adjust and see how they should work in other States, but also because I believe the DEA shouldn't be busting medical marijuana houses and stores in Los Angeles. They should be working in my community to eliminate and eradicate methamphetamine, crack and other drugs that are ravaging my community and causing a crime problem in Memphis, Tennessee, and throughout this country. 
   The DEA has not been effective at controlling the war on drugs. We need to win it. I would like that to happen.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to myself such time as I may consume. 
   Intellectual property accounts for billions of dollars in our Nation's economy. The success of this industry largely depends on the protections afforded them by the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the decisions made by administrative patent and trademark judges. 
   In 1999, the process by which administrative patent and trademark judges are appointed was modified as part of the American Inventors Protection Act. That act, which provided greater accountability and efficiencies at the Patent and Trademark Office, transferred the power to appoint these judges from the Secretary of Commerce to the Director of the U.S. PTO. 
   Recently, however, concerns have been raised as to the constitutionality of the Director making such appointments. Already, at least two U.S. PTO decisions have been challenged on this basis. 
   We firmly believe that appointments made by the Director are constitutional. Nevertheless, in order to remove any doubts, the House and Senate has reached identical bills to respond to these concerns. H.R. 6362, sponsored by Howard Berman, John Conyers, Lamar Smith, and HOWARD COBLE, and S. 3295, sponsored by PATRICK LEAHY and ARLEN SPECTER, make three changes to the administrative judge appointments process. Today, we take up the Senate bill, which passed the Senate last week by unanimous consent. 
   First, S. 3295 restores the statutory appointment authority to the Secretary of Commerce. 
   Second, it allows the Secretary to retroactively appoint administrative judges who have been acting as de facto judges. The appointments would be effective as of the date the judges were originally appointed by the Patent and Trademark Office Director. 
   And third, the bill provides a de facto officer defense to counter challenges to the United States Patent and Trademark Office decisions made by these administrative judges prior to their retroactive appointment. 
   This legislation is intended to ensure certainty in the market and to end unnecessary litigation and the consumption of judicial resources on an issue over which there should be no dispute. 
   But should these judgeships be found to be unconstitutional and not de facto officers, the courts should remand the affected cases back to the U.S. PTO panels so that they may dealt with expeditiously. 
   Given the importance of intellectual property to our Nation's economy, years of uncertainty as the courts determine the constitutionality of the appointments process would be devastating. 
   The sponsors of H.R. 6362 and S. 3295 have provided a way through this uncertainty. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support this critical legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 1324, which will press the President to focus appropriate attention on neighborhood crime prevention and community policing. The resolution also asks the President to coordinate certain Federal efforts to participate in National Night Out. 
   Neighborhood crime is a major concern for many Americans across our Nation. While our police departments are generally as professional and responsive as they can be, preventing neighborhood crimes comes from the efforts of us all. 
   Community-based programs involving law enforcement, school administrators, teachers, parents, and other citizens are among the most effective ways to reduce violence and crime in our neighborhoods. 
   Neighborhood Crime Watch groups and Citizens on Patrol groups, for example, can be an integral part of a police department's effectiveness in making our neighborhoods safe. The presence of concerned citizens walking their neighborhoods, in contact with police, help prevent communities from becoming targets for drug dealers. Just as patrol is the great deterrent that police use, patrol can be a deterrent that citizens use. With more potential witnesses on the streets, citizens are much less likely to be robbery victims. 
   National Night Out is a unique crime prevention event that helps to highlight the importance and effectiveness of community participation in crime prevention efforts. This special event allows citizens, businesses, and local law enforcement officers, along with Federal, State and local officials, to participate in community crime prevention programs.  
   Last year, more than 35 million people in more than 11,000 communities across America participated in National Night Out. This year marks the 25th anniversary of this special event. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Mr. Stupak for leadership on this issue. And I ask my colleagues to support National Night Out.

   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6225, as amended, a bill authorized by my colleague Mr. Dan Lungren of California to address the growing problem of self-propelled semi-submersible or fully submersible vessels used for criminal purposes. Not the Hunley, in fact. 
   According to the United States Coast Guard, international drug traffickers are using these vessels to transport illegal drugs to the United States. They are typically large enough to carry 24 metric tons of contraband, can travel up to 3,500 miles, and are designed so that the crew members can readily sink them within scant minutes of being spotted, thereby making it virtually impossible for authorities to intercept illegal shipments and bring the smugglers to justice. 
   These vessels sail under no country's flag. They are not registered. They are usually camouflaged and constructed to avoid radar detection, with all but a few inches hidden below the water line. 
   The Coast Guard estimates that these vessels now account for 32 percent of all maritime cocaine flow to the U.S. from pan-American sources. And they could just as easily carry even more dangerous cargo, posing a serious national security threat. 
   In recognition of this threat, this bill makes it a felony to operate such a vehicle on the high seas or across our border without national registration and with intent to avoid detection, punishable by up to 15 years in prison.  
   The version of the bill we are considering reflects a number of improvements developed by Congressman Daniel E. Lungren, Senator Biden, and Senator Lautenberg in consultation with the Coast Guard and the Department of Justice. I would like to commend them all for their leadership on this important legislation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. COHEN. (APOLOGIZING FOR THE ENSLAVEMENT AND RACIAL SEGREGATION OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   It is with pride that I introduced this resolution with 120 cosponsors from both sides of the aisle, and it is with pride that I serve as a Member of this institution and this building that was built with slave labor and for which the new Visitors Gallery will be known as Emancipation Hall. It was the gentleman from this side of the aisle, the party of Lincoln, Representative ZACH WAMP from my State, and this side of the aisle, Representative JESSE JACKSON, JR., who eloquently spoke to a subcommittee of which I am a member urging the remembrance and recognition of the work of the slaves who helped construct this magnificent Capitol Building and have the entryway named Emancipation Hall. 
   This country had an institution of slavery for 246 years and followed it with Jim Crow laws that denied people equal opportunities under the law. There was segregation in the South and other places in this country at least through the year 1965 when civil rights laws were passed. 
   There were separate water fountains for people marked ``white'' and ``colored''; there were separate restaurants; there were separate hotels; there were job opportunities that were not available to African Americans; there were  theaters that were segregated. It is hard to imagine today in 2008 that such a society existed and was sanctioned by law, that the laws of this Nation provided for segregation and enforced fugitive slave laws. 
   In fact, the history of slavery goes not just through the Emancipation Proclamation and the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments to our Constitution, but, as so eloquently written just yesterday in the Baltimore Sun in an editorial by Mr. Leonard Pitts, Jr., that slavery existed up until about World War II, but it was a form of slavery where people were bought and sold for debts. It was slavery by another name. 
   In a book called ``Slavery by Another Name'' by Douglas Blackman, a correspondent for the Wall Street Journal, he talked about a convict leasing system in the South where poor black men were routinely snatched up and tried on false, petty or nonexistent charges by compliant courts, assessed some fine they could not afford, and then put into the servitude of an individual who bought them. This system continued up until World War II. 
   The fact is slavery and Jim Crow are stains upon what is the greatest Nation on the face of the Earth and the greatest government ever conceived by man. But when we conceived this government and we said all men were created equal, we didn't in fact make all men equal, nor did we make women equal. 
   We have worked to form a more perfect Union, and part of forming a more perfect Union is laws, and part of it is such a resolution as we have before us today where we face up to our mistakes and we apologize, as anyone should apologize for things that were done in the past that were wrong, and we begin a dialogue that hopefully will lead us to a better understanding of where we are in America today and why certain conditions exist. 
   In 1997, President Clinton talked to the Nation about the problem that this country had with race, and he wanted a national dialogue. He considered an apology for slavery. I happened to run into President Clinton at that time at the Amtrak station here in Washington and discussed with him having an apology for Jim Crow as well as slavery. I encompassed that in a letter dated July 2, 1997, that as a State senator from Tennessee I wrote to President Clinton.     
   In that letter, I urged him to have a slavery apology and a Jim Crow apology, and to mark it on the 30th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, an event that tragically took place in April of 1968 in my city, and that the appropriate time for President Clinton to have that apology would be on that 30th anniversary. 
   In going through my papers as I was elected to Congress, I found this letter and I thought about it and I said to myself, ``You are a Member of Congress. You don't need to wait on a response from the President of the United States, which, my friend, the President's office failed to make a response. I can take action myself.'' So I introduced the resolution in February of 2007, with 120 sponsors joining me as time went on. It is important on this day that we admit our error, that we apologize. 
   I have been in this body and voted with the rest of the body on a unanimous voice vote to encourage, this past year, the Japanese government to apologize for its use of Chinese women as comfort women during the war, and not a voice was raised questioning that resolution which passed unanimously on us calling on a foreign country to apologize for its use of comfort women. 
   Twenty years ago, this Congress passed a bill apologizing for the internment of Japanese citizens during World War II. In fact, subsequent to the consideration of this resolution, the distinguished lady from California (Ms. Matsui) has a resolution recognizing and celebrating the 20th anniversary of the passage of that bill. 
   This Congress did the right thing in apologizing for the imprisonment of Japanese Americans during World War II and in encouraging the Japanese government to apologize for the use of comfort women. But the fact that this government has not apologized to its own citizens, African Americans, for the institution of slavery and for the Jim Crow laws that followed, and accepted that fact and encouraged changes in our dialogue and understanding and the actions of this country to rectify that, is certainly a mistake, and today we rectify that mistake. 
   This is a symbolic resolution, but hopefully it will begin a dialogue where people will open their hearts and their minds to the problems that face this country from racism that exists in this country on both sides and which must end if we are to go forward as the country that we were created to be and which we are destined to be. 
   So it is with great honor that I speak on this resolution and urge the Members of this body to pass this historic resolution, recognize our errors, but also recognize the greatness of this country; because only a great country can recognize and admit its mistakes, and then travel forth to create indeed a more perfect union that works to bring people of all races, religions, and creeds together in unity as Americans, part of the United States of America. 
   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chairman, I thank you for the time, and I urge my colleagues to vote unanimously to pass this resolution today.

   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, S. 3294, the United States Parole Commission Extension Act of 2008, would authorize the United States Parole Commission for another 3 years. 
   Under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, criminal defendants sentenced for Federal offenses committed on or after November 1, 1987 serve determinate terms and are not eligible for patrol. 
   Since the elimination of Federal parole in 1987, the Parole Commission has been reauthorized on four prior occasions. Current reauthorization is set to expire October 31, 2008. 
   The Commission has jurisdiction over Federal offenders sentenced before November 1, 1987, as well as DC offenders sentenced before August 4, 2000. The Commission also has jurisdiction over an increasing number of DC offenders on supervised release. 
   Should the Commission not be reauthorized, the Department of Justice is concerned that Federal inmates who were sentenced prior to 1987 will begin to file motions for release under the Sentencing Reform Act. This act requires inmates sentenced before 1987 to be given release dates 3 to 6 months prior to the Commission's expiration. This is why it's imperative that Congress act immediately to reauthorize the Parole Commission. 
   Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation and I reserve the balance of my time.

   FEMA had purchased thousands and thousands and thousands of pounds of ice after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita when they didn't have enough ice. To try to compensate, they bought way, way, way too much ice. 
   I have discovered that FEMA spent in purchasing, in transporting and in storing ice in 23 different American cities, Mr. Speaker, $67 million of our taxpayers' money, and FEMA is now spending nearly $4 million to dispose of that ice over a period of 11 months. That means over $70 million of American taxpayer dollars going down the drain. That is not the way an American government or any government should work, any business should work, or what Americans should expect of their government. 
   Fortunately, this Democratic Congress is doing what legislative branches are supposed to do; oversight. We have lacked oversight for the last 6 years, Mr. Speaker, and faults of the administration have gone unnoticed. But as I deal on the subcommittee that deals with FEMA, I will see to it on August 29th when that subcommittee meets in New Orleans on the second anniversary of that horrendous event, Hurricane Katrina, that we will ask the director of FEMA and the others about their programs, of why they buy excess commodities and excess ice, of why they spent $70 million of American taxpayers' money on an ice folly, and why  they didn't try to dispose of that ice during the period of time when it had a useful shelf life and give it to 501(c)(3) charities, Federal, State or county institutions, so it could be used and utilized by American people who could have used that ice to save some money. 
   The same thing happens with commodities. Chairman Eleanor Holmes Norton, the chairman of that subcommittee, had a hearing on food distribution of commodities where FEMA had wasted other precious commodities and dollars. 
   Mr. Speaker, this needs to stop. Our tax dollars are valuable and people expect their government to do right with their tax dollars. I will not stand by. When I see incompetence, when I see inefficiencies, when I see ineffective use of tax dollars, I will speak up. I am fortunate to be on the subcommittee to ask the questions on August 29th of FEMA. 
   It seems like the horrendous events that we had when Brownie didn't know what he was doing and the people in New Orleans were left in a tragic circumstance are replicating themselves. FEMA has not been cleaned up. 
   We will try to see that FEMA spends our money properly and responds properly. They haven't responded to the American people and they haven't responded to Congress. This is a wrong that needs to be righted.

   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, the 110th Congress came into action with the mandate from the American people to change the way business is done in Washington, and they wanted action on policies. They want action on policies that affect their everyday lives; and this Congress gave it to them with a minimum wage increase for the first time in a decade, with an ethics bill that helps drain the swamp and change the way we do business with lobbyists and make this truly the people's House.  
   We also did it with the CHAMP bill that gives 6 million more children insurance and gives doctors the reimbursement they deserve, and seniors and people with disability the opportunity for health care. 
   We passed ethics reforms. We have done things to make this House better. 
   One thing the President and the people want us to do is work together. They don't want dilatory tactics by either side, and we have seen them, and the people on the other side know they have engaged in them. We need to have order in this House, respect for this House, and respect for the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member and Mr. Shuster for doing such a wonderful job on this bill. The chairman is passionate about this issue, and the American people are fortunate to have people in the Chair's position who are knowledgeable and passionate about the subject matter. 
   I rise today in support of the H.R. 2095, and am pleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation which would reorganize the Federal Railroad Administration as the Federal Railroad Safety Administration, and requires the Secretary of Transportation to develop a long-term strategy for reducing the number and rates of accidents, injuries, and fatalities involving railroads. It is not just linguistics; it is action and direction. 
   The city of Memphis, which lies along the Tennessee border, is a major hub for the railroad industry. The city ranks third nationally in the number of class 1 railroads. According to the Memphis Regional Chamber, 220 trains pass through Memphis every day. Between January and July of 2007, there were 36 rail accidents in Shelby County, two of which were fatal. Consequently, railroad safety is critically important to my district. 
   I was pleased that this Congress passed and enacted H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act, which was designed to enhance the security of our railroad transportation systems. The bill also adopted an amendment I introduced which called on the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Homeland Security Secretary, to work to minimize the hazards of toxic inhalation hazardous material. 
   This legislation today goes further by focusing on rail safety for passengers, pedestrians and train workers. The bill changes the hours of service rules for railroad workers and includes measures to improve areas where railroad tracks cross roads. This happens  too frequently in Memphis, particularly in the university district. 
   In response to inspection personnel shortages, the measure requires the Department of Transportation increase the number of Federal Railroad Safety Administration safety inspections and enforcement personnel, setting targets that are reachable and good for the public. I urge all Members to support passage of the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, President Bush and congressional Republicans have no problem writing blank checks  for the war in Iraq, but ask them to prioritize the health care needs for 10 million low-income children, and they can't be bothered. Every month, every month we are spending $9 billion in Iraq that is borrowed from our children, because the President has always demanded that funding for the Iraq war be classified as emergency spending and, therefore, not subject to the pay-as-you-go rules. 
   Three-and-a-half months of Iraq war funding equals the funding needed to extend health care coverage to 10 million children over the next 5 years. Unlike the war, our children's health is fully paid for with absolutely no deficit spending; yet President Bush vetoed this bipartisan compromise because he said it included excessive spending. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Republicans need to show the President that there are other priorities in our Nation besides the never-ending war in Iraq. They should send that message by joining us tomorrow in overriding the President's veto and caring about our Nation's children.

And we had a Judiciary Committee meeting with Justice Pryor and Justice Alito, I think there were just six or seven or eight of us there, and I choose to go to that meeting rather than the Yom HaShoah program at Statuary Hall. And I felt bad about that because I had attended all those programs in Tennessee and felt strong about the Holocaust. And I rushed up here at the end and I saw Mr. Lantos and I went up and I said, Mr. Lantos, I'm sorry, I missed the meeting. He said, First of all, it is Tom. And I said, Well, okay, Tom. And I said, I went to this Judiciary meeting and I made a mistake; I should have come here, I know. And he said, No, you didn't; you did the right thing going where you belonged. You belonged in committee. You can go again next year. And then I walked away and he stopped me and said, And by the way, I read about you in The Hill. If you need some help with interior decorating, you give me a call. 
   He was a special person. He had a wonderful sense of humor. And when I had problems with bills and votes that I didn't feel comfortable with, I would go to him; and he was grounded and helped me with them, just as he did Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz.

   Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, on Friday, April 4, this Nation will observe the 40th anniversary of the tragic assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King,  Jr. Dr. King was a great American who fought injustice; not just social injustice, but economic injustice. His beliefs 40 years later have not been fulfilled. His dream is still alive, but not fulfilled. 
   In his time, he fought a war and was against a war in Asia that this country was fighting and losing, and costing us much in terms of human sacrifice, as well as financial sacrifice. We see that same situation today, as we have the cost in Iraq taking away from our cities and our people. He fought for working people who were working hard but not moving forward. Today, we see working people in the middle-class continuing to having their power eroded and taken away from them. 
   I ask each person in this House and each person in America to think of Dr. King this week and to think of Dr. King every day and keep his dream alive and move this country forward with economic and social justice, for we need it more now than ever.

   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, Memphis, Tennessee and the Nation lost a great photographer and a great public personage in Ernest Withers. Ernest Withers died at the age of 85. He was a gentleman who was at the right time at the right place with the camera that took the picture that showed the civil rights movement, showed the history of Memphis, Tennessee and its progress from segregation to integration to a city that's one of America's great cities today. 
   Mr. Withers was one of the first African Americans hired as a police officer in the city of Memphis in 1949. He left that profession and went into photography. And whenever there was an event, Mr. Withers was there. He took a picture of B.B. King and Elvis together on Beale Street. The King and the King together on Beale, back in about 1956, when B.B. was thin enough that you wouldn't recognize him, and Elvis was thin too. 
   He had pictures of Dr. King and the civil rights movement. He covered Oxford, Mississippi; he covered Medgar Evers. He covered all of the major civil rights events that came throughout the mid-South. 
   He was published in People Magazine and the New York Times, and Ebony and Jet, and was honored by the Memphis College of Art with an honorary degree in 1992, and by the Missouri School of Journalism for his great work in photography. 
   He'll be missed in Memphis, and his collection needs to be maintained and made available to all citizens for remembrance of what went on during the civil rights era. He'll be missed by all of us. He'll be remembered in history books and museums.

<DOCNO>Mr. COHEN. (RECOGNIZING STAX RECORDS FOR ENRICHING THE NATION'S CULTURAL LIFE WITH ``50 YEARS OF SOUL'' -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on Stax and 50 years of soul music that my hometown, Memphis, Tennessee, has provided this Nation. H. Res. 154 recognizes the rich history of Stax, its 50-year celebration. 
   Last Saturday in Memphis, we started what's called ``Seven Days of Soul,'' honoring 7 days of soul, and while we're honoring 7 days of soul starting last Saturday, the rest of the year is just as good in Memphis. Every day is good in Memphis, and every day's really good on this Earth. 
   Soul music is a special part of American music, and I wish to quote from The Commercial Appeal, which did a special feature on Stax and soul this past week by Mr. Bob Negr. He quotes Peter Guralnick, great rock and roll raconteur, and he says, what soul music is is the story of blacks and whites together. It is the story of the complicated intertwinings of dirt-poor roots and middle-class dreams, aesthetic ambitions and social strivings, the anarchic impulse and the business ethic. 
   Guralnick, while not a Memphian, has been a great recounter of stories of Memphis music. He's done a lot with Elvis, and he's done a lot with Stax. And Memphis has got the roux that has made music what it's been in America. 
   At Sun Records, things came together, and Sam Phillips put them together there, and Rufus Thomas, a staple of Stax, recorded at Sun Records. That was a fusion of music, just as Stax and soul music is a fusion of rhythm and blues and gospel music. 
   Steve Cropper, one of the famous Booker T. and the MGs musicians and song writers, along with Duck Dunn, Booker T. Jones and the late Al Jackson, said, the main reason Stax was so singular and phenomenal was that we had no idea what we were doing. Kind of reminds you of Congress on occasion, like last week, but we had no idea what we were doing. I guess you'd say there was a kind of magic in not knowing, and that made it special. 
   As Cropper noted, everything that made Stax great was, at its essence, beautifully raw and largely untutored. Certainly, that kind of description makes so many things in America so great. 
   Mr. Speaker, what made Stax so great was it was a natural energy and it was a coming together of blacks and whites. The House band there was Booker T. and the MGs. Steve Copper and Duck Dunn are Caucasian, and Al Jackson and Booker T. Jones are African American. And they put out the music. They didn't put out white onions, they didn't put out red onions. They didn't put out yellow onions. They put out ``Green Onions,'' and because of ``Green Onions,'' the world rocks to a Memphis beat and Stax soul. 
   The Memphis Horns were two gentlemen, Andrew Love and Wayne Jackson, one black and one white. That's the story that Memphis had in music, and it's the story that Memphis and this country need to have to come together and move forward.     
   Stax is an embodiment of the American dream, the promised land, as Dr. King would call it. I am pleased the House considers this bill today, and welcome the gentleman from Arizona's manager's amendment which recognizes the important role that Memphis played in immortalizing the great genre of soul music at large. 
   Now at the site of the old Stax headquarters and studio on historic McLemore Avenue is the Stax Museum of American Soul Music. It is the world's only soul music museum. No matter what Detroit might say, Memphis has the world's only soul music museum, and you need to come to Memphis and visit the Stax Museum of American Soul Music. The many exhibits there include award-winning documentary film and an authentic 100-year-old Mississippi Delta church that was home to the gospel roots of soul music, original studio equipment, costumes, artwork and memorabilia intended to preserve the legacy of American soul music and its contributions worldwide. 
   Stax was founded in 1957, not on a specific day with a cornerstone laid by the masons, but generally in 1957. That's the way soul music was. There is not exactly a date for it. It's just kind of a thing that happened. It was Jim Stewart and his sister, Estelle Axton. Jim Stewart's last name, Stewart starts with S-t, and Ms. Axton's, Ax, together S-t-a-x. Stax Records came together with Jim Stewart and Estelle Axton. They put the Stax in Stax music. 
   Stax Records brought forth so many hits. Otis Redding, ``(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay,'' and I have got to parenthetically relate a personal story. I was a freshman at Vanderbilt University one night when Otis Redding performed in the Bar-Kays. The Bar-Kays, a great instrumental group, ``Soul Finger'' was their big hit. Ben Cauley, James Alexander are the surviving members. 
   Two days after they performed at Vanderbilt, their plane crashed. Just as when the Big Bopper's plane crashed, soul music would have crashed. We lost great, great talents, Otis Redding and the Bar-Kays that night. 
   Fortunately, Mr. Cauley missed the plane and Mr. Alexander wasn't on it. But it was a night I will remember and all students at Vanderbilt will remember as well. We saw their next-to-last concert. 
   But Otis came to Memphis to do ``(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay,'' the Staple Singers, ``Respect Yourself,'' Sam & Dave, famed for ``Hold On! I'm Comin,'' as well as ``I'm a Soul Man,'' Gene Knight's ``Mr. Big Stuff,'' so many instrumentals by Booker T. & the MGs; Eddie Floyd came to Memphis to do ``Knock on Wood.'' Other great musicians performed there, the Mar-Keys and others. 
   It is fitting this resolution be considered this month of June, which is Black Music Month. Black Music Month recognizes the outstanding contributions African American singers have made to our Nation. 
   This Friday, June 22, the Memphis Orpheum Theatre will celebrate this occasion with a concert entitled ``50 Years of Stax: A Concert to Benefit the Stax Museum of American Soul Music.'' Artists scheduled to perform at the event include such legendary talents as Isaac Hayes of ``Shaft'' fame, and one of the nicest human beings you would ever want to meet, and I have had that great fortune; Booker T. & the MGs, Eddie Floyd, William Bell Mavis Staples, the Soul Children and the Reddings will be honoring their father, the late legendary Otis Redding. 
   I am honored this resolution recognizes their talents, as well as such legendary artists as Aretha Franklin, who was born in Memphis; B.B. King; Albert King, no relation, but just as good at putting hot licks on those guitars; the Memphis Horns, Wayne Jackson & Andrew Love, Sam & Dave, the Mar-Keys; and even though not on Stax Records, Al Green and his legendary producer Willie Mitchell can't not be mentioned for all they did for Memphis music. 
   David Porter was a great songwriter. He'll be there too in the Stax Days. Stax Records was something special for Memphis and the country. It lives on through the museum, but it also lives on through now the Concord Music Group, which just announced the relaunch of Stax Records as a creative home for present-day soul stars such as Angie Stone, Soulive, Lalah Hathaway and Leon Ware who will be performing as well, and they will be joined along with other heritage artists such as Isaac Hayes to record on this label which has returned to its prominent place in Memphis and hopefully a prominent place in the charts. 
   It is a great honor and privilege that the House of Representatives would consider this bill today. I am thankful to have the opportunity to sponsor this legislation because of the great impact soul music has had on my life, the lives of my constituents, so many of us here in Congress and so many Americans. 
   Tomorrow is Juneteenth. Juneteenth is the anniversary of the last free emancipation of slaves. The word got to east Texas that the Emancipation Proclamation had been signed in 1863. It wasn't until 1865, June 19, the news got to Texas and all the slaves were freed. It's appropriate that in Black Music Month, during the celebration of Juneteenth and weekend before last,  Middle Passage Weekend, when we celebrate the people who made their passage, and some were so brave that rather than put themselves into slavery as Jews at Masada in the same way gave up their lives rather than be enslaved that we honor Stax Records. 
   It's going to be a great night Friday night. We will remember our heritage in Memphis. We will remember our heritage in America. And we have a new future with a recording label, with Stax Records. I urge every one to be soulful, to listen to soul music and ask the House of Representatives to pass H. Res. 154.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my freshman colleague from Hawaii for bringing this particular resolution. It is appropriate that she honors her predecessor, Congresswoman Mink, who did so much in this Hall. In passing this bill, she did some of the things that were similar to civil rights laws of the 1960s in a continuum, because discrimination, whether it be race or gender or national origin or sexual orientation, is wrong. 
   There are barriers this country needs to tear down and present a level playing field and an opportunity for all to enjoy the benefits of America. It is what Dr. King did talk about when he looked forward to getting to the Promised Land. That's part of what the Promised Land was, is, and will be. And so I thank the gentlelady for bringing the resolution. 
   I am going to take an opportunity here to make a mea culpa. Earlier, when I had to address the House on Stax Records, I forgot a few people. And one of the people I forgot was a women, Carla Thomas, who did ``Gee Whiz,'' and her father, Rufus Thomas, who did ``Walking the Dog.'' In music, many of the Stax Record people were men, they were the Staple Singers, but Carla Thomas was a great singer. And there are so many fields that have been opened up. 
   When I looked at the statistics that were made available to me, before title IX only 9 percent of the graduates from medical school were women. In 2004, there were 46 percent. In law, 7 percent had J.D. degrees for women, now 49 percent. When you think about those numbers, and that was just 35 years ago, Mr. Speaker, it's amazing how far we've come from the discrimination that existed at that time because of gender and what Representative Mink and the United States Congress' work did. It shows what can be positive and good about government. 
   There is a lot of good things that government can do and does do, and people forget that. If it weren't for civil rights pioneers, there would still be segregation. If it weren't for the work of the Congress in the middle 1960s, there would still be discrimination possibly in housing and public employment and other public facilities. And if it weren't for Congresswoman Mink, there would be discrimination against women. There is much good that comes. Forces within society help, but they propel people in government to act and take action that this Congress has seen has made America a greater place. 
   So it is my honor to stand and support the passage of this resolution that celebrates the 35th anniversary of title IX. It tells us just how far we've come in 35 years, but how just 35 years ago there were these limits. And the fact is, it was only 87 years ago that women got the right to vote. Mr. Speaker, 87 years ago women could not vote in this country, but this Congress, through a passage of a constitutional amendment, passed eventually by Tennessee as the perfect 36th State, gave women the right to vote in this country. So we've come a long way, but we've got a long way to go. And it is an honor to participate in this 35th anniversary. 
   I thank the gentlelady for giving me the time.

   Earlier this year, on the budget, Congressman Cooper and I cosponsored an amendment to include this in the budget. Unfortunately, it didn't make it through the Senate, and I am proud to be here to support this amendment with Congressman Cooper. 
   In my district, LeMoyne-Owen College has struggled financially. It is an institution of long and historic import to our community. It survived this year. It has difficulties with its financial base, but it has done much for our city in educating young people and continues to do so. 
   This provision would give LeMoyne and Fisk, which has had some financial difficulties, and other schools like Bennett and Wiley, additional help so they can continue to serve a mission that is unique in this country. 
   Anybody who saw the movie ``The Great Debaters'' should be able to understand what Historically Black Colleges and Universities mean to many people in this country. There are alumni of Fisk University, LeMoyne-Owen, Wiley, and other Historically Black Colleges and Universities which see their institutions being threatened with elimination. That is a serious thing. We consider our colleges part of ourselves and almost part of our family, that is part of your home, your mother, in essence. To have it disappear is wrong. 
   LeMoyne-Owen is a good institution, as is Fisk, as is Wiley, and this amendment would help them stay capable of surviving and servicing people who want an education in this atmosphere, and I wholeheartedly support this amendment and thank Congressman Cooper for bringing it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, back in February when this Congress started the 110th, there was a proposal up here, a resolution that passed with mostly Democrat support, very few Republicans, to say we supported the troops but we opposed the surge or the escalation. Since that time, we have put 20,000 or 30,000 more troops into Iraq, and since that time we have had some of the deadliest months that we have incurred in this failed war in the Middle East. 
   As time has gone on, we have seen Senators VOINOVICH; LAMAR ALEXANDER from my home State; LUGAR; and others on the Republican side in the Senate come forth and say we need a change of direction. The handwriting has been on the wall in both cloakrooms. The handwriter got to the Democratic cloakroom a lot sooner than apparently the handwriter got to the Republican cloakroom. Either that, or the optometrist hasn't made it over to the other side. But the handwriting is on the wall, and in the interim there are American men and women dying needlessly. Over 3,600 have died; many, many, many, many more casualties, and the cost to this country will be great. 
   While I was home during the home workweek, I saw a lady who told me her son has been at Desert Storm. He was still in the military. He had been in Iraq once before. And she told me he told her, Mother, I am proud to fight for my country. I have done it twice. But there is no purpose over there, there is no reason to be over there. We need to come home. I have heard it over and over and over again from the mothers of the soldiers who come home with testimony to our failed foreign policy. 
   How many, how many, how many more must die? How many more limbs must be lost before the handwriting on the wall in the Republican cloakroom is read? I ask you to look in your own hearts. Think of the soldiers as your children, they are your constituents, and help redeploy them. We are not saying in this proposal that we come home entirely. We keep troops for certain causes.

   Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, the great poet, Maya Angelou said, ``When I knew better, I did better.'' 
   I am a member of the Progressive Caucus, proudly so, because I believe that we must always strive to do better to truly make progress. 
   A sign of intelligence and learning is to take the knowledge that we have acquired and adjust our goals accordingly. For some, it seems to be a badge of honor to stay the course, no matter what facts have come to light to contradict that course. 
   So what did some think they knew then, and what do we actually know now? 
   Some thought Iraq played a part in the attacks of 9/11. Now we know better. 
   Some thought that invading Iraq would not diminish our ability to continue our mission in Afghanistan, defeat the Taliban, and find Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the terrorist attacks in America. Now we know better, but we still don't know where Osama bin Laden is. 
   Some thought that the intelligence used by the President to lead us to war was accurate. Now we know better. 
   Some thought that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which could not be discovered by the U.N. peacekeepers. Now we know better. 
   Some thought that Saddam Hussein tried to purchase yellow cake uranium from Niger. Now we know better. 
   Some thought that we did not need the support of the free world to enter into war. Now we know better. 
   Some thought we would never send our troops into harm's way without proper equipment. Now we know better. 
   Some people thought the people of Iraq would welcome us with open arms, and that the war would be won swiftly. Now we know better. 
   Some thought on May 1, 2003, some 4 years ago, that the mission was accomplished. Our President told us so on an aircraft carrier in a photo-op. Now we know better. 
   Most importantly, we know that young Americans have heeded their country's call and have placed themselves in harm's way to serve America. There is nothing nobler than the sacrifice made by our men and women in uniform. But such sacrifice should never be secured through deception. Now we know better, and we must do better. 
   Early on, many of my colleagues in the Progressive Caucus did not believe all they were being told about the connection between 9/11 and the terrorists and Iraq. We were all very concerned that pursuing an invasion of Iraq would be an act of aggression unheard of in our Nation's history. 
   What makes America unique is we believe that our Nation is founded on the rule of law, and that is what has made our country great and why we have been respected all over the world. 
   Millions of Americans put faith in the administration. Many could not have imagined that such a disastrous course would be pursued without truth beyond the assurances that were given. But now we know. 
   We know we have lost the goodwill of many of our allies. We know we have no exit strategy. We know that more Americans will sacrifice their lives. We know that mothers, fathers, wives, husbands and children will weep. Children will be orphaned, and young people will spend their lives maimed. And for what? 
   We can choose enlightenment or we can choose blind ignorance. We can choose to wrap ourselves in the American flag and claim that anyone who demands answers about the reasons for sending our troops into harm's way is unpatriotic and does not support our troops. 
   We can choose to use the knowledge we now have, or we can cling irrationally to the President's failed policies that led us to war. 
   The Earth is not flat. The sun does not resolve around the Earth, and we did not go to war for the reasons we were told. I don't know what the real reasons were. Maybe we will never know. But we do know better now and, knowing better, we must do better. 
   That is why I support this resolution, why I support our troops, why I oppose the escalation, and why we must follow the recommendations of the Baker-Hamilton Commission and shift from the war zone to the diplomatic arena. We have gone from shock and awe to aw shucks.  
   And escalating this war by putting 20,000 Americans into the streets of Baghdad, ala Mogadishu, aka Blackhawk Down, is inviting a 21st century Pickett's Charge or a Charge of the Light Brigade. 
   May God save us if the President of the United States will not.

<DOCNO>Mr. COHEN. (AMERICA IS GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I had a 1-minute prepared to talk about the debate on Iraq, but I think what is more appropriate at this time is to talk about what this House of Representatives has experienced since January 4. 
   The doors of this House of Representatives, indeed this country, have been opened to thought, perspectives and issues that have been stifled for the last 12 years. I want to thank the Speaker for her leadership, for the leadership of the Democratic Party, and the chairman and what they brought forward. The first woman ever elected Speaker in this country's history, the first African American to be elected Clerk. History is being made with the issues coming forth from middle America for people who are in need, for the future of this planet. 
   I want to thank the Speaker. America is going in the right direction.

<DOCNO>Mr. COHEN. (UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS AND THEIR NUMBER ONE RANKING -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, 25 years ago, I was a freshman member of the Tennessee State Senate, and on that occasion, the University of Memphis now, then Memphis State University, became number one in the country in basketball. It was the first time that we had ever had a number one ranking, and I got up on the floor of the Tennessee Senate and spoke proudly about my basketball team and their number one ranking. That night, my Tigers lost, and they were no longer number one. 
   Well, today, 25 years later and a freshman Member in the United States House of Representatives, the University of Memphis is again the number one basketball team in the country. Should I talk about them? Not.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, as an alumnus of the University of Memphis Law School and the congressman from the University of Memphis district, I still grieve over the outcome of the game Monday night, but I want to congratulate the University of Kansas for winning the national basketball championship and thank the city of San Antonio for being such a wonderful host. 
   On behalf of the citizens of Memphis, I want the country to know we love our team. They brought our city together, which needed a unifying force. We are proud that our coach who made that team what it was has been named the National Coach of the Year by the Naismith Society. 
   Our players played valiantly. We came very, very close to a national championship. We won more games than any team in NCAA history. We will look back upon this year with fondness and appreciation and we will, like General MacArthur, return.
