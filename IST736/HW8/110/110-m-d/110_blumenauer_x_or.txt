<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I thank the gentleman for his kind words and for his leadership on this issue. 
   I rise in support of this legislation, but, frankly, we've waited too long to get to this point. We have watched as this administration has exploded the national debt. We have watched the growth in the gross domestic product slow 35 percent in this administration over the previous one. Median incomes declined. The savings rates have gone negative, and the trade deficit has doubled. 
   Most important, they ignored the symptoms of the subprime mortgage markets, a failure to exercise reasonable oversight. This legislation is an important first step towards rebalancing the equity. 
   I commend the Speaker for targeting aid for those who need it most. I appreciate what my friend from Massachusetts Mr. Frank has focused on, to make it easier for hard-pressed families to refinance their loans. I hope before we get through this process that we'll be able to add to it unemployment and food stamp benefits, which will have even more stimulative effect.  
   After this bill, we need to deal with issues of infrastructure, making sure that we don't shut down our wind energy production tax credit, and deal with bankruptcy equity so that homeowners get the same protections as people who speculated in property. 
   Last but not least, I hope that this is the beginning of real progress in Congress that becomes a critical issue of accountability on the campaign trail so that next year we won't have to make compromises that compromise what we need to do for the American family.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (ACKNOWLEDGING IRAQIS AT RISK -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, there is fierce debate and dissension on this floor and in Congress and around the country about the war in Iraq. This disagreement runs deep. It is profound. I believe it to be sincere. But there is one thing that everybody will agree on regardless of whether they think this war is merited or not, regardless of whether they think it has been prosecuted in a reasonable and efficient manner or not. They can acknowledge the debt and obligation that the United States has to over 4 million Iraqis who have been forced to flee their homes. This is a humanitarian crisis that rivals Darfur. It is the worst ongoing humanitarian crisis in the world at this point. 
   Over 2 million Iraqis have fled their country. And while there is debate over the precise numbers these days, whether it is an additional 25,000 a month or 50,000 a month, whether it is going up or going down, no one disputes that they are still fleeing their homes by the thousands. 
   I first became involved with the problem of the Iraqis who are at risk because they help the United States, guides and translators, when I started working with a group of high school students in Portland, Oregon, at Lincoln High School, who were working in turn with some Oregon National Guard members who had returned to Oregon but were trying desperately to save the life of a young woman who had served as their translator. Because she had helped the Americans, she was targeted. She and her family were targeted by extremists. It took months. Time doesn't permit going through all the hurdles that we encountered. Luckily, that young woman is safely in the United States now going to college and she is no longer at risk, although afraid to show her face or to be identified specifically for fear that her family would in turn be targeted. I made a commitment to those young people in the high school and in the Oregon National Guard that we would work to introduce comprehensive legislation to make it easier to meet the obligation to those who took America at its word, who helped our brave soldiers, and who in turn now have their lives imperiled. 
   We have introduced comprehensive legislation that would increase the allowable number that could come, that would put somebody in charge of this responsibility, make it possible to actually be processed in country. 
   It is ironic that we have the largest embassy in the world in Baghdad, and yet the Iraqis have to leave the country to seek refugee status. They can't go to the green zone and this vast embassy. They have to leave the country in order to apply for asylum. 
   I frankly was encouraged that last week our colleagues in the Senate made important progress by passing an amendment to the Senate defense authorization bill that would start to address the crisis by including some of the elements in the comprehensive legislation that I have introduced. It is an important first step, but it is only a first step. It is time for the United States to do the right thing for these people whose lives are imperiled. 
   When we started this process at the beginning of the fiscal year, the United States was going to allow 7,000 people in the country. A small number, actually, by comparison to what little Sweden, for example, was willing to do, a country a fraction of our size, and they aren't the country who engineered this war nor are occupying Iraq. Well, in a few months that goal of 7,000 was reduced to 2,000. As the fiscal year ended this last weekend, we fell short even of that reduced goal: Only 1,600 of these Iraqi refugees were brought into this country. 
   Our failure to step up is having serious operational consequences. Ambassador Crocker in a memo that has been I suppose leaked but widely published, widely disseminated here in Washington, DC, points out that the failure to help these people who are helping us actually undermines the ability to have other guides and interpreters and people working with us. We risk leaving a legacy of despair, undermining our credibility in the Middle East, to say nothing of the thousands of people whose lives are at risk. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in passing comprehensive legislation that will deal with this humanitarian crisis, at least for the people who are most at risk for having put their trust in the United States as they worked to help us.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy in permitting me to speak on this resolution and for the leadership of his Foreign Affairs Committee in bringing this forward. 
   Madam Speaker, one of the most inspiring events of my life was being able to spend an afternoon with Aung San Suu Kyi in her compound in Burma with my son and daughter. Having a chance to meet this gentle woman, a clarion voice for democracy, for human rights, a strong and steadfast beacon for the 50 million people. Burma, a country that a generation ago was poised to be one of the bedrocks of that area in southeast Asia, a country that is rich in natural resources, with a gentle and sophisticated people have been taken over, as my colleagues have mentioned, by a gang of thugs. The Burmese have suffered untold privation, brutality by the regime as symbolized by their treatment of this gentle woman who was appropriately awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. It is time for us not only to speak resolutely but for us to work behind the scenes and overtly with countries like China, India and Thailand that can, in fact, have a significant influence on the behavior of the government in Burma. We must work for the Asean countries and speak with one voice about the intolerable behavior that is being evidenced by this regime. 
   There are many areas that the United States is involved with internationally where there isn't a consensus, where Members on this floor will debate with themselves and disagree about the best path forward. Yet as it relates to Burma, I think there is no debate. There is no confusion. There is no division. We need to speak as one. We need to work to fashion that international consensus. We need to make sure that we use every resource possible to put the spotlight on the problem, and help save the Burmese people.

   This resolution represents the lowest common denominator, I think, but it's important for us to expand it, to deal with budget accountability. I personally don't want to have one more dime for waging war but, rather, move it forward in terms of securing the peace. 
   I want to stop the open-ended commitment, hopefully revisiting the terms of the authority, move legislation to deal with the poor souls who are trapped in Iraq, refugees who relied on the United States and we've turned our back on them. Let's have some added accountability for the outsourcing of the war through private contractors, and certainly stop the drumbeat of war for Iran. I hope this will be the first of many debates on specifics every week, hopefully every day. 
   I appreciate, Mr. Skelton, what you have done. There is no one who cares more deeply about our troops. There is nobody who has tried to sound the alarm about these disastrous policies. I hope we can work with you to expand this debate, to increase the accountability so that ultimately we achieve peace in Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENTS TO H.R. 6, ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy, his leadership on this bill and for yielding me this time. 
   Listening to the debate here on the rule, as I sat through the hearing last night in the Rules Committee, I am, frankly, more than a little disappointed in the discussion that has taken place. 
   First of all, this is a very large and complex bill, but the vast majority of this bill has actually already passed the House at least once, some of it twice. We have had 11 committees that have been involved in this process. It has not somehow been ``sprung'' on people. There is a large stack of paper that represents the bill, as is the case in most complex legislation. But most of it is familiar to the staff. It is familiar to the Members, if they choose to have been involved with this issue. It has been here before. 
   The process that has taken place is not one that we would have desired, but the Republicans in the Senate decided that there would not be a conference committee. But there has been a process that has gone on which I don't think it has been fairly characterized, frankly, where there has been extensive back-and-forth, where House and Senate staff committee members from the various jurisdictions met since September, have met in the same room going over these details. And, in fact, you can verify this is you talk to staff members on both sides. Republican staff members have been able to influence what has been going on here. Indeed I think majority staff members will acknowledge positively the technical expertise that has been provided and print out changes Republicans have influenced. But all of that is sort of swept away and ignored. That is wrong. 
   Fundamentally, we want to talk about what we are for. This deals with a significant increase in CAFE standards. There is lots of new energy here because we focus the alternatives on the energy sources that need tax support. And we pay for it, although it is scaled down from what has already passed the House. I think people ought to look at the Record.

Well, you know, think for a moment about the abuses we see worldwide in terms of corruption and environmental abuse, and we have those for a reason. 
   But even if you're going to ignore that, if you think environmental protection and administrative controls are infringements on freedom and unnecessary, gee, as my friend from West Virginia points out, you passed an energy bill in 2005 that was supposed to streamline it. The Republicans and two oilmen have been in charge for the last 7 1/2 years. If it doesn't work right, whose fault is that administratively? 
   I would suggest the gentleman look in the mirror and then vote for our legislation.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, we are soon going to be greeted by a photo-op in the Arctic with some of our Republican friends doing a little flyover. It is an example of their ``drillusion.'' 
   We have been fighting the Republican energy policy that is trapped in the 1950s. For the first 12 years I was in Congress they made it impossible, indeed, sometimes even illegal to even study improving fuel efficiency standards for cars. 
   For the last 7 1/2 years, we have had two Texas oilmen in the White House, their secret energy task force, their disastrous 2005 Energy Act and, by the way, their Dept. of Energy which missed all 34 deadlines to improve appliance efficiency. 
   And what do we get from years of Republican control and their energy policy? $4.35 cent a gallon gasoline. 
   Democrats, from the beginning, have provided new energy incentives. We have improved auto fuel efficiency standards for the first time in 30 years. And today we are going to have the Drill Responsibly on Leased Lands Act, the DRILL Act, to use the millions of acres they already have to be able to provide oil for this country. Together we can solve this gas price crisis which is the result of the President's failed energy policy and our addiction to foreign oil.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy in permitting me to speak on this rule. 
   I am pleased that after 12 years of not just ignoring the needs of working men and women and their needed labor protections, but actually what we have seen is a concerted, specific program that has undermined those rights, I am pleased to see this legislation come forth today. 
   I am pleased that the gentleman from California will have the opportunity to put his substitute before us and be able to debate back and forth. 
   As the gentleman from New Jersey pointed out, there are clear differences of opinion, but the facts are that we are simply strengthening opportunities for working men and women to overcome the serious abuse of the organizing process in this country. 
   Time after time, we have had examples of where there have been clear cases of unfair labor practices that have undercut the opportunity for men and women to represent themselves. Often they win a sort of hollow victory because long after the fact, there is a slap on the hand for the company that doesn't play by the rules long after the damage has been done. 
   What we need to do is have an appropriate process that guarantees the rights of working men and women in this country to organize. This legislation provides additional, valuable tools. 
   I am under no illusion, given the attitude of this administration, and perhaps what will happen in the other body, that this bill which I hope passes today in the House, is going to become law anytime soon. It is however a long overdue signal that people in this House are going to stand up for the rights of working men and women, give them an opportunity to organize, and that we are going to reestablish a level playing field. We will be able to help organized labor, the people who brought us the 8-hour day, the people who brought us the weekend. It is time to allow them the opportunity to extend the rights of organized labor to other folks in the workforce. 
   One of the first things I did as an elected official was be involved with collective bargaining rights for public employees in Oregon. There were all sorts of dire predictions about what was going to happen, but in fact, what has occurred is that we were able to provide a framework for solving issues that affected people in the workforce. 
   As luck would have it, later in my career, I was on the other side of the bargaining table, working to represent management, but I never regretted having an aggressive, effective program for organized labor to be able to collectively bargain. 
   This is the most civilized, effective and appropriate way to resolve workforce issues, and this legislation today is an important step in that direction. 
   I urge support of the rule. I urge support of the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Chairman, the history of organized labor in the United States goes beyond the colorful to include stories of drama, heated conflict, and even violence. 
   Any objective view of history shows that legitimate efforts of workers to organize and represent themselves have been subjected to an amazing array of extraordinarily aggressive behaviors on the part of employers and at times even of the government itself. Indeed it was regarded by many business and government leaders as a subversive activity. There has been violence and intimidation on both sides but systematic repression against workers is certainly one of the darker chapters in our history. 
   Over the last century, organized labor has brought about the five-day workweek, overtime pay, and workplace protection; ultimately, unions helped create America's middle class. These are benefits that we now take for granted, but which were fought by many business interests who had taken advantage of unorganized workers. These issues arose out of intense conflict and were faced with great difficulty. There are numerous examples in today's workplace that attest to the continuing need for workplace protection. 
   Recently we have found that the Federal Government has no longer been serving as a neutral protector of collective bargaining within the organizing process. I'm convinced that legitimate rights have been systematically undercut and the Federal Government has been indifferent, at best, to providing a level playing field to workers and redress against abuse. 
   Today's Employee Free Choice Act is a small step in correcting that imbalance by restoring choice in a system that is currently driven by aggressive employers and coercion, as well as anti-union consultants. Instituting a level playing field for workers who want to unionize will ultimately improve wages, working conditions and job security for workers. 
   While it is highly unlikely, given this administration's antagonism toward organized labor, that this legislation would ever find its way into law, passage of this bill today in the House is a vital and important step in giving workers a toehold again. 
   This legislation will help end the official hostility and indifference by initiating a process that spotlights workers' opportunities and employers' responsibilities. I am confident that  the passage of the Employee Free Choice Act will ultimately give unionizing rights to all workers.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support today's legislation to extend unemployment benefits at a time of economic hardship for families in Oregon and across the country. There are currently over 106,000 unemployed workers in Oregon and as many as 3.8 million nationally who are struggling with the rising cost of food and fuel. 
   Today's legislation will immediately provide up to 13 weeks of extended unemployment benefits in every state to workers exhausting their 26 weeks of regular unemployment benefits. In states with levels of unemployment at 6 percent or higher, an additional 13 weeks would be available for a total of 26 weeks of extended benefits. 
   In my home state of Oregon, our economy has weakened but remained at the relative national average of 5.5 percent. However, that is an unemployment rate 0.5 percent higher than this time last year. Although Oregonians would not qualify at this time for the second extension of benefits, it gives me peace of mind to know that safety nets are in place if the Oregon economy gets bleaker. Many in Oregon well remember the downturn in 2003 when during the summer the unemployment exceeded 8.5 percent, the highest in the country. 
   During major economic slowdowns, unemployed workers are the hardest hit. Not only do they suffer a loss of wages, but they face a tighter job market in which to return. Extending these workers' benefits is not only morally correct; it is also good for our ailing economy. The Congressional Budget office estimates that every $1 spent on unemployment benefits generates $1.64 in new economic demand. 
   I am pleased that Democrats have moved quickly to pass this benefits extension for the workers who need it most. I hope that the Senate will move quickly and the President will refrain from vetoing this legislation so that American families can get the help they need.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy. 
   I urge my colleagues to invest in our children's health by approving this bipartisan legislation. 
   It amazes me that the President of the United States can support testing our children in school repeatedly under No Child Left Behind, but doesn't think we should test them for hepatitis, let alone vaccinate them against the disease. 
   The President claims that everybody already has access to health care through the emergency room. This is not only callous; it's a terrible way to get health care and it is factually wrong. Every family does not have access. 
   Now, there are no surprises here in this legislation. No matter how often the President or some of his apologists here on the Republican side of the aisle say it, this is not a giveaway to the middle class; it's not socialized medicine. That's why 86 percent of our Governors, including 16 Republican Governors, support this legislation and are looking, actually, to use it to increase the number of vulnerable families who receive health care. 
   How can some claim that ours is the best health care system in the world when it is inaccessible to 10 million of our most vulnerable citizens, our children of working class families, none of whom can afford their own health care? 
   I urge my colleagues to take a stand, join this bipartisan consensus, vote to extend the program, and resist the President's veto.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I share my colleagues' concern about the possibility of a nuclear armed Iran, so it is with regret that I must vote against this bill. Similarly to other bills that purported to sanction Iran and which I voted against, this legislation doesn't provide additional tools for diplomacy. Rather it limits the President's flexibility to use sanctions as a tool to deal with the Iranian challenge. However, by focusing the sanctions within it on third-parties such as Russia and Australia, this bill would make it more difficult to maintain the united international diplomatic front that is critical to resolving the Iranian situation peacefully. 
   We need to craft a new framework for relations with Iran; one that advances our interests and values through engagement and support for the Iranian people. I believe it is more important than ever for forceful U.S. diplomatic re-engagement to support peace, democracy, and a more secure regional dynamic. We must also undertake the difficult, yet critical, task of engaging directly and honestly with Iran, despite its often destructive and destabilizing role. The lack of a serious diplomatic relationship strengthens those who seek chaos and isolation, while leaving the U.S. with fewer levers of influence and more blind spots than we can afford. 
   Faced with the prospect of nuclear war with the Soviet Union, President John F. Kennedy said, ``Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.'' For the United States and our friends in the Middle East, the prospect of continued terror, violence, and instability is too dire to do otherwise.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support the reauthorization of Amtrak. This bipartisan bill authorizes $14.4 billion over five years and is Amtrak's first full reauthorization since 1997. The bill includes $4.2 billion for capital grants, $3 billion for operations, and $1.75 billion over five years for grants for high-speed rail corridors. This marks a major step in the right direction at a time when consumers around the country are struggling with high gasoline prices and limited transportation options. 
   At the same time, I am sobered by Chairman Oberstar's remarks highlighting a European initiative to spend $350 billion on their rail system. Over the past decade, the United States, by contrast, has barely doled out enough resources to allow Amtrak to limp along. Our Nation must invest in our infrastructure if we expect to remain competitive. This bill takes the first steps in that direction. I would support further action to expand and improve intercity passenger service in the United States. 
   In Oregon, the state transportation department partners with Amtrak to provide service along the Eugene-Portland-Seattle-Vancouver, BC corridor, a federally-designated high speed rail corridor, known as the Cascades line. While Oregon and Washington pay for the Cascades service, Amtrak operates the train, and this arrangement has proven to be a very successful partnership. 
   Ridership on the Oregon segment of the line, which has two daily roundtrip trains, has nearly quadrupled since it was initiated in 1994, rising to over 130,000 passengers in 2006. Total ridership on the Cascades service rose over 7 percent last year, reaching 674,000 passengers, making the Northwest high speed rail corridor the seventh most heavily traveled in the country. With gas prices high, ridership on the corridor for the first quarter of 2008 is up 14.4 percent compared to the first quarter of 2007. This train service is an important part of the region's transportation system on the congested 1-5 corridor. 
   As successful as the Cascades service is, however, reaching its full potential will require additional investments in the rail line to allow Oregon and Amtrak to increase the frequency and reliability of service. The authorization of capital grants for this purpose will provide needed system upgrades and will strengthen this successful partnership. 
   I am also supportive of Congressman Oberstar's manager's amendment, which allows for grants to create bike storage on Amtrak trains. Much of the increased ridership in Oregon and around the country is a result of people changing their work commutes to include public transportation. Many commuters, however, still need their bikes to get to and from the train stations, or for transportation at their destination. By equipping our trains with bike storage we offer people more choices and we do so in a way that is efficient, economical, and good for the environment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you, Madam Speaker. 
   This week, hundreds of cyclists from around America will descend on Capitol Hill to advocate on behalf of America's 100 million people who enjoy bicycling for recreation, for their livelihood, and some for basic transportation. 
   With 176 members of the Congressional Bicycle Caucus, I know there will be great receptivity in many offices, but it is time for everybody to take these men and women very seriously when they bring their message to Capitol Hill. 
   Yes, bicycling is fun. We know that from our youth. Everybody seems to have a bicycling story that they love to tell. However, there are many reasons why bicycling should be taken very seriously by policymakers. Consider the times. Remember last year when oil averaged $72 per barrel and gasoline averaged $2.81 per gallon and how people were deeply concerned about those increases over just the year before? Well, already oil is significantly over $100 a barrel and rising gasoline prices are expected to perhaps reach as much as $4 a gallon this summer. 
   There is also an emerging consensus on global warming that it is not just an urgent problem, but that transportation is the largest source of carbon emissions that we can manage quickly to reduce. The carbon emissions from riding a bicycle to work or to the store or for exercise are zero. 
   Consider the livability of our cities and neighborhoods as we are struggling with traffic congestion, air pollution, and the quality of life in every neighborhood and downtown and everywhere in between. Bicycles, obviously, make a huge difference there. 
   Last but not least, impacts on our health. There is great unease about soaring health care costs. There is a childhood obesity epidemic. The bicycle is the simplest, most cost-effective way to be able to enhance our health as we enhance the quality of life for our young people. Think for a moment right now how many people somewhere in America are stuck in traffic on their way to ride a stationary bike at a health club. These are all initiatives that can be dealt with by taking over 100 million bicycles that are stored in our garages and basements and locked to a back porch and putting them to use. The role for the Federal Government is not to tilt in favor of cycling, although I could certainly make that argument, but just to level the playing field. 
   Why do some Members of Congress think it's all right to give tax benefits to commuters that burn gasoline to help them cushion their costs, but are against providing modest tax benefits for those who burn calories instead? Three times the House of Representatives has passed a modest reform for bike commuter equity, but it has yet to be enacted into law. 
   Mostly it's time to set the table for the massive transportation reauthorization that will be before us next Congress. I have introduced House Concurrent Resolution 305, which would be the first comprehensive bicycling policy statement as a guide for authorization and beyond. 
   I urge my colleagues to look at it. It's the simplest, most cost-effective direction the Federal Government can give to make more transportation choices for Americans, to provide safer opportunities for our children to get to school, to deal with health and climate change, and to heal our communities while we strengthen our bodies and improve our spirits. 
   Bicyclists are an indicator species of a livable community, a place where our families are safe, healthy and economically secure. It's time for the Federal Government to step up and do its part.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, after five years, thousands of lives lost, and hundreds of billions of dollars spent and trillions to go, the amendments adopted today are the beginning of a solution in Iraq. These amendments mandate the beginning of withdrawal, setting us on a path out of Iraq, and support critical domestic and international priorities. 
   The language offers some of the same prescriptions in my own Iraq legislation, including a ban on permanent bases and an increase in contractor oversight. All too often we hear reports of billions of dollars our contractors can't account for, or the hiring of individuals our troops can't rely on. This war will cost over $3 trillion, and I am pleased to see some funding shifted to cover more of our international obligations. I authored legislation to help the 4 million displaced Iraqis and I support the funding in this bill for migration and refugee assistance and international disaster assistance. We have a responsibility to the Iraqi people, and as we have an obligation to provide for our own. 
   Part of remedying this tragedy will be rebuilding the health and readiness of our armed forces. In my state, the Oregon National Guard's 41st Combat Brigade Team has served two tours in Iraq and Afghanistan since 9/11, and is scheduled to deploy again in 2009. When they return, these brave men and women deserve the best care this country can provide and the least we can do is make sure education and retraining is available and affordable. I am proud to support an expansion of the GI Bill education benefits that proved so successful in transitioning our troops after W orId War II and in mobilizing our economy for succeeding generations. Frankly I find it unconscionable that President Bush, as Commander in Chief of our armed forces, would threaten to veto this legislation on account of this basic and historic investment in our troops. 
   This country is ready for change, and these amendments are an important step forward. As this issue develops over the coming weeks, I remain committed to getting our troops out of Iraq now and providing our veterans with the best care available.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I support S. 5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, because it is a critical advancement in scientific research. The medical possibilities from stem cells continue to excite the scientific community, holding great promise for therapies to alleviate human suffering from diseases such as diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, and cancer. Perhaps no area provides more potential to revolutionize the lives of Americans than the ability to avoid or cure debilitating diseases. It is time for the Federal government to be a full partner in the critical advancement of stem cell research. 
   This legislation enables scientists to pursue research in a responsible, ethical manner, through the utilization of the 400,000 surplus embryos currently frozen in storage at fertilization clinics across the U.S. The strict confines of this legislation present no threat to the sanctity of human life. I strongly concur with the National Institute for Health Director's statement that it is in the best interests of our scientists, our science, and our country to pursue all aspects of stem cell research--both adult and embryonic--to the fullest extent.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the opportunity to join with my colleague again in this effort to try and reduce this output. I respect my friend, the chairwoman of the subcommittee, but I do think it is time for us to take a more aggressive action to reduce what is a gratuitous waste of resources and is a signal, I think, for us all to find ways to be able to deal with the electronic era. 
   This is a holdover. We have attempted in the past to be able to scale it down. I have also checked with legislative counsel to find out what we need to repeal. But I have been told that simply by enacting our amendment today, we will, in fact, achieve that objective in terms of reducing the number of unnecessary printed copies.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is simple: by instructing the Government Printing Office (GPO) to print half the number of CONGRESSIONAL RECORDS daily, we will save $3.2 million in taxpayer dollars and 57 tons of paper annually. 
   An unofficial survey of House offices revealed that many swiftly discard their daily copy of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. And why shouldn't they? The full, easily searchable text of the RECORD is available online back to the year 1989. As electronic viewing of this resource becomes more widespread, we must continue to adjust the number of printed copies accordingly. In fact, since 1995 we have reduced the number of daily printed CONGRESSIONAL RECORDS from 18,000 to 5,600 per day. 
   We have an opportunity to save millions of dollars by taking advantage of paperless technology and pushing House operations into the 21st Century. I commend Speaker PELOSI in her recent effort to ``Green the Capitol'' and this is a common-sense amendment that is consistent with that initiative.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy, as I appreciate his leadership. 
   I voted against the last mining reform on the floor of the House, even though it represented some progress, because, frankly, it didn't go far enough and it didn't do it quickly enough. The treatment of our miners compared to what is going on in other developed countries who take mine safety seriously is a national disgrace. I am pleased to see a comprehensive piece moving forward. This is going to help reverse that course. 
   I heard some say that this administration would veto the legislation. I would consider a veto of mining legislation by this administration a badge of honor, an administration that has put the wrong people in charge, has been not zealous in dealing with the problems that have come forward, that have taken tragedies to at least seemingly get their attention. 
   I hope that each Member of the House spends a little time looking at this legislation comparing it to what's going on in the rest of the world. I'm confident that they will then support the legislation, and if by some reason the administration chooses to override it, I'm confident that people of good conscience can override it to give the miners the safety they deserve.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr Chairman, today I will vote in favor of H.R. 2768, the Supplemental Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act. This comprehensive legislation addresses the many short-comings of the MINER Act of 2006, which Congress passed in the wake of several fatal coal mining accidents. 
   I voted against the 2006 legislation because it did not go far enough to prevent these tragic, avoidable accidents, instead focusing exclusively on emergency response and rescue. It is a national disgrace that S-MINER is the first legislation in over 30 years that addresses preventing mining accidents and illness. We have witnessed far too many needless disasters and I am proud to support this comprehensive legislation which will not only further improve emergency response, but also reduce health risks to workers and enhance prevention efforts.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, there's a certain irony: As the country is slipping towards recession, the Bush administration is backing away from its own study on infrastructure finance. The answer is simple. It's not a gimmick. Think of the subprime mess that got us into this situation in the first place. The solution is more money to invest. There are examples of where money may be available. For example, the carbon-constrained economy that we are moving into will create a great deal of value, some of which could be captured to help pay for infrastructure. 
   It is critical, however, that we have a new vision of cleaning up the environment, rebuilding America, and making it more energy efficient, because people are not, nor should they put a lot of money into yesterday's plan. A new vision for investing in America in this century is a key, not just to fighting this temporary recession but making our communities more livable and making our families safer, healthier, and more economically secure.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, Congress is in the process of updating the Nation's agricultural policy for the first time since 2002 to see if it can serve the interests of all America's farmers and ranchers. This is more than a farm bill, it is a food bill as well. Everyone who eats is affected by our food and farm policy. 
   Michael Pollan explained how the farm bill is the reason that a package of Twinkies, which contains 39 complex ingredients, costs less than a bunch of carrots straight from the farm. The farm bill should serve all Americans, not just a few special interests. 
   Today, 70 percent of the payments go to the richest 10 percent of the farmers, while 60 percent of America's farmers and ranchers get no support whatsoever. 
   It is time for a food and farm bill of rights that provides a comprehensive guide to reform the farm bill. We must move beyond the policies that were written for the Depression or the 1950s to one designed for the world we live in today; and, more important, the world we want to live in tomorrow.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, John McCain has famously said that he doesn't know much about economic issues. But it's paradoxical that the Republican presidential candidate's idea for helping a troubled economy is to put people out of work and make traffic congestion worse and freight movement harder. 
   His proposal to stop collecting the gas tax will cut critical funding that keeps commuters, freight and our economy running. And when the trust fund is moving into deficit for the first time in our history he will only make that problem worse. 
   It will also lead to the loss of over 300,000 highway-related jobs, while there's no evidence that huge oil companies will cut their prices when they get this gas tax ``Holiday''. It is the  worst kind of pandering to mortgage the future to serve current political needs. 
   Instead, it's time for our presidential candidates to talk about their vision, their plan to support our economy and our infrastructure needs.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, as chair of the U.S.-Vietnam Caucus, dedicated to strengthening the bilateral relationship between the United States and Vietnam, I strongly support efforts to help Vietnam improve its human rights record and I support this resolution. Nothing would do more for this important relationship that continued steps by Vietnam towards respect for free speech, human rights, religious freedom and democratization. I have raised this issue at the highest levels of Vietnam's government and continue to do so at every opportunity. 
   However, given that Vietnam has made significant progress over the last decade, I wish that we could have passed the version as introduced, which focuses on the steps Vietnam needs to take, rather than this Committee-passed version which now includes unhelpful language about placing certain sanctions and restrictions on the U.S.-Vietnam relationship. I  continue to believe that the path of engagement and honest dialogue will be a more fruitful avenue for the advancement of human rights and democracy in Vietnam.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, we will face a very stark choice on the farm bill this week. The hollow claims of reform are exposed by the fact that it hardly saves any money at all and retains the complex system with special provisions to avoid what we say we want to do: concentrate on our family farms. 
   It preserves a system where five commodities, rice, cotton, wheat, soy beans, and corn, will continue to claim most of the money and dominate our farm policy. It is perverse because it continues to enrich those experts at farming the taxpayer while continuing to squeeze out the family farmers, driving up land prices and giving the big guys a competitive advantage. That is why the overwhelming majority of farmers favor a strict cap of $250,000 a year. You can ask independent experts, not lobbyists and associate members. Ask your own farmers. 
   Let's amend the committee bill, currently the least that can be done, with a vote for a series of amendments that will strengthen it and provide the sort of support our farmers deserve.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (CLEAN WATER ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, last week we observed the 35th anniversary of the Clean Water Act, and it was an important observation here on the floor as we dealt with the impact that that new law had, the heightened awareness and the progress that resulted. Back in 1972 when the law was enacted, only one-third of our waterways met water quality standards. Two-thirds did not. In the course of that 35 years, we have reversed that: Now there are only one-third that don't meet the goal. But the fact is that there still is one-third that are not in compliance with our basic water quality standards. 
   When we look under the ground, the situation is even worse. There are over 72,000 miles of sewer pipe and water main that are over 80 years old. It is one of the reason large sink holes open up and swallow trucks in American streets, why the American Society of Civil Engineers has given our water infrastructure a D-minus grade. 
   All of this is compounded by the stress from global warming, as we see not just the ice caps shrink but the snow pack being reduced, we watch evaporation being accelerated as a result of the elevated temperatures, and we see that thirsty crops need more water because of the global warming. Agriculture of course is 90 percent of our water commitment. 
   Now, there is going to be more friction, more problems over time with Water and Agriculture. We have some of our programs that have been enacted that are just plain silly. We continue to grow heavily subsidized cotton with subsidized water in the desert, something that long since should have been phased out. The New York Times Magazine this weekend featured the Southwest United States water problems, especially centered on the Colorado River and the demands that are rising there. But this tremendous problem is not limited to the southwest. On the front page of this morning's paper we see the Georgia delegation in Congress is suggesting that they deal with their severe drought and water supply problems by ignoring the environmental regulations of the Endangered Species Act, upsetting not just environmentalists but their friends downstream. It is a problem we are familiar with in the Pacific Northwest, where we have a severely water stressed Klamath River Basin, where the Federal Government as in most all instances has been part of the problem as we promise more water to more diverse users than nature can deliver. 
   It is time for us to revisit, not just the celebration of the 35th anniversary of the Clean Water Act, but revisit our commitment that is embodied in that Act and where we are going over the next 35 years. 
   It is important that we deal with very real problems of environmental quality requirements to save fish and wildlife and protect eco systems and, indeed, human life. We are watching the problems of diminishing supplies as we mine fossilized water in ancient underground aquifers. Global warming of course is going to make all of these problems more complex, more severe, and harder to solve. 
   Every Member of Congress needs to do more than just celebrate the 35th anniversary of the Clean Water Act. I would hope that, in the months ahead, every one of us does an assessment at home to find out how bad the situation is with our local water supply, storm water, sewage, and drainage. Are we one of the over 1,000 communities with combined sewer overflow problems? How is it going to be paid for? What is the planning that needs to take place? Every one of us should be insisting that we shift to basinwide framework for analyzing and solving water problems, not just looking at isolated instances. 
   It is time for us to be serious about a funding solution. In 1978, the Federal Government provided 78 percent of the funding for our water quality problems. Today, that is just 3 percent. Even that 3 percent is as uncertain, as it is inadequate. It is time to establish a water trust fund, like the Highway Trust Fund, to help be a partner with State and local communities in meeting water quality needs. Finally, we need to begin addressing the ultimate question of who is going to get the water  and why, beyond just some historic accident and water rights policy no longer adequate for today's challenges. 
   I strongly urge my friends in Congress to reflect on the 35th anniversary of the Clean Water Act by getting serious today with our constituents at home about what we are going to do for the next 35 years of clean water.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (WATER QUALITY FINANCING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy. I appreciate his leadership and that of the chairwoman, EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON. I salute the committee, which has done more on water resources in the last 12 weeks than we have seen the previous Republican leadership do on water resources in the last 12 years. 
   One of the reasons that we have had a roadblock dealing with these critical water resources has been the Republicans' pathological aversion to Davis-Bacon protections. Sometimes when I hear some of my conservative friends on the other side of the aisle fulminating about Davis-Bacon, I want them to go back and look at the history. 
   Davis-Bacon is named for the Republican sponsors of the legislation in the Hoover administration. It is not some sort of Democratic plot. In my State, in Oregon, we have adopted a ``little Davis-Bacon Act'' that was signed into law under a Republican Governor, former Senator Mark Hatfield. When the ideologues put it to the test, tried to repeal the protections, it was overwhelmingly supported by Oregonians almost two to one, and I would note that it passed in every Oregon county, big city or rural areas. 
   What we have seen is that Davis-Bacon protections level the playing field for bidding, so we are not going to have shoddy public works with inadequately trained and equipped workers. We have watched over time where the  amount of a public contract for construction for labor has actually declined as a percentage. So if they were ever concerned, they should have been concerned long ago when the Republicans introduced it in the Hoover administration. 
   I would hope, Madam Chairman, that this President does not continue holding water resources hostage by threatening a veto. For heaven's sake, vote Davis-Bacon up or down, but don't penalize American communities by shortchanging water resources.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy, and I must say I have enjoyed the opportunity to work with him on this amendment. 
   Madam Chair, it is a pleasure to see the people; I feel a little angst not being on the Transportation Committee, I must say, and I keep gravitating down to the floor because of the important work that is being done. 
   I deeply appreciate Congressman Hall's work in the water resource area. I know he comes from an area that is challenged in terms of water resources and environmental threats and has long been a leader before he came to Congress. I deeply appreciate his leadership in this regard, and I was pleased to partner with him on this amendment because it will strengthen the bill to target effectiveness and support where the needs are greatest. As Mr. Hall mentioned, there is a deep concern that we target the resources where they will make the most difference. 
   There is another adage that I would offer up, and that is, ``Fix it first.'' We are dealing with an aging water infrastructure problem that is hundreds of billions of dollars, national in scope. The work that the Transportation Infrastructure Committee has done already in the last 12 weeks is moving us forward on an aggressive agenda. But by being able to target this money in areas where the need is the greatest, not to add to the inventory that is already overloaded, I think is an important area of priority.  
   I look forward to the approval of this amendment, working with the gentleman, working with the committee, working with our other colleagues. We have massive problems around the country where we need to be focusing; and I note my friend and colleague from Louisiana there, we have got unfinished business there as well. And the extent to which we are able to work in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and in this Congress to be able to put the dollars where they will do the most good is important. 
   Being able to have thoughtful infrastructure investment in ways that reinforce smart growth, where it needs to be, where it will have the most impact, is an important principle. I am pleased that, with the adoption of this amendment, we will be able to enshrine it in this legislation, and I hope that it finds its way in the work that will come forward with this committee throughout the course of this Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, this last week I had the opportunity to meet a true American hero in Iraq, Kirk W. Johnson. No matter what your position on the war in Iraq, how it started, where it's going, how it will end up, you should be deeply concerned by the 4 million Iraqis who have been forced to flee their homes. And you cannot help but be impressed by Mr. Johnson and his deep concern for their plight. 
   This young Arabist, who worked for the USAID as regional coordinator on reconstruction in Fallujah--from, I might add, impeccable Republican lineage--figured prominently in George Packer's haunting essay in The New Yorker on March 26 of this year. That essay, entitled ``Betrayed: The Iraqis Who Trusted America the Most,'' had a profound impact on me. It is a harsh title, but the facts are harsh. In a country with a population about the size of Texas, 4 million Iraqis have been forced to flee their homes. Two million are currently outside the country, primarily in Jordan and Syria where there are jarring press accounts, for instance, of women forced into prostitution to feed their families in Syria. Mr. Johnson has been focusing on a special subset of these unfortunate people, people whose lives are at risk because they helped the United States, translators, guides, people who worked on the reconstruction effort. He has compiled a list of over 500 Iraqis that he knows personally are in that category. Five hundred, not one of whom has been able to yet make it to the United States for asylum. They are part of the tip of the refugee iceberg. Two million, as I say, in Jordan and Syria. 
   Mr. Johnson asks the question that each Member of Congress must confront: What kind of superpower can't convert its ``very top priority''--the words, by the way, of Ellen Sauerbrey, the Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and Migration in her testimony before the United States Senate--can't convert its very top priority into a program that starts saving the lives of people who helped us before their visas expire? 
   The stark reality is that only 70 Iraqis since October of last year have been admitted to the United States. Only eight in March, one in April and another in May. 
   I strongly urge that my colleagues join me in supporting H.R. 2265. This comprehensive refugee legislation will allow for more Iraqis to be granted refugee status in the United States. Why should the United States accept fewer refugees than Sweden? It would allow them to apply for refugee status in Iraq. Why should they be forced to flee the country, to Jordan, for instance, when we have the largest embassy in the world in Baghdad? This legislation would put somebody in charge, having a special coordinator to help us make sure that this problem is solved. I strongly urge my colleagues to make sure that Congress does its part to deal with the greatest continuing refugee crisis in the world with the possible exception of the Darfur. This is a crisis for which the United States has a unique responsibility and a unique role in its solution. 
   Please examine H.R. 2265, add your name as cosponsor, but, more important, join Mr. Kirk Johnson in making the plight of these millions of unfortunate people, especially those who helped us, part of your mission in Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   It is interesting listening to the Republican fog machine starting to churn out its smoke surrounding the resolution that we are going to be discussing this week. I listened to my friends from Texas and from Georgia talking about the innocent people that are going to suffer under the approaches that we are talking about. Well, it is interesting that polls show that the people in Iraq, the majority of them, think it's all right for the insurgents to shoot and kill our soldiers. They are not just fighting us. They are also fighting each other. The discussion this week is going to be the first honest and direct opportunity to start redirecting the course here. 
   Stay the course? My Lord, that is not remotely what we are talking about here. Anybody who has watched what the Democrats have done for the first month that they have been in power realize that we are setting in motion a foundation to do what should have been done from the outset: to regain the power of the purse, to be able to deal with oversight which has been completely abandoned by my Republican friends over the last 5 years, and start developing the policy framework that is going to be necessary to deal with the disaster that has been created in Iraq. The increase in troops, the over 20,000 that we will be talking about this week, was not the first choice of the military and indeed the masterminds that President Bush turned to for this surge theory did not talk about 20,000 or 25,000. They wanted far more troops. They have stripped this down. 
   I heard my friend from Texas disparage the retired generals and admirals who have come forward to deal with their deep concern about the flawed strategy and implementation of the Iraq campaign. These are men and women who have proven their dedication to this country, who in many cases have been in far more battles than all the people in Congress combined, who don't have anything to win or lose by not speaking their mind. If you go back and check the record with what they have said, with what has happened in Iraq, I'll take those retired commanders every time. The fact is they've been right, and if the President and Congress had listened to them, we wouldn't be in the middle of the mess that we're in now. 
   I served in this body when President Clinton took steps to stop the genocide in the Balkans, and I watched the Republicans on the other side of the aisle be unable to figure out whether they supported the President, they were opposed to the President, or they wanted to change the policy. Go back and look at the former majority leader, Tom DeLay, who just couldn't figure out what to do in the Balkans but he sure knew that he wasn't going to support the Commander in Chief. 
   What the Democrats are doing now is laying a foundation that should have been done from the outset. We have had over 50 oversight hearings now, in the first month, more meaningful oversight than in the last 5 years of the Republicans who just couldn't bring people in to find out what happened to the billions of dollars in cash that is now unaccounted for. In committee after committee, the American people are finally getting to what should have happened years ago in terms of meaningful oversight. This is what the Truman Commission did during World War II. The Republicans would have no part of it, and now the American people are seeing for themselves. We will soon see in the appropriations process that Congress is regaining the power of the purse to make sure that the money will be spent properly. 
   There is no reason to not have troops that are deployed with a guarantee that they will have the equipment that they need. It was a travesty what men and women from my State were subjected to, being sent over to Iraq in a war of choice without being properly equipped. Under the Democratic watch, we are going to make sure that that is not going to happen. 
   Last but not least, by having a simple debate on whether or not this Congress approves of this escalation, we  are going to establish a baseline. I suggest that this baseline is not only going to have overwhelming Democratic support, but we are going to find dozens of Republicans on the other side of the aisle who, when finally given a choice, are going to make a clear stand with us. It's just the beginning, it's long overdue, and it's exactly what the American people, what our troops and the Iraqi people deserve.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (IRAQI REFUGEE CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, the largest humanitarian crisis in the world continues to unfold in Iraq. Over 4 million displaced people, more than the crisis in Darfur, two million or more, have fled their country; and the rest are displaced within. They have fled to Syria, to Jordan, throughout the Middle East and beyond. It is brutal, not just for the refugees themselves, and the displaced people, but it places a great strain on the host country.       
   NOTICE
 X          
   Late last summer, Ambassador Ryan Crocker pointed out the problems that this refugee crisis is posing for the United States itself when he expressed deep concerns that if we don't do a better job of helping to protect the people whose lives are at risk because they have worked for the United States, if we turn our back on them when they flee the country, than people will be less willing to work with us, and we won't be able to rely on those who make such a difference in terms of services of interpreters and guides and others providing essential services for United States activities in Iraq. 
   I have been deeply concerned about this problem over the course of the last year, finding out how far we have fallen short of the mark when I was working with a group of high school students in Oregon and returning U.S. Oregon National Guard troops. They were fighting to bring to the United States their interpreter, a young woman who had been marked for death in Iraq because of her cooperation with the United States. It was frustrating over the course of the months that we worked with them because I really had no good explanation for these young people, the Guard and the high school students, about why it should be so hard for the United States to help people who helped us. 
   It is not just people who had helped the United States who have fled the country, it is not just those that are concerned about Sunni and Shia violence; the Mandean, an ancient people, a small Christian sect, are caught in the crossfire of this civil war in Iraq, and they are at risk of being wiped out in their entirety for all time. 
   Having been inspired by these young Oregonians, having been inspired, by other dedicated advocates, for example, Kirk Johnson, a former AID staff member, who chronicled the plight of over 600 people at risk, of whom less than 10 had been resettled, we introduced legislation to deal with the mismatch between the scope of the problem and the limited resources the United States Government has put into addressing it. 
   Indeed, after we ``won the war in Iraq,'' the situation became worse on the ground, and we witnessed the explosion of this crisis. For 2005 and 2006, the numbers of people we helped were miniscule. Out of the 4 million people who have left their homes, we allowed 198 Iraqis in the United States in 2005, and 202 last year, almost entirely people who were being reunited with their families, who had been made refugees in 1991. 
   There were glimmers of hope this year, with the administration promising, to allow 25,000 people into the United States, which was the same number of refugees that the Prime Minister of Sweden told me that Sweden was willing to accept. Later, the U.S. number fell to 7,000, and then ultimately we only let 1,800 Iraqis in throughout the entire last fiscal year. Even that was after a last-minute rush, because the first 6 months we had only allowed 69 Iraqi refugees. 
   There is good news, however, because due to an amendment by Senator KENNEDY that was adopted in the Senate for the Defense authorization bill, largely taken from provisions in our House legislation, we are actually going to be able to make some real progress. We will be able to process some of these refugees in their own country. Until now, people had been forced to leave Iraq. Even though we have the largest embassy in the history of the planet, they had to leave Iraq before they could apply for refugee status. We have an opportunity to increase to 5,000 a year those people who are at risk because they have helped us. These are important steps, and I hope they are approved. 
   But much more needs to be done. First, we have to actually do what is authorized. Second, we need to put some real money into it, not just the $250 million for refugee assistance that is currently pending. That is rounding error, given the billions that we have spent in Iraq that we can't even account for. 
   It is important for us to scale our commitment to make sure that we meet the humanitarian crisis in the aftermath of our war in Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3036, the No Child Left Inside Act of 2008. This bipartisan legislation extends the National Environmental Education Act through 2009 and strengthens the Environment Education Training Program. It also establishes a capacity building grant program to help States and school districts expand environmental education. 
   Today's students are our future workforce and they must be quipped to face the myriad of challenges that threaten our Nation. Our country faces an energy crisis, air quality concerns, climate change, and diminishing natural resources. It is vitally important that environmental education become an integrated part of the curriculum, and that our students be trained in the tools necessary for future careers in green technology. 
   In my home State of Oregon, Portland State University has a renowned sustainability program that has just been boosted by a $25 million foundation challenge grant. PSU already partners with schools throughout the community to teach children about environmental sustainability. Because of today's legislation, schools across the country will have similar opportunities as those students in Oregon to learn the value of our resources and gain the skills necessary to be key players in America's future green economy.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (RESPONSIBILITY TO IRAQI REFUGEES -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you, Madam Speaker. 
   I am privileged to take the floor after my colleague from Virginia and I am in agreement with the sentiment that he has expressed. However, I would like to speak for a moment about the second greatest refugee crisis in the world after Darfur. 
   Four years after the fall of Baghdad, many of the worst fears expressed at the beginning of that war have come true, as Iraq and its neighbors are in the midst of a humanitarian crisis rivaled only by the ongoing genocide in Darfur, referenced by my good friend from Virginia. Iraq has the fastest growing refugee population in the world. The United States has a responsibility to try to protect the innocent victims of massive violence wherever it can. However, having made the decision to begin a war of choice in Iraq, we have a particular responsibility to those who are suffering as a result of America's actions. Whatever one believes about the wisdom of the war or the future of the United States' engagement in Iraq, we have a responsibility to those innocent Iraqis who have been driven from their homes or fear for their lives every day. 
   The numbers are sobering. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees estimates 4 million Iraqis have been made refugees, 2 million of which have left for adjacent countries like Syria and Jordan. Every month, another 50,000 to 70,000 Iraqis continue to be displaced from their homes, and these figures likely underestimate the magnitude of the problem. These are the front lines of a regional humanitarian crisis, one that could easily destabilize these front line countries that neighbor Iraq and turn a humanitarian crisis into a security disaster. 
   For one group in particular, however, our moral responsibility is unquestionable--Iraqis who are at risk because they helped the United States. Having collaborated with the United States military, the United Nations or even with a nongovernmental organization can literally mean a death sentence at the hands of any of the many sides in this civil war. Tens of thousands of Iraqis, who worked as translators, drivers, even construction workers, live every day in fear of being targeted. However, the United States is only allowing 50 Iraqi translators to start their lives over in the United States. Over the next few months, that may be raised to 500, a number that is still dwarfed by the need. 
   I became acutely aware of this problem working with a local high school in Portland who were partnering with members of the Oregon National Guard who had served in Iraq who were trying to bring their translator to the United States to save her life but kept running into bureaucratic hurdles. Since then, I've heard the same story over and over again. 
   We should keep faith with those who have served alongside our brave men and women in uniform. This is a basic moral responsibility and a simple issue of fairness. Yet in March, the United States admitted only 11 Iraqi refugees. Since the war began, we have admitted only 700--remember, out of 4 million displaced. 
   I am introducing legislation this week, the Responsibility to Iraqi Refugees Act, to address this ongoing humanitarian crisis to use all of the tools at our disposal, admitting refugees, providing assistance to the region, and using diplomacy to ensure their well-being. It creates a program to admit to the United States Iraqis who are at risk because they helped coalition or reconstruction efforts. It establishes a special coordinator for Iraqi refugees and internally displaced people and requires the United States to develop plans to ensure the well-being and safety of these Iraqi refugees. Most important, it increases the number of persecuted Iraqis who can be admitted to the United States as refugees. And, finally, it would authorize additional funding for assistance to those refugees, their resettlement and fixing the bureaucratic process that often hampers even the most well-intended efforts. 
   I urge every Member of the House to cosponsor this broad, ambitious and comprehensive response to the Iraqi refugee crisis before it is too late, too late for the people whose only crime was working with Americans.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy. 
   It is an interesting debate that is going on here today because in terms of the motion to instruct, there really isn't that great a difference of opinion. We are, in fact, going to be able to meet the objectives. We are working hard in our budget to make sure that we deal meaningfully with tax relief for those who need it. 
   The difference between the Republicans and the Democrats is that they are not willing to make any distinction. For them it is Paris Hilton who is first in line. We have made it clear that we are going to work to make sure that  real priorities for American families are adopted. We have proven that in terms of what we have stood for in the past as well as what we are working for in the future. 
   Democrats have repeatedly voted for a lowered tax bracket on lower-income people, the expansion of the earned income tax credit, marriage penalty relief, increase in the child tax credit, acceleration of the expansion of the 10-percent bracket, increased expensing for small businesses. These were things that people here on the floor who are on our side of the aisle offered up as a responsible alternative when our friends on the other side were engaged in a rather extensive and unfocused effort to try to provide tax benefits for those who need them the least while ignoring the needs of those who need it the most. 
   They have given some modest bones to a few in America. Those that merit our support will, in fact, be continued. And, more important, we are going to deal with what is the largest tax increase in American history, which the Bush administration and my Republican friends on the other side of the aisle have set the stage for, and that is the tsunami of the alternative minimum tax. That is going to cost $1 trillion over the next 10 years, and we have made it clear that that is our number one priority to solve, as in the House Committee on Ways and Means we working on this. 
   We don't have to accede to every single detail for Paris Hilton in order to make sure that we deal with the needs of working Americans and the tax tsunami of the alternative minimum tax, which has been ignored session after session after session by the Republicans when they were in charge. 
   I find no small amount of irony to hear my good friend from Wisconsin talking about how he has proven it is possible to have a unified budget surplus when for 12 consecutive years of ironclad Republican control they wrote all the fiscal rules, wrote the budgets, wrote the tax policy.     
   I invite anybody to look at what the now minority proved that they could do. It's a pretty sorry record of fiscal irresponsibility. 
   Mr. Speaker, my point is simply that the budget resolution that we brought forward is a reasonable, meaningful approach to deal with these fiscal problems. 
   Independent observers agree that there is no tax increase this year or the next. And we are on a path allowed for in our budget resolution and the work we are doing in the Ways and Means Committee right now to make sure that we solve the tax tsunami of the alternative minimum tax. 
   I look forward to our getting past this type of discussion here, as my friends on the other side of the aisle seek to substitute rhetoric for their sorry record of non-accomplishment, and look forward to moving forward.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy. 
   I listened to my friend from Michigan, and in one respect I think she is right: there will be people who will be haunted by the bill that we are voting on here today, but not because it goes too far, but because it doesn't go far enough. I am confident, under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi and the commitment that we have by the American people, that we will go back to the comprehensive energy bill that we had a few moments ago. 
   I find it ironic talking about the CAFE standards and the problems. Now we see the American auto industry is reluctantly accepting to do in this country what they are already doing in Europe. And, frankly, if they don't get it right in terms of fuel efficiency, there is nothing that we are going to be able to do to bail them out, and they will continue to lose market share to foreign companies that are more energy efficient. 
   I am pleased that this bill contains provisions I have worked on to align the interests of the natural gas companies to promote energy efficiency rather than penalizing them for conservation. I am pleased that we are going to have increased energy efficiency for light bulbs, appliances, buildings, and government agencies. All of these are starting to lay the foundation for legislation that is long overdue. 
   I am sad that it does not include the renewable energy portfolio standard which half American States, and the public is already represented by States that have galloped ahead of us, and it is unfortunate that the Senate could not deal with the tax provisions that would have put government subsidies for emerging renewable technologies that need that government support to turn a profit and come to scale, and instead continue to lavish subsidies on the petroleum industry that frankly doesn't need it to turn a profit. But these we will return and address. 
   I am pleased that this is an important step in the right direction and urge support of the rule and the legislation today.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy in permitting me to speak on this bill. 
   We are watching fiscal chickens come home to roost with this housing bubble that is slowly working its way through the system. As my good friend from Connecticut mentioned, we are looking at perhaps 2 million foreclosures looming. There is another 2 million figure to keep in mind, and that is the number of loans that are going to reset in the next 18 months. And many of these people were not particularly sophisticated. There are a number of folks that appear to have been lured into subprime loans that actually would have qualified for conventional, fixed-rate mortgages. And this is a ripple effect that can have a very profound consequence for people. 
   If we see a 15-percent drop in housing values, which is projected by Goldman Sachs, we are talking about millions of families who can be in this situation of having phantom income. If it is a 20-percent drop, it is 3.7 million. And some people feel that 30 percent correction is not beyond question, and that would put almost 20 million American homeowners in this negative territory. 
   It is important for us to make sure that people are not paying taxes on phantom income. Frankly, I am a little disappointed that the legislation that came back to us from the Senate is only 3 years because I fear that this is going to be a longer-term problem. And, frankly, I can't foresee any circumstance where this Congress would like to apply tax rates on phantom income when anybody is under water, getting a loan forgiveness. We have put careful provisions in this to make sure that it is not unlimited, it is not for wild speculation, but for typical, average everyday homeowners. 
   I hope we pass this bill, but I also hope that we look at a long-term adjustment so that no one who is in this unfortunate circumstance ends up making a tax payment on phantom income when they have lost their home.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy as I appreciate his leadership. 
   One of the most important things the United States did in the aftermath of World War II was to help returning veterans with housing. In my home State of Oregon, in 1945 we established a veterans home loan program which, for over 60 years, has provided over a third of a million loans, a value that is approaching $8 billion, which has changed the lives of the veterans and their families as it has helped revitalize communities. 
   Unfortunately, in Oregon, as in other States like Alaska, Wisconsin, California, and Texas, we are bumping up against limits in dealing with this program. We do not have the bonding capacity to be able to deal with the flood of returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan, who are every bit as worthy of our help and support as veterans from Korea or World War II. 
   The House legislation that went forward corrected this situation, adding an increase in the bond cap; and it made a modification for eligible veterans of more recent wars to be included. Unfortunately, the other body, inexplicably, following rules that Daniel Webster and John C. Calhoun would recognize today, allowed a minority to strip away these important provisions. 
   It is important for us to repass this legislation that affirms that we are going to do right by veterans in Alaska, Oregon, Wisconsin, California and Texas, raise those limits, and extend the coverage to warriors that are returning from these conflicts. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to not just pass this legislation but to make clear to our friends in the other body  that this is one of our go-home items of legislation that we are going to insist upon.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy in permitting me to speak on this rule as I rise in support of this integral part of a comprehensive approach that has been offered by the majority party to deal with the energy challenges we face today. 
   It is important that we think of this in a comprehensive fashion because there isn't one silver bullet that's going to solve America's energy challenges, especially when it has taken years to paint us into this corner. 
   It should be made clear that, first and foremost, this is not just more about increasing supply, not just more drilling. Some of my Republican friends are talking about draining America dry and turning the rest of our energy future over to large oil companies who already, as the gentlewoman from Florida points out, control 68 million acres of land that is available for exploitation. Just ExxonMobil alone had $40 billion of profit. Were they spending it on existing leases to increase supply? They spent $36 billion buying back their stock and found, what was it, $10 million to invest in alternative energy. Significant irony here, I think. 
   One of the items that we've been involved with in the last 18 months is to work to give Americans more choices for their energy, to beef up opportunities for wind, solar, and tidal, in addition to those 68 million acres already available. 
   We're working on new technology. Three times the House has passed legislation, I'm pleased to say, that has included my provision to close the Hummer loophole that actually subsidizes the purchase of the largest, most energy inefficient, expensive vehicles like the Hummer and, instead, would spend that money to encourage alternatives like hybrid technology. 
   We need to be serious about not wasting more oil than any country in the world. You know, it's ironic, after the Democrats seized control of Congress we had to fight with this administration and our friends on the other side of the aisle to just increase fuel efficiency standards to 35 miles a gallon, that basically remained unchanged for 35 years. Our Republican friends, when they were in control, actually made it illegal to even study increasing fuel efficiency standards. It is stunning when we think today of the price Americans are paying at $4 a gallon that they refused to allow us to even study making cars more gasoline efficient. 
   Well, we broke through that. The irony is now George Bush is claiming credit for something that he resisted, but even if we give George Bush credit for what we forced him to do, it took George Bush longer to get to 35 miles to a gallon than it took Jack Kennedy to get Americans to the moon. 
   We hear about now, all of the sudden, they're flip-flopping and interested in more offshore drilling. This is interesting. George Bush, the first, put in place an executive order that prohibited it. George Bush, the second, reaffirmed it at the insistence of his brother, Jeb Bush, as my friend from Florida well knows. The President could now overturn that executive order if he wished. The Governor of Florida, since Florida controls the first three miles of State land, could start drilling 3 miles off the Florida coast if they were really excited about doing it. 
   Well, it's important that we've got this legislation today about using or losing oil leases. I strongly support the part of the puzzle that deals with conservation, because with less than 3 percent of the world's oil reserves we'll never be able to drill our way out of this. The irony is that even if we started drilling more today, every expert, every expert agrees that it will take 7 to 10 years for any of this oil to trickle into the system. 
   In this legislation, we are putting more resources to help mass transit, putting more resources to give consumers choices.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. This is part of a comprehensive approach. Democrats have been working since we returned to power to increase fuel efficiency and with other alternatives for energy. 
   I welcome a broad, far-ranging debate about what Republicans did when they were in control for a dozen years in the House, especially the 6 years of the Bush administration, they were in complete control, their energy bill of 2005 when they were running the show, in contrast with what we've already been able to accomplish with just the last 18 months and what we propose to do in the future.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy as I appreciate his leadership. 
   It's interesting for us to hear from some of our friends on the other side of the aisle, my good friend from Florida, recounting sort of the history of the Bush administration leadership on energy. I have a slightly different recollection of that. 
   One of the first things this administration did when they came to power was to create 7 years ago a secret task force. They never really fully released what was going on or why, but we know that it was dominated by representatives of the industry. And the Secretary of Energy in March of 2005 indicated that 95 percent of the objectives of the task force were completed. And then 35 months ago, on the floor of the House, we passed their big picture energy bill when they controlled everything, House, Senate, White House, and it was going to envision great changes for all American families. 
   Well, all American families have had some significant changes since the Republican energy bill was passed. Most significant is that gasoline prices have gone from $2.49 a gallon to over $4 a gallon. The changes about altered conservation, for instance, have come over the objections of our friends in the Republican party. Remember, for years, they made it illegal even to study increasing CAFE standards, and lo and behold, now George Bush is claiming credit for what we forced him to do for the first time in 30 years, increasing those fuel standards. But even if we give him credit for going to 35 miles to the gallon standard, it took George Bush longer to get to that 35 miles to a gallon than it took Jack Kennedy to get Americans to the moon. 
   This legislation is part of a comprehensive approach. You've seen it come to pass from our first days in Democratic control in this Congress, where we provided more incentives for new sources of energy, where we've worked to shift incentives from massive oil companies who didn't need our tax dollars. Remember, George Bush said they didn't need subsidies at $50 a barrel. Well, Big Oil didn't need it at $100 per barrel or $140, but that shift to alternative energy support was resisted by the administration and by my Republican colleagues. 
   We have systematically moved forward in areas to give more choices to Americans. I heard my friend from Louisiana talk about how it costs money to explore the 68 million acres already available to them. Gee, ExxonMobil spent $36 billion last year, not in alternative energy, that was $10 million, but to buy back their own stock. 
   Let's get a grip. It's time for us to move forward with choices that will make a difference. This legislation will make a difference for every community, rural and urban, around the country. I urge its adoption.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Chairman, I thank Mr. McGovern and my friend from Virginia. This is really important for us, to be able to start equalizing the playing field. I think there is nothing at this point in the game that is more critical than giving people transportation choices. I appreciate the long-term interest and advocacy that you have had in terms of doing this. I think it is an important step to make sure that commuters across the country are treated in a fair and equitable fashion. 
   I am hopeful that the body will embrace this, that we will be able to deal with it in an aggressive sense, both in terms of the Ways and Means Committee, that we can work with our colleagues to find ways in the Tax Code to make the adjustments that are necessary to cushion the commuter cost of transit users, as well as people who use their vehicles; that we deal with some people who have extraordinary costs because of the long distances commute, and I think there are ways that we can adjust this. 
   I would beg their indulgence for one modest potential adjustment, and that is while this moves forward to make a difference for people who are commuting, I would hope there would be some way we could work together to also include equity for people who burn calories instead of fossil fuel, because as yet, the Tax Code and the policies do not provide equity for Mr. Oberstar's friendly, favorite people, the cyclists, although we have passed that three times through the House this year previously. Being able to put cycling communities along with transit and auto communities will make a big difference in the long run. 
   I appreciate this leadership and look forward to working with them to make progress in the future.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy, and look forward to moving forward on this amendment. I think it balances a potential inequity. 
   But I would hope that as we move forward to reauthorization, that the folks on both sides of the aisle, Mr. Chairman, that we might be able to look at more Federal flexibility for the land that is used with these park-and-ride items, because in many cases they are frozen in time. We have inflexible Federal rules about what can be used for that land, and they have a habit of not being at the end of the line. So if we can in the future be able to use them as an anchor for community development and redevelopment where people can live and work at that point, rather than having to drive vast distances to get there in the first place, these facilities can leverage significant redevelopment opportunity, reduce vehicle miles traveled, and be able to reduce the operating cost for the lines. 
   So I have no objection to this proposal as it goes forward, but I would hope that we would be creative as we move to reauthorization that we don't freeze in arbitrarily what local communities can do with transit agencies and the Federal Government to be able to leverage them to get more out of it in the long run so we don't have to unnecessarily force people to drive to use it in the first place.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, it's amusing to listen to my friends on  the other side of the aisle decrying Democrats as somehow responsible for the problem of the current high energy prices. 
   The fact is our friends on the Republican side controlled everything, by and large, for the last 7 years. They passed an energy bill in 2005 which was a perfect energy bill for the 1950s. 
   Nothing that they are proposing in terms of draining America dry by opening up more drilling is going to make any difference for 8 to 20 years, according to all the experts, and oil companies already have 68 million acres available for exploration now that we're encouraging them to use. 
   It's interesting that after the Republicans blocked even a study of improved fuel efficiency standards for our vehicles, the Democrats for the first time in 30 years have improved those efficiency standards. We're stopping Government competition with the oil companies by suspending Federal purchase of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We had to pass legislation to force the administration to do that. 
   Now, we're looking at squeezing speculators a little bit, and there are a range of choices to help commuters compete now. 
   It is time for us to talk honestly about the options and what's going to make a difference, not pretending that turning our energy future over to oil companies will make any difference in price or supply for years to come.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleague from Missouri in saluting the 40th anniversary of Public Broadcasting. 
   On the floor of the House we're surrounded by controversy on so many issues, but the unique achievement that is our system of public broadcasting really does bring us together. 
   In those 40 years we've evolved a powerful system with NPR and PBS, through the hundreds of stations around the country, 100 million viewers of public television a week. Many cities around the country especially my own Hometown, Portland, the number one radio station is its public radio station. 
   We have evolved a national voice that deals with issues of education, of music and public affairs. We've been able to prove empirically that the people who get their news from NPR actually have an identifiable, measurable, more accurate view of what's happening in the world. 
   Since public broadcasting was established in 1967, the Federal Government has spent trillions of dollars, but there is no investment during those last 40 years that has paid greater dividends for the American people.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Chairman, today I vote in favor of H.R. 3685, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) because all Americans deserve to be protected from discrimination in the workplace. As a new legislator, one of the first hearings I attended in Congress was on this very bill and while I am pleased to finally vote on it, I'm sad it took twelve years for this day to come. 
   I see today's vote as part of our nation's struggle to achieve civil rights--an effort to make our country more equitable, more just, and more fair, so that every child has the opportunity to pursue their dreams in a safe and accepting environment. As I look back on how we have achieved civil rights legislation, I am struck that each accomplishment was both monumental and yet disappointingly incomplete. I am saddened that the gender identity provision did not pass this time around, but remain committed to resolving this inequity in the future. 
   I appreciate the advocates in my district, and across the country, who have worked tirelessly to bring about today's successful passage of ENDA. I am confident we will continue these efforts to keep these issues at the forefront of our agenda. Together, we can put an end to the ugliness of intolerance and bigotry.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy as I appreciate his leadership. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have dedicated over 30 years to environmental efforts. As a Member of this Congress, I successfully fought to enhance environmental provisions in the Singapore Free Trade Agreement. I have carried these arguments and opportunities in China, Indonesia and Vietnam. I didn't support CAFTA because President Bush and the partisan Republican leadership abandoned efforts to work in a bipartisan fashion and rebuffed our efforts at environmental protection. 
   I can't express my appreciation to our chairman, Mr. Rangel, and to the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Levin, for empowering members to work with the environmental community to make sure that their voices were heard. And we have been able to enshrine in this agreement enforceable, multilateral environmental agreements in the FTA for the first time in history. Absolutely unprecedented. 
   We have already been able to use the force of these agreements to clarify the protections of threatened Peruvian forest wilderness using the leverage we have already got even before it was enacted. This is not remotely NAFTA. We have all learned from that experience. It is not CAFTA, which I didn't support. We have given the critics what they said they wanted within labor protection and within the environment. 
   I urge in the strongest possible terms that we vote a new beginning in trade. Adopting these stringent labor and environmental protections in the agreement will serve as a foundation for United States trade policy from this point forward, and I urge its adoption.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (THE FARM BILL -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, the farm bill in its current form is a missed opportunity to strengthen family farms while reforming American agriculture. The bill coming out of committee is absolutely the least that can be done. 
   Long overdue support for specialty crops is welcome, but a relative drop in the bucket in terms of overall agricultural spending. Conservation is honored more in word than deed, and the massive payments to the wealthiest few farmers are virtually unrestricted. The new adjusted gross income limit of $900,000 is almost meaningless, the proof being that it only saves a few million dollars. There is no meaningful limit on rice and cotton farmers, and it sweetens the outrageous deal for Big Sugar. It is sad that it continues to shortchange the family farm, forcing them to compete with heavily subsidized large operators who will continue to buy them out, making it harder for most farmers to make a living. 
   Luckily for people who eat and people who farm, there still is a chance for reform. And I urge my colleagues to carefully examine the bipartisan amendment from Congressmen Kind, Flake, and Ryan.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6867, the ``Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2008.'' We have seen the United States economy lose jobs every single month of 2008. Today we were greeted with the news that 159,000 more American jobs were lost in the month of September, the worst job loss in 5 years. In my home State of Oregon, the unemployment rate is up over 6 percent, and families are hurting. 
   Extending unemployment benefits for those who are looking for jobs in an increasingly contracting economy is the right thing to do. It is not only the moral thing to do, it's a good stimulator for our economy. Most families have exhausted their benefits and still need help paying their bills and putting food on the table. Moody's Economy.com estimates that every dollar of unemployment benefits provides $1.64 in economic stimulus by being put directly back into the economy. 
   We have just voted to pass an enormous financial rescue package which lends a helping hand to the financial services industry. I voted against that legislation because it didn't do enough to help consumers and taxpayers. Our unemployment rate is at a 5-year high, and claims for benefits have just hit a 7-year high. It's time to lend a helping hand to the more than 65,000 Oregonians who would benefit from extended benefits under this bill. I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this important legislation to help get our economy back on its feet.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy and his leadership. And thanks to the leadership of Mr. Frank, Speaker Pelosi and the House Republicans, we have part of this bill before us today that is somewhat better, but it sadly adds $150 billion of largely unpaid for tax breaks, frustrating for me because many of these provisions like alternative energy too credits and secure rural schools are provisions I fought for for years and are very important. 
   Madam Speaker, as members of the public and Congress learn more about these problems and the solutions, I must say I have never seen more diametrically opposed opinions, and even people explaining about the facts in their business. But if this bill passes, which it appears that it will today, it ignores the underlying problem of a housing market in free-fall, and it ignores the plight of six million homeowners who are facing foreclosure in the next 2 years. 
   If there was ever a time to give the same bankruptcy protection to American homeowners that Donald Trump will get the next time he takes bankruptcy for his casinos and for his fourth vacation home, that time is now. It needs to be in this legislation, and I'm sadly disappointed that it is not. In makes long term recovery harder and more painful.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, I do not support this economic recovery bill. While it is imperative that Congress act to address this financial crisis, this mixed bag of legislation is not the appropriate immediate or long-term solution. The hard work done by the Democratic leadership over the past week has made it better, but it's still not good enough. It doesn't go far enough to protect taxpayers or to help homeowners stay in their homes. I have been very vocal on the floor of the House of Representatives about my concerns that this proposal won't help our financial situation and may be beside the point. 
   There are some extremely important provisions in the bill for which I have fought during the past 2 years. For example, the bill extends the production tax credit for wind energy and investment tax credit for solar energy. It includes legislation I drafted to provide a tax credit for the purchase of small wind turbines. And it provides tax fairness so employers can offer the same transportation fringe benefits for bicyclists that they offer to employees who commute by car and public transit. 
   I'm pleased that this bill will reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools program, which is so important to Oregon. I'm pleased that it will prevent the Alternative Minimum Tax from impacting millions of hard-working, middle class families. 
   The bad news is that, at a time when our national debt is at its highest point in over 50 years as a percentage of GDP, Senate Republicans chose not pay for most of the good things in this bill. I'm disappointed that the Senate also added a number of provisions to the bill that will provide incentives for coal-to-liquids and oil-shale fuels, which take us in the wrong direction in our battle against climate change. 
   I hope this bill works to protect our commercial system, but I fear that it won't. I will continue to fight to deal with the consequences of added debt and poor energy investment choices. I look forward to closely scrutinizing the choices that the Treasury Department makes as a result of this legislation and working to improve the position of ordinary homeowners, American taxpayers, and our environment.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and permitting me to speak, and for the hard work he and his committee have invested in this. 
   Mr. Chairman, the area of flood insurance is one that I have been focusing on over the last half dozen years. I was pleased to work with our former colleague, Doug Bereuter, with Chairman Frank and with then-Chairman Oxley on some serious flood insurance reform that predated the most recent disaster with Katrina. During that time, I had a chance to learn a lot about opportunities that the Federal Government has to alter its programs and policies to reduce this long-term exposure, and to think about the redesign of the partnership between the private sector, the State and local governments. 
   While I appreciate my friend from Mississippi's tenacity in zeroing in on an area of very serious problem dealing with wind damage, and he has documented in great detail the almost impossible situation that many of his constituents and others in the Hurricane Katrina area have faced, I am trying to keep an open mind in terms of how far we go along the lines in terms of expanding it to add wind damage. 
   I don't think that we have seen the end of this process. I am looking forward to working with my colleague on the legislative process as it moves along. I am deeply concerned that we haven't come to grips with the financing of our flood insurance program. We are looking at upwards of $20 billion, and we are slowly having some actuarial balance added to these programs; but, it still lags. Not only is there a problem of not having actuarial balance to be able to provide the sums that are necessary to maintain this as a self-supporting program, because as it stands now, that is going to be a stretch. It is going to take a long time without serious incident for us to get there. 
   I am also concerned that we need to do a better job of making sure that the Federal Government and State and local governments aren't putting more people in harm's way. In too many areas we have seen that there has been,  shall we say, reluctance on the part of local authorities and State authorities to be rigorous in making sure that we are not pouring large sums of public investment in areas where it is encouraging people to locate in places where we know there is going to be damage over time. 
   Last but not least, later in this debate we will be talking about working with FEMA to make some adjustments to take into account global warming, climate change and rising sea levels, because this is an area that is going to compound lax local land use controls and unsteady development processes that is going to end up creating a disaster out of our disaster relief. 
   I can't say enough about how much I appreciate the committee's willingness to be involved in an area that some think is esoteric, that is sort of mundane, that is sort of too detailed and unexciting. But it is precisely that sort of attention that is going to make us have a stronger program that is going to meet the needs of people and is going to do so in a way that actually helps keep people out of harm's way, which ought to be our ultimate objective. 
   We ought to make sure that all of these forces save money, save lives and protects the environment. I think this legislation moves in that direction. I look forward to working with the committee as this legislation works its way through the legislative process to better achieve that goal.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I am actually encouraged by some of the common expression that is here. I share some of my friend from Georgia's reservations about where we are getting into with wind coverage. The chairman is right when he noted the focus on restrictions for flood insurance to reduce the problems you are talking about is in the underlying bill. What my good friend from Florida is offering is if you are going to be in this area dealing with wind peril that there is a requirement to discourage elements in the land uses that will not make it worse. 
   So you are both on the same side. You may want to go further with the wind peril. I am open to that. We are not done with this legislation yet. There are unanswered questions. I agree with you. But in the meantime, acknowledging what the committee has done to narrow the scope with flood insurance peril, which is, I think, extraordinarily positive, and the gentlewoman is speaking out for solid land use, having the natural barriers protected, that will save all of us money. 
   I am optimistic. If we can talk this through, there are enough elements here that will be good for the environment, good for the taxpayer, and under the leadership of Chairman Frank, I am convinced we can get there before we're done.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I am, in fact, encouraged with some of the discussion that is here today. If we sort of cut through some of the areas where people are cranky, as I understand it, I think we are looking at some broad areas of agreement that, at the end of the day, we are going to have a stronger flood insurance program that will be able to answer some  of these questions. I have an amendment that I think will further strengthen this because, as we learned during Katrina, there is more work to be done to make sure that the flood insurance program is able to fulfill its mission of providing flood insurance and helping communities reduce that flood risk. 
   Now, I am pleased that the underlying legislation makes some very important reforms to the program that I have been involved with for the last 6 years.     
   What I propose in this amendment is an adjustment to the legislation to help ensure that FEMA is better prepared for current and future risks and that people have the information that they need to reduce their own risk. The amendment simply requires FEMA to take into consideration the impacts of global warming, current and future, when updating and maintaining flood insurance program rate maps. 
   The flood insurance maps are significantly outdated; over 75 percent of them are at least 10 years old. Not only are they outdated, but they estimate risk by extrapolating solely from historic loss, as my friend from Louisiana (Mr. Baker) pointed out earlier. 
   Unfortunately, it looks like the future will bring new weather patterns. A recent report from the Intergovernmental Commission on Climate Change, the leading group of climate scientists from around the world, indicated that, with climate change, future hurricanes will become more intense, with larger peak wind speeds and heavier precipitation. Changes in snow pack and sea level rise will also have a significant impact on flood risk. These impacts are not currently considered in the floodplain map modernization effort. 
   My amendment will improve upon this mapping program by ensuring that FEMA is prepared to improve the mapping accuracy. It will require the Director to take into consideration the impacts of global warming on flood, storm and drought risk; and take into consideration the potential future impacts of local climate change, weather-related events; and use the best available climate science in assessing flood risks and updating FEMA maps. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Excellent question. Around the world, scientists are a part of this consensus, and we are refining tools. One of the problems with this administration is they've been trying to stifle, as you know, scientists within the administration speaking out on this, and we have undercut investment in these resources. 
   The fact is that there is better information now for climate change. I have no problem whatsoever of our being able to invest to increase it further, but there is a global scientific consensus, there is investment in NASA, there are already resources within the Federal Government. They are not currently used now by FEMA, the stuff that we've got now, let alone what we're going to have in the future.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. As my friend, Mr. Baker, pointed out when he was arguing a few moments ago, they use a different pattern, a different model right now. What we're doing with this legislation is we are requiring them to change the model, use the information that's available right now by the Federal Government, hopefully the Bush administration won't try and stifle it, and use that for forecasting current and prospective. Right now they don't do it in their modeling, and there's no reason why they can't. This legislation would require it.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. What we're saying now is that we are in a world that everybody else acknowledges is rapidly changing. It looks like climate change, global warming is a reality, and just using straight-line extrapolation for FEMA to determine 100-year floodplains or 500-year floodplains doesn't work because it is changing much more rapidly than past patterns would expect. 
   So we ought to use the best available science here and around the world to look at what's likely to happen in the future. FEMA doesn't currently do that. They look at flat-line projections of past activity, not looking at using the best available science for what's going to happen in the future.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Let me just take 30 seconds here. 
   This is something that isn't unknown. GAO found that 11 out of 11 insurance companies that they surveyed already incorporate this into their risk models. FEMA can do this using the private sector, and it can use government data that the Bush administration has been suppressing now in other areas, open it up, let these climate scientists that work in other parts of the government advise FEMA, or contract with the private sector. It's not hard to find the information.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I understand the reticence that my good friend from Georgia would have giving the current administration of FEMA more tools. I'm sorry he's beating up on the administration, but I understand it. They haven't shown that they're very adept. But think of this as longer-term legislation. There will be a new administration; there will be professionals who are there. The point is that, whoever is there, they need to use the most up-to-date, modern information to think about what's going on in the future. 
   The science is already available in parts of the Federal Government right now that could be used. The information is available that the private sector is already using. All this amendment says, notwithstanding that I share your concern about who's running it now, but that will change, I guarantee you, that when it changes, and even until it changes, we can give them a mandate to look at the bigger picture and factor climate change in. And I am open to working with the gentleman in terms of whether it's contracted, or it's Federal information, or it's from other international sources. The point is they currently do not do it; we haven't instructed them to do it. This is one thing we can't blame on the inept FEMA administration; it's something that Congress needs to change. And with your help, we can approve this amendment, we'll change their marching orders, we will have the big picture, and it's one of these things we can agree on, work on together, and we will all be better off. 
   I urge approval of the amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (SHAREHOLDER VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have been intrigued by the debate that has been transpiring here. I wanted to come to the floor to make one simple point, and that is that I appreciate the efforts on behalf of the Financial Services Committee and Chairman Frank to start demystifying the process. There is a lot of talk about supporting of shareholder rights and what not. But the fact is that we don't have a uniform system in this country that actually guarantees people the right to exercise corporate democracy in ways that most people would take for granted. In terms of the most important stakeholders, the people who own these corporations, they are too often treated like children that need to be kept at bay. You don't have to read very many business pages in the New York Times, just for the last year, to discover areas of systematic abuse in terms of what anybody would expect to be the treatment of shareholders. And, unfortunately, that is aided and abetted by government policy. 
   I appreciate what is happening with the Financial Services Committee to take some steps to try and demystify the process. I see this as one simple step to allow shareholders just an advisory vote on compensation. I thought it was a pretty good idea. I thought it was being part of a larger conversation. I think it is a warning shot about corporate behavior and to State regulators to take seriously the rights of the people who own these companies. All of us, I think, support capitalism. But the way that the shareholders are treated must make us be suspect. 
   Then on top of this, I hear the amendment from my friend from Florida. Again, I may be a little biased, getting my information from the business pages of the newspaper, but the Sunday before last, it was fascinating looking at the hash that has been made by SEC in terms of trying to explain what total compensation is. It is almost now beyond the capacity of individuals to understand because we get in here, make these distinctions that torture and twist information. 
   I thought the proposal that is brought forward by Financial Services, was pretty straightforward. Yet this amendment again would start parsing that out, distinguishing between different types of compensation and making it harder for shareholders to have a clear understanding. 
   I would respectfully suggest that we vote against this amendment; we support the underlying bill; and most important, we support the philosophy from Financial Services to demystify corporate governance, that we give a little more respect to the rights of shareholders and our responsibility as people who establish the rules of the game. 
   I think the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation was rushed through after years of sort of holding it at bay in the aftermath of scandals where Congress wouldn't act, to the point where Congress was forced to act. 
   I appreciate what is happening in the Financial Services Committee where they are looking at this subject in a systematic fashion. I look forward to subsequent proposals that come forward so that we can give shareholders the rights that they deserve as the people who are after all really the owners of our capitalistic system. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Putnam). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy in permitting me to speak on that. I rise in support of this resolution and think that it is appropriate and timely for it to come forward and agree with the representation that I have heard from my colleagues. 
   As a long-time public radio listener and Chair of the Public Broadcasting Caucus, I was proud to sponsor the resolution recognizing Public Radio Recognition Month. 
   Too often we take for granted the rich and diverse contributions of public radio to America's communities, and this was an opportunity on the floor of the House to reflect on its contributions and show our appreciation for public radio as a genuine national treasure. 
   The future of radio depends on programming and content, first and foremost, and in the area of high-quality radio content, public radio has no peer. Public radio offers an unmatched commitment to using the airwaves to create a more informed public, a public that craves and is challenged by an examination of ideas, events and culture. 
   Each week, over 33 million Americans listen to NPR, an audience that exceeds the top 35 U.S. daily newspapers combined. When we consider this figure, along with the 100 million people who watch public television each week, we can see the profound reach of Public Broadcasting. It connects people with their local community, their Nation and their world in a way that no other outlet can or does.     
   Distinctive, award-winning programs such as This American Life, A Prairie Home Companion, and Speaking of Faith tell the story of our shared American experience, and the vibrant, enduring programs of Morning Edition, All Things Considered, and Marketplace draw on reporting from correspondents based in bureaus around the world and from producers and reporters in 19 locations in the United States. 
   But the strength of the NPR and the member station news network goes far beyond this corps of international and national NPR reporters; it reaches into communities across America. Through community-based journalism, such as the Diane Rehm Show right here in Washington, DC on WAMU and Think Out Loud on OPB back home in Oregon, we see a dedication to bringing people together at the local level for thoughtful conversations about complex and sometimes contentious issues. 
   These strong, news-oriented programs exist today in most of the top markets across the country, and when the strength of these stations is combined with NPR's strength in national and international reporting, the result is one of the largest, most capable and most trusted news network organizations anywhere in the world. 
   Public radio reliably provides a careful, balanced and thoughtful approach to news and culture. This feature is unique to public broadcasting, and it is a breath of fresh air in our often shrill and argumentative mass media environment. 
   We hear a lot about commercial broadcasting's becoming little more than 30-second, sound-bite news. That's one of the reasons I believe NPR's audience has grown so significantly in recent years, doubling in the last 15 years and increasing by 70 percent in the last decade. 
   Americans are thirsty for thoughtful and intelligent programming, and at a time when our media is controlled by fewer and fewer entities, we can have confidence that public radio which is owned by the public is committed to public interests, not to special interests. 
   In every congressional district across the country, through over 800 locally controlled and managed stations, Americans can turn to a public radio station as their single source for local, national and international news as well as for informative, cultural and musical programming. 
   There is nowhere else you can find such unique and valued service for all of our communities, and I hope that resolution was a reminder that we in Congress, as individuals and policymakers, must continue to provide critical support for local, publicly owned radio stations, the heart of public radio. 
   I invite my colleagues to recognize this achievement as they reflect on public broadcasting. It's part of the framework that makes the country so great and part of why we revere our flag and our Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, on the seventh anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, I join every American in honoring the innocent men, women, and children who lost their lives to those attacks. I pay tribute to their memory, and extend my deepest sympathies to the loved ones they left behind. 
   I also honor the brave first responders--the firefighters, policemen, and ordinary citizens--who so courageously risked and, in many cases, gave their lives for others. 
   Over the past seven years, Americans have worked tirelessly to prevent further attacks and protect the American people. The 110th Congress joined them by focusing on keeping our country safe and has wisely implemented the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. We now have vastly improved security on our rail and public transit systems, more robust screening of aircraft and seaborne cargo, and strengthened law enforcement capabilities. 
   Those who perpetrated the attacks of September 11, 2001 must be brought to justice. I am determined to see the next administration rectify the grave mismanagement that has allowed many of these terrorists to go unpunished. 
   We must also acknowledge that today's threats--terrorism, global economic upheaval, worldwide epidemics, and environmental devastation--are nuanced and interconnected and cannot be addressed by military force alone. Protecting our security demands that we cooperate with our neighbors and promote wise governance. We must address global poverty, promote wise stewardship of natural resources, and provide aid to developing and devastated peoples. 
   It is the first-order duty of Congress to keep Americans safe. As we commemorate the seventh anniversary of 9/11, I join Americans across our Nation in grieving for loved ones lost, and in honoring the heroes among us. I resolve to do all in my power to prevent a tragedy like this from happening again.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy, and I appreciate this coming forward. 
   It's somewhat ironic to listen to our friends on the other side of the aisle dust off the old canard about earmarks. It's a bit awkward for them, as we're finding out that Governor Palin was not just for them but aggressively lobbying for them before she was against them. And all the earmarks the gentleman talks about were under the Republican watch. They controlled the last transportation bill. 
   But I am pleased that the administration has had a change of heart. It's withdrawing its veto threat to ensure the fulfillment of the highway trust fund. 
   This is serious business, and I hope it would be one of the areas where we Republicans and Democrats could come together. Making sure that we don't lose the over $14 billion of highway, bridge and other transportation funding and hundreds of thousands of construction, engineering and design jobs that are at risk right now is absolutely essential. 
   I'm pleased that Congress is taking this step to make sure that we do not move in the wrong direction because communities, large and small, urban and rural, are suffering from failing infrastructure. I spent last week with my friend, Mike Simpson, in Idaho, dealing with those issues in his State, and it's nothing partisan or ideological about it. It's time for us to come forward and make this initiative. 
   It's so bad that the American Society of Civil Engineers has given our Nation's infrastructure overall a grade of D minus. Today the Federal Government is investing less than we have as a percent of our Gross Domestic Product than we have for 50 years. And we're falling behind our competitors around the world. 
   I'm hopeful that we can move forward today with this as a first step towards a comprehensive approach to deal with rebuilding and renewing America dealing with its energy needs, its water, transportation and infrastructure, so that we can make sure that all our communities are livable and our families safer, healthier and more economically secure.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, first, let me begin by expressing my deep appreciation to the subcommittee for their work in providing an increase over the President's request for funding base cleanup. And particularly what we're talking about here are the legacy locations, places that have been closed in previous BRAC cycles, 1995, 1993, 1991, 1988. However, as we consider this appropriations act, I am concerned that we continue to dramatically underfund our commitment to communities impacted by these past BRAC rounds.     
   These communities are ones that have been penalized twice. They are penalized when the base is closed, and second, they are penalized because they are unable to make use of the land left behind because of hazardous contamination caused by unexploded ordnance. 
   According to the most recent Defense Environmental Programs' annual report, there is an estimated $3.5 billion backlog for environmental cleanup of these bases. This represents over 140,000 acres of land that remain unusable by local communities for economic development across this country. 
   At the current levels, Mr. Chairman, we are facing people who went through the trauma of base closure in 1988, for instance, in Sacramento; they are going to wait over 60 years to be cleaned up. 
   I appreciate the words of the subcommittee Chair and ranking member  in terms of what they are trying to do with the difficult issues regarding BRAC, and I appreciate there is a very generous number that have been established, maybe not completely adequate, to try and deal with the people who were just whacked in the last round of closure. But, for heaven's sake, we need to keep our commitments to the communities that have worked in good faith, that had their bases closed 5 years, 10 years, 15 years ago, and still are awaiting our meeting, our commitment to them. 
   I strongly urge support of the amendment that I have introduced with Ms. Ginny Brown-Waite.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate what my friend from Florida said, and I have no interest in robbing Peter to pay Paul. But let's take it down to a very specific example that you are familiar with in Jacksonville. You had a base closed, Cecil Naval Air Station, in a prior round. Under the current schedule, this facility is not scheduled to be cleaned up until 2026, another 19 years. 
   Now, you are right, we have put a significant amount of money into the 2005 round of BRAC closures. We put $5 billion in the supplemental. And you have put in this bill which I appreciate, almost $8.2 billion. But where I take modest exception with the gentleman is that you can't spend it. The payout rate is about 10 percent. I am seeking to transfer 2 percent away from areas that you can't spend this year or next year or the year after that. 
   But I will distribute a list of people who have been waiting in some cases since 1988. They have plans ready to go. They are ready to clean up. If you talk to the companies that are the ordnance contractors, they are ready to go. They will clean this up. But we have got to stop the fits and the starts, where we don't follow through on our commitments. 
   With all due respect, if I had a facility in the 2005 BRAC cycle, I would like this Congress to start meeting its commitments from 1988 and 1990 and 1992 and 1995, because if we don't, subsequent Congresses are going to play the  same game. Because you can't spend this $13 billion, it will be dragged on and dragged out, and it will ultimately be diverted. Then we will be here, or some of you will be here, 10 years from now, and people will be wondering why the 2005 round of BRAC is waiting, like Mather Air Force Base, for 60 years, or why people in El Toro are waiting for 30 years. 
   With all due respect, I would hope that the subcommittee would build on its good work, but look at the payout rate for the $13 billion you have for 2005, which we estimate maybe will be spent, 10 percent. 
   Join with me in shifting a modest 2 percent of that money, so that we can keep our commitments to people who have been waiting since 1988, since 1990, 1993 and 1995. 
   I deeply appreciate the work that the subcommittee has done, and I appreciate Mr. Edwards, you have been encouraging and helping the work that I have done in the past on this with Mr. Farr. And it is important that you put $50 million in above the administrations request but I hope we can work to keep the commitment to the people.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, my Republican cosponsor is stuck in traffic, and I wanted Ginny to have a chance to speak on this. Evidently, she is not going to make it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I do think this is very important in terms of our keeping our commitments. I appreciate the work that the subcommittee is doing in this broad range of areas, but I would hope that you would work with us, because you cannot spend the $13.5 billion. The adoption of this amendment will have no effect on BRAC cleanup for the 2005 round for years to come, if at all. 
   But failure, failure for Congress to keep our commitments to these legacy BRAC programs, not only does it penalize these people who have been waiting in line for, in some cases, 19 years, but it makes it more likely, frankly, that people who are in the 2005 cycle are going to end up having Congress do to them what pass Congresses have done to the legacy BRAC.     
   I appreciate the work of the subcommittee, and I look forward to working with you, and echo my friend from California that it would be the worst of all possible worlds if somehow the next amendment, taking money away from these critical bases, was somehow diverted for another use. But I hope that we spare ourselves that problem by adopting the amendment before us.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy, and I am really bitterly disappointed that we would have somebody come before us to break the commitment that we have to the previous BRAC-round cleanups, communities across the country who are going to wait up to 60 years to have their bases cleaned up, to take that funding and further reduce it. I think this is a very cruel cut. 
   If you wanted to do something, you've got $13 billion in the 2005 BRAC account that is only going to be spent a maximum of 10 percent. Why in heaven's name would we reach back and penalize people who have been waiting in some cases since 1988 to have the Federal Government keep its commitment to base closure and cleanup. I think this is cruel. I think it is unjustified. I think that it is unfair to make these communities that have dealt with unexploded ordnances and military toxins and have land that is not available for reuse and penalize them for a small amount of veterans health. 
   I respectfully request that we reject this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. My good friend from Texas, if he would have bothered to talk to the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, who was seated on the floor next to him, would have known that there is a trade bill coming to the floor, passed unanimously, 39-0, that is a reflection of what we were sent here to do, which was to redefine, redirect these policies so that they were win-wins, so that they benefited the economy, not at the expense of working men and women, not at the expense of the environment. And the legislation we have before us here today is an extension of that strategy. 
   There is a clash of philosophies that you are going to hear in the next hour.  We have included a greater scope, including services, as you have talked about. The notion is to expand and enhance, to deal with people who are disadvantaged, in some cases harmed, because of global impacts beyond their control. Our Republican friends would propose to redirect and reduce. 
   We put more money for more employees with issues of health care. Their proposal, if you look at it carefully, is doing it on the cheap, perhaps with contract employees, capping training assistance at $8,000 over 2 years. Just because you call it a scholarship doesn't mean that it's not going to be a cut for over 25 percent of the workers on the current program in States like Pennsylvania. Even in Nebraska, 80 percent are going to see a 25 percent reduction because they already benefit from more expensive programs. 
   I hope that as a result of the debate today where people look behind the premises of our friends on the other side of the aisle, the program here, there will be an opportunity to make a judgment about what is the approach. Ultimately I hope we unite behind the approach in the bill before us, and I urge its adoption.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy as I credit his mastery for bringing this bill before us today. Thanks to his leadership, the leadership of Speaker Pelosi, and the cooperation of the Republicans, it is a far better bill. 
   But, unfortunately, this is not likely to be the end of the bubbles. We must with our actions be extraordinarily careful if we don't want to compromise the next rescue. Remember Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund? What happens if the hedge fund industry is next? The article in today's New York Times wasn't very comforting. Any real rescue must include bankruptcy equality for homeowners. This is not just a moral issue. Fairness to our Nation's homeowners is the key to stabilizing home values currently in free fall. 
   We cannot continue to bail out failing industries with borrowed money. No bill should be enacted without a payback from the financial services sector to be rescued, not merely a hint of a promise to pay back in 5 years. At the core, we are ignoring the fundamental question about the size and scale of the financial services industry in trouble not just because of a lack of regulation, but because we had too many people pursuing unsustainable business practices. 
   We have seen change from an irresponsible White House proposal into a responsible bill. But it's not as good as it should be. And sadly, may be besides the point if more bubbles explode. 
   I will vote ``no,'' reluctantly hoping I am wrong, but fearing that I am right.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., POST OFFICE -- (House of Representatives - June 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy. 
   I rise today in asking my colleagues to join me in this legislation to designate the facility of the postal service on Northeast Killingsworth in Portland as the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Post Office. 
   Dr. King, as a powerful symbol of racial justice and social equality in our country, is a fitting designation for this facility. I have had some experience in the community dealing with recognition for Dr. King. Some 20 years ago as Portland's Commissioner of Public Works that I worked with the community, notably of my friend Bernie Foster, the publisher of The Scanner newspaper, and others, to designate Union Avenue after Dr. King. It was an eye opening experience for me, a reminder of the troubled racial past of our community and our State. While Oregon has a rich cultural heritage for black Americans, it had a rocky path towards racial equality. 
   While slavery was declared illegal early in Oregon's history, in 1848, the provisional government had exclusionary laws surrounding land ownership. And when Oregon was admitted to the Constitution, it had exclusionary laws then. It was only after a long and aggressive struggle that progress was made. 
   In 1914, the NAACP opened a chapter in Portland, and continues to be the oldest continually chartered chapter west of the Mississippi. This movement was bolstered by the independent black owned weekly newspaper, The Advocate, that dated back 105 years in Portland that tirelessly featured articles and editorials dealing with the evils of segregation, lynching, employment opportunities, and other issues that kept the reality of Jim Crow and the pressing need for civil rights in the State, local, and national agenda in the forefront. Sadly, it wasn't until 1927 that the Oregon State Constitution was finally amended to remove the clause denying blacks the right to vote, even though Oregon had ratified the 14th amendment in 1868. 
   We have been, in our community, trying to come to grips with that past. And, as I mentioned, it was a tumultuous experience we had 20 years ago in the renaming of Union Avenue after Dr. King. But it did come to pass. In the course of the 20 years, we have watched steady progress as we have dealt with our past and as we look forward to the future. 
   I find the renaming of this post office after Dr. King to be significant on so many different levels. First of all, it came about as the result of a grassroots community effort led by local letter carriers, Jamie Partridge and Isham Harris, that epitomized the service from that particular post office, something that people in the community remark to me as sort of an island, one of these 37 outposts of the post office where half the world's mail is delivered every day. But this is a linkage to people, and it is a very special office signified by the leadership of letter carriers themselves.     
   Starting with their fellow workers, moving out through the Piedmont and Concordia Neighborhood Associations, the Sabin Neighborhood Association, showing deep community pride in its heritage. 
   I find today, Mr. Speaker, that it is particularly noteworthy because we are going to make history, in all likelihood, tonight or tomorrow, where there will be enough votes for the nomination of the first African American nominee of a major party for President of the United States, and one who I sincerely hope is elected. 
   Having the opportunity to reflect on that great national achievement, while we have the recognition locally for Dr. King and his achievements and the progress that has been made in our community gives me great pride. I'm pleased that we take a small step forward with the designation of this Post Office in the honor of Dr. King, and hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting it.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 1700, the Community Oriented Policing Services Reauthorization Act, which has provided greater numbers of police officers to protect our citizens in every State in the union. My district in Oregon has benefited significantly from this program through the addition of 279 police officers and a total of over $24 million secured for local law enforcement agencies since 1994. 
   I find it perplexing that the administration continually attempts to reduce funding for COPS when independent studies confirm that the grants significantly contributed to the crime reduction in the late 1990s. Nationally, the strain on law enforcement has never been greater, as resources are stretched to combat the recent rise in crime while also addressing homeland security responsibilities. For this reason, I support the revitalization of this program to protect our families and give law enforcement the support they need.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy in permitting me to add my voice, expressing the appreciation to Mr. Loebsack and to the Iowa delegation for bringing this resolution forward commemorating the service of our friend and former colleague, Jim Leach. 
   The 30 years that we were privileged in this body to watch him at work, the words, the recitation to what Jim Leach did doesn't do him justice. He was dignified and principled, one of the few people who could navigate these Halls successfully without ever being mired in partisan politics, doing it his way, a way that was right for the country, if often difficult for him politically. 
   Just reciting the facts misses the quality of his service. Jim Leach predicted the savings and loan crisis. He was spot on in his observations about American diplomacy from the Middle East to North Dakota. I meant to say North Korea, probably North Dakota as well, as I think about it. 
   He, as an example of his principled nature, resigned from the Foreign Service in protest of President Nixon's firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox. 
   In his congressional campaigns, he was one of the few people who refused to accept PAC contributions and out of State donations. He wouldn't run negative ads, and he tried to stop outside groups who were supporting him from, in turn, running negative ads. 
   In 1997, he refused to vote for Speaker Newt Gingrich because of deep ethics concerns. And while it was the right thing to do, as history has shown, it was a tough vote against a sitting Speaker in your own party. But it was an example of how Jim Leach operated. 
   He correctly predicted what was going to happen with our ill-advised adventure in Iraq with great clarity and force in committee and on the floor. And then he voted against it, again, at some difficulty for himself politically, particularly at that time. That wasn't the direction of the prevailing winds in his party or in the country. 
   But that's how Jim Leach was. He thought about issues. He analyzed them. He shared his analysis in his own thoughtful, understated way. He was usually right, and the congressional deliberations were better as a result. 
   I must say that I'm sorry that President Bush chose not to take the advice of dozens of Members in this body on both sides of the aisle who urged that Jim Leach be appointed as the U.S. Representative to the United Nations, a post for which he would be eminently well qualified.     
   I am confident we will see a new chapter in his distinguished career whether in the United Nations, perhaps in a new administration. As a friend, a colleague and an American, I look forward to whatever that next chapter is in Jim's career.

   Why, just last night, jaws dropped across America as the author of the Republican alternative referred to the Concord Coalition, a respected centrist organization, as a ``left-wing think tank''. 
   Well, the Republicans have zero credibility when it comes to the budget. Last year, when they were in complete control, they couldn't even pass a budget resolution. They couldn't even pass the appropriations process, leaving town with 11 of the 13 budgets unfinished. The wheels completely fell off. These are the folks who gave us the rainforest in Iowa, the Bridge to Nowhere. 
   This is why 77 prominent national organizations have endorsed the Democratic budget, from the American Legion to Ducks Unlimited, the Environmental Coalition, the Military Officers Association to Veterans of Foreign Wars and the National Education Association. 
   I am proud of this Democratic alternative. I hope people read it to see through the Republican rhetoric.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, today I voted for both the Congressional Black Caucus and the Progressive Caucus alternatives to the budget resolution, in addition to voting for the House Democratic Budget resolution. I believe all three of these proposals have a great deal of merit. 
   The Congressional Black Caucus's alternative provides high levels of funding for important national health initiatives, including increasing funding for the State Children's Health Insurance Program by $10 billion and increasing funding for veteran's benefits and services by $3.4 billion over the amounts provided by the House Democratic resolution. Importantly, the Congressional Black Caucus's alternative provides an increase over the House Democratic resolution in foreign aid spending by an additional $3.1 billion--providing much needed funds to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. The Progressive Caucus's alternative also showcased wise policy choices; it also would have provided increased funding for the State Children's Health Insurance Program and would have invested in America's future by funding educational opportunities, job training programs, and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. In addition, the Progressive Caucus's alternative reflected one of my highest priorities, which was to strip funding from obsolete Cold War era weapons programs that divert precious resources away from America's actual security interests, and its budget projections assumed a complete withdrawal from the Iraqi Civil War. 
   I was also proud to help craft and vote for the House Democratic Budget resolution, however, because it provides for increased veterans benefits and services, increased educational benefits, increased environmental initiatives, and leads to a budget surplus by 2012. In sum, it represents a reasonable balance of opportunities and it does so within our means--unlike the Republican proposals. A critical aspect of the House Democratic Budget resolution is its provisioning of reserve funds that enable this Congress to begin repairing the damage done by the Republicans to our Nation's fiscal stability by fixing the alternative minimum tax--a ``stealth tax'' on millions of middle class taxpayers--and preserving tax cuts for the middle class. I voted to express my support for the ideas contained in Congressional Black Caucus's and the Progressive Caucus's budgets, but I also voted to support the House Democratic Budget resolution because it provides a reasoned blueprint for the fiscal decisions facing this country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, today's legislation marks a continuation of the important effort to advance animal welfare in the 110th Congress. One of the stark differences with the new congressional majority is the ability to deal meaningfully with important animal welfare provisions. Congress, as one of its first orders of business, passed the long-stalled animal fighting legislation, ending barbaric cruelty that helped foster and advance other illegal and dangerous activities. 
   Today Congress has the opportunity to take another step reaffirming policies that deal with the protection of horses and wild burros; protection of free roaming horses and burros from commercial sale and slaughter. 
   Actually, it's embarrassing that it had to get to this point because, since 1971, the Federal Government has had a policy to protect these animals. Unfortunately, in the last Congress, without hearing or public notice, a rider was slipped into legislation that eliminated these protections. I'm pleased that a majority of the Commerce Committee and a strong bipartisan majority has voted to support this important provision. The Senate is also moving to protect animals by ending the sale of horse meat for human consumption. These are important steps reflecting a renewed commitment to animal welfare, an essential part of any vision of a livable community. 
   It is important and overdue that Congress renew our commitment to developing a policy framework strongly supported by the American public.

   In the current political climate it is increasingly clear that Congress must serve as an example for the Federal Government. With this bill's passage, Americans can be confident that their representatives in Congress will be held to an ever-higher standard of conduct. 
   This bill closes the most abused loopholes by banning lobbyist-funded gifts and travel, reforming congressional earmarks, and by prohibiting Members from influencing outside hiring decisions for partisan gain. It also addresses the larger issues of reform by requiring public disclosure of bundled campaign contributions and lobbyist activity. And if that isn't enough, this bill also increases the punishment for Members and lobbyists who break the law. 
   It's clear this bill raises the bar for congressional conduct. I look forward to its passage and to the creation of a more open government.

   There is a seriously flawed Senate package moving its way forward. We must remember the people who need help the most, by reforming bankruptcy laws so that we do not favor the speculator over the homeowner. Above all, we must not reward the people who got us into this mess and profited overwhelmingly along the way.

Because I fully agree with the gentleman from California, where there was not adequate time for Congress to be involved is when this was slipped into the PATRIOT Act revisions in the first place. Without the knowledge of anybody, it seems, in the House or the Senate, this change was done by the staff behind closed doors. We didn't know about it. I haven't heard yet from any of my Republican friends that did. 
   By restoring the status quo ante the way that it had been for years, we get back to a situation where we can remove this from the table.

Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Scott's courtesy in permitting me to speak and the leadership in taking what is seemingly a simple and innocuous bill and bringing it to the floor of the House. I appreciate working with my friend, ELTON GALLEGLY. This has been a long haul, lots of ups and downs, but today we reach an important milestone. 
   This is my fifth year of working on this issue. We were exposed to it during the last farm bill. We found that this got caught up in back-room machinations that really just defy description. 
   You have already heard about the despicable cruelty. You have heard about the association with illegal activity, gambling, violence, drugs and firearms trade. Louisiana is now poised to become the last State to make it illegal, making it illegal in every State in the Union. 
   Why then is this even an issue? Well, it is an underground and pervasive activity. It is in fact active across the country. 
   I just heard from one of our floor staff as we walked in today that he saw accounts from small town newspapers in Alabama the last 2 weeks in articles there. In Portland, Oregon, in recent months we have had officers break into a meth and coke den where there were 43 live chickens and all the equipment, as well as illegal weapons and large amounts of cash. In another high-profile case in my community, a professional basketball player was involved with illegal fighting of his pit bull. 
   This is something that has been an area, frankly, where Congress has shamefully been complicit. We have ignored the fact that inadequate penalties, as has been said by the chairman of the committee, by my friend from California, which have just been the ``cost of doing business,'' We have looked the other way. 
   This is an important vote today. I am confident with over 300 co-sponsors it will pass, and it will pass overwhelmingly. But the battle is not done. Never underestimate the power of the apologists, the allies and the enablers of this vicious and cruel, I won't even call it a ``sport,'' it is a vicious practice. 
   I am hopeful that we will move forward with not just voting today, but make sure that it passes the other body, and it is not subjected, as it has been time and time again over the last 5 years, to some other devious action. 
   Do not sell short the people who are apologists for this sport. Join with us not just with your vote but to make sure that we get this legislation enacted and then enforced around the country.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (ANIMAL FIGHTING PROHIBITION ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I support the Animal Fighting Prohibition Act, which would raise the penalty for violators of the federal animal welfare law, from a class 1 misdemeanor to a felony. In an industry where thousands of dollars change hands with each fight, misdemeanor fines and charges are simply considered ``the costs of doing business''. This bill would close this loophole and keep criminals from traveling to states with weaker penalties to conduct their business. 
   Animal fights are not only despicable for their cruelty to animals, but they are commonly associated with illegal gambling, drug traffic, firearms trades, and numerous other illicit activities. Recently in Oregon, officers found meth, cocaine, $10,000 in cash, along with 43 live chickens, cockfighting equipment including metal spurs and gaffs in a Portland man's home. Drugs are often the impetus for the discovery of gamecocks and illegal weapons. In another high profile Oregon case, a former Portland Trailblazer pled guilty to animal abuse for fighting his pit bull. Officials found her bloody, scarred, and covered in tar which is used by fighters as a cheap antiseptic to fresh wounds. 
   But animal fighting doesn't just pose a threat to the people and animals who engage in them, it has enormous costs to the United States health and economy. Cockfighting has been implicated in the introduction and spread of exotic Newcastle disease in California in 2002-2003, which cost the U.S. taxpayers nearly $200 million to eradicate. The disease spread further to large scale egg farms in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas; costing the U.S. poultry industry many millions of dollars in lost export markets. Cockfighting has also been implicated in the deaths of at least 9 people in Asia who contracted avian flu after exposure to fighting birds. If avian flu were to reach the shores of America, the economic and human consequences would be staggering. 
   This bill has widespread support across the country, including 303 cosponsors in the House and 35 cosponsors in the Senate. HR 137 is endorsed by the Humane Society of the United States, the National Chicken Council which represents 95 percent of the Nation's poultry producers, the American Veterinary Medical Association, the National Sheriff's Association, and more than 400 local law enforcement agencies. Currently there is only one bastion left for cock fighters; the State of Louisiana. Although gamers have attempted to use tribal lands as exemptions from state and federal laws, a federal jury recently convicted four men for their participation in a cockfight, and 70 others entered guilty pleas. It is my understanding that the increase in penalties contained within this bill would be equally applicable to animal fights held on tribal lands or Indian Reservations. 
   It is far past time that Congress give our law enforcement agencies the tools they need to end this barbaric and consequential practice.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Our hearts go out to the almost million people forced to flee their homes from wildfires in Southern California. At the same time a drought has gripped North Carolina and Georgia which in the long run may be end up being as devastating. 
   These disasters are almost unimaginable, except we've been there before, like in Southern California in 2003. And two-thirds of the new development in the last 10 years in Southern California has been in areas we know are subject to wildfire. What are we going to do about it? 
   The administration's refusal to deal meaningfully with global warming is the most glaring example of behaviors that doom us to reruns for years to come. Georgia has no real plan to deal with its water and doesn't even know what supplies it can count upon. Here in Congress, we fail to prioritize the right infrastructure and give billions of dollars for relief after a disaster and won't spend millions to invest in programs to protect before it happens. 
   I hope and pray that the message sinks in and that we use this disaster as a wake-up call to get our act together to help people before these things happen to save both lives and money in the future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman yielding me this time to speak on this, and his leadership in bringing this measure to the floor. 
   This is an important element to bring together to finally wrap up and end a game of political ping-pong. We have passed four times through the House of Representatives these critical energy provisions, along with the tax extenders. 
   We have a proposal before us today that is something that our friends on the other side of the Capitol ought to be able to accept. It meets all of the needs of things that we all agree should be part of this legislation, and it is paid for by using provisions all of which have already passed the other body. These are not controversial. These are things on which there is agreement. 
   We can meld these together and be able to have the provisions that are so critical for research and development, for solar, for wind. There are others obviously that deal with important parts of our economy and items that relate to individual families in terms of tax extenders.     
   There is something in this legislation for virtually everybody on the floor of the House, for the people that we represent, and in terms that do not have to be controversial. Indeed, our chairman of Ways and Means took out a provision that is near and dear to his heart, a proposal that was a recommendation from the President of the United States, to keep the American commitment at Ground Zero; not that it's not important, but it's not there in order to make this a clean tax bill and to minimize controversy. 
   There have been some concerns about the rural schools provision. I come from the State of Oregon. I have been here working in a bipartisan basis, to atone for what the last Republican-controlled Congress did, where they allowed this provision to expire. The Republicans chose not to renew it, so we started from scratch. We had to scramble to find a budget home. 
   I see my colleague, Peter DeFazio from Oregon here, who's been a champion trying at every turn to move this forward. And we've actually got it through in several provisions through the House of Representatives. 
   It's ironic that there are some who would come to the floor, and sadly, as we heard them, attack the Speaker, the Rules Committee Chair in the past and others who are trying to help us and whose leadership is critical. 
   I've talked to the majority leader a few minutes ago. You just heard his words on the floor as he told me privately that he would continue to work with us. We're not done yet. Let's look for a provision in which we could get help for rural school. The best way to do it is to take people at their word, yes, try and work with them, and yes, not to insult the people who we're relying on to help us guide it through. I would hope we are people of goodwill. 
   The rural schools funding is not a tax provision and not germane. I hope we can find an opportunity in an economic stimulus bill or something else, that is appropriate. I want to deal with the problem at Ground Zero. 
   But let's not muddy the waters on this bill. Let's not vote against the rule. Let's not disparage people whose help we need at a time when there are all sorts of things going on here and we're going to need to work together cooperatively.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the ``Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act.'' It looks like the Republican mantra of ``drill, baby, drill!'' and their threat to hold the entire operation of government hostage in order to eliminate the decades-old ban on drilling off our coasts may actually end up doing a favor to those of us who want a comprehensive and sustainable approach to energy policy. 
   Ironically, there is not much controversy about the impact of more drilling on gas prices. Even the Bush administration's own Department of Energy agrees that more drilling will make no difference for two up to decades, and even then any impact on the price at the pump would be insignificant. 
   When it comes to drilling, the real issue is about surrendering more of our energy future to a handful of large oil companies to develop when they want to, according to their terms, and whether or not we are going to get full value for the taxpayer dollar. The American citizens, after all, own our oil and the evidence is that other countries drive a stronger bargain for their oil than we do. 
   Indeed, the comic, yet tragic Inspector General's report about mismanagement, collusion, conflict of interest, partying, and even sexual liaisons between the Three Stooges operation that is the Minerals Management Service and the industry they are supposed to regulate, is an example of the failure of the Republican oil administration. It is also the fault of the Republicans, who ran Congress until recently, and who are even less concerned about providing adult supervision. 
   I am proud that the Democrats have responded today with a wide-ranging proposal that offers opportunities for some responsible drilling for gas and oil, but goes far beyond just drilling This bill ensures that taxpayers get fair value for the oil from public lands and waters and provides additional incentives for renewable energy and conservation. It presents another opportunity to extend the production tax credits so essential to the emerging new sustainable green energy sources like wind and solar which, despite having passed the House five times, is still resisted by Republicans in the Senate and the President. 
   I am also pleased that this bill recognizes that giving Americans transportation choices will help reduce the pain at the pump by expanding service and reducing transit fares for commuter rail and buses. 
   This legislation puts all the pieces together in a comprehensive, thoughtful way that answers the legitimate concerns of the American public with more than a bumper sticker solution. As is always the case in the legislative process in a democracy, this bill is not everything that anyone person would want. For example, I would prefer to extend the moratorium on drilling off our shores for more than just 50 miles. 
   However, compared to the Republicans' one-dimensional, disingenuous approach to energy policy, in which they seek to obscure their 7 1/2 years of mismanagement and misdirection, this bill is certainly light-years ahead. It will also provide a framework to look at the big picture between now and November and an important point of departure for a new administration and Congress to follow through. 
   We are not going to reverse years of myopia and mismanagement overnight; certainly not in one bill in the few remaining weeks of this Congress. Today, we do have an opportunity to tie the pieces together in a way that will move us further along to solving the problem rather than dueling sound bites.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy in permitting me to speak on this important legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to my friend from Utah. I am from the West, although my district is not impacted as intensively as some. The county schools program is something that I have been working with the entire Oregon delegation and others to try to remedy, to keep it alive.     
   Because it is so important I am sorry that our Republican friends in the prior Congress allowed the legislation to expire. It is not authorized because the Republican-controlled Congress and the Republican administration allowed it to die. We have been playing catch-up ever since. I deeply appreciate the work of the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Speaker Pelosi, and others, who worked to help us with funding last year. 
   I want desperately to achieve funding this year. But I understand the concerns of my friend, the Chair of the Appropriations Committee, about wading into this issue.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Yesterday on the floor we had the tax extender bill, and my Republican friends attempted to attach this despite the fact it is not germane. It was a tax bill, not an authorizing bill. 
   Yet during that debate, we heard the Chair of the Ways and Means Committee say that he would work with us in conference because he understands it is important if it came back from the Senate in the bill. Mr. Rangel said he would accept it in conference where the germaneness would not apply. We heard the majority leader sympathize and say he would work with us. 
   I would suggest that rather than go down a path that is a dead end and unfairly attack people for things that aren't in their control, that people get over the fact that they failed in the last Congress and killed the program. Instead work with us to take ``yes'' for an answer. Work with the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, get that proposal coming back from the other body, and hopefully we can have the funding that we are all concerned about restoring.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1852, EXPANDING AMERICAN HOMEOWNERSHIP ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy in permitting me to speak on this bill and appreciate her leadership, and particularly emphasizing the fact that the minority has the opportunity for a substitute to be offered up. So the House will have an opportunity to weigh the different approaches to determine what is truly in the best interests of American homeowners.  
   I welcome this legislation today. I support the rule, and I support the underlying legislation. But I hope that this will be just the start of on-going progress for dealing with what is truly a housing crisis that is enveloping this country. 
   While it's pleasant to read now that Alan Greenspan, as he's attempting to protect his role in history, now agrees that there were probably some mistakes that were made, not yet acknowledging the failure on the part of the Fed to step forward and deal meaningfully, using the powers that they had in the housing market. Today we see the consequences of that failure, of this Congress, a failure of being able to meaningfully deal with the protection of American homeowners. 
   Foreclosures are mounting by the day, but we're only seeing the tip of the iceberg, because literally tens of thousands of people every week are going to be facing a situation where adjustable rate mortgages in the months ahead are going to be exploding in much higher rates, where people are going to be paying $200, $300, $400, $500 a month, or more, higher and be trapped into these unfair subprime loans. Where there is a clear pattern of abuse of lower income, less sophisticated buyers, it's time for us to put on the table more comprehensive approaches. 
   Isn't it time to reconsider the draconian bankruptcy legislation that this House passed a few years ago? Maybe it is time to treat the homeowner, dealing with the most valuable asset most families have, their home, the same way that a business person who speculated in purchasing homes for investment purposes would be treated in bankruptcy. The speculative business person can readjust mortgage terms; they can negotiate interest rates in the amount of the loan. That is denied to homeowners. 
   Maybe it's time to consider some consumer protections. If you buy a $40 toaster that explodes, there is a Federal agency that will protect you. But if you buy a financial instrument that has a one-in-four chance of exploding in the face of the buyer, putting at risk their number one asset, there isn't any similar protections. 
   While I appreciate the legislation that's coming forward, I am hopeful that it is just the beginning of dealing with this ongoing problem.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, as we have been greeted with a torrent of depressing news about Iraq, more violence, there is debate here about whether or not it is progress that the President plans to have the same troop level next summer that we had before the surge. 
   There is no good way out. Keep the troops there and have bloodshed; have them leave and have bloodshed. But there is one thing that every Member of Congress ought to be able to agree upon, no matter what their position on the war in Iraq: That we have a moral and practical responsibility to step up and help those Iraqis who have put their life at risk because they help Americans as guides, as translators. As Ambassador Ryan Crocker pointed out this last week, it is time for us to step up and help these people. 
   The Department of Homeland Security needs to have more people processing applications for those that are trying to escape the worst humanitarian crisis in the world other than Darfur. Don't make them leave Iraq for Syria or Jordan to apply when we have the largest embassy in the world in Baghdad. Support our comprehensive bipartisan legislation, H.R. 2265, to help meet that responsibility.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's eloquence and his courtesy in allowing me to speak on this. And he is absolutely right; there has been a longstanding process of advanced funding to give our public broadcasting stations the ability to move forward. 
   He talks about it only being 15 percent of the budget. That 15 percent of the budget is critical, particularly for small and rural areas. There will always be public broadcasting in Denver or San Francisco or New York, but this money, these grants speak to the very heart of the ability to deal with sparsely populated areas from coast to coast. These are the people that would be punished if this ill-advised amendment were passed. 
   And, last but not least, he advances the notion that somehow this is just providing entertainment. I would strongly suggest that the gentleman offering this amendment go visit his public broadcasting system, because you will find that it is not just entertainment. Public broadcasting is culture, it is education, it is public safety. Indeed, this is the backbone in many parts of the country of emergency communications network. The notion that somehow this is only Big Bird and entertainment, and all we have got to do is commercialize public broadcasting more, misses the essence of why we have broad bipartisan support for public broadcasting. 
   I strongly urge rejection of this ill-advised amendment on behalf of 110 bipartisan members of the Public Broadcasting Caucus, over 100 of whom signed the letter to the appropriators supporting this budget. It is the 15 percent that is most critical for rural America. It is the advanced funding that provides the stability for things like the Ken Burns commentary. And it is not about just providing entertainment, it is education, it is culture, it is public safety. Public broadcasting is providing a voice for America, a noncommercial independent voice that is too often sadly lacking. It isn't available anyplace else in the gazillion channels on our cable networks. 
   And I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF WORLD WATER DAY -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the chairman's courtesy. I appreciate his leadership in working with me on this bill. 
   Madam Speaker, as we stagger under the implications of what we have just witnessed at Virginia Tech, I think part of what we ought to do is to rededicate ourselves to simple steps that will help make the world a better place. I can think of no better or direct way for us to act today than what this legislation means for us. 
   I would begin by thanking the gentlewoman from Texas, Ms. Johnson, who can't be here right now because she is actually chairing a committee dealing with water pollution as we speak, as Chair of the Water Resources Subcommittee. She has been really a terrific champion. I see here today my friend from Tennessee, the former Chair of the subcommittee, who likewise has been focusing on the central need for us to be respectful of water supply. 
   As the old joke goes, God gives us water for free, but he doesn't give us the pipes, the distribution system and purification. 
   Across the world, as my good friends from the Foreign Affairs Committee have just enumerated, every day millions and millions of poor people are paying the price for nature's failure to provide water exactly where they live, and a failure of stewardship on the part of governments and individuals to take care of the water that they have.     
   They are paying the price for pollution from inadequate or nonexistent sanitation, and far too many poor people are paying a huge amount of their scarce income because they can't otherwise get water. They are paying in time and in money. There are some poor people that are slowly going blind because of arsenic poisoning in their water system in Bangladesh. 
   I used to think that the pictures in the National Geographic articles with the water jug on the head was sort of exotic, but now I recognize this as the face of poverty. Indeed it is a travesty as young women particularly spend 1, 2, or 3 hours with that jug of water balanced on their head to meet the needs of their family. That is time that they are not spending in school, that is time that they are not spending economically to support that family. As has been mentioned, every 15 seconds a child dies from lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation, and each is an unnecessary death because we know exactly what to do to stop it. Indeed, there are people from churches and synagogues and Boy Scout troops and Kiwanis Clubs that are acting on their own to help provide water around the world. 
   Lack of access to drinking water and sanitation is the number one preventable killer in the world. And I won't repeat the statistics, mind numbing as they are, of over 2 billion people without access to sanitation, and the fact that half the people who are sick today around the globe are sick needlessly from waterborne diseases. 
   As my friend from Florida said, this is tied to other health problems, HIV/AIDS, and poverty reduction. The tragedy is compounded because we are not doing enough to stop it. By recognizing the goals and ideals of World Water Day, we commit again on this floor to spread the word about this grave issue and build the momentum to address it. 
   As the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee pointed out, in 2002 the world did take a stand. I was privileged to be at that conference in Johannesburg, where the United States and 185 other countries agreed to that ambitious goal. The frustration is that this goal can be met, if done correctly, for less than the cost of a takeout pizza a year for an American family. 
   In 2005, the Congress passed and the President signed into law the Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act, which I thought was important because not only were we for the first time taking a stand, but the way that we did it, with the leadership of Mr. Lantos and Mr. Hyde; and on the Senate side we had the minority leader and the majority leader coming together in broad bipartisan legislation. We were for the first time providing a plan to implement the commitment that the United States and 185 other countries made. 
   I am saddened as we come to the floor today, however, that the Bush administration has failed to implement this legislation. Instead, as I read the budget, the President has proposed major cuts to the already inadequate commitment from the United States to water and sanitation. 
   The centerpiece of this bill was to create a strategy for meeting our international commitments, to bring together some 15 agencies and departments, to have a plan. Sadly, the deadline has passed, and as yet, we don't have yet that comprehensive plan. We continue to use gimmicks and numbers games to claim that the administration is meeting Congress' requirements, but they are not. This resolution ought to be a point of emphasis that Congress demands a greater effort, not lesser, from the administration, and indeed from ourselves, as we come forward with the budgets this year. We should insist that the United States stand by its word and actually do something about this crisis. We are saying that we have to partner with poor people wherever they are, not in a few allied countries in the Middle East, but especially in sub-Saharan Africa, in South Asia, and around the world. 
   I would hope that with the help of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the distinguished leadership on the floor here that when the State Department comes back to Congress this June with its second report on the implementation of the bipartisan ``Water for the Poor Act,'' I would hope that it will match our legislation in scope, ambition, and focus. If not, let us return to the drawing board to find ways to help the State Department meet its obligation under the Act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy, and I am pleased to join with my colleagues from Oregon in recognizing the importance of the anniversary of the flooding of Celilo Falls. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have, in the Northwest, I think, in recent years, started to re-evaluate our relationship to native peoples and to the special sites that are holy for them. 
   I remember in my youth Celilo Falls when it was a site of the native fishing, going by on a train, watching the dip netting, pulling these fish from the falls. It was something that I didn't properly appreciate at the time. People in my own family were talking about the great dam that was about to be constructed, and using it as a metaphor for progress in our community. 
   Well, transforming the mighty Columbia River into a machine that has aided navigation and electric generation has had many positive aspects for the Pacific Northwest, but it has been devastating for the Native Americans. 
   Sadly, our history, since the treaty of 1855, has been one where we have not always honored even the provisions in those treaties to Native Americans. And particularly the site at Celilo, where we are talking about over 10,000 years of history, strikes special significance. It is an unparalleled meeting point for people of native tribes that, slowly but surely, now we are starting to recognize, starting to appreciate, the Federal Government is starting to invest in working with them to restore the heritage. I hope that this recognition of the significance of the 50th anniversary of the flooding of the falls might be another signal that we are appreciating our responsibility in partnership with native people, the need to work with them in terms of first foods, in terms of historic sites, in terms of restoring the spirit of partnership in those treaties too often that has not been observed. 
   I appreciate my colleague, Congressman Wu, bringing this forward. I appreciate the Congress focusing attention on it today, but I hope it is the beginning of a more sustained effort to keep faith with our native people.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, I appreciate my colleague from Georgia, the distinguished chairman of the Oversight Committee, for permitting me to speak on this bill, and I commend his hard work. 
   I find no small amount of irony hearing one of our friends from the other side of the aisle talk about how it might be time now for tax reform. The other side of the aisle was in charge for 12 years, and it is interesting that in the last 6 years, when they controlled the White House and Congress and had three major tax bills before us, the words in the Tax Code increased 1.5 million; 1.5 million extra words, special-interest provisions, while ignoring opportunities to simplify the code and to deal meaningfully with the tax tsunami that is coming at us, the alternative minimum tax.     
   I appreciate the hard work that the subcommittee has done, dealing with provisions like this that have no argument against them. These are things that are long overdue. I am glad we are moving forward. I commend the subcommittee Chair, and our Chair, Mr. Rangel, for looking at other provisions that would level the playing field, that would deal with simplification, deal with fairness, deal with some of the problems that lower-income citizens have in terms of trying to cope with the complexity, and being able to equip the Internal Revenue Service to make sure that we deal with hundreds of billions of dollars that is uncollected revenue that shifts the burden on the vast majority of Americans who are hard working, who report their income, who pay their taxes fairly and on time. 
   It isn't the fault of the worker who has got the W-2 that we have this vast amount of uncollected income. We have the complexity. I appreciate what this bill represents, a true effort at bipartisan cooperation to establish a foundation. We can move forward to have an Internal Revenue Code that is fair and effective for all.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX REFORM -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   Today, 4 million Americans are paying the price for the misplaced tax priorities of the Bush administration and the Republicans here in Congress. For the last 6 years, their obsession with assisting the top \1/10\ of a percent and other favored special interests to reduce their tax burden has riddled the Tax Code with more loopholes, adding about a million and a half more words to that code. At the same time they have considered three mammoth and expensive tax bills in 2001, 2003 and 2004 that refused to address the alternative minimum tax inequity. They have made few modest additions with broad benefit like the 10-percent bracket but showered their real attention, their affection, and huge sums of money on those who need help the least. In the process, the $5.6 trillion surplus inherited by this administration has evaporated, to be replaced by $2 trillion more in additional national debt. 
   In the meantime, the alternative minimum tax, signed into law by Republican President Richard Nixon to ensure that the richest of Americans, who used tax shelters, pay at least some income tax, has morphed into a tax on millions of Americans who are caught because they pay their State and local taxes and are raising their families but largely leaves the most wealthy untouched. 
   Without extraordinary action, over the course of the next 3 years the alternative minimum tax will ensnare 32 million families, virtually every two-worker middle-class family with children. It won't bother the hedge fund manager or the NBA superstar but it will tax the teacher married to the firefighter with two kids. Because a tax shelter now means paying your local property and income taxes but does not include the tremendous tax advantage from capital gains, it won't hit the high-tech billionaire but will hit the postal worker and the nurse with three teenage kids at home. 
   The zeal to make permanent these tax changes has left the needs of tens of millions of Americans at risk. Indeed, the number one priority of the administration and the Republicans in Congress for taxation would not only make a true reform of the alternative minimum tax prohibitively expensive, it would rely on the ever-widening reach of the alternative minimum tax to finance their schemes. 
   On this day that millions of Americans are filing their tax returns and 4 million are paying the mutated, unfair alternative minimum tax, it is time to have that critical national debate on taxes in honest terms: 
   Should we tax people who work at jobs more than people whose money works for them? 
   Do we care about reducing the ability of some very privileged people to escape taxation? 
   What is our priority for tax reform? Is it to freeze the patchwork of special interest provisions over the last 6 years? Or to prevent 32 million families from an unjust alternative minimum tax, and then paying billions more to accountants just to calculate the damage? 
   I would hope that this is the last year that this unjust tax is used to provide unnecessary tax benefits for those who need them the least at the expense of those truly in need of tax relief.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Following up on my good friend, I'm glad he mentioned bicycles, because there are some people in America that are doing something to provide more choices to Americans, to burn calories instead of fossil fuels. I am pleased that my community, Portland, Oregon, was just designated a ``platinum level bicycle-friendly city,'' the highest rating granted by the League of American Bicyclists. 
   Portland celebrates three decades of consistently applying policies that promote cycling, and the third consecutive year of double digit growth in bicycle ridership. This makes a big difference for real life people. It's why Portlanders are nine times more likely to ride a bicycle that the average American, and part of the rich choice menu for Portlanders with cars and transit and bicycles that ends up having them drive 20 percent less than the average American family. That translates into a savings of $2,500 a year per family that they can spend on education, on housing, on entertainment, on investing back into the community. 
   I would suggest that it's time to celebrate choices, and I'm proud that Portland, Oregon, has decided to give cyclists the choices they deserve and is being honored for that effort.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, President Kennedy, 47 years ago at the establishment of the Peace Corps, said that reactions to the Peace Corps are proof that we have in America ``an immense reservoir of such men and women, anxious to sacrifice their energies and time and toil to the cause of world peace and human progress.'' 
   What was true in 1961 as it is true today. Peace Corps volunteers are an outstanding group of men and women serving the cause of humanity across the globe. 
   This year, those words have even more meaning for me as my daughter Anne is serving in the Peace Corps in Mozambique. 
   During this National Peace Corps Week, I want to commend the service and commitment of the Peace Corps volunteers from my community and express our pride in fellow Oregonians who have chosen to devote 2 years or more of their lives in service to others. 
   In addition to Anne Blumenauer, I would like to recognize John Bento, serving in Georgia; Amanda Bickle-Eldridge, serving in Nicaragua; Stuart Chidester, serving in Paraguay; Melanie Edwards, serving in Azerbaijan; Ashley Hollenbeck, serving in Morocco; Andrea Lawrence, serving in Bolivia; James Lensen-Callas, serving in Peru; Erik Nelson, serving in Georgia; Sami Oeser, serving in Botswana; Sandra Stevens, serving in Jamaica; Paul Sylvester, serving in Samoa; Normand Tremblay, serving in Cameroon; and Natalie Wilson, serving in Botswana.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 2269, the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007, the single largest investment in college financial aid since the 1944 GI bill. This legislation will help millions of middle- and low-income families and students pay for college without any new cost to taxpayers. At a time of skyrocketing tuition costs, government investment has not kept up. As college degrees become more expensive, we must help keep bright students in school and ensure a bright future for America. 
   The legislation boosts college financial aid by about $18 billion over the next 5 years, and pays for itself by reducing excessive federal subsidies paid to lenders in the college loan industry by $19 billion. Over the course of 5 years, almost 70,000 Oregon students would benefit from an additional $194 million in available loans and Pell Grants. The average Oregon student graduates with more than $14,000 in debt, and this legislation would cut by almost $5,000 the interest paid on their loans. By investing in our students, we ensure a well-educated, globally competitive workforce. We also benefit our communities by providing incentives for our brightest to go into public service jobs and into our neediest schools. 
   I am proud to be part of this new Congress that prioritizes education, making it feasible for all families to send their kids to college, and keeping America competitive.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the chairman's courtesy in yielding time. 
   I see what the subcommittee has done here is not an effort to somehow dictate to local governments what they have to do, but instead, structuring how to get more out of scarce Federal investments. 
   As has been noted on the floor by people on both sides of the aisle, we are approaching a transportation infrastructure funding crisis in this country. There is not enough money remaining in the trust fund to deal with the existing level of programming, let alone what is going to be required as we move it in the next three authorizations. And countries around the world are spending trillions of dollars in China, in the European Union, in Japan, while we're falling behind. 
   I appreciate the big-picture approach that the subcommittee has taken in terms of dealing with location efficiencies, with balanced transportation, with initiatives to green the infrastructure. I am hopeful that the instruction that the subcommittee has given to some of the Federal transportation agencies on how to have maximum impact by weighing factors of economic development and trip reduction to stretch more of those scarce dollars. 
   I applaud funding the $1.4 billion for Amtrak, which hints at efficiencies that we can have in the long run. Because adequate funding of our rail passenger infrastructure is the cheapest, fastest way to increase airport capacity and reduce congestion, it's the cheapest, fastest way to get additional highway capacity while saving energy and reducing greenhouse gases. 
   This is an unprecedented effort on behalf of the subcommittee to look at the big picture under its jurisdiction in the appropriations process. I think it's going to have a dramatic impact in the years to come. I appreciate what they're doing, and I look forward to working with them in the future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Chairman, I have earlier indicated my appreciation of what the subcommittee has done, looking at the big picture and trying to squeeze additional efficiencies out of transportation and housing initiatives. And in that regard, I offer this amendment and hope to inquire of the Chair and ranking member to see if there is something we can do to move this forward. 
   I'm prepared to withdraw the amendment, but I at least would like my 3 1/2 minutes here to put it before the committee and seek their assistance as it moves forward.     
   My amendment deals specifically with the Conserve by Bike program.  This was unanimously adopted in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and subsequently signed into law. It was authorized at $6.2 million, a program that would establish 10 pilot projects across the country. These projects would utilize education and marketing tools to encourage people to replace some of their car trips with bicycle trips. 
   The law also directs the Transportation Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a national study to help us understand the benefits from converting cars to bike and how to educate people about these benefits. 
   Nationally, less than 1 percent of trips are by bicycles currently. But in many bicycle-friendly communities, the percentage is much higher. In my home town of Portland, Oregon, like yours, Madam Chairman, that percentage is 2 or 3 percentage points. In our community of Portland, we have the highest percentage of bicycle commuting in the country, despite the fact that it rains all the time. 
   Were we to increase bicycle trips by just 2 percent nationally, we would save more than 693 million gallons of gasoline per year, up to $5 billion. Increasing bicycle usage has additional benefits of reducing our dependence on foreign oil and improving public health. When we are concerned about an obesity epidemic among our young people, having bicycles is an opportunity to reduce vehicle emissions; and combating adult and childhood obesity would seem to be a logical step. 
   For all of these reasons, Congress had the foresight to include the Conserve by Bike program in the 2005 energy policy. Unfortunately, the program has not yet been implemented, because the Department of Transportation does not have the contract authority to fund the program. This appropriation is necessary to get the program off the ground. 
   Given its modest price tag and innumerable benefits, I was disappointed to see that the program did not receive funds under the Secretary's account for Transportation Planning and Research, especially considering the committee's laudable commitment to other green and efficiency measures. 
   Many cities and nations, particularly in Europe, have seen how converting car trips to bike trips can have measurable benefits for all its citizens. We have all perhaps been reading about Paris's recent inauguration of their bike-sharing program featuring over 10,000 bikes across the city to demonstrate that people will ride bikes when the infrastructure exists. 
   Madam Chairman, I would strongly urge that the committee consider working with me to make sure that this important authorized program find funding in the conference report. As I say, I deeply appreciate the work that the committee has done. This is a relatively low-cost, high-impact area. Given the fact that we have come forward with over $5.5 billion in transportation infrastructure for bicycles, for trails, and for pedestrian activities, this would seem to be a relatively modest program to be able to jump-start the Conserve by Bike. 
   Madam Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (PLIGHT OF IRAQI REFUGEES -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, the front page of the Washington Post yesterday had the harsh and ugly reality. We cannot afford not to help the Iraqis who trusted and worked with the United States with the opportunity for refugee status. 
   I quote: 
   ``The American Ambassador in Baghdad, Ryan Crocker, has asked the Bush administration to take the unusual step of granting immigrant visas to all Iraqis employed by the United States Government in Iraq because of growing concern that they will quit and flee the country if they cannot be assured of eventual safe passage to the United States.'' 
   For the last 7 months, I have been working with a broad bipartisan group of people on legislation that would deal with the largest ongoing humanitarian crisis in the world other than Darfur. And unlike the tragedy in the Darfur region of the Sudan, the United States is front and center in Iraq. We have over 300,000 American soldiers, contractors, and civilian U.S. Government employees. We see firsthand every day the train wreck, while officials at the top of the food chain appear, sadly, oblivious and powerless to do anything about it. 
   I am proud to say that there are young American soldiers who will try to do something about it, even after they rotate out of the country. That is how I first became involved in this issue, as young Oregonian Guard members fought valiantly to try to save the life of their interpreter when they returned to Oregon, knowing that her life was at risk. Working with those young guardsmen and with high school students from Lincoln High School in Portland, Oregon, we were able to have a happy resolution in this one case. But, sadly, it is only one case. 
   I have become acquainted with another true American hero. Kirk Johnson was a young USAID worker who, as he rotated out, embarked upon a crusade to save the lives of Iraqis who were at risk because they were known to have helped the United States. He has compiled a list of over 500 Iraqis who were interpreters, who were guides, who were civilian employees. Not one, the last time I talked to Mr. Johnson, had been able to make it to the United States. 
   The sad fact is that we are failing miserably in terms of responding to the refugee requirements. Since I became involved last fall, the United States has admitted the grand total of 133 Iraqi refugees, a shocking number when we consider that over 2 million Iraqis have fled the country and another 2 million within Iraq have been displaced from their homes. It's not that we can't figure out how to do it if we care, if we establish a priority, if we work on it. In that same period of time that we could only admit 133 Iraqis, we have allowed 3,500 refugees from Iran, a country with whom we have rocky relations, to say the least, where we have deep concerns about terrorism. 
   It makes a mockery of our commitment to accept 7,000 during this fiscal year which ends September 30. There must be a sense of urgency and a profound sense of obligation. In order to make even that modest goal of 7,000, we are going to have to admit more Iraqi refugees every working day than we have for the entire last 9 months. 
   It is not just the right thing to do for these poor souls and their families. There is a harsh geopolitical reality. With 4 million Iraqis displaced, more than half fleeing the country, there's 1.2 million in Syria, and the accounts of what these people are forced to do to keep body and soul together are truly disturbing. Or three-quarters of a million Iraqi refugees across the border in Jordan, threatening to overwhelm that small country, adding another element of instability to this already unsettled part of the world. 
   I urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives to look at a letter that we are circulating to them today that includes this article from the Post. I urge them to cosponsor our bipartisan legislation, H.R. 2265, have them urge a markup and action before we recess for August. Our failure to keep our commitment will be exceedingly serious. We undermine our ability to carry out  our current mission in Iraq if people we depend upon know that they can't depend upon us.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy. I am pleased to stand in support of the rule and the underlying bill. 
   I deeply appreciate the work that the subcommittee has done, producing a critical piece of legislation for times of escalating energy costs, congestion, pollution. The work that the committee has done, in particular putting the big picture together looking at the intersection between transportation, land use, and energy, is to be commended. 
   I am particularly pleased of the work that the committee has done in zeroing in on three particular areas. One that is of a particular interest to me has been the Small Starts program, which permits things like street cars to be reintroduced into American communities. It was something that I was able to work on and insert in the last reauthorization. Sadly, it has been 3 years since that bill was enacted, and the Federal Transit Administration has been unable to get the rules together to be able what should have been a simpler small scale program to be able to operate. 
   I deeply appreciate the work that the committee has done to be able to make clear that the FTA needs to get its act together; that, rather than using a single means of cost effectiveness and disregarding all the other factors required under the underlying legislation, that the FTA must weigh economic development and land use effects of the project. This is critical. It is something that 82 communities across the country are now looking at for the reintroduction of street car and Small Start. This committee language is an important step in that direction, to help the administration obey the law, something they have been unable to do for 3 years. 
   I am also pleased that there is clarification of the utilization of the CMAQ, the Congestion Mitigation Air Quality.  The administration has unfairly limited the application of this funding simply to new bus services, leaving out rail transit all together. There are projects in my district and others around the country that would be unfairly impacted by the narrow implementation of this rule. It would be the wrong thing to do in a time of rising oil costs, transportation congestion, and the economic and environmental concerns. I appreciate that the committee directs the Federal Highway Administration to reinstitute the CMAQ eligibility regarding operating assistance for New Starts projects for up to 3 years. This is back to the original intent, it is a great step forward, and I appreciate them doing it. 
   Last but not least, ``location efficiency,'' particularly as relates to HOPE VI programs, is very, very important to where a project is located and how it is constructed. The committee has taken some pioneering work to be able to look at the application, to be able to deal with the implementation in a location-efficient way that will stretch transportation dollars. It will make a huge difference for low-income families who spend more on gasoline in many cases than they do on food, on education, or any other major discretion. In fact, many low-income people actually spend more on transportation than on housing. 
   I must conclude by noting that there are still some who hold on to the pathological notion that the United States should be the only country in the world with unsubsidized rail passenger service. I would note that the airline industry has made a net profit of zero in its 75-year history despite massive Federal subsidies. I think this legislation is a step forward by simply giving a little bit of what is necessary for a national rail passenger network. It is cost effective, it is energy efficient. It brings us in line with where the rest of the civilized world is. And I commend the committee for it.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy. 
   We listened to our friends on the other side of the aisle cite averages, but those averages include the incomes of people like Bill Gates. They ignore the realities of 100 million lower-income Americans who are struggling to even approach middle income and who have been suffering a decline in recent years. These are people who pay more for food, for housing, for transportation. They are discriminated against by payday loans and subprime lending. Some are too poor to qualify for the child tax credit because of the perverted tax priorities that the Republicans have had in the last 12 years. 
   The dire results that have been cited by my friends on the other side of the aisle are simply hogwash. I come from one of the 28 States that increased its minimum wage and has indexed it automatically for inflation. Since we have done that, our economy is stronger, and our business leadership will tell you that what we have done is fair; it is good for all of us, not just the poor. 
   I hope this is a first step that is followed by increased awareness and sensitivity to 100 million lower-income Americans. Helping 13 million today with their first pay raise in 10 years is a good start.

   It is amusing to hear from our friends from the other side of the aisle who for 12 years have run the show and are complaining about some of the choices that are being made by some 4,000 institutions of higher education. If they had something that they wanted to do, I am sorry, but they didn't for the last 12 years. But what we have done in the first 12 days is to act to make a difference.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. And I am saying for 12 years they had a chance. I am sorry if you couldn't work with the administration and the Republicans who ran the other Chamber. But my point is I am not dealing with Taj Mahals; I am dealing with community colleges that have not had the basics. I am not talking about rock walls for 50 students at one time; I am talking about basic laboratory space, classroom space, library space, people who are having difficulty getting access. 
   The point is that the people on the other side of the aisle have been talking about this while they have been cutting opportunities and cutting budgets, cutting taxes. This bill continues our commitment to working families, promoting competitiveness in the workforce by starting by cutting interest rates on these subsidized undergraduate loans. It targets the lower and middle income students and their families with the most financial need and the least support. 
   The poor often get grants; the rich don't need them. This bill would save that college borrower in the middle thousands of dollars. In my State in Oregon, our students have the second highest amount of debt in the country. Over 40,000 Oregon students a year will be substantially helped by this legislation amongst the 5 1/2 million students around the country in times of skyrocketing tuition. 
   Now, unlike the Republican approach of the last 12 years of cutting budgets and cutting taxes and putting the tab on the credit cards of our youth, this bill is fully paid for by offsets. Five of these six were included in President Bush's fiscal year 2006 budget and have bipartisan support. 
   We owe it to our students, our communities, and hard pressed families to make college not just a dream but an affordable reality, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5 as an important first step in making that happen

   Unexploded ordnance technologies and levels of funding are clearly inadequate. Refining detection technologies will significantly reduce cleanup costs and allow for more rapid cleanup. This amendment moves us in the direction by making research and development of UXO detection a priority, facilitates the deployment of this in the field where it's needed through partnership with outside entities and training of skilled operators. It requires the Department of Defense to provide a detailed review of its activities in this area by February, 2009.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy, as I deeply appreciate the work that the subcommittee has done. This is not just about spending money; it's about spending money right. 
   It is important that resources are being focused to being able to ``fix it first,'' to be able to deal with the fraying of our Nation's infrastructure. As the gentleman pointed out, there are 100 million trips on tens of thousands of substandard bridges across the country. 
   There is an important step in this legislation to have more robust funding for Amtrak. We have avoided the problems of past sessions where we have come through here to have an ideological battle fought about how somehow the United States should be the only country in the world without government-supported rail passenger service. Given skyrocketing oil prices and congestion in our highways, people understand that that is a prescription for disaster. I appreciate the hard work of the committee coming forward with a proposal to help put a floor underneath the rail passenger infrastructure, not making a difference just for Arizona but throughout the country. 
   I appreciate looking at the big picture. The committee's willingness to look at how land use, housing, and transportation fit together to coax maximum advantage out of those investments is very, very important.     
   I hope that we can continue to work with the subcommittee, with the whole Appropriations Committee, with the authorizing committees to be able to get more out of these investments. 
   Last but not least, it should be pointed out that this will be the last budget that we'll be able to have with the transportation funding at this level. The refusal of the administration to work with us to increase transportation investment in the last Congress resulted in a reauthorization level that is higher than the trust fund can support. We're going to be running out of money here in a couple of months. That means that the task of the subcommittee will be extraordinarily difficult, given the slow payout rate of transportation funding. It means you're going to have to cut probably four times the amount of the deficit this next year, and it's going to be even greater in subsequent years. So I'm hopeful that, working with the subcommittee dealing with appropriations and with Ways and Means, with the authorizers, we can come forward to make sure that we don't lose the opportunity to make the right investments in transportation and housing, because these are going to help us with greenhouse gases. These are going to help us with economic development, with energy efficiency. It's a tall order ahead of us, but I appreciate the foundation that the subcommittee has laid, and look forward to working with them.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate your courtesy, Mr. Inslee, in permitting me to speak on this. I appreciate your continued leadership in spotlighting issues of global warming, energy efficiency, and the difference it will make for Americans across the country. 
   I too was impressed today with the clear, articulate vision set forth by our new Speaker, NANCY PELOSI, reemphasizing the commitment that the Democratic leadership and our caucus has to deal meaningfully with problems of global warming, energy independence and efficiency. 
   Having an opportunity this evening to focus on this is important because for the first time in a dozen years we won't just be talking about this. We have legislative leadership that is committed to action, to dealing with the redirection of vast subsidies that have been given to people who need them the least, and, instead, rationalizing investments in areas that you have championed with alternative energy, wind, solar, biomass and, particularly, conservation. 
   You are right, tracking the problems of transportation is central to dealing with greenhouse gases, global warming and our alarming dependence on oil imported from increasingly unstable areas of the world. 
   I appreciate the conversation that you and Mr. Holt have had about the positive impact, the President and the Republican leadership in the last half dozen years have been baring their head, claiming that we can't deal with problems of global warming, climate change, energy conservation because of the economic disruption. 
   You have cited examples from our Pacific Northwest where there are entrepreneurs ready to go, rolling up their sleeves, with things that will make a difference, creating jobs in this country, that will, in fact, conserve resources and save money.     
   Our ability to invest in wise, diverse transportation choices for the American public has the opportunity to put money in the pockets of Americans while it fights greenhouse gas. We consume approximately 10 percent of the world's petroleum supply each year driving our SUVs to work and back. The commitment to make sure that the Arctic wildlife refuge is the last place we drill, not the next, that makes energy conservation more available to Americans, and unlocks the economic potential of a whole array of new technologies and products.  
   I look forward to continuing our conversation here over the next few minutes. I, personally, am committed to continuing, as I have in both of your districts in the past. I know you both have constituents that are concerned about transportation choices. This Congress might be able to do something to provide equity, for instance, for cyclists, people who burn calories instead of petroleum, but are treated differently in our Tax Code for their commuting costs, for instance. I look forward to working with you to make these a reality and make a difference to enhance the planet, protect our national security and put money in the pockets of the American taxpayer.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate your positive words about our community. And I do take pride in essentially having reached 1990, emission levels for carbon dioxide and actually having reductions in per capita emissions for each of the last 4 years. And it has been done, not at the expense of economic development and choice, but rather, as a result of providing it. And this is a point, I guess, that I am eager for us to pursue. And I appreciate the leadership that you gentlemen have exercised, both in terms of looking and investigating what's going on in Oregon and providing leadership in your own States and in your own communities. 
   The average American family, today, pays more for transportation than anything else in their budget, except for housing. And for Americans who make less than $40,000 a year, typically, they pay more for transportation than for housing. So our being able to have sensible development patterns where people can live closer to where they work, employing what Mr. Holt was talking about in terms of smarter technology to let people know what they are getting into in terms of congestion, and giving people choices. This is not about saying you can't drive a car. 
   But when I go to other communities, and since I have been in Congress, I have been in more than 200 communities across the country working on issues of transportation, land use and affordable housing. What I find is that people are complaining not that we are trying to take away their choices, but because they have no choice. Too many communities, people can only drive to work in a single occupant vehicle. In many of these communities, 90 percent of the children cannot go to school safely on their own by bicycle or walking. And what we are talking about here is giving back choices to the American public about where they live, how they travel, choices that will not only reduce congestion, improve air pollution, it will put money in the pockets of American families.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you. And I am intrigued with the conversation, the way that it is going at this point. We talked a moment ago about giving Americans more choices as to how they transport themselves. We can avoid the disastrous policies of this administration and the past congressional leadership of picking winners and losers and picking the wrong ones to win. 
   What you have described I have seen in my own State. There are people going gung ho in terms of biomass, in terms of wave energy, and technology that is emerging around the country in colleges and universities, in small businesses and large to take advantage of the opportunity. 
   If we just level the playing field, if we shift the massive subsidies away from the people who do not need it and do not deserve it, and help level the playing field for these emerging technologies dealing with biomass from any of a variety of fuel stocks, of dealing with electrical, solar, wind, wave, if we level the playing field, if we give them a fair and predictable tax treatment, which we do not do now, we can take these subsidies that are frankly not buying us anything. 
   It was interesting, the report that was suppressed by the administration for a year, that revealed we actually would have done more for energy supplies in this country, rather than lavishing tax breaks on the most profitable corporations in the world, the oil companies, selling the most profitable product, oil and gas, we would have been farther ahead just buying it up. 
   By our redirecting these investments, we can help this nascent technology grow around the country and we can have unleashed the potential of making a difference and allowing the free market to work after we level the playing field, after we enable them. 
   As you indicated, we are probably going to need to have some rules of the game to be able to jump-start these markets. But I really appreciate what you are talking about here. 
   I was in over a dozen States this last fall working on behalf of a number of our new colleagues, including in Ohio. I am intrigued that they to a person are concerned about global warming, to a person they understand before they become Members of this body what you are talking about here, and it makes me think that we have a real opportunity to tap some creative energy in this body to 
   finally, as I say, stop talking about it and actually do something.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. If I could briefly comment, I appreciate what you have each indicated in terms of the new generation of dealing with biofuels. I think this is an example of how we move forward. 
   You are absolutely right in terms of being able to zero in on the research, to squeeze out of this, to have tax incentives that are uniform, predictable and deal with the second and third generation of ethanol development and dealing with what might happen in terms of unlocking the power of biology here.  
   I have been struck by how there are many opportunities for us in the new farm bill to redirect, what is it, $23 billion of subsidy at this point that flows increasingly to a very small number of farmers, often corporate farms or large ones in a small limited area in a small, limited number of crops. We have an opportunity to unlock that, help farmers with their energy production, allow more farmers into it and find out how we unlock the power of this ingenuity.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy in permitting me to speak on this. 
   I am pleased, Mr. Speaker, that we are acting quickly in this Congress on the unfinished business from the last Congress. In short order we will be dealing with things like implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations, we will have a clean, up-or-down vote on the minimum wage unchanged after 10 years, and we will be able to deal with promoting stem cell research and cutting interest rates on student loans. Again, this is getting past the unfinished business left over from the last Congress. 
   I am pleased that today, unlike how we started the last Congress, we are not beginning by watering down the ethics rules or making it more difficult for the minority. 
   I believe very strongly in the commitment that our caucus has made. Our leadership has articulated that we are not going to treat the Republican minority the way that we were treated. I think it is going to be very important, Mr. Speaker, that we deal with the spirit with which these rules are enforced. And I am absolutely certain that you will find that the people on the Democratic side of the aisle are going to make sure that the spirit is enforced to make sure that voting machines are not kept open for hours in the middle of the night; making sure that our commitment to have functioning conference committees, where Republicans will be invited to attend conference committees, know when they are there, be able to sign off on them, and not have things parachuted in in the middle of the night in back rooms that nobody had seen; There will be no effort to have the notorious K Street Project turn the business lobby into a partisan tool. 
   Most important, I am interested in our progress to maintain and enhance civil discourse on this floor. I look forward to a bipartisan effort on an ethics panel that would be independent enforcement and that issue will be reported back to Congress by March 15. I am interested in working on a bipartisan basis to establish this independent mechanism for ethics oversight. 
   The rules we are adopting today and that we will be refining are an important first step to realize the promise of  the new Congress. Most important will be the spirit. And I, for one, pledge myself to work with Rules Committee members on both sides of the aisle to make sure that that spirit is maintained.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, As a result of Republican obstructionism and the President's threats to veto our Democratic Congress' new investments in health, the environment and infrastructure, Congress is being forced to pass a resolution to keep the government operating beyond next week's end of the fiscal year. Unfortunately, this bill included money to continue funding the war in Iraq. I have pledged: ``not another dime for the war,'' and voted ``no.'' I will continue to vote against any appropriations bill that continues military operations in Iraq. 
   At the same time, the motion to condemn Moveon.org was both irrelevant and hypocritical. It was irrelevant in that it had nothing to do with the underlying bill and hypocritical because the Republicans have tolerated, and in some cases encouraged, some of the most savage Swift-boating of candidates and individuals without ever raising a voice in protest. 
   People have deep concerns about this administration and they have the right to question the testimony General Petraeus gave before Congress. The twisted factual basis for some of his statements, which charitably can only be deemed convoluted, has been made clear in numerous independent press accounts. I voted ``no,'' choosing not to be a part of the irrelevance and hypocrisy. 
   Mr OBERSTAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 52, making continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2008, and for other  purposes. H.J. Res. 52 provides continuing appropriations for Federal programs, including the aviation investment programs. 
   H.J. Res. 52 includes a provision extending the Federal Aviation Administration's Airport Improvement Program, AIP. Specifically, section 148 of H.J. Res. 52 provided mandatory AIP contract authority only for the term covered by the Continuing Resolution at a level that, when annualized, equals the amount of mandatory AIP contract authority included in the fiscal year 2008 budget baseline. 
   The Congressional Budget Office, the House Budget Committee, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, the Senate Commerce Committee, and the Office of Management and Budget all concur that section 148 provides mandatory contract authority. Moreover, section 148 is a change to a mandatory program and therefore, the amount of contract authority provided by the Continuing Resolution will ultimately be rebased in the baseline and put on the mandatory side of the budget. The baseline for the AIP program will remain mandatory. 
   Based on my shared understanding that section 148 will not in any way change the nature of the AIP program, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.J. Res. 52.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (THE ECONOMIC TRAIN WRECK: IT MATTERS WHO IS IN THE WHITE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, it has been a painful experience for all of us watching this slow-motion economic train wreck get worse and worse. 
   One of the lessons over the last dozen years that I have been in Congress is that it matters deeply who is in the White House. One can just look at the bankruptcy legislation, the so-called ``reform,'' as it worked its way through Congress getting actually worse in various iterations. When Bill Clinton was no longer there to veto it, it was embraced by the Bush administration and enacted into law to the detriment of the vast majority of American citizens. 
   One looks at how for 13 years when the Fed Chairman refused to use the authority to reign in the subprime mortgage madness, the ``froth'' that Mr. Greenspan referred to. We went from the firm leadership of the Clinton White House Treasury Team of Rubin and Summers to the drift of the Bush Treasury with O'Neill and Snow. 
   I appreciate the efforts by Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Frank to protect the taxpayers, to rein in the people who have driven these companies over the edge and our economy into the ditch, to assure that they don't profit from any Federal bailout, to stop the golden parachutes. This may seem to some to be relatively small potatoes given the hundreds of billions of dollars that are being tossed around, but it is incredibly important in terms of the signals we are going to send to people who are going to behave recklessly in the management of corporations. It is critical that we don't rub the nose of the public in this failure by rewarding people who have helped create this disaster. 
   It's important that we take the time to craft this properly, to have a shorter leash for the Treasury, particularly because there is such a dramatic difference that we are hearing on the campaign trail between a Senator McCain, who has repeatedly said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong even as he has advocated policies and has been counseled by people like Phil Gramm who helped make those fundamentals weaker. Senator Obama has appropriately highlighted the problems, proposing reasonable solutions, while convening groups of people who understand the problem, who have credibility, and the reasonable principles and solution. 
   Some of the key elements that should be pursued from my perspective are, first and foremost, to not put the taxpayer on the hook for any more than is absolutely necessary. That sounds simple, but we see proposals coming forward that would have us not simply mark to market, to just buy the value of the damaged items but things that are going to actually accelerate the amount of loss. It is important that we get something in return, get back equity. This is not unprecedented. This is just what happened a few days ago with insurance giant AIG, and it should be a principle that is applied to any other institutions that are going to receive Federal assistance. 
   It is absolutely critical that we focus on two groups that we need to be more sensitive to than the reckless and the greedy: homeowners and retirees. It is important to stabilize the middle class housing market on which so much of not just our economy but the stability of our communities relies. Today's retirees are in danger of paying the greatest price of all. Many are already losing what they thought were lifetime guarantees of health care and pensions as corporations they retired from rewrite the rules. Too many have less saved, they have longer lives in retirement, and they are going to be forced to deal with more risk than ever before. 
   All of this suggests, while I think we are moving in the right direction changing some of these proposals, just because the Secretary of the Treasury and the Fed Chair made some rash comments about urgency, Congress should not rush it; it needs the time to get this right.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, I opposed the 2005 Bankruptcy Act in part because of its egregious support for abusive credit card practices. H.R. 5244 works to  knock down some of those supports. This bill represents one step toward fixing some of the worst aspects of that bankruptcy bill and one step towards resolving the challenges facing our nation's consumers and I support it. 
   It is outrageous that as the financial crisis has spread, credit card companies have imposed higher delinquency fees. Double-cycle billing, unfair penalties, and arbitrary rate increases likely are also part of the credit card industry's response. 
   This bill would put a stop to many of the most egregious practices by credit card companies. This bill ends ``double-cycle billing,'' where consumers pay interest and fees even where they have paid their obligation fully and on time. This bill also requires that cards allocate consumer payments proportionally to debt carrying different interest rates--rather than allocating the payment to the debt carrying the lowest interest rate. 
   In short, I support this bill because it provides added protections for consumers, and I will continue to work to end abusive credit card and bankruptcy practices.

   This is not a partisan issue. Maintaining a fair and responsive government is a duty that transcends politics.  This legislation fairly addresses both parties by granting one seat in the House to the District and one additional seat to Utah, which is next in line to receive an additional House seat based on its population. This elegant and equitable solution leaves the overall composition of the House unchanged as the District seat is anticipated to be Democratic and the Utah seat Republican. 
   Given this bipartisan spirit, I am disappointed that the administration is fighting to deny citizens their basic voting rights. I hope the President has the good sense to withdraw his veto threat. Any concerns this administration has regarding this bill's constitutional appropriateness are best left up to the judicial branch to clarify. 
   I am proud to support this important legislation and urge its speedy passage into law. Residents of the District have waited long enough.

The war against Saddam Hussein was over in a few weeks, yet for over 3 years they have been trapped in a deadly crossfire of an Iraqi war. This bill is not micromanaging the war, it is the next logical step as Congress rediscovers its voice and its constitutional responsibility as a coequal branch of government.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (WE MUST TAKE CARE OF OUR VETERANS -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, historically, the month of March has been a time when we greet representatives of our Nation's veterans who come to Capitol Hill to advocate on behalf of their fellow veterans. This year, however, it is hard not to feel a sense of shame as we see the veterans spreading out over Capitol Hill again carrying their message. Sadly, as has been shown in our hearings and on the front pages of our papers around the country in countless news accounts, Congress has done a poor job of listening to their needs in the past, and we are seeing more than ever the need to address those concerns directly. 
   I haven't supported the reckless treatment of our veterans. I have supported our Democratic efforts when we were in the minority, fighting for appropriate funding and equipment. But we can only go so far with an administration that has been focused on its own version of reality and its own priorities very much at variance with our veterans, and that have been enabled for the last 6 years by a Republican leadership with their own sense of priorities. 
   We have seen and heard from our veterans about the long waits, the red tape. It is not, however, the fault of some faceless bureaucracy as implied by Vice President Cheney yesterday, because there are countless dedicated men and women who still provide good care for most of our veterans and who want to do better. It is an administration and its policies and the people that they have put in charge that must change. And, of course, it is the war in Iraq, itself. 
   It is not just a question of money. We have given plenty of money to this administration, more in fact than they have asked for. We are spending more on our military and veterans than the entire rest of the world combined. But because of the mismanagement, we have been giving too much to the wrong people to do the wrong things, dealing with the wrong priorities. 
   I just left a budget hearing. We are still looking at an administration that wants to lavish billions on missile defense and Cold War era weapons, while having proposals that would cut programs for traumatic brain injury and, according to the Congressional Budget Office, underfund our veterans' needs by some $3.4 billion over the next 5 years. 
   We are dealing with an administration that has put political operatives in sensitive positions. The head of the Veterans Administration, for example, is a former head of the Republican Party who was surprised about the budget problems, whose administration forgot about the thousands of returning veterans that were going to need more services, who was baffled by the security lapses in the veterans' files on VA computers. 
   This last week, I hope the tide is turning. I hope that finally the spotlight that has been focused on amplifying the concerns that a number of us have heard and have talked about in the past, will make a case that will not be possible for this administration to ignore any longer. 
   Mr. Vice President, it's not just the Federal bureaucracy. It's your bureaucracy after 6 years. It's your budgets, your priorities, your leaders who are failing. 
   I am confident that this Congress will be able to turn the tide so next year, when our veterans' representatives are here on Capitol Hill, we are not going to feel guilty; that we will be able to look our young men and women who are in the service today and the people who are recovering from their service overseas in the eye, knowing that we, this Congress, the administration and the American people have done all we could for them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you. I appreciate the gentlelady's courtesy. 
   It is a little frustrating to listen to our friends repudiate the legacy of Ronald Reagan and Dick Darman who believed in the PAYGO philosophy. These people feel that they cannot balance revenue and spending, and they don't even want to try. We heard them in our committee propose adjustments that would have added over $1 trillion to the deficit. 
   This budget demonstrates the Democratic commitment to the environment, public health and livable communities in a fiscally sustainable fashion. This budget addresses the 7 years of cutting environmental programs and failing to address our energy needs and challenges of this country. 
   We reject the President's cuts to these programs and begin to reinvest in our public lands and domestic economy. This President's budget severely cuts important core environmental programs at a time when a third of our Nation's waters don't meet water quality standards and 150 million people live in areas that exceed EPA's air pollution standards. And the President's budget would provide some of the lowest levels of funding for clean water and drinking water revolving funds in their history, hurting communities' ability to meet their water infrastructure needs, which the EPA of the administration has estimated to be over a quarter of a billion dollars.  
   Finally, the President's budget cuts the USDA farm bill conservation programs which provide farmers with critical technical and financial assistance to reduce erosion, protect wildlife habitat and limit adverse impacts from agriculture on land and water. 
   Our budget rejects those cuts to natural resources environmental program. This provides 10 percent more to discretionary funding than the President's budget. 
   On the environment, over 5 years the chairman's mark is more than $26 billion higher than the President's budget. 
   This budget accommodates the legislation that the House has passed three times to increase tax incentives for renewable energy and conservation. It rejects the President's cuts to research as well as weatherization assistance for low-income families to cut down on energy bills. Instead, this bill increases funding for energy efficient and renewable energy programs and vehicle technologies that move our economies forward.

This assault on public broadcasting is not just undermining the digital conversion, the education and public affairs that we have grown to rely on, it's a direct assault at small-town and rural America where it's more expensive to reach and they don't have the donor base to provide it for themselves.

Indeed, this has been recalibrated to be able to make it more flexible, reduce the standard, and give more flexibility in ways to achieve it. There is no State that does not have opportunities for renewable energy.  
   The ranking member suggests that it doesn't go far enough. Well, I would suggest that part of the reason that some of the exemptions have been made for co-ops and whatnot is to recognize the differences and to make it actually easier politically. 
   I will guarantee you that within the next 3 or 4 years after we adopt this we will be coming back, because the public will be demanding that more happen. That is why States are already ahead of the Federal Government and are adopting portfolio standards that are higher than we have. 
   People recognize that that is a source of new jobs in Oklahoma and in Florida. It is a new source of jobs in my State of Oregon. There is a new plant in Arkansas. There are tremendous opportunities.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, while I agreed with my friend from Wisconsin about the farm bill, he could not be more wrong when it comes to what is happening here on this energy legislation. 
   First and foremost, it is not just the appearance of PAYGO. We are rolling up our sleeves and actually funding this legislation, instead of the borrow-and-spend policies that we have seen the other side of the aisle practice for the last 12 years. We have a bipartisan ``pay-for'' that was approved in the first hours of this session, closing an unnecessary loophole that was snuck in in the last session of Congress. 
   The notion about picking winners and losers is also wrong. With the leadership our Chair of the select committee, Mr. Neal, we had extensive hearings to listen to what happened across-the-board in terms of alternative energy. We have rationalized how they are treated for subsidizing wind, for solar, for biomass, for wave energy, a whole range of alternative energy sources. 
   We are not picking winners and losers. We are extending tax subsidies, and we are treating them all fairly to let the marketplace act. We are increasing the supply of energy. By providing incentives for domestic production of alternatives it is going to make a huge difference. And we are relying on the energy and activity of cities and States across the country that are far ahead of the Federal Government when it comes to dealing with global warming, with dealing with energy efficiency. We have at least 612 cities that have already initiated their own Programs of Kyoto compliance. We are  providing some resources to help them do something about it. 
   Last, but not least, we are closing the egregious loophole that had the Federal Government subsidize the purchase of the largest, most energy-inefficient luxury cars. We have closed that hummer loophole. We are instead using this money to provide opportunities for using smaller, more fuel efficient vehicles; and we are subsidizing plug-in hybrids, a very good trade off.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, the amendment before us today is a relatively simple and very direct effort. It is an attempt to provide incentives for the gas industry to be able to conserve natural gas. Unfortunately, the way that it is regulated in 40 States around the country, actually there is a perverse incentive that they make more money the more gas they sell and they are penalized if they conserve. 
   There are 10 States that have different initiatives to try to decouple the volume from profit. There are efforts here, which I am pleased to say were pioneered in my State of Oregon with our local utility Northwest Natural, to have a conservation-based tariff or mechanism for utility regulation.     
   This legislation, which is supported by the American Gas Association and by the environmental community, is to encourage development of utility regulation that doesn't penalize conservation but encourages it. It is not a mandate and it does not carry any costs but has the potential of saving American consumers billions of dollars and a great deal of energy, and I strongly urge its acceptance.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I will just conclude. I appreciate my friend from Pennsylvania's observation. The point that I would make is that the companies that are distributing gas have tremendous fixed costs that they have to support regardless of the volume. This simply encourages them to be able to explore other alternatives for rate regulation. The cheapest gas supply is the Therm that's not used. I just don't want the regulatory system to penalize them for conservation. I appreciate his comments, I appreciate his acceptance, and I look forward to more conversation about ways that we can help move this along.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you, Madam Speaker. 
   In a couple of hours, the House of Representatives will be dealing on the suspension calendar with House Resolution 936, a commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the Gallatin plan. This historic effort was a plan commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson, led by his Secretary of the Treasury, Albert Gallatin, to design a system to knit together a ragtag group of 13 colonies into a transcontinental nation. It focused on transportation, on waterways, it planted the seeds for what would ultimately become the transcontinental railroad, and actually unleashed a pattern that carried through to the national park system, the hydro system and, indeed, the national interstate highway system signed into law by President Eisenhower. 
   Today's commemoration comes at a critical time, for just as Albert Gallatin did something important for the founding of our Nation, today America's infrastructure is falling apart. The American Society of Civil Engineers rates our infrastructure at a D-minus. It's one of the reasons our economy is in decline. We're losing the competition to Europe, to Asia. China is investing nine times as much of their national output as we are in infrastructure. And at a time of $110 a barrel oil, will $4 a gallon gasoline be far behind? 
   We live in a carbon-constrained, water-stressed environment with an imperative need to rebuild and renew America. It is time to celebrate this historic vision which helped build America for much of the first two centuries of our existence. It is critical that we remain true to that tradition, but today infrastructure means more than just roads, bridges, waterways and canals. We're talking about railroads, aviation, power transmission lines, pipelines, indeed the green infrastructure, the network of environmental, park and open space that means so much to the protection of the environment and clean air. 
   It is time for us to craft a new plan, a vision for this century, one that takes into account global warming, rising energy prices, the change in demographics and the knowledge that we know today about how to put the pieces together. Renewing and rebuilding America ought to be something that people on both sides of the aisle can agree with, that we can unite behind a vast coalition that includes the Garden Club, the Sierra Club, organized labor and business, the professions, local government and environmental activists to make sure that we're putting the pieces together appropriately today, that we have the resources, the vision, the partnership that will make livable communities for all of our families, where they will all be safer, healthier and more economically secure. 
   I look forward to the debate today on the Gallatin plan and the commitment of an infrastructure vision for this century.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy, and I appreciate the leadership from my friend from Oregon on this legislation; likewise, my friend and colleague from Tennessee, with whom I'd served on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee so many years. They have adequately, I think, framed what we have here. This is not merely the commemoration of some obscure historical event. As was mentioned by the Speaker, this is the framework upon which America was built for over 200 years; the vision of President Jefferson and Albert Gallatin, the work of President Roosevelt, having a framework for taking a ragtag group of 13 colonies and making it into a transcontinental powerhouse. This farsighted leadership and Federal action helped make America what it is today. 
   But right now, on Capitol Hill today, there are literally thousands of people who are here urging that we deal with the infrastructure crisis in this country, people dealing with mass transit, firefighters, engineers. There are thousands of people who are concerned, right now, that it is time for us to take this resolution as a clarion call for a wake up. 
   The American Society of Civil Engineers has rated our infrastructure at D minus. We are being outcompeted internationally by the European Union and the Chinese. 
   This is history that is worth reviewing; how we built the partnerships that created the infrastructure, how we were able to tie communities together, to be able to enhance new technologies. When it was time for the transcontinental railroad, the framework was in place. 
   It is time for us to have a clear-eyed assessment of what the infrastructure needs are of today. My colleague, Mr. DeFazio, talked a little bit about this in his statement because, frankly, we've got the evidence at hand of what  the condition is. We know that there is time for us to move forward with a new plan for this century. It is time to build the constituency and the public awareness going from the Sierra Club to the Garden Club, the AFL-CIO to the Chamber of Commerce, the bicyclists and the truckers. 
   In 314 days, we start a new era here on Capitol Hill. There are people out and about who are starting work on this, the America 2050 program, a nonpartisan assessment under the leadership of the RPA, headquartered in New York, to other assemblage of professional and academic and business. 
   I hope this resolution helps focus the attention of people on this Chamber for what we all need to do to help our colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to move forward with an assessment of our needs now, a plan for this century, so that all of our communities can be more livable and our families safer, healthier, and more economically secure.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy in recognizing me and in working with us. 
   For over 60 years, Oregonians have provided a benefit to our returning veterans of home loans that were below market rate to be able to help them reestablish themselves in the community and as a small gesture of our appreciation for their sacrifice. Unfortunately, with the recent flood of returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan, we found that that program has been stretched to the limit and we were faced with denying them access. 
   Working with Mr. Neal, Chairman Rangel, the committee and subcommittee, we were able to make an important adjustment, a 400 percent increase in the loan cap, so that we will be able to fully meet the needs of returning Oregon veterans, and along the way it will help people in Alaska, Wisconsin, Texas, and California. In this time of uncertainty in the housing market, giving these important loans to our veterans is an important gesture. I appreciate the work that the committee has done to make this a reality.

   I have watched in the Northwest the development of wood utilization research to deal with plywood and particle wood that are formaldehyde-free. It enables us to be able to provide a superior environmental product, adds greater value, protects the public and competes against foreign products where they are cutting corners. It wouldn't be possible without this type of partnership, from an environmental perspective, from an economic perspective, from a research perspective.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, every American has a very personal stake in today's discussion because everyone knows people who would benefit from breakthrough research using stem cells. Indeed, with 100 million Americans at risk from a variety of diseases, ranging from Lou Gehrig's disease to Parkinson's, it is almost impossible not to know somebody impacted. The most profound beneficiaries are our family and friends who have not yet shown any symptoms, but may fall victim to one of these devastating diseases. 
   The stakes in this debate are both high for potential benefit to the physical condition of all human kind, as well as the establishment of appropriate boundaries between public policy and personal theology. The President failed the latter test when he exercised the only veto in his entire career. 
   In the last election, the American voter made it clear their families deserve an opportunity for embryonic stem cell research to be conducted in a reasonable, controlled manner, to hasten the day of vital life-saving, life-enriching therapy for all.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, if there's been any good news on the Middle East peace process over the last 7 years, it's that barriers to ending the conflict are less about final-status issues and more about the challenge of reaching the outcome that majorities on both sides know will be necessary: an independent Palestinian state, based on the 1967 borders, living side by side with Israel in peace, with a shared Jerusalem and a negotiated solution to the Palestinian refugee problem. Against that backdrop, it is unclear to me what good comes from passing a resolution which would place Congress out of step with large parts of the Israeli political spectrum. 
   This resolution is disconnected from the reality on the ground. At a time of rocket attacks in Sderot, retaliations in Gaza, and renewed fears of war between Israel and Syria, it is, at a minimum, inappropriate for either the United States Congress or the Bush administration to stand in the way of whatever moves for peace Israel may choose to make, yet that is exactly what this resolution does. We should be more engaged at promoting a return to a peace process, not less, and we should be encouraging compromise, not intransigence on the difficult issues. 
   Jerusalem is Israel's capital and a city of unmatched significance for the Jewish people. I will never forget my first morning in Israel and what it was like to go on a run around the Old City. However, I must oppose a resolution that reaffirms the need to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem prior to a peace agreement because, as both Presidents Clinton and Bush have recognized, this harms our efforts at diplomacy and, therefore, the security of Israel and the United States. Instead, we should keep faith with the Biblical injunction to ``pray for the peace of Jerusalem,'' reject this senseless resolution, and recommit our support for serious efforts at peace in the Middle East and security for Israel.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (FEDERAL GAS TAX HOLIDAY A BAD IDEA -- (House of Representatives - April 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   During this election season, we've seen some pretty painful moments. It has been embarrassing, for instance, to watch the flip-flopping of Senator McCain on tax cuts that he is now for before he was against them. But there is no idea that is as bad as his most recent suggestion that we just have a gas tax holiday, to suspend the 18.4 cent per gallon Federal gas tax from Memorial Day through Labor Day. 
   This is a really unfortunate suggestion. It's unfortunate to me that Senator Clinton appears to be embracing it. I would hope that Senator Clinton's staff will help her remember her own words when this proposal was launched by one of her opponents in 2000 when she was running for the United States Senate, where Senator Clinton pointed out that it would be a ``bad deal for New York and a potential bonanza for the oil companies,'' which is why she opposed it back then. Her words were true in 2000 and they are true today. In fact, it's even more important. 
   First of all, there is absolutely no evidence that States that have suspended the gas tax have ended up putting any more money in the pockets of consumers. The research suggests that it's more likely that they have simply increased the amount of money that goes to the oil companies who are not reducing their prices to compensate for the reduction. At a time when ExxonMobil's profits set a new record of $40.6 billion, we don't have to give them even more money at the expense of our infrastructure, because this proposal comes at a time when for the first time in history the highway trust fund is going into deficit. And this proposal would add more than $10 billion to that deficit, money that will not go to State and local governments to deal with badly needed transportation infrastructure. It comes at a time when we recognize that our infrastructure is falling apart. The Society of Civil Engineers has graded it D-minus, and they're grading on a curve. 
   It would be far more logical and effective to help poor citizens and people in rural districts that have to drive a great deal directly as a part of the economic stimulus, or a rebate that actually gets into their hands, not to the oil companies. It would make more sense to invest in renewable futures and green jobs, like not allowing the production tax credit to expire at the end of the year, costing thousands of jobs in the wind energy business. 
   It makes sense to rebuild and renew America with a vision for the future, attaching a budget priority, and be honest with the American public, not cheap political tricks that may sound good for a moment but will end up hurting us in the long run.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, over the past few months, we've had a lot of back and forth on this issue. For those who have been at the table, I want to express my appreciation for your hard work and the quality of your debate. I am proud of the fortitude displayed by the Speaker and the Intelligence Committee during this process: There will be no blanket immunity for telecom companies, there will be a two-year sunset, and there will be a commission to thoroughly investigate this administration's shameful wiretapping program. 
    For the past seven years I have been highly critical of Republican wiretapping legislation. I have voted against past efforts to expand the ability of this administration to intrude in the lives and privacy of innocent citizens. Most recently, I supported the expiration of the Protect America Act because I am confident that the dedicated members of the intelligence community do not need to violate the rights of Americans in order to protect them. 
    The bill before us will not solve every potential abuse of FISA, but it does provide stronger legal protections for Americans and introduces a measure of oversight. As this issue continues to play out into the future, it is my hope that our next steps will include even stronger protections for innocent Americans, clearer legal standards for FISA to judge surveillance procedures, and explicit requirements for the destruction of unnecessary data.

Mr. Speaker, this week we commended on the floor of the House the 200th anniversary of the Gallatin Plan that guided the infrastructure for this country for the first century of our existence. It's timely because we are today losing that battle. We have an infrastructure crisis. The Society of Civil Engineers gives us a D minus for condition of transportation and water facilities and we are fast running out of money to fix it. 
    Now is the time for an infrastructure plan for this century. Yes, we do need adequate resources; but more than money, we need a new vision for all our infrastructure needs: roads, rail, air, energy transmission. Most important, we need to squeeze out more value. We need to find a way to do this critical work better. Congress and Federal agencies can help by changing how they do business.

   Mr. Speaker, the same framework that our friends have been complaining about on the other side of the aisle is a State block grant program has been retained. It's successful, but underfunded. 
   Their complaints of enhanced programs ring hollow when you examine them. I heard my friend the distinguished minority whip come to the floor and talking about his opposition to higher income levels, and I find some irony in that because his State is one of them, Missouri where there was a request by his son, the Republican Governor, for a waiver from the Republican Bush administration which has been granted that allows a level 3 times higher than the poverty level. 
   They don't feel comfortable with the requests that are coming from the State level for the innovation. However, that's what it was about in the first place. 
   This program is not about putting Medicare Advantage at risk. It's being adjusted. This bill helps with reform. I am pleased that 157 counties in 27 States are being rewarded with an efficiency bonus. My State's medical system is strengthened by helping kids.

   Well, first of all, Madam Speaker, it ought to be clear that there are some States where there have been eligibility limits that have been increased. But why? Because Governors, including many of them Republican Governors, have requested waivers. Who gives the waivers? They have been granted by the Bush administration. If you think it is wrong to expand health care for more children, for some with slightly higher income levels, then stop granting the waivers. 
   This isn't a problem that somehow Democrats are leaping into socialized medicine. This is an effort at the State and local level to meet these critical problems. That is why the legislation today is going to pass with overwhelmingly partisan support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy in permitting me to speak on this measure, because I strongly support the rule and look forward to the enactment of the Conference Committee Report. It represents hard work and has been acknowledged by my former colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, whom I miss a great deal. 
   Like many Members, I have some projects in here that I, too, am pleased to see move forward, particularly some environmental restoration in the State of Oregon that is going to smooth fish passages. 
   I must say that, in terms of the thing that excites me most about the bill, though, is the movement towards the reform of our Water Resources policies. I have long talked about this on the floor. I have attempted, as a member of the committee, to support them and continue to move this work forward. 
   As I look at the bill in its totality, there were some good things from the Senate, and some good things in the House version. I think the conferees worked to enhance the overall reform aspects of this legislation. 
   I am particularly pleased that we've been able to retain the update of the principles and guidelines which have not been changed since 1983. I think this is absolutely essential and look forward to the progress that the Corps can make in this area. 
   I appreciate the fact that the conferees worked to strengthen and refine language on independence review for large projects. Much of the time, at least some of the controversy that we have faced in the political arena would have been avoided if we would have had this independent review mechanism in place. But I think there is a lesson that we all must pay attention to, that once we have the independent review, it's very important that we listen to what the independent review concludes. 
   One project that I'm less than totally enthusiastic about, the Upper Mississippi Lock and Dam Project, had independent reviews from the GAO, from the National Academy of Sciences, from the Army's Inspector General that all were negative but somehow the project continues to move forward. 
   It is important that we are sensitive to this. I take modest exception to my good friend from Washington being concerned about the language here to make it easier for dam removal. We have 60,000 dams that relate to the Depression era, for instance. We found last year that there are a number of dams in the Northeast; we don't know who is responsible for their maintenance. It is important in many cases to be able to sensitively, environmentally decommission dams in order to protect the public safety. 
   As it relates to the Everglades, bear in mind we are spending billions of dollars undoing an earlier Corps of Engineers project. As it relates to the areas around New Orleans in Louisiana, there was a three-quarters of a billion dollar navigation project in an area where river traffic was static or declining at the very point of the levee failure. That money could have been better spent protecting New Orleans. In fact, the LSU Hurricane Research Center thinks that that navigation project actually may have amplified the surge and put more people at risk. At a time when we are dealing with global warming and climate change, the stakes are higher than ever. 
   This bill represents an important step forward. I hope that we're able to work with the committee in its implementation and its oversight so we can build on this foundation and be better off as we move forward.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you. I appreciate the gentleman from Washington's clarification. 
   My point was that this is important because there comes a time when many dams outlive their usefulness. They either have to be restored or removed. They can actually pose a danger to the public. I don't want us to be frozen in place, unable to respond in the best way. 
   There may come a time when people want to reassess big dams, small dams. What is in this committee report, however, is something I think is long overdue, to give the Corps flexibility in areas where there is little or no controversy; and I think it's important, that we need to be focusing more attention. 
   I will continue to work with the gentleman to make sure that we do the right thing in the Northwest and make sure that we don't have any unintended consequences, and I will work with him to make sure that this is not an unintended consequence.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, this year's Defense Authorization presented us with a great opportunity to bring the focus of the American military back in line with American values. Unfortunately, that opportunity was missed. This bill does little to correct the President's misplaced priorities of missile defense, indefinite detainment of prisoners, pre-emptive war, and weapons for wars we are not fighting today. 
   Last year the House passed the Military Commissions Act which attempted to add legitimacy to the improper actions of the Bush administration to ignore habeas corpus rights for prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. By not adhering to the strictest standards when putting suspected terrorists on trial, we run the risk of punishing innocent people who could simply have been in the wrong place at the wrong time. It is now widely known that hundreds of inmates at Guantanamo Bay may in fact have had nothing to do with terrorism. Sadly this bill does nothing to change the status quo of wrongdoing. 
   It perplexes me that while we are fighting an urban war against improvised explosive devices, snipers, and suicide bombers in Baghdad, we continue to spend precious resources on weapons that are unproven or designed for an obsolete Cold War. We had an opportunity today to push the Department of Defense to review these weapons and report back to Congress on their viability and value, but unfortunately the amendment failed. I also voted for an amendment to ensure that the power to declare war solely resided with Congress, as our forefathers intended, and not with the Executive Branch. This amendment also failed. This administration has repeatedly shown that it will make bad judgment and has repeatedly crossed the line of its constitutional powers. I am deeply concerned that the House is unprepared to rein in the President's stance of pre-emptive war with Iran and it is my hope that we will not regret this decision in the future. 
   Finally, I planned to offer an amendment that would have simply required the Department of Defense to create a database of incidents involving unexploded ordnance. I am disappointed that it was not made in order, and that we were not able to deal with that critical issue today. 
   With so little progress made in this year's authorization, I am forced to vote against this bill. I will continue to work for the changes that the American people and our men and women in the military deserve.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's permission to speak on this bill because I am pleased, as having joined with her as a member of the Budget Committee, to embrace a new direction in terms of the Democratic management of the budget. 
   I have been in this Chamber for the last 11 years and watched Republican performance fall short of what Republican promises were made. We have watched people who are preaching austerity fall short time after time after time, record deficits, coupled with tax benefits concentrated for those who need it the least and truly Draconian budget cuts. 
   We have watched, in a particular that I have specialized in in terms of the environment, the natural resource funding, the Function 300, has been cut 16 percent, and anybody who's been in our national parks has a chance to see the consequences. There have been lost conservation opportunities and Superfund cleanup has languished. 
   I am pleased that we have a budget framework that focuses on tax relief for those who need it the most, and there will be extended obviously those areas where there is broad bipartisan consensus dealing with the lowest income tax brackets, protection of family, marriage benefit, but the Democrats will be focusing on the tax tsunami that is bearing down on the American public, and that's the Alternative Minimum Tax which once was supposed to be limited to the wealthiest of Americans and now has morphed into a tax on middle America. 
   It's not the hedge fund managers that are going to be paying it, but every middle class two-income family with children is going to be threatened with this if we don't act, and that's what we have focused on. 
   Last but not least, we have rejected further Draconian budget cuts. They were offered up here on the floor, rejected, because people didn't want to further erode environmental protections, erode educational benefits, erode benefits for our veterans. 
   Instead, you have a budget that is on a path towards balance, tax relief for those who need it most, and being able to focus on critically neglected programs in the past. 
   Anybody who wants to look at the difference can look at what we have supported with what the Republicans have failed to deliver over the last 6 years when they controlled everything. 
   I appreciate the rule that's brought forward, look forward to its passage  and the passage of this ultimate legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the effort that has gone into this evening's debate. It has been lively and at times amusing. 
   I rise to offer an amendment to extend the effort that is intended here to extend home ownership to a greater number of families. 
   The problem that I seek to focus on is that by having a uniform threshold for the loan limits understates the purchasing power of people in often high-cost, low-impact areas, people who live, for example, in urban areas, in central cities, who spend far less on energy and transportation than the typical person but often is faced with much higher home costs and they get caught in a double whammy. They are actually better credit risks because they have more disposable income, but they are running up against loan limits that discriminate against them. 
   The average American family spent over $5,100 in gasoline, home heating, and electricity last year. Families routinely list transportation cost as their second largest household expenditure on average. Sometimes it is the greatest. 
   Research shows that when these families live locally near where they work, shop, and socialize close to public transportation, they actually have more disposable income. 
   My amendment would instruct Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to credit mortgage applications for the savings that a transportation-friendly location and energy-efficient home generate, making it easier for these homeowners to purchase these homes. By recognizing the added purchasing power home buyers generate from both transportation and energy savings, lenders can quantify these savings and place them in the ``shelter'' category of expenses. This would allow home buyers, based on his or her enhanced buying power, to either qualify for a mortgage or qualify for a larger mortgage. 
   This would have a particular benefit for lower income and first-time home buyers in locations that they tend to congregate that are more efficient. It will strengthen the communities that we wish to celebrate that are less impactful on the environment, requiring this energy. It would encourage families to reduce vehicle and energy use. This will translate into benefits for the larger community in terms of congestion, cleaner air, and reduced dependence on foreign oil. 
   Now, this is not an unknown concept. I know there are some that have some concerns about it. Fannie Mae has been a partner in pilot programs offering what are termed location and energy efficient mortgages in the past. It has been limited to just a few cities, but these programs have demonstrated that they make a difference on the lives of the families that have been able to benefit from them. 
   There was a pilot project in Illinois, in Chicago, for the first time, the first initiative, with the location, energy efficient mortgage, and it provided a $53,000 benefit for the people involved in terms of the home that they could qualify for. 
   I would respectfully suggest that this amendment would extend the effort that the committee has to promote affordable housing. It would eliminate the discrimination against people in these energy and transportation efficient areas, and it would provide more justice to people in terms of what we are trying to provide in this system.

   I look forward to working with your task force under the chairmanship of my friend from Colorado. I understand what the gentleman is saying, and I would be happy to withdraw my amendment at the appropriate time and work with the committee in that fashion. 
   Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oregon? 
   There was no objection.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite words. 
   Mr. Chairman, one listens to the ebb and flow of this debate, and you sort of lose track of what it is that we are about here this evening. 
   As Senator Moynihan said, that we're entitled to our own opinions, we're not entitled to our own facts. And perhaps if my friend from Texas had spent less time making up things to try and scare people back home in terms of political fantasy and spent some time dealing with the substance that we have here this evening, we would have less disagreement. 
   It was cited earlier that this proposal is an experiment in socialism. Well, one can look at the history of how the special status of these entities evolved from being government agencies to being in this special hybrid status of the government-sponsored enterprises. The fact is that the Federal Government sets the ground rules. Congress sets the ground rules. 
   As my friend, the chairman of the committee, pointed out, that there are costs associated with everything we do. Goals for affordable housing entail some cost. The regulations entail some cost and consequence. Focusing in on the lowest income has some costs and consequences. This is all right. This is what we are about here this evening is to determine whether or not, as Congress exercises its oversight, its focus, that it is appropriate in nature and it is reasonable in its outcome. 
   Mr. Frank has pointed out that what we are talking about here, in terms of this fund, is a tiny fraction of the overall profits of multi trillion dollar holdings. He has also pointed out, and something that has not been refuted by our friends who are trying to kill it, is that there are other proposals that they are talking about which would bear far greater impact on the profitability of the enterprises. The question we should be asking is whether the goal is one that is appropriate. And it seems to me very strongly that what has been identified here is an appropriate goal. It is consistent with the  creation of these entities. It speaks to a crying need in community after community. 
   I would strongly urge that we vote down this and each of these proposals to gut this essential provision that would help us make substantial progress in providing affordable housing for those who need it most.

I am pleased that that is why we will pass this hate crime legislation today which follows progress in my State of Oregon just this week, where we have provided protection for domestic partnerships and antidiscrimination legislation. I hope it will herald changes on the Federal level in the military for gays and lesbians, and in the workplace with non-discrimination protection for all Americans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy in permitting me to speak on this. 
   I understand my colleague from Oregon being frustrated. This is an issue we have discussed over the last year, and I imagine his frustration has doubled because the committee that he was a member of in the last Congress, the bill did not find its way into law because of what happened in the prior Congress. I understand his going with my colleague, Mr. DeFazio, to the Rules Committee and flagging the issue because while it is not quite as critical in my direct district, it affects them and it affects my State. And not just Oregon, but there are people in rural America across the United States for whom this is serious. 
   I am sorry that the last Congress failed in its responsibility. I worked with him then. I will work with him now. 
   I respectfully disagree slightly in terms of the tactic, in terms of venting frustration at the Rules Committee or the Appropriations Committee. I take the Chair of the Appropriations Committee at his word that he is concerned. He will work with us. The Chair of the Rules Committee, Ms. Slaughter, is a cosponsor with us. And I look forward, as we move forward with this year's budget, to doing the best we can.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I appreciate Mr. Dicks' willingness to come forward, his interaction with my colleague even now, Mr. Walden. 
   This is important business. It failed last Congress. It is not going to be achieved this Congress unless we are able to do it in a bipartisan fashion, unless we are able to look seriously at dealing with the funding. Wedging it in here, with all due respect, is ill-advised. Having an across-the-board cut for everybody on something where I know Mr. Obey has been working very hard to clear the decks so we can get busy on this year's budget and that we can start looking at the overall fiscal situation. 
   I will continue my efforts to work with the gentleman, but I don't think we ought to confuse it today with the matter before us. I think it is appropriate to use as a vehicle to raise the issue. I think it was a point well made before the Rules Committee. I appreciate his coming to the floor here today to talk about unmet needs. There may be others that could talk about unmet needs. The issue before us is moving forward. 
   For me, I hope this is the last time this CR action happens. I appreciate the Appropriations Committee being willing to make some very tough decisions. This is not something that would have been ideal. I am sure Mr. Dicks, as a senior member of that committee, there are things that he would have done differently. I am sure Mr. Obey didn't want to be in this situation. But the fact is we are picking up from the abject failure of the Republican leadership last Congress, a breakdown in the process, a failure to pass the legislation, and now we must move forward. 
   I support this rule. I don't think we have to go back 20 years to find one exception. The fact is we have a plan to move forward. I appreciate the work that has been done. We don't have to bring up extraneous issues. I, too, like Mr. Obey, choked hearing about the reference to the rain forest, which wasn't something that is dealt with in this bill. You could go back over time and start undoing the work that Mr. Dreier or others disagree with when they were in the majority. I hope they come to the Appropriations Committee with proposals to rescind things that they did, but do it in the course of regular order in terms of the authorizing committee or coming forward with their own amendments in the course of what is going to happen this year. 
   To somehow pick on this rule, pick on this CR, trying to deal with the mess that the Appropriations Committee inherited, I think is out of line, uncalled for, and, frankly, hypocritical.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (NATIONAL CAPITAL SECURITY AND SAFETY ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, the Childers amendment to the National Capital Security and Safety Act is deeply flawed. We continue to treat the residents of the District of Columbia as members of a colony, hampering their ability to govern themselves. We ought not to have Congress be the State legislature or city council for 580,000 people. 
   For the tens of thousands of Oregonians who visit our Nation's capital each year, traveling with their children to experience America's history and culture, and as someone who lives in DC for 30 percent of the year and has worked with victims of gun violence, this legislation is neither comforting nor sound policy. The imposition on local government would throw out all locally approved gun safety measures, including handgun registration and the semiautomatic ban, and even go as far as removing all age restrictions on gun purchase, permitting a 6-year-old to purchase a deadly weapon. 
   It is best for Congress not to do the National Rifle Association's bidding, forcing DC to be their showcase for eliminating all boundaries of gun safety. I urge my colleagues to respect home rule and common sense.  
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Under the rule, the Committee rises. 
   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Pastor) having assumed the chair, Mr. Altmire, Acting Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 6842) to require the District of Columbia to revise its laws regarding the use and possession of firearms as necessary to comply with the requirements of the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of District of Columbia v. Heller, in a manner that protects the security interests of the Federal Government and the people who work in, reside in, or visit the District of Columbia and does not undermine the efforts of law enforcement, homeland security, and military officials to protect the Nation's Capital from crime and terrorism, pursuant to House Resolution 1434, he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted by the Committee of the Whole.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy, his leadership, that of the subcommittee Chair, and, of course, my friend and the lead sponsor of this legislation, the author, Mr. Price. I think there is no more conscientious and thoughtful legislator, and he has approached this in a very nonpartisan, methodical way. 
   Madam Chairman, I am concerned as I am listening here. I want to say, first of all, that I hope this is the first of a number of provisions that we have that deal with the netherworld of contracting and outsourcing this war. I think there are lots of opportunities to tighten down, to focus, to add accountability. But this is an important essential step. It is simple, and it should not be nearly as controversial as my friend from Virginia appears to make it. 
   First of all, I have heard him about 10 times talk about how somehow this is narrowing the scope of MEJA. Look at page 2 of the bill. It doesn't take anything away. It adds provisions. It adds provisions. 
   The notion somehow that we are not dealing with the problem in Germany I think misstates and betrays a lack of understanding about the difference between operations in a stable, established country and one that is in the theater of military operations. If somebody commits a crime in Germany, there will be an opportunity for that government to be able to deal meaningfully with it. That is not the case with a rogue contractor in Iraq, in a field of battle who shoots somebody and there is no established mechanism. It is absolutely apples and oranges. 
   I find curious an argument from our friends on the minority side that this cost a few million dollars to the FBI and there is no funding attached. This is the same party that for the last 11 years out of this committee, when they were in charge, had a litany of proposals that added costs to the judiciary and the FBI and the corrections system and never blinked an eye over burdening them. 
   This is a modest adjustment. It is within the scope of their duty. I strongly urge its approval.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman yielding me time. I do think the admonition is important to focus on the substance of this legislation. The Rules Committee, as she points out, wasn't given an alternative and there is nobody in this Chamber, I think, that has a better, more well-deserved reputation for being a thoughtful, bipartisan Member to try and solve problems than our colleague, the primary sponsor of this legislation, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price). I am privileged to be a cosponsor of the legislation with him. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is an opportunity for this Chamber to focus on an important area of accountability. We have in the newspapers, not just this week, we have had accounts going on not just for months, but from the outset of this war about the trend to outsource fundamental functions that heretofore have been the province of United States soldiers. It has had significant consequences. We are now finding, as a result of some of the hearings, that there have been repeated instances of violence. We are finding that there is no good remedy currently under the law. There is basically no clear line of authority to get back to be able to exercise the oversight and accountability of the security function that has been outsourced. 
   What Mr. Price has offered up is a small part of moving in the direction that we should have done from the outset. I would hope that we can get past the discussion on the rule. I plan on supporting it and look forward to a vigorous debate on the floor to open up this question of accountability for a war that is outsourced, for costs that are five times what an American soldier would do to provide exactly the same function. With the American soldier at one fifth the cost of a mercenary there is a clear line of authority. If something goes sideways, we know what is going to happen. 
   Mr. Price has offered up legislation that gets us started in that direction. It is a thoughtful, bipartisan, narrowly crafted effort. It is not the whole answer, but it moves us in the right direction. I would strongly urge that my colleagues support the rule, support the underlying bill, and get us moving into an important area of debate, accountability and responsibility. Our failure in this area is going to have serious consequences for years to come. We are already seeing this with the Iraqi Government. We are seeing it in terms of problems on the ground. We are seeing questions that are being asked, answers demanded by Americans and Iraqis alike. Working together on this bill is a first step towards remedying that situation.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, there is absolutely nothing cynical about the delay. My Republican friends need some time to get their facts straight. I really get tired about hearing these phony arguments. 
   We're going to be covering some adults. Why are we covering some adults? Because the Republican administration granted State waivers for some States to be able to deal with some experiments to add to them, and this legislation stops the ability to grant those waivers that the Bush administration enacted. 
   We're talking about it should be just poor children, and somehow I heard somebody talk about $200,000 levels. Hogwash. There was one State that requested a waiver, New York, that would have taken it up to $83,000. That was denied. There are a number of States, with the approval of the Bush administration, that have raised the levels. New Jersey at $63,000 still doesn't hit their median income. Only one out of 10 of these children are in family incomes of over $40,000. 
   You need 2 weeks to get your facts straight.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy. I appreciate his continued leadership and advocacy in this bill. 
   I would remind my good friend from Pennsylvania that earlier in this debate, Mr. Kind and I, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Flake, we advanced proposals that would have provided more than enough money to fully fund the conservation, would have provided more than enough money to deal for the areas of agriculture that are dramatically underserved. 
   This does a terrific job for the large corporate enterprises, for the richest of farmers. Lowering the limits to $900,000 may in the minds of some be a draconian reform. But when we know that the average farmer makes twice what the average homeowner makes, the average citizen makes, and I was actually campaigning in Pennsylvania for a campaign in the presidential effort here a couple weeks back, and I was in some very rural parts of Pennsylvania engaged in the discussion there, and I found that Pennsylvania is much like Oregon. We are short-changed dramatically in the farm bill. 
   Earlier we had my good friend from North Dakota, a State that produces less agricultural value than the State of Oregon and gets one-sixth the subsidy. Pennsylvania is a massive farming effort. Twenty-seven percent of the land area is devoted to farms. But Pennsylvania farmers get one-half of their share of the subsidy nationally, 62 percent of the applications for conservation are not paid for, and the average farmer in Pennsylvania, 83 percent make less than $100,000 a year. So these are small farmers. They are hard pressed. They want conservation, and they don't have the money for the application. It is just like in my State. 
   I would suggest that we look hard, because I agree with my friend from Pennsylvania and my friend from Oklahoma. This is not necessarily partisan. There are areas that agriculture policy divides, not necessarily partisan, but sometimes it is urban and rural. Sometimes it is east, west, south, midwest. It is more likely the type of agriculture that is practiced, because the vast majority of farmers in this country would have been well served by the reforms that we advocated from here, limiting the payments to $250,000, for instance, like have been advocated by the Bush administration and by many people here. 
   But we don't even have to get to that point. My friend Mr. Kind's motion to recommit should bring us together, because farmers all across the country, in States large and small, east and west, are for environmental protection. This is the most important environmental bill that the 110th Congress will address. We should not miss this golden opportunity. 
   It is frustrating to me that the conferees are talking about cutting what we approved at $5.7 to as low as $4 billion. And who knows what it might end up? There are lots of missing pieces. We need to go on record here strongly supporting maintaining at least a $5 billion level. 
   I will tell you, farmers in my State regularly identify conservation programs as their top need. They have to comply with all sorts of difficult environmental regulations, and we need to ensure that they get the payments they deserve for environmental protection that they provide. 
   It is the farm community, the ranchers, that are the source of the cheapest, most cost-effective water quality and water quantity improvement. This money supports programs that protect our most sensitive and ecologically important lands. It keeps pollution out of the lakes, rivers, streams and wetlands. It represents the largest Federal investment in private land, and it should be an investment that our farmers and ranchers can count upon year after year. 
   It is not just the clean water. It is maintaining abundant wildlife populations. It is storing carbon. Agriculture is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions, the largest internationally. With the increased pressure on lands from biofuel mandates and high food prices, these programs matter more now than ever before.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you. 
   Too often I have watched in the farm legislation that I have seen work through here that conservation ends up being the piggy bank for the farm bill. This is an area that is shortchanged to deal with more powerful political interests. 
   Well, if the American public knew what was at stake, there would be no more powerful interest than protecting the environment. Two-thirds of the farmers who apply are turned down. This is not right. Increased conservation programs help balance out some of the inequities in the farm program and provide benefits to everybody. 
   I urge you to support family farmers, the environment and sportsmen, and support a good farm bill by supporting Mr. Kind's motion to instruct.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy in permitting me to speak on the bill and commend her leadership. 
   I had the privilege, for 10 years, of serving on this subcommittee. I miss the work that is being done. But I am pleased that in the first days of this Congress we are moving forward with important bipartisan legislation that can make a huge difference for communities around the country. 
   The city that I call home, Portland, Oregon, is one of over 1,100 communities around the country with a combined sewer overflow problem. The EPA estimates that there is something like 40,000 discharges of raw sewage that occur each year from sanitary sewer systems with a volume into the billions of gallons each year. In my community, this represents an investment well of over $1 billion to try and deal with the problems of an antiquated system, much of which was built before 1960; and, compared to what is happening in other parts of the country, that is a modern system. 
   This is a situation where we, as a country, have long overlooked making the type of systematic investments that are important. I appreciated my colleague, Mr. Duncan from Tennessee, who talked about the potential for a $400 billion shortfall. Well, it is really not clear exactly whether it is $400 billion, $500 billion, you pick a number, being able to meet the needs of America's communities that are being stressed, not just by aging systems but by growth and development. Sprawl across the country is putting more and more strain on these inadequate systems at a time when we are finding out more and more of what needs to be done to protect the public health and infrastructure. 
   Mr. Chairman, around the world, at any given time half the people are sick needlessly from waterborne disease. In this country, we have had a better record. But we have had problems here, and we are on the edge in many places around the country. I can't say enough about my appreciation for moving forward with this in an expeditious manner. 
   Unfortunately, other areas of the Federal Government haven't quite caught up to the leadership of the subcommittee bringing this forward. I am sad to note that the administration continues its trend of downplaying this problem with its 2008 budget and its stated opposition to this bill. I am confident that there will be such an overwhelming show of support for it that we will be able to convince others that it is a good investment. 
   Solving America's water quality issues requires a partnership. Already, State and local jurisdictions are being stressed. We are finding the private sector stepping up and making higher and higher investments. The average rate payer is facing exponential increases. 
   In my community, in the course of 10 years we are going to double the sewer rates. I met with a group of professionals this last week that said that, at the current rate of expenditure, we could actually have the entire country's GDP devoured by local utility cost for sewer and water. That is not going to happen because of the leadership that we see here now. 
   I look forward to a strong bipartisan vote in support of it, and I hope that my colleagues will take the time to visit with the hundreds of consulting engineers and local government officials who are on the Hill today to tell them that we have taken a step forward, and we look forward to working with them to finish the job.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, thank you for the work that you and Chairman Dingell have done in bringing forth to the House for a vote today an opportunity for a comprehensive energy policy. 
   For too long, we've focused on energy for the past, on energy sources and products for the world as it was or as some wanted it to be. This is an opportunity for us to deal with the energy challenges of today and for the future. 
   The bill that comes forward will be, for the first time since 1975, an opportunity to significantly increase vehicle fuel mileage standards. It will contain a renewable portfolio standard that emulates what has happened in over half our States across the country, to be able to jump-start renewable energy. It will be financed by redirecting tax breaks from the largest oil companies who don't need taxpayer support to produce oil profitably, and it will be directed to the energy sources of the future, renewables, which do need this help to bring their opportunities to scale. 
   I hope my colleagues will arise to meet this challenge. Vote to pass this legislation. Our national security, economic stability, and environmental survival depends upon it.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, it's interesting our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are trying desperately to change the subject. There could be a FISA extension in a heartbeat. They turned that down. If they cared truly about national security, they would be embarrassed about the bankrupt energy policy that puts our Nation at risk. We wouldn't have a third of a million American soldiers and civilian contractors in Iraq today spending 1 trillion American tax dollars if Iraq didn't have the second largest oil reserves and that we have an energy policy that doesn't meet the needs of America today, much less for the future. 
   The bill that we have before you that this rule enables us to consider will be passed. It will be passed through the House today. It will pass the Senate, it is only a question of when. It may take an election for the American people to be clear that they're tired of investing in energy policies from the past, for the past. 
   This isn't a tax increase. Our bill has exactly the same amount of money  coming in as going out. But instead of subsidizing the purchase of the largest gas guzzling SUVs, we are going to subsidize hybrid plug-ins. Instead of giving $14 billion of unneeded subsidies to the five largest oil companies who made over half a trillion dollars in profit, we are going to help avoid the starving of the wind energy business.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy, and I appreciate his leadership in guiding the committee to deal with issues of affordable housing, the crisis that plagues our country dealing with the mortgage crisis. 
   If we are serious about providing affordable housing for families, then we need to be serious about building that housing in a sustainable fashion. Energy costs are increasing much faster than family incomes. Green homes are often 30 percent more energy efficient; that can cut utility costs by hundreds of dollars a year from the outset and an amount that is going to compound over time. We need to do well by our environment but we also need to save families' hard-earned money.  
   There is also strong evidence that green homes are also healthier homes. More than 4 million American children have asthma, and it is estimated that had more than 40 percent of diagnosed asthma is due to residential exposure. Green homes use building practices and materials that minimize moisture, that provide proper ventilation, that prevent infestation and avoid toxic materials. 
   I had the opportunity last night in Portland, OR, to be part of a celebration for our Oregon's architectural foundation, and these folks are zeroing in on practices that make a difference and add value. Many of the advantages of ``going green'' are based on people just having the fundamental information. There is a great deal of misinformation. 
   This amendment would provide a ``green housing clearinghouse'' that will provide fundamental information for people who are involved with the industry. It requires grantees to self-certify how many of the total units they build with the grants were green. This will help keep the grantees accountable. It gives HUD important information on how many affordable housing units are, in fact, green. And I think it's going to be an important step, low cost, high impact, that is going to promote the housing in this arena to be of the highest quality and most sustainable practices. 
   I strongly urge adoption of the amendment.

It's important for them to get the facts right, important for them to listen to their constituents and actually read the bill, not just accept the President's talking points. 
   It's ironic that one of his arguments is concern about adults who are covered by SCHIP. Yet the States have been encouraged to experiment to help uninsured working families, and the White House, George Bush, has approved those waivers that allowed them that coverage. 
   The bill he vetoed was actually more restrictive than current law. It would end coverage for adults after a transition period. It would prohibit the Bush administration, or any administration, from approving more waivers for new States, and parents already enrolled with Bush approval would get reduced matching funds. 
   It's time to stop making phony arguments; to listen to the Governors and the overwhelming majority of our constituents and override this cruel veto of health care for our children.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy. 
   Make no mistake, we're talking about uncollected taxes that are uncollected because of a systematic effort by this Republican administration and a Republican Congress to undermine the ability of the IRS to do its job, cranking up the audits on the poorest of citizens while stopping the IRS from oversight of those who are more wealthy. 
   As my good friend from North Dakota pointed out, we're talking about a 6 percent rate of return, when the independent officer, who has been set up within the IRS to give the independent judgment, has pointed out that this same $71 million would collect over 1.4 billion uncollected tax dollars. Independent observers know that investing in the IRS and its employees rather than unaccountable private contractors will get more money and will do so in a more humane fashion. 
   It was shocking for the committee to listen to some of the phone calls, to the abuse that has been subjected to American taxpayers who are caught in the ``Alice in Wonderland'' of these private collectors. 
   I would urge my colleagues, if they have any doubt, to try an experiment. I have done this at home. I have met with CPAs, tax attorneys and with financial advisers. All of them suggest investing more in the IRS infrastructure to improve customer service, and it will collect more money. 
   I would strongly suggest that it is time to stop this dark chapter of emasculating the IRS, giving money to private contractors, and instead, do a better job for the taxpayer. 
   I for one support the notion of the 1-year suspension of the 3 percent contractor withholding. I think it makes sense to try and sort this out. I think it needs more examination. I think we can have a better proposal. This got slipped in in the Senate without any House consideration in the last Congress. I think a delay makes sense. I support it. I support the underlying bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy in permitting me to speak. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and the underlying bill. 
   This is a critical piece of legislation that speaks to the quality of life of our men and women in uniform. One of the consequences of having the most effective, powerful military force in the world is that we have a great deal of activity that takes place training and operating military facilities across the country. And, sadly, Mr. Speaker, one of the areas that we have not been quite as good as we should is dealing with the consequences of those military operations. The American landscape are littered with the residue of past military operations, base operations, and training exercises. There are bombs, explosives, military toxins and environmental hazards in every State of the union, over 3,000 sites across America. 
   One of the things I have worked on since I came to Congress was to have the Department of Defense and, most important, we in Congress do a better job of helping the military clean up after itself. I have come to this floor repeatedly with examples where bombs have turned up in people's backyards. I see the former chairman of the committee from California on the floor and am reminded of the three young children in San Diego who discovered bombs in a subdivision, and two of them were killed. Over 60 more people have been killed according to my research here in the United States. 
   It is time for us to take responsibility to clean up that explosive and toxic legacy, in part because it's not going to get any cheaper. Over the years it's going to cost more and more. Failure to do this right puts innocent children's lives at risk. Remember when we came to the floor with a coloring book that told children what they should do when they found unexploded ordinances near their schools. The Pentagon had Larry the Lizard trying to tell them what to do, when they found a shell ..... rather than spending money to clean it up and remove that hazard. 
   I am pleased that this year we are fully funding the--the 2005 BRAC account. I am pleased with the leadership from Chairman Edwards, Ranking Member Wamp and my good friend Mr. Farr from California, who has been struggling with this issue for years in his district, they were able to put an  additional $80 million to clean up the legacy of BRAC sites. 
   I appreciate that this is a difficult budget year but it's always a difficult budget year, and we never seem to quite have enough to deal with the environmental problems that face our Department of Defense. I hope that this is a start in the right direction for a renewed commitment to clean up this toxic legacy that risks American lives here in this country and will develop new technology that will actually save American lives overseas in places like Iraq and Afghanistan if we do it right. I hope it makes possible more progress in the future, and I urge support.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlelady's courtesy in permitting me to speak in favor of this rule and the underlying bill. 
   It's exciting to see this landmark reauthorization come forward, and particularly given the range of advantages that are going to be given to young people around the country strengthening communities and opportunities for higher education. 
   Mr. Speaker, one of the major challenges we face at this point deals literally with the future of the planet dealing with global warming and sustainable development in a water-stressed, energy-short, carbon-constrained world. I have been pleased to look in my community at colleges and universities that are doing pioneering work with developments on campus for sustainability, training students, and doing research. 
   I am pleased that this legislation incorporates our Higher Education Sustainability Act of 2007, H.R. 3637, which provides provisions here that will help fund this research and training, sustainability practices on campus, to be able to make sure that the best practices that are being developed across the country can be incorporated into the day-to-day operations, that we can do more research, more training of students, and that we will be able to incorporate them into how campus life itself operates. 
   Last but not least, I am pleased that the provision that would direct the secretary of education to convene a sustainability summit to have a national showcase of these best practices has been retained. This is an important element to make sure that our colleges and universities continue to be the change, the engine of innovation for the most vital challenge of our time dealing with global warming and sustainable development. 
   I strongly urge support of this legislation and that each and every one of my colleagues look at these sustainability provisions and look at how they can be applied to their colleges and universities back home.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy in permitting me to speak on this measure and for the hard work that the chairman and the ranking member have done. This is truly a landmark reauthorization. We're all pleased to see it come forward. 
   The major challenge of this century is literally the future of the planet, global warming, sustainable development in a water-stressed, energy short, carbon-constrained world. 
   To help us cope, this higher education reauthorization incorporates the provision of our Higher Education Sustainability Act. Inspired by the late Debbie Murdock from Portland State University, it will fund programs in our colleges and universities for research, for training of students, for sustainability practices on campus. 
   It also does direct the Secretary of Education to convene a sustainability summit to be able to showcase all these best practices. 
   One of the things that I am pleased about as I travel around the country, is looking at the environmental progress on our campuses. This legislation will help accelerate that vital process, and I deeply appreciate what the committee has done.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I understand after what the gentleman just said that he would like to stop debate and move on because, with all due respect, that's turning it on its head. 
   He's right. When they were in charge, they did offer up a fix that President Clinton mercifully vetoed because if it had been in place in 1999, their proposal would have required almost $800 billion more in deficit spending. But when they were entirely in charge for the last 6 years, they ignored this all together. In fact, they have used every dime that was projected by CBO to fuel their massive spending increases. 
   Go back and look at the record. Your record for increased spending has been far above the rate of inflation, far above the Clinton administration. It embarrassed your fiscal conservatives. Even Mr. Ryan on the Budget Committee kind of gets embarrassed about your performance for the last 6 years. 
   That's why you have increased in the Bush----

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the admonition. 
   That's why we've had a $3.4 billion increase in the national debt in the first six years of the Bush administration as opposed to a surplus, budget surplus from the Clinton administration, which I think the majority leader will be talking about. 
   This is not a tax increase. The Federal Government will collect exactly the same taxation over the next 10 years under our proposal as under the Bush budget proposal right now. The difference is they're spending 23 million taxpayers' alternative minimum tax for the next 10 years. That's how they deal with the budget. We stop that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, for years I have spoken out and voted against wasteful Defense spending that often serves to make us less safe and takes money from more useful programs. I am concerned that there is still too much money in this legislation for unnecessary weapons systems and other outdated holdovers from the cold war and too little to deal with the challenges of today. However, I am pleased that this bill takes some steps in the direction of reform, and I hope that it provides a platform for further progress. 
   I support this bill because it includes provisions from the ``Responsibility to Iraqi Refugees Act,'' which I introduced in May and which were added in the Senate as an amendment by Senator KENNEDY. This bill will provide 5,000 special immigrant visas for each of the next 5 years to Iraqis at risk because they helped the United States, require the Secretary of State to establish refugee processing in Iraq and other countries in the region, and direct the Secretary of State to designate a special coordinator at the Embassy in Baghdad. 
   We need a wholesale change in attitude that puts the needs of Iraqis at the forefront of our Iraq policy, rather than using them as pawns in political games. It is ironic, to be generous, to hear President Bush repeatedly talk about the humanitarian crisis and massive out-flows that would follow what he called a ``precipitous'' withdrawal. This only illustrates the state of denial over the humanitarian crisis currently happening. 
   This is one area where our moral responsibility to these unfortunate people can be used to bring together those of disparate viewpoints in a cooperative effort that might serve as a template for how we solve greater problems associated with the war. One of the burdens of those who would be world leaders and the responsibility of those who make war is to deal with the consequences of their decisions. Innocent victims of war and civil strife are too often the invisible and forgotten casualties.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, I listen to my friend from Washington repeating the same lame line from the talking points of my Republican friends. 
   They knew this was coming. Yes, President Clinton vetoed a flawed tax measure back in the previous administration. What have they been doing for the last 6 years when they controlled everything? 
   They decided not to deal with the alternative minimum tax. They made a cynical decision to cut taxes for those who are the most fortunate in this country and be able to use this money in the budget calculations to be able to justify these massive tax reductions. They spent this money and they count on spending this money for years to come. It is in President Bush's budget.  
   We reject that cynical effort. We implored them time and time again when they were having their tax reductions to deal with the alternative minimum tax, this fiscal tsunami that is going to sweep away middle and upper middle-income Americans. They refused. They bet on the other side. 
   Now we are coming forward not with a tax increase but with a tax adjustment. The Federal Government will get the same amount of money; it is who are you going to benefit. We are going to save 23 million Americans from paying the alternative minimum tax, making some reasonable tax adjustments and not putting the cost of this patch on the credit card of our children.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of the 2009 Budget Resolution. This legislation strongly reflects the values of Oregonians and Americans across our country and I urge my colleagues to pass the bill. 
   Today I am especially proud to be a member of the Budget Committee. It is worth noting that this is the first budget passed in an election year since 1998. The new Democratic majority has shown that they are committed to passing a budget despite an uncooperative  President. Today's budget agreement is a balanced budget with balanced priorities. We have rejected the President's misguided cuts to programs that serve as a safety net for our most vulnerable citizens; cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, and the Community Development Block Grants. 
   This budget also recognizes that we must strengthen our middle class, a group that has suffered tremendously over the last 7 years. The budget provides fiscally responsible, deficit-neutral middle income tax relief; including keeping 20 million middle-income households from being hit by the Alternative Minimum Tax. It also extends the child tax credit, marriage penalty relief, and the 10 percent individual income tax bracket. 
   However, tax relief will do little without reinvestment in the priorities which strengthen our Nation and its citizens. Building our Nation must include a strong commitment to physical infrastructure, human capital, and innovation to keep us competitive globally. This budget does all these things. Recognizing that our current crumbling infrastructure is both structurally unsafe and hindering growth of our economy, the 2009 Budget includes an Infrastructure Reinvestment Reserve Fund to accommodate legislation that would provide robust Federal investment in projects such as rail, bridges, transit, ports, and more. The budget invests in our human capital both by creating a Higher Education Reserve Fund to make college more affordable for families, and by including funding for investment in renewable and energy efficient technologies to train workers in rapidly expanding ``green collar'' jobs. These investments, along with increased funding for the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health keep our Nation on the cutting edge and maintain our position as a global leader. 
   Today's budget reflects America's priorities in a fiscally responsible way and brings our budget back into balance by 2012, while abiding by pay-as-you go rules. I strongly urge my colleagues to join me today in supporting and passing the 2009 Budget Conference Agreement.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy. 
   I find no small amount of irony listening to our friends from the other side of the aisle talk about complexity on Tax Day because for the 12 years that they were in charge there was an explosion, hundreds of thousands of additional words added to the IRS code; loopholes and complexity, not simplification. 
   It is absolute hogwash that there are areas that the IRS won't go after to collect and we have to use private collection agencies. They are the people who decided to underfund the IRS. Testimony before our committee was conclusive: The IRS-trained employees collect eight times as much per person as these bounty hunters that they contract out. With the minimum of a $70 million investment, we will raise over $1.4 billion. 
   Equally specious is the argument here that we're hearing about HSAs. There are millions of Americans who have benefits, as my good friend from North Dakota pointed out, flexible savings accounts. We have them for our Federal employees. And all they have to do, however, is there is some minimal verification. What they're proposing is that we just ignore it and allow people to use it for car washes and country club memberships and rely on an occasional audit, which is much more difficult because they have cut back on the IRS. That's foolish. It works for millions of Americans with flexible benefit accounts, there's no problem doing it with HSAs. 
   It is time for us to move forward with these simple, commonsense efforts, steps that make the IRS more effective. More money for the taxpayers prevents inappropriate use of tax exempt money.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, by calling for a withdrawal date from Iraq, today the House is making a compromise that marks another stage in the unfortunate struggle with the President to end the war. Yet despite our hard work and the desire of the American people, this bill faces a veto from a President who is out of touch both with what the American people and the Iraqi people want: winding down the presence of American troops who are stuck in the midst of a civil war. 
   This is not the precise legislation I would have written, but it is a fair compromise that reflects the mindset of Americans who voted for a new direction in Iraq. The U.S. spends $8 billion a month on the war, and Oregon has already lost 54 brave men and women in Iraq. I have opposed the war from the start, and this bill hastens the day when we bring the tragedy of the Iraq War to a close. I urge support for it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you, Congressman Inslee. It's a pleasure to join with my colleagues from Illinois and Kansas for this conversation this evening. 
   This is serious business, and in a time when energy impacts are devastating our airline industry and when there is no part of the costs for the Air Force going up faster than fuel efficiency, I think we could spend the rest of the evening talking about the relative merits there and the advantage that this means in terms of operation and in terms of budget. 
   But I really wanted, if I could, just to circle back here for a moment because  I appreciate the focus that we're hearing from my colleagues about the merits of the issue. 
   Now, I come from a little sliver of the northwest. We're not the epicenter of that, but there's 1,000 high paying, family wage jobs just in my little district that are involved with this and is going to make a difference. But candidly, the way that the other proposal was structured, there would be a little residual benefit. It was sort of politically engineered, and there was a little bit, not nearly as much as the Boeing proposal, and Congress can and should consider that. It has huge impacts in some parts of the northwest, in the Midwest, and it has ripple effects throughout the economy. 
   And at the end of the day, this is something I think policy-makers have an obligation to be aware of and comment, and I appreciate my friend from Illinois talking about pending disputes with the WTO. There are serious allegations about unjustified subsidy for Airbus that really do need to be resolved, because we are in an anomalous situation where if we rush ahead with this and 
   grant the award, perhaps on a basis that wasn't justified, we could end up further undermining the position of American industry by somebody who's not playing by the rules and further undercut us, which is something that, going back to the drawing table, allowing that challenge to work its way out, I think has great merit. 
   But I appreciate what my colleague from Kansas was talking about in terms of the end of the day we're talking about a critical component of our defense establishment. And while there's lots of complaints, and some that I think are merited that we need to review our military approach to make sure that we're not spending too much money fighting the Cold War, clearly there is no argument, no argument that we can afford to not have a robust and effective exercise of our air power, and the air refueling is essential to warfare today, things that are going on today and are going to go on tomorrow. 
   And when we're looking at a strategic, critical component of our ability to supply our troops, that is already averaging almost half a century, and before anybody could move forward it will pass that critical 50-year mark, this raises I think to a critical level. 
   And I hope that every single Member of Congress in the House and the Senate takes the time to review this GAO report because I think it's going to raise serious questions in their mind, as it did with GAO. We want to make sure that that evaluation is done in the most cost-effective manner--big questions about whether the bid does that--and we want to make sure we are treating, given the troubled history of this project--and some of us, Congressman Inslee, we've been around a little bit. We've watched the bumpy ride to get to this point. This has got to be done letter perfect. We can't afford to have any questions or errors. And boy, any objective reasoning suggests that what we've heard, the way the Air Force handled it doesn't meet the bill.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate you zeroing in on this, Congressman Inslee, because you, as much as anybody in Congress, have been spending the time looking at the consequences of our current use of energy. I think the evidence is not only in terms of the percentage that you referenced, almost a quarter less over a 40-year period, the evidence would suggest that the trend line for energy costs are likely to be understated. 
   Who would have thought, frankly, 6 months ago that we'd be bumping up against $140 a barrel oil and with the likelihood that it could go to $200 before it gets down below $100?     
   So the costs are magnified over time. 
   And given the fact that these planes have actually stayed in service far beyond their design life, that that is further--what if these are going to be operational for another 50 years? I think that projection just pales; it makes it all the more important that we do that. 
   I appreciate your focus. And I appreciate having a chance to join you in this discussion.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, and I have enjoyed listening to the last hour from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle give their version of what we should do to deal with the energy problems that we face. 
   You know, I found it amusing what we didn't hear in the course of their discussion. They were able to talk for one solid hour, and there was no mention of conservation. The fact that the United States has less than 3 percent of the world's proven reserves of oil, that we consume almost 25 percent of it, that we waste more than any country in the world, that it has taken George Bush longer to get to 35-miles-per-gallon fuel efficiency than it took Jack Kennedy to get to the moon, not one word about something that was going to make a difference. 
   We didn't hear one word about how long it would take if they got everything they wanted, if they surrendered America's energy future in toto by giving all of the remaining oil and gas leases going to some of our most precious and sensitive areas that was highly speculative, and is in fact opposed by some Republican governors like Governor Schwarzenegger of California. If you just turned all of that over, they didn't talk about how long it would take to produce. And our friends at home can do a little bit of research from independent analysts, and they'll find that that's 7 to 10 years into the future. They didn't talk about how long that would take. 
   You didn't hear one word about popping the speculative bubble. If they had been attending the hearings that we have had here in Congress in the course of the last couple months, we would find that experts, including people from the oil industry, have testified that up to $50 of this increase in the price of a barrel of oil is due to speculation. And we haven't heard one word about what they would do to pop the speculative bubble, which much faster than anything you can talk about draining all our resources and turning available land over to the oil companies, this would make a difference immediately. 
   We haven't heard from them about all of the flip-flopping that's going on. You know, we heard this land is off-limits. George Bush I issued an executive order that declared areas off limits to drilling. George Bush II and the Republican Congress for the previous 6 years didn't do anything about this. But George Bush, by a stroke of the pen, could reverse what his father put in place. Yet our friends didn't have anything to say about that. 
   It's interesting watching the flip-flopping that's going on in the Republican party. JOHN MCCAIN was against drilling in these sensitive areas when he was a candidate for President in 2000. In fact, he's maintained a position against drilling in the sensitive offshore areas until a few days ago when he's decided to change. Of course, he does not agree with my friends on the other side of the aisle that we should go into the Arctic Wildlife Refuge. Maybe he understands that that's the last place we should drill instead of the next. 
   We're finding that it is fascinating watching the jujitsu here where people are flipping around changing positions and there is no consistency, there is no honesty in terms of how long it would take, there is no effort to deal with some of the things that are actually running up the prices. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Democrats in Congress have been passing initiatives since we regained control to improve fuel efficiency that was approved over the objection of the Republicans and over the objection of George Bush and was delayed. We have had initiatives to improve efficiency to give people more tools, to shift from lavish subsidies to the most profitable corporations in the history of the planet, the oil companies that really don't need extra subsidies, and give it to alternative sources of energy like wind and solar that do need it now. 
   We are very concerned that we use the resources that are available now. It is absolutely facetious to suggest that we have locked up all of America's energy resources. What you didn't hear from my friends that have been talking for an hour is the fact that there are 68 million acres already under control of the oil and gas industry that they have chosen not to explore. They're not in production. 68 million acres. Indeed, the majority of the land that is available right now they have chosen not to use. 
   We have legislation from a number of my colleagues that I am proud to cosponsor that would simply require that the oil companies use it or they lose it. If they are going to have these leases, they're going to have to explore it. And if they don't, then they will lose the opportunity to tie up even more land. That simple expedient of using it or losing it would spark far more exploration than anything my colleagues talked about for an hour and would do it much sooner. 
   Second, we need to pop the speculative bubble. They haven't said anything about that. Not one word, other than one of my colleagues, to acknowledge that the speculators are at work. But no focus about what we're going to do about it. 
   As I mentioned, we have heard, including a top executive from ExxonMobil that testified before our Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, that speculation, along with weakening of the dollar and geopolitical risk, is responsible for driving oil prices up to $50 a barrel. 
   Now, I don't know whether the speculative bubble is $5 a barrel or $50 a barrel, but that is something that this Congress should do something about. It's something the administration has turned a blind eye to, and it's something my Republican colleagues have nothing to say about. 
   We have legislation to deal with that. 
   Congressman Larson from Connecticut has legislation that is pretty straightforward that if you are going to speculate in oil futures, you have to be willing to take delivery. Now, this is supported by people who are in the oil--it wouldn't affect anybody who is in the oil and gas business who's producing or delivering, but the people who are simply there to profit from speculation would have their wings clipped a little bit. 
   The Enron loophole which excluded this speculative activity in energy which was approved under the watch of  this administration and the Republicans of Congress, excluded it from supervision from the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. We think it's time to close the Enron loophole. We think it's time to have more oversight rather than less. 
   Let's deal, for instance, with the amount of margin, the leverage that people who are doing something that's perfectly appropriate trying to make a buck, but we want to make sure that we don't have yet another speculative bubble that is hammering the American economy like we've seen with the housing bubble, what we saw in the stock market bubble. People turn a blind eye to it. We suggest we shouldn't do that. 
   It is important to ramp up efforts at conservation. 
   As I mentioned, it's taken George Bush, who sat in before us speaking from the podium immediately in front of me and declared that we were addicted to oil, the same George Bush who said at $50 a barrel the oil companies didn't need subsidies to be encouraged to develop oil resources but yet has consistently fought our efforts to shift unnecessary subsidies when oil prices were twice that. 
   It's taken this administration longer to get to 35 miles per gallon than it took Jack Kennedy to get to the moon. 
   We need to help provide consumers with more choices. We need to accelerate our efforts dealing with alternative fuels. 
   I see my colleague, Jay Inslee, has joined us here in the Chamber. Congressman Inslee serves with me on the Speaker's Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming who's done a great deal of work and research and has listened to the testimony that I have heard that there are a vast array of entrepreneurs ready to go right now with plug-in hybrids, with electric cars, that we should be accelerating this effort. 
   And before I turn to my colleague to elaborate on that, somebody who speaks with great passion, authority, and conviction, I would mention that the Federal Government itself, under the Republican administration, continues to have a vast fleet of gas-hungry SUVs. We're spending $3 1/2 billion through GSA for hundreds of thousands of vehicles and millions of gallons of gasoline. Wouldn't it be nice for this administration to get serious about not competing with the rest of American consumers by moving to more fuel-efficient cars ourselves, more biodiesel, alternative energy sources, plug-in hybrids, to be a leader rather than making the problem worse? 
   Congressman Inslee, I appreciate your taking time late at night to join me. I appreciate your leadership and advocacy, and I wonder if you might want to talk a little bit about some of the choices, based on your research and work, that should be made available to the American consumer.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (REPUBLICANS' ENERGY ``SOLUTIONS'' WON'T SOLVE OUR ENERGY CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate, Mr. Inslee, your continued advocacy, being on message, moving legislative initiatives, and helping educate the American public about the potential of the New Apollo Project, the potential for our economy, the potential for a new era. 
   I want to conclude because I guess we only have half an hour, so I've got a few minutes left. So I'm going to conclude by just running through what we didn't hear this evening. I want to be very, very focused on this because what we didn't hear was an honest explanation of what the problem is and where we're going to go. If for some reason we have a few more moments, I'll be happy to flip back to my friend, but let me just finish my thoughts here. 
   The notion that we are going to somehow surrender our energy future to the Big Oil companies, allow them to lease everything else, and have it their will to take some of our most precious, sensitive places and run roughshod over the will of the people in California or Florida or elsewhere, New Jersey, I mean, a whole host of places that would be affected by this and somehow get $2 a gallon gasoline is poppycock. And I think my good friend from Washington said hooey. 
   But you look at any independent, honest, objective expert, and they will say, you may be able to affect things 7 to 10 years from now a penny or two below what the price otherwise would be because we're caught up in a global initiative. 
   It is as phony as Senator McCain's proposal for a gas tax holiday which would only give the holiday to the Big Oil companies, and we'd rely on their magnificent generosity to trickle a little of that down. No indication that that would happen. 
   We didn't hear one word about global warming, which even Senator McCain and Senator Obama agree on and we are going to be dealing with a carbon-constrained economy. 
   Not one word about conservation. We can't afford to continue to waste more oil than any country in the world. 
   We heard an attack on cap-and-trade, which is where the United States and every other developed economy is going. We're going to have a carbon-constrained economy. We're not going to enable people to continue to pollute the environment with massive amounts of carbon, slowly cook the planet, raise sea levels and temperatures with extreme weather. That's not going to happen. The American public understands that. The evangelical community, the environmental community, organized labor and business are moving in this direction. 
   It was George Bush the first's decision to issue many of these protections via executive order, and George Bush the second--if he had been serious about this, would have done it years ago. He would have changed his father's decision if he was serious about it before he was running in Florida and California. He hasn't. 
   It will take 7 to 10 years for this to get to market. We will, as Mr. Inslee has mentioned, we will 
   deal with closing the Enron loophole and squeezing the speculators. 
   We need to use what we have now, the use-it-or-lose-it. Sixty-eight million acres are now open to the large oil companies right now, an area the size of Georgia and Illinois combined. We're going to advance legislation that says they we're going to use that before we mortgage the rest of our energy future for them, or we'll give it to somebody who will. 
   I'm amazed that my friends continue to come to the floor and attack bicycles. I find that somewhat amusing because I've been working for a dozen years on bike partisanship. I know there are many Members on the Republican side of the aisle that don't believe the rhetoric of their extreme Members and their leadership who belittle the role that new technologies can play or the application of old technologies. 
   You know, today, if you go down to the G2 entrance in the Rayburn building, you can't find a place to park a bike. Members and staff are coming here in droves. At $4 or $5 a gallon, you bet it makes sense. Making an opportunity for our children to walk or bike to school safely, you bet it makes sense. Would we be talking about morbidly obese, 300-pound sixth graders if more kids could do that? Yet somehow the Republican leadership has chosen to try and belittle the most effective form of urban transportation ever designed and, in fact, is supported by many of the Republicans themselves. 
   At the Republican convention and the Democratic convention, Mr. Speaker, we're going to have 1,000 bicycles, and you watch these people who try and belittle cycling. You watch delegates line up to use it, to travel around Minneapolis and Denver, to actually see the community at 10 miles an hour, to get through security and parking hassles, to be able to get a little exercise and save some energy. 
   But that is symptomatic of their approach to try and score political points, to make fun of things that make a difference, and ultimately, it's why their approach is doomed to fail. 
   Democrats, since we assumed control, have been working on initiatives to give the American consumer more choices, to protect the environment, to encourage conservation, to give them more fuel-efficient cars, to give them mass transit, to give people in rural and small town America and our urban centers more opportunities about how they move, where they live, to get more out of the energy that we've got and develop new technologies that are more sustainable, that will lead to the revitalization not just of the environment but to our economy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you. And I appreciate your pulling these pieces together, Congressman Inslee. I think you hit the nail on the head. 
   I am hopeful that throughout all of this, that we can conduct this debate from this point forward by being honest with the American public. There is no one single cause for what we've seen happen with oil prices--speculation, world market, increased demand, hiccup here, there are a whole host of things that we see. Likewise, there is no one single solution. We need a comprehensive array. 
   We do want to restrain speculation, whether it's $1 a barrel or $50 a barrel. It's unfair to the American consumer. It's unfair to the industries and small business people, and homeowners that rely on fairly priced petroleum products. 
   We need to encourage using the energy leases that are out there right now before we consider surrendering our energy future by turning over even more leases. Use the 68 million acres that are available now. 
   We have to stop wasting more oil than anybody else on the planet. Three times I've had an amendment that has passed in our legislation to close the Hummer loophole, but with our tax code, we're still subsidizing, with your tax dollars, the purchase of the largest, most fuel-inefficient, expensive vehicles, costing the Treasury hundreds of millions of dollars and working against ourselves. We need to change that; something that we have been unable to do with the current configuration, but it has passed the House. 
   We need to develop new energy sources, not just drain petroleum dry. But we need to be serious about solar, wind, tidal. We need to be serious about new technologies, as you point forward. We need to work on how the land use system is in place. In too much of America it's illegal for somebody who works in a drugstore to live in an apartment above that drugstore. We artificially separate uses. 
   We have too many long commutes. Too many people have to burn a gallon of gas to buy a gallon of milk. We need to have a more rational and thoughtful approach to a land use system that will make transportation work better. 
   And last, but not least, we need more transportation choices for Americans, whether it's Amtrak revitalized, streetcars, buses, light rail, heavy rail--God forbid bicycles and pedestrian. They're all part of a mix. And every American ought to have a wider range of choice, and the Federal Government ought to be working to do this. 
   Mr. Inslee, I appreciate your joining me this evening. I appreciate your  analysis and your leadership. And if you have any concluding thoughts, I would turn to you at this point before yielding back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, while our hearts are touched by the  terrible flooding in Iowa, 24 lives lost already, 40,000 people who had to be evacuated, now is the time to think about how we help them in the future and prevent others from this fate. 
   This is the second 500-year flood in the last 15 years. There is a thought-provoking article on the front page of today's Washington Post that I would commend to all of my colleagues. It recalls something that I saw when I last visited Iowa, that the whole State has been dramatically replumbed. Ninety percent of the wetlands have been filled and farmed. Last year alone, 106,000 acres in the Conservation Reserve Program were taken out and farmed, acres that would have served as a great big sponge to capture the water instead of making flooding worse. 
   Because the effects of global warming and planting one-third of the State in corn and soybeans, we should reflect on the human role in the unfolding disaster. Now is the time to review our disastrous farm and water resource policies so that we can protect people in the future from this fate.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, as we take up the final war supplemental of the Bush administration, the Bush legacy in Iraq is clear: a President who misled America, needlessly put our troops in harm's way, and threw billion of dollars of good money after bad. 
   Five years ago, I spoke out and voted against the invasion of lraq. From that time I have opposed the open-ended funding and escalation of this terrible conflict, while the President has committed us to a growing military tragedy, foreign policy nightmare, and, increasingly, humanitarian crisis. I continue to believe that the best way to honor those whose lives have been lost in this tragic war is to end it quickly and responsibly. 
   It is a constant source of frustration that Congress has been unable to substantially curb our involvement in Iraq. Though this bellicose President may be content to wage a war and then leave the aftermath to his successor, Congress should know better. It is the men and women from our districts--whose names and faces we know--that are wounded and dying in Iraq. I cannot support the war funding amendment. It is fundamentally flawed, providing no requirements for withdrawal. 
   However, I am pleased that the second amendment provides almost $700 million in refugee assistance. Iraq has claimed the lives of thousands of Americans, and the Iraqi civilian death toll is several times that. George Bush famously proclaimed he would be no ``nation-builder.'' This has been sadly true for the 4.5 million Iraqis forced from their homes since the U.S. invasion. Tomorrow, June 20, is World Refugee Day, and I am pleased to see that this second amendment does more for Iraq's 2.5 million refugees and 2 million internally displaced persons. 
   I am also pleased that the amendment includes responsible domestic items such as the significant expansion of ``GI Bill'' education benefits, the protection of Medicaid from harmful cuts, an extension of unemployment benefits, and funding for domestic disaster relief, all necessary in our unsteady economy. 
   I am proud today to cast votes in support of our troops--by voting against unconditional war funding and this President's reckless war, and by voting for educational benefits and responsible international and domestic priorities.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (SCHIP VETO -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, the vote to override President Bush's veto of SCHIP marks the culmination of the most disingenuous and deliberately misleading debate I have witnessed in my entire political career. 
   The partisan talking points from the Bush White House have been disputed not only by the independent experts, but by dozens of sensible Republicans like Senator Grassley, Senator Roberts and Senator Hatch. The facts are simple: working families are having great difficulty providing their children with health insurance. 
   This is not a program about poor kids, most of whom are already eligible for State Medicaid programs. SCHIP provides health care to children of working families who make too much to receive welfare, but can't afford private insurance. Everyone I talk to back home agrees that this is a problem government needs to address and that children of struggling working families shouldn't pay the price for Republican politics. 
   The President and his Republican defenders say that SCHIP shouldn't go to families who earn $83,000 a year. Well, as Republican Senator Grassley points out, this is why the bill doesn't authorize coverage at that income level. 
   The White House now opposes the bipartisan bill because it provides coverage for adults. Yet, over the last 6 years, the administration has cheerfully approved numerous waivers to allow States that have requested to extend coverage to some adults; for example, to pregnant women. This bill actually phases out adult coverage over 2 years, coverage the Bush White House used to think was a good idea, before they were against it. 
   We have heard complaints about the process, how Republicans were shut out of consideration of SCHIP reauthorization. Yet Commerce Committee Republicans wasted hour after hour demanding the bill be read line-by-line, aloud, instead of debating areas of concern and proposing their own amendments. Just because House Republicans chose to squander time with procedural games and stalling tactics is no justification for denying health care to 10 million children. 
   Nothing is more ludicrous than the argument that SCHIP is a step towards socialized medicine. We have heard them say it time after time. But SCHIP is a block grant program to the States where most SCHIP recipients receive their coverage by private, managed care plans, similar to the private Medicare Advantage plans the Republicans have been promoting for the last 5 years. 
   The argument that SCHIP is too costly rings hollow. After all, remember, there are 98 Republican opponents of SCHIP who voted for a more expensive unfunded Medicare prescription drug program, which the President happily signed into law. 
   Five years of SCHIP expansion would cost little more than a month of the Iraq war, and SCHIP is paid for, unlike the President's war that is all borrowed money. The President's opposition, if wrong headed, is at least consistent. His budget proposal for 2008 underfunded SCHIP. It would have cut coverage for 800,000 children currently in the program. 
   He drug his feet on SCHIP as Governor of Texas, and his home State still has the highest percentage of uninsured children in the country. Of course, his tendency to ignore inconvenient facts or make up his own is well documented. 
   What I find inexplicable is the decision of House Republicans to follow the President's leadership down this path of denial and deceit. This bill is about more than health care for 10 million children. It could mark a turning point in the future of politics and health care reform in America. 
   If Bush and his GOP supporters are allowed to kill this bipartisan compromised legislation without severe consequences, meaningful health care reform and progress will be delayed for years. We must lay the foundation for accountability at the ballot box, because the message will be clear.  Progress would be possible only with a new visionary president and a Congress that will listen. 
   I still hold out hope that this Congress will listen to the support of 70 percent of the American public, the support of 16 Republican governors and the bipartisan support in the Senate, that will convince a sufficient number of House Republicans to overturn this cruel veto and provide 10 million children with needed health care.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (RECOGNIZING THE 35TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLEAN WATER ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I deeply appreciate the gentleman's courtesy in permitting me to speak on this, his kind words, and his leadership in expediting this legislation to come to the floor. 
   I am honored that Chairman Oberstar and Congressman Duncan are cosponsors of this legislation. And I was privileged to work on the Water Resources Subcommittee for those 6 years that Congressman Duncan chaired it, and it was a valuable and productive time. It was an opportunity for me to learn about this critical area. 
   And the reason we are introducing this resolution today is because of the history that was recounted by my good friend from Minnesota. There is nothing more critical to our survival than water. It is essential to our survival; it sustains human life. Its patterns have dictated the development of species and ecosystems, and more recently, of the bilky environment. I am pleased that we are celebrating this landmark legislation, and not just a celebration, but an opportunity to reflect upon what has worked and why, as my friend from Tennessee indicated, where we might go. We have an opportunity to understand where there are continuing challenges and what else needs to be done. 
   We must move beyond commemoration. We must make a commitment not to celebrate another milestone with the Clean Water Act without more demonstrable progress here at home and abroad. And I hope this resolution inspires further action that is both quick and ambitious. 
   Issues confronting us today and over the next 35 years are even more complex than when the Clean Water Act was enacted. There are still problems with pollution, water supply, infrastructure integrity, and the technical jurisdictional issues. The growth and development we've seen across the country compounds that. And global warming gives these issues a new sense of urgency. We just finished a meeting, and I know the Transportation and Infrastructure team met with officials from the Netherlands, who are dealing with immediate challenges with their water resources as a result of climate change, rising water levels and extreme water events. 
   Changing climate will have an influence on many aspects of our lives, and it will take many of them in the form  of water; floods, sea levels, drought. This will make water supply and quality issues much harder to deal with. 
   In the Pacific Northwest, for instance, where we rely heavily on hydroelectric power, where the snowpack in the mountains every year determines the amount of our drinking water, we have a sense of urgency as we watch that snowpack diminish. 
   Just this last month, there have been two additional reports highlighting the work in front of us. A report by the U.S. PIRG found that thousands of facilities across the United States continue to exceed the limits under their Clean Water Act permits; 57 percent violated those permit limits at least once during the year 2005, many for more than once, and many for more than one pollutant. 
   A report by Food and Water Watch found that the majority of States are facing current and projected wastewater infrastructure needs that are far out of line with their available funding. At the same time, Federal support for State and community wastewater projects has declined. 
   When my good friend first came to Congress in the early days of this program, 78 percent of the funding was supplied by the Federal Government in 1978. Now, maybe we don't want to return to those glorious days of yesteryear, but last year it was 3 percent of the funding. It undercuts the potential partnership that we have. And all of this at a time when our decaying water infrastructure was recently given a grade of D minus by the American Society of Civil Engineers. 
   For these reasons, I believe we need a sustainable, reliable, dedicated revenue source that will help communities address these important needs. 
   Clean water is critical to environmental and public health. But I think it also, as demonstrated by the action here on this floor, has the potential of bringing people together. Mr. Oberstar mentioned the history back in contentious times when there was an overwhelming vote to sustain a veto, not the easiest thing to do. As was shown by this bipartisan resolution, I found working with the Water Resources Subcommittee that this brings people together and there is common ground. 
   This bipartisan resolution is evident of recent polling that shows that more than eight in 10 Americans are very concerned about America's water, that it will not be clean or safe enough for their children or grandchildren. Eighty-nine percent of Americans say that ``Federal investment to guaranteed clean and safe water is a critical component of our Nation's environmental well-being.'' 
   I hope that, even as we move beyond commemoration and towards addressing some of these critical unresolved issues, that we can keep the same spirit of bipartisanship. 
   I hope our colleagues will do more than just vote for this resolution. I hope we educate ourselves and our constituents about what it represents, what it represents in terms of the status of water quality and infrastructure in our own State and community, offer our own contributions to practical solutions, and, as I said, a dedicated trust fund and financial resources to do the job right. 
   Mr. Oberstar gave us 50 years of history in a very short period of time. I hope this commemoration is a point of departure for the next 50 months under the leadership of the chairman, with the work of Mr. Duncan, with a new administration that's coming to town, that we will have, over these next 50 months, a landmark in water quality, and I look forward to working with you all in achieving it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy as I appreciate his leadership. It is a pleasure to be here with my friend from Arizona (Mr. Flake) as we are going back to review some of what we said was going to happen when we were here a week ago. Remember, we talked about what would happen: As the light of day shone on this bill, there would be more things that would come up that would give pause. 
   Now I have had my differences with President Bush from time to time, but he did the right thing by putting the spotlight on this bill by vetoing it. As has been pointed out by my colleagues, we found out just in the course of the last couple of days something that wasn't clearly explained on the floor, how as the high commodity prices declined to more typical levels, we could end up paying an additional $16 billion of subsidy. 
   This bill simply is a missed opportunity for real reform. It is not turning your back on America's farmers and ranchers to suggest, as some of us have and the President argues, that you are limited to $200,000 a year of income before subsidies kick in. At a time of record commodity food prices, farm couples earning up to $1.5 million a year with an additional up to $1 million outside income simply don't need to receive government subsidy. Meanwhile, the majority of farmers who don't grow the commodity crops are going to continue to get little or no money. 
   It hurts a State like mine, the State of Oregon, where we are proud of what our ranchers and farmers do. But the majority of them get nothing under the existing farm bill and they will continue to get nothing under this proposal. 
   It troubles me that we are creating a new permanent disaster program, an additional layer of subsidy, which doesn't make sense. If a region is representing repeat disaster year after year after year, it is not really a disaster. It is growing the wrong things using the wrong techniques in the wrong places. We shouldn't turn it into an entitlement. 
   This bill is a missed opportunity for conservation. The National Wildlife Federation has called the farm bill a disaster for wildlife that ``fans the flames of global warming.'' The funding for conservation is not nearly enough to meet the needs. They are not met today. The majority will not be met under this bill. And, sadly, it makes cuts to important programs like the conservation reserve program, the wetland reserve program. I am disappointed that it also guts the sod saver program that protects important prairie and grassland habitat. 
   I mentioned last time that I was on the floor that this bill nullifies a Federal appeals court decision under the Freedom of Information Act that ordered USDA to make public data that is critical to monitoring the economic and environmental impacts of these subsidies.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Nobody talked about this on the floor, drawing the veil over this information. It was inserted without public hearings, without debate, and will have serious oversight ramifications on how we manage these programs. Nineteen congressional districts in the country will get about half the money. They make out grandly. But States with strong agricultural communities will continue to be shortchanged. 
   Congress could have done a better job for the environment, could have concentrated the help on the majority of farmers who are shortchanged to help them and their communities. Small- and medium-sized farmers will continue to be squeezed away. If we pass this bill, do not sustain the veto, we will continue to have large operations squeezing out small and medium-sized operations. If we can't muster reform with these record high prices, we probably never will. The President was right to veto it. I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support him and go back and do it right.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND JOB CREATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy. 
   There have been some stark differences in the debate here today, but there is one thing that is clear: There is a clear record of failed fiscal discipline on the part of our friends on the Republican side of the aisle; 12 years of failure to deal with the alternative minimum tax, including 6 years of that time when they controlled the entire process, their failure to cut spending while they borrowed money on our children's credit card to give tax benefits to those who need it the least, and for 12 years they refused to fix the AMT. 
   There is going to be a new era in Washington in 242 days where we will be able to deal comprehensively with tax reform, and I look forward to it. But, in the meantime, it is critical to give Americans more energy choices, and this legislation does precisely that. 
   In particular, it would extend the investment tax credit that deals with renewable energy. When the PTC for wind energy expired at the end of 2003, the installation of new wind capacity dropped 77 percent in the next year. A recent analysis by our friends in the wind and solar industries suggest that we are looking at $19 billion of lost investment and 116,000 lost job opportunities if we fail to act on the extension. This will set us back not just in terms of the challenge of wind and solar energy today, but we are going to lose ground to our competitors overseas. 
   I strongly urge that we focus on the need to provide more energy choices for Americans today. Extending these credits is a way to make a difference this year. Failure to do so is going to cause unnecessary disruption, not just in terms of energy, but economically as well. 
   I would hope that this is one area where we ought to be able to work together, agree with these responsible provisions, and enact it into law.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (HIGH GAS PRICES -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, people are right to be concerned about the impact of high gas prices, diesel fuel, and even though it is summer, soon we'll have to be concerned about home heating oil prices as well. This is hurting everyone from truck drivers to nonprofits, like Meals on Wheels, who are seeing fewer volunteers because they can't afford the gasoline. It is clear that American families are struggling after years of this administration's failed energy policies. They need help from their political leaders, but most of all, they deserve to be treated honestly. 
   While it may test well with some focus groups to talk about opening up some of our most fragile and sensitive areas, like the Arctic, for drilling, it fails the more fundamental test of making a difference for our families today or for at least this year. It will take 10 to 20 years before the oil begins to flow from a place like the Arctic, and the benefits will not necessarily be noticed by families even then as we are in a vast global oil market. We hear now that there is a lack of equipment, materials and workers that compounds the problem of getting that oil to flow even if we move forward. 
   Expanding oil drilling as an answer to the current problems is a hoax because it will not make any difference for years, and even then, it will have so small an impact as to not even be noticed by most people. A difference of 2 cents a gallon in 20 years is little solace for people who are seeing gas prices rise 10 cents in a couple of days and oil prices shooting up $10 a barrel in a single day. It is a cruel hoax because there are things that can be done now. 
   An example of something we can do tomorrow which will make a difference immediately would be to release even a small fraction of the oil stored in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This would squeeze dollars out of the speculative part of the price of oil today. The money from the proceeds of selling this oil could be used to finance badly needed energy and transportation alternatives, and we would still have money left over with which we could continue to fill the Reserve with less expensive oil over time. 
   There are a series of initiatives that are being examined by the House this week that would rein in oil speculators. I don't know whether it's $5 or $50 a barrel. The experts we hear from conflict, but it's clear that there is some impact. If we stopped wasting taxpayer dollars and eliminated the Hummer tax loophole, which subsidizes the purchase of the largest, heaviest, most expensive gas guzzlers on the road, and instead used that money to make investments, that would help families now. 
   We can also help immediately by leveling the tax and policy playing field to give American families more choices about how they get around and about how they spend their money on their transportation needs. That's why I've introduced legislation, the Transportation and Housing Choices for Gas Price Relief Act, that recognizes, while there is no single solution to the complex energy situation we are facing, we can immediately reduce the impact of high gas prices on consumers by providing them with real options. 
   The bill would expand the successful Safe Routes to Schools program, and it would make high schools eligible so children could get to school on their own, burning calories instead of fossil fuel. 
   It would allow self-employed small businesspeople to get for the first time transit commuting benefits currently enjoyed by other employees of larger businesses. This legislation wouldn't force commuters into a one-size-fits-all solution for their transportation benefits. Instead, it would level the playing field so they could access what works for them. 
   The bill recognizes that the housing choices that reduce commuting costs sometimes may be a little more expensive, but it results in a legitimate increase in terms of their capacity to purchase a house, and that should be reflected in policy. It promotes telecommuting as well. 
   It uses current resources better to give people more choices designed to make lives better for Americans today,  this year, in 2008, not waiting until 2028. Congress should not spin an energy fantasy, but should deal with things that we can do today to deal with today's energy realities, and I urge my colleagues to look at the options like those in my legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2082, INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - December 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that after failing to reauthorize our Intelligence programs for the past 2 years under Republican leadership, the Democratic majority has taken the health of our Nation's intelligence community seriously. I support the critical improvements to this bill: strengthening the offices of the Inspector Generals, authorizing increased attention to climate change, and strengthening contractor oversight. 
   Most importantly, I support this bill because of its torture prohibition. Torture violates not only the laws and values of our country, but all standards of decent human conduct. I have consistently spoken out against the stonewalling and equivocation surrounding this administration's ``interrogation'' of prisoners. It is clear that the American people will not get satisfactory answers from the administration, and that it is now Congress's duty to set interrogation standards worthy of our great Nation. 
   Extending the rules of the Army Field Manual to intelligence personnel is a significant step. I am proud that Congress will send the message to our Nation and the world at large that Americans do not approve of, and will not stand for, torture.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (IT'S TIME FOR A NEW DIRECTION IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor with some observations about Iraq, but I must comment on the presentation I just heard from my friend from Georgia. 
   You know, Mr. Speaker, independent observers agree that Democrats have moved quickly and aggressively to implement what we said we were going to do in the first 100 hours. I find it disingenuous that our friend was talking about somehow the Democrats not dealing with its commitment on earmarks, and mentioning the rain forest in Iowa. Mr. Speaker, again, independent observers agree that Mr. Obey and Mr. Byrd did bring forward a clean continuing resolution that didn't have any new earmarks. It killed the earmarks that had been set aside in the failed budget of the Republicans in the last session of Congress. 
   What my friend is talking about, the rain forest in Iowa, was an earmark from several years ago, a Republican earmark, I might say, from several years ago. And now he is suggesting that as we have moved forward to clean up the budget mess left by the Republicans, failing to meet their commitments to produce budgets in a timely fashion, that we didn't go back and surgically remove earmarks that they had scattered throughout the budget for years. Well, I'm sorry. With all due respect to George Orwell and my friend from Georgia, I think that is doublespeak. We did what we said we were going to do. The CR has come forward without earmarks, and we have put in place a much more transparent process so people will know who is doing what on whose behalf. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, I came to the floor today to make a few comments about the situation in Iraq. There is much ado in the other body to work to catch up with the reality on the ground in Iraq and where the American public is. This is not the time just to oppose escalation of more troops in Iraq. We find that the 21,000 that the President referred to is actually going to mean 50 additional thousand when you put all the support in. It is time for Congress to deal in a comprehensive fashion with what we need to do to make the best of this tragically mismanaged situation, a war of choice that we didn't have to do, sadly mismanaged by the administration. It is time for Congress to rediscover our war powers with Iraq, and even more important, the saber rattling that is directed now towards Iran. It is time for us to rediscover the power of the purse, not provide an open-ended bank account, but tighten down the resources that are provided by Congress to the administration, and to rediscover oversight where there are daily reminders in every major newspaper of where Congress in the last few years has frankly been missing in action. 
   To be able to advance those goals in a comprehensive fashion, I have introduced new directions for Iraq. It sets forth goals for United States policy, supporting the Iraqi people, preventing greater violence, reestablish our international credibility and military readiness, and focusing on real national security threats. It calls not for escalation, but prohibiting the escalation without specific congressional approval, and for the redeployment of troops from Iraq to be completed in approximately 1 year. 
   It calls for the United States to forswear the establishment of permanent bases in Iraq, as well as U.S. control over Iraq's oil infrastructure and economic policies. It redirects United States reconstruction funding from large foreign contractors to Iraqi-owned businesses to help create jobs in Iraq. It instructs the President to nullify contracts where any company has not fulfilled an Iraq reconstruction contract, and to recover lost funds. 
   We ought not to just stop the fraud in terms of the contracting, but we ought to aggressively punish war profiteering, encouraging Congress to investigate and the Attorney General to aggressively prosecute profiteering and fraud. 
   It requires a regional diplomatic initiative because ultimately it is going to require diplomacy on the part of the United States and all of the surrounding countries to be able to turn this around. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to look at the New Direction For Iraq Act of 2007 as a comprehensive way to change the situation in Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (IMPLEMENTING THE 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I could not be more pleased that we start the hundred legislative hours dealing with the implementation of 9/11 commission recommendations. 
   On the first somber anniversary of 9/11, I asked myself whether we had done all we could have as a Congress to make America safe. Sadly I did not think so and my feelings were vindicated when the bipartisan independent 911 commission later reported that much more was left to be done. That was as unacceptable then as it is now. 
   The American public expects and deserves better. By moving forward with these recommendations today, we are keeping faith with that commitment and making long overdue progress. I understand that this is the beginning of that commitment rather than the end. There are other things that I would do much more quickly including giving the American public the budget numbers so they can begin to evaluate our stewardship, but I understand that these will take more time. 
   We are striking a balance between rapid action, broader consensus and bipartisan engagement. Today we're dealing with the lowest hanging fruit and setting the stage for more progress. I look forward to the committees' of jurisdiction in the House stepping up their efforts, and to the Senate joining us in what I hope will be a steady stream of further reform. Until that happens, launching the grant program for interoperability among first responders refocusing investments based on risks and not political power and providing a platform for the legislative leadership to coordinate in these critical oversight areas are very important first steps. 
   We'll continue to work for further streamlining the congressional intelligence and security oversight, but I am delighted that this will be done in an open legislative platform and  moving away from the backroom dealing that has shut out the minority. 
   This represents an important and long overdue step forward.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   No matter what you call it, another escalation in the war in Iraq is wrong. I will oppose in both word and deed any effort to send more troops. We've tried it before. It will not just mean more American casualties. It will bring more violence to the Iraqis while adding to the burden on our already strained Armed Forces. We should start instead bringing our troops home, not sending more into harm's way in what the President's advisers have already admitted is a political decision, not a strategic one. Let's take advantage of the new congressional leadership to change direction in what Americans know is our most important issue, ending the war in Iraq. 
   We should start with the resolution the Bush administration used to authorize this disaster. Knowing what we know now, the authorization of force bears little relation to reality. Instead, the committees of jurisdiction should use their upcoming hearings to craft new legislation that will mean a withdrawal of our troops as well as guide our continued involvement in Iraq until that withdrawal is complete. I will introduce legislation later this month that would provide exactly that sort of guide by refocusing our efforts on political, diplomatic and economic strategies. 
   Most importantly and most immediately, Congress has clear authority through its power of the purse. We must demand accountability for how money is spent, who is getting how much and for what purpose. We need to target war profiteering. There are too many accounts of contractors who have taken taxpayer dollars and abandoned our troops under fire and the Iraqi people in need. We need an entity like the Truman Commission during World War II to aggressively investigate contractors, punish war profiteers and recover misspent funds by canceling any failed or fraudulent contracts. By redirecting as much of the money as possible to projects run for and by Iraqis, we can repair that damaged country as cost effectively as possible. 
   We must also reconsider the unprecedented privatization of our military effort. The outsourcing of these basic support functions in Iraq has left contractors unaccountable to the American people, immune from military law and has cost the taxpayers much more than we've needed to spend. 
   While we're at it, Congress should end the outsourcing of our work. It should be embarrassing to the Republican leadership that it took the Iraqi Study Group to provide the oversight and accountability that Congress should have done these past 4 years. 
   We need to work to make sure the political discussion surrounding Iraq is not just more civil but more effective. We need to make it possible to debate this issue in terms of facts and the policy consequences and not hide behind the cloud of politics. In the 2002, 2004 and 2006 election cycles, there was lots of talk about Iraq, but people didn't tell the truth. Instead, the issue was manipulated for political purposes. We must resist the efforts to reduce this discussion to how it will impact the next election rather than how we got into this mess and how we are going to get out of it. In all of this conversation, we need to be dealing with the long-term security of the United States. 
   We must look at the President's plan to escalate the war in Iraq in the context of those violent fundamentalists around the world that would do us harm, threats of genocide in Darfur and chaos in Somalia, nuclear proliferation, global warming and the loss of America's influence in the world. In none of those areas does escalating the war in Iraq make the world a safer place. 
   The American people would welcome Congress doing our job right. Only then can we turn this disaster around and provide the security for families in America and around the world.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (FARM BILL/FOOD BILL -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   The farm bill is described as the most important legislation that most of America ignores. It's big, complex and involves lots of money all over the country, but the details are not well known. One of the reasons might be the name. We call it a farm bill. But it could and perhaps should be called a food bill, because that is what it is. 
   Many people do not understand that the farm bill isn't just about farmers. It is a bill that funds food stamps, nutritional programs and farmers' markets. The programs we're talking about all impact rural, urban and suburban families alike. 
   Currently, our farm programs provide too little help to the majority of American farmers and ranchers. The majority of commodity payments go to a few large-scale farm operations with only 40 percent of the farmers receiving any commodity payments at all. My State of Oregon is an example. Even though it is a major agricultural producer, it really doesn't benefit that much from the farm bill. 
   With the 2007 farm bill reauthorization, we have a chance to make dramatic reforms in American agricultural policy by crafting forward-looking policies to help farmers manage the transition to a new farm economy. I would suggest some basic principles for strengthening the farm bill so that we ensure the future of American agriculture by giving small farmers the increased markets they need, a dependable workforce, the ability to pass their farms and heritage on to the next generation, and be protected from urban sprawl. 
   Farm workers also need safe, family wage jobs, and rural communities need a stronger economy. We need to provide safe access to nutrition and reliable foods to all Americans, especially the most vulnerable members of our communities; children, the elderly and the poor. 
   We need to increase the health and safety of our communities by improving access to local markets that can improve farmers' revenues, improve rural economies, and strengthen the vital connections between urban and rural communities. We can have programs to reimburse farmers for providing environmental services such as flood control, carbon sinks and wildlife habitat. This can help reduce global warming, increase communities' resilience to natural events, and give farmers the opportunity to diversify their revenue stream. 
   In short, we can move American agriculture into the 21st century by not being devoted to policies from the last 200 years. 
   To that end, I have recently introduced the Local Food and Farm Support Act to connect local farms to schools to provide healthy food choices for children and promoting a stronger local farm economy by providing funding and programs that connect farmers with local markets, including school to cafeteria programs, and the promotion of farmers' markets. This legislation would provide grants to farmers to explore innovative new ways to connect to local markets and increase food assistance for senior and low-income families. 
   Mr. Speaker, I could just as easily talk about the farm bill as being the most important piece of environmental legislation we will consider in this Congress, because the potential for energy with biomass and wind, greenhouse gas reduction and energy conservation all enable us to reduce the carbon and energy footprint of America's vast agricultural landscape. In the area of water, a sound farm bill is the best and most cost-effective way to improve the quality and quantity of water across America, and of course it is essential to land preservation. 
   This is why we all need to pay attention to this critical legislation. Every Member of Congress should deal with the challenge to work with America's farmers and ranchers to produce agricultural legislation that meets the needs of America in the 21st century.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (SPECIAL IMMIGRANT STATUS FOR CERTAIN ALIENS SERVING AS TRANSLATORS OR INTERPRETERS WITH FEDERAL AGENCIES -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate your courtesy in permitting me time to speak on this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 1104 for all the reasons that have been articulated by my friend from California and my friend from Florida. 
   Iraq today is the scene of the fastest-growing humanitarian crisis in the world. It rivals only the problems that are being faced in Darfur. 
   As has been pointed out for one group in Iraq, our moral responsibility is unquestionable to Iraqis whose lives are at risk because they helped the United States. Having cooperated with the United States military, the United Nations, or even a nongovernmental organization, can literally mean a death sentence at the hands of any of the many sides of this civil war. This bill is an important first step, expanding the current limit of the 50 special translator visas to 500. 
   I became acutely aware of the magnitude of this problem working with a local high school in Portland, Oregon, who were partnering with the members of the Oregon National Guard who had served in Iraq and recently returned, who were trying to bring their former translator to the United States, literally to save this young woman's life. But they kept running into bureaucratic hurdles. It took us months to, thankfully, secure her entry into the United States, where she is safely a college student today in Portland, Oregon. 
   I have heard the same story over and over again. We should keep faith with those who have served our brave men and women in uniform. This is a basic moral responsibility and a simple issue of fairness. 
   What we have before us in this bill is a critical first step. But as my friend from California pointed out, it's only the first step. We have 4 million Iraqis who have been driven from their homes and tens of thousands who are at risk because they helped the United States, not just as translators but as drivers and construction workers, NGO support staff. 
   We are, sadly, failing Iraqi refugees. We have allowed into the United States fewer than 800 since 2003, 69 since this fall, only 1 last month. The Swedish prime minister told me last week that Sweden is going to admit 25,000 Iraqi refugees this year. 
   I introduced, last week, bipartisan legislation H.R. 2265, the Responsibility to Iraqi Refugees Act to address this ongoing humanitarian crisis by using all of the tools at our disposal, admitting refugees, providing assistance to the region and using diplomacy to ensure their well-being. 
   It would allow not 50 or 500, but 15,000 Iraqis who are at risk because they helped the United States to come to this country, along with their families. It would establish a special coordinator for Iraqi refugees and internally displaced people, and requires the United States to develop, finally, plans to ensure the well-being and safety of these Iraqi refugees. 
   It increases the number of persecuted Iraqis who can be admitted as refugees. This legislation has been endorsed by Amnesty International, Church World Service, the International Rescue Committee, Refugees International, the Jubilee Campaign, the Truman National Security Project, and many others. 
   I strongly urge that we adopt this bill today. But I would implore the Members of this House, regardless of how they feel about the war in Iraq or its future, to join and cosponsor my legislation--broad, ambitious, a comprehensive response to the Iraqi refugee crisis--before it's too late, too  late for people whose only crime was working with Americans. 
   It is also clear that it is not just these Iraqis that we ought to be concerned about. If we cannot keep faith with refugees that the United States has a responsibility for, it sends a very unpleasant message about the reliability of working with us, and, sadly, it sows the seeds for additional instability in the region. With 1 million Iraqis in Jordan, it creates an untenable situation for the long-term stability of that country. 
   I strongly urge passage of this bill, but I do hope that each of my colleagues will look at the comprehensive legislation that I introduced and determine what they are going to do to stop the fastest-growing humanitarian crisis in the world today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity. As we are concluding our activities wrapping up on the floor, preparing for the Thanksgiving recess, as people go back to work in their districts, and hopefully spend a little time with their families, it is appropriate for us to reflect on the important work that has been done here in Congress under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, working with our House Chief Administrative Officer Dan Beard, to develop a Green the Capitol initiative. 
   We have made it clear under the new Democratic leadership in the House that it is not appropriate to ask the American people to address the challenges of global warming and climate change without first carefully examining the ways that we reduce our own work energy consumption and sustainable practices here in the workspace. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have spent most of my career working with environmental issues at the State, the local, and now the Federal level, working in partnership with people in the private sector to be able to make our communities more liveable, to make families safer, healthier, and more economically secure by virtue of our environmental initiatives, how we put the pieces together. 
   Over the years, I have had lots of ideas myself. I have heard them from others. We have looked at policies and practices, rules and regulations. I will tell you that the one thing, if I were empowered for a day to be able to set the rules and regulations, it wouldn't be any new regulation, any new tax, any new environmental law. It would simply be to make sure that the Federal Government practiced what we ask the rest of America to do in terms of our behavior regarding the environment. 
   The Federal Government is the largest manager of infrastructure in the world. It is the largest consumer of energy. We have facilities from coast to coast. We are the largest employer in the United States. And the extent to which we are able to put in practice the best practices, it will have a transformational effect, not only in terms of the Federal operations themselves, but in terms of what difference it will make as we are setting trends and move forward. 
   I am extraordinarily impressed with what has happened already. I can't say enough about this initiative. The goals that were adopted were to operate the House in a carbon neutral manner by the end of the 110th Congress; to reduce the carbon footprint of the House by cutting energy consumption 50 percent in 10 years; and, to make House operations a model of sustainability. 
   There are a number of steps that the Chief Administrative Officer has already done to implement these goals. They purchased renewable energy power for electricity, funding that was approved in the Legislative Branch appropriations bill. We have switched the Capitol power plant, which provides heating and cooling to the House, to natural gas. It will improve the air quality on Capitol Hill for the residents. This was also already approved. I personally have been appalled at looking at the belching gas coal-fired plant that powers many of the energy needs for Capitol Hill. That is being changed. 
   To improve energy efficiency, the House will use metering, commissioning, and tracking to improve operations, install energy-efficient lighting, adopt new technologies and operation practices, other office equipment, update heating and ventilation. We are looking for sustainability in all House operations. Purchased carbon offsets from the Chicago Climate Exchange. These are initiatives, Mr. Speaker, that are extraordinarily exciting as they are spreading out across Capitol Hill. 
   Before turning to some of my colleagues this evening, I however must note that our friends in the minority office have decided to somehow try and politicize this effort issuing a broadside, and I am willing to talk about this further if we have time with my colleagues, but issuing a broadside against this initiative, claiming that it is somehow, the term the House Minority Leader Boehner used, green pork. It is sort of disappointing, I guess, to see that the minority leader doesn't see the value in leading by example and reducing the House energy costs and modeling the behavior we expect from citizens. I am disappointed he would prefer to have the Capitol continue to waste energy, limit transportation options for House employees, and continue to force Capitol Hill residents to experience the pollution of the Capitol Power Plant. 
   The green pork update has taken issue with a number of initiatives that the CAO has undertaken, taking to task the notion of working with the Chicago Climate Exchange. 
   I wish that the House could offset all our emissions on premise, but it is not possible at this point. But the Chicago Climate Exchange is a credible mechanism, the world's first and North America's only voluntary, legally binding greenhouse gas emissions reduction registry and training program. 
   The minority leader attacks initiative here on Capitol Hill for car-sharing. It is kind of ironic, we actually have higher per capita use of auto commuting on Capitol Hill with our 7,000 employees than in Washington, D.C. as a whole. One of the initiatives to help solve the problem of forcing people to drive their cars is to use car-sharing, something my colleague from the Seattle area can speak to.     
   We've had Flex Car and Zip Cars. The average car is only used 2 hours, less than 2 hours a day. Car-sharing is something that's moving across the country. It's been pioneered in a number of European cities. 
   The minority leader dismisses this as a ``hybrid loaner car for staffers wishing to run errands or catch a movie during work hours.'' 
   I find that offensive in the extreme. The 7,000 men and women who work for us on Capitol Hill are amazing. 
   Now I don't know what happens in the minority leader's office, maybe he has employees that go off in the middle of the day to catch movies. I don't know of anybody, Republican or Democrat, who experiences that. And it's a slander against the outstanding primarily young men and women who work with us. It's illegal in the first instance to do this. But I think it really is demeaning for the people that we work with. 
   Car-sharing, if that's what they're trying to get at, is a very successful business around the country. It's recently on the GSA schedule. I'm pleased to have a small part in encouraging that to happen here on Capitol Hill. We now have over 100 employees that have signed up for it. There are cars that are parked here that people can use before or after hours for business or after hours on their own time and avoid having to drive a vehicle. 
   I will return to this in a moment. I am obviously quite disappointed in the  minority leader slandering our employees and demeaning this effort, even picking out, claiming that he's concerned about the notion of using Segways. The Segway personal transporter is not in the initiative. It's nothing that we have done in bringing forward this program. They were part of a green products fair that was conducted here 2 weeks ago on Capitol Hill, fabulously successful. But it's an example of the fuzzy thinking and sloppy research that I think typifies the Republican approach to trying to green the Capitol and their dismissive nature of it now. 
   I would, however, if I could, recognize my colleague from the State of Washington, Jay Inslee, a gentleman who is deeply involved with the environmental issue, who's just published a book, I think it's entitled ``Apollo's Fire,'' where he has spent, with a co-author, over a year researching these issues, has tremendous insights and is using the work that he has done to help implement a sense of vision here on the House floor. It informs his work on the Commerce Committee, and I am privileged to serve with him on the Speaker's Special Committee on Global Warming and Energy Independence where he has made invaluable contributions, and would recognize him at this point.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Just in referencing the work that's already under way, now we are implementing in our cafeteria products that will add less than a nickel to the overall price of a meal that are fully biodegradable, items here that will turn to dirt within 90 days, unlike the typical foam clam shell and plastic cup that will be here thousands of years. These are being implemented on Capitol Hill, something that will be responding to the desires of the outstanding young men and women who work here who've been agitating about this. Having biodegradable products that are completely compostable will reduce the problems of land fill and pollution for centuries to come.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate, Congressman Farr, both your being here and the work that you have done for years, dating back to your tenure as a local official and as a legislator in the State of California, continuing a fine family tradition of sensitivity to the environment. 
   The point you just made about the difference between having an energy policy that our friends on the other side of the aisle that would be perfect for the 1950s, maybe, but not where business is going, not where local government is going, not where any of our three State governments are going, is unfortunate. And people are turning to change these practices not just because they are fuzzy-headed tree huggers, but because it makes good, solid business sense. 
   The initiatives that have been undertaken in the House to this point are anticipated to reduce our energy bill by more than $5 million a year at the end of the 10-year period. We invest a little money at the outset, like businesses are doing across the country,  like some families are doing, with energy-efficient appliances or more energy-efficient vehicles, but it pays for itself. 
   I was particularly put off when they were taking to task the environmentally sensitive adhesives and materials that we're putting on Capitol Hill. One of the problems right now in our households is that people use building products, use materials that are not environmentally sensitive, that actually put people at risk, put people at risk in terms of the health of their family, that we have in business. When they use environmentally sensitive adhesives, for instance, it not only enables a little shoe company in my State, Nike, to meet U.S. EPA air quality standards in Thailand by using these water-based solvents, it's a better product, it's a safer product, and it's safer for the producer and for the user. 
   It seems to me that this is the type of thinking that I commend Chief Administrative Officer Beard for bringing into play here in the House. 
   I would turn to my colleague to maybe elaborate based on his experience.

   And I appreciate what you said a moment ago about our responsibility as a neighbor. I have been privileged to be a Member of Congress for 12 years. And 3 of those 12 years on Earth Day, we went down and had press conferences using that coal smoke belching out of the Capitol power plant as an example of what we would like to change. And it's interesting, I remember, Congressman Farr, when I first came here, we were concerned about the whole House of Representatives, with gazillions of tons of paper. Sam, help me. I think it was something like $21.17 for a year.

I must note, Mr. Speaker, that that first year when we were trying to get the House under the Republican leadership to change their policies, the entire House of Representatives, with all this paper, with the staff, they recovered what I think was less than a Boy Scout troop would do in my neighborhood in Portland, Oregon. It was embarrassing. We've turned the corner. It is a significant change.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I must confess, and you and I have endured some fascinating hearings on our global warming committee having these new technologies explained that are not, as you say, some far distant point in the future. They are available today for people to implement. I must, however, as the Chair of the congressional bicycle caucus, make a mention of proven technology that we have available now, where people can burn calories instead of electricity or fossil fuel. 
   One of the things that I really appreciate Dan Beard working with us on is to make the cycling choice more readily available to employees on Capitol Hill. As I mentioned a moment ago, we have about 14,000 car trips a day to Capitol Hill. The majority of the trips to the Capitol by our employees are made by car, higher, at a higher percentage than the rest of D.C., where fewer than half of the residents drive to work. 
   Mr. Beard has been working with us to be able to deal with making this Capitol more cycle friendly, working with the Washington Area Bicycling Association, the League of Bikers, to have more bike racks here on Capitol Hill, more secure facilities, lockers perhaps inside the garages. When I first came here, there are showers that are available for the staff, but people didn't want to let it on, I guess, because they wanted to be able to sort of use it on their own. But we have made some real progress. We have got maps now where the showers are available. We have added employee locker and gym facilities in Rayburn. But we have more work to do in terms of improving the choices for cyclists. 
   Part of it, and I would defer to any of my esteemed colleagues here who are more senior, if there is something we do with the Capitol police so they don't have different standards for cyclists than people in cars or pedestrians, allowing the bikers to have the ramps, barriers that are lower for people who are cycling. So like I am cycling to Capitol Hill to vote, I don't have to choose to go on the sidewalk and harass pedestrians. In all seriousness, cycling is the most efficient form of urban transportation ever invented. It is something that helps promote health. It does not have any impact in terms of the environment, wear and tear on the roads, congestion, and in 13 years on Capitol Hill, almost 12 years now on Capitol Hill, I have never had to look for a parking place or be stuck in traffic. And I hope there is more we can continue to do with Mr. Beard working on this program for cycling promotion.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you, Sam. Thank you for your efforts and your kind words. I want to just elaborate for a moment on a point that Congressman Inslee said in terms of providing choices.     
   What we are talking about here today is to provide Americans with better choices that meet their needs, giving them options, because too many people are trapped in a car, too many people don't have environmentally-sensitive opportunities available to them. Every day, Americans make billions of decisions about where to shop, what to buy, how to move, where to go. The extent to which we get it right, to give them a range of choices about where they live, how they can move that are available to them that meet their needs, we find that people inevitably gravitate toward things that are better for them and better for the community. 
   We are seeing it now coast to coast in terms of opportunities of livable communities where, if they can walk safely, they will; if they can bike safely, they will. They will take transit if it's available to them. 
   I think, Congressman Inslee, your point a moment ago about choice, about choice and leveling the playing field, is really what this battle is about. If we are able to squeeze out the incentives for things that really aren't environmentally sensitive, because we tend to subsidize a lot of things that are actually environmentally destructive. If we even out the economics, if we give people those choices, it's going to make a difference. We are seeing it here on Capitol Hill, greening the Capitol in a way that will save us money while we give people better choices. 
   I know you have a lot of thoughts about ways to give people more choices in areas of energy conservation and production. I wonder as we are wrapping up if you have some thoughts that you would like to share in that direction.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you, Congressman Inslee. I appreciate your being here, I appreciate your explanations, and I appreciate your continued work on our various committees that we serve on. 
   One final point that I would say in conclusion that we haven't talked about is that this is not just an issue of greening the Capitol in terms of providing examples. This is also fundamentally that the same principles that we are talking about here make a huge difference for American security. The first hearing that we had on our Global Warming and Energy Independence Committee was a panel of retired military and intelligence experts. 
   The United States Department of Defense is the largest consumer of energy in the world. An aircraft carrier gets 17 feet to the gallon. The war in Iraq is the most energy-intensive military operation in the 
   history of the world. It is four times more energy-intensive than the first Iraq war. We are delivering gasoline to the front at a price of over $100 a gallon, and it's being delivered in tanker trucks that might as well have great big bull's eyes on them. 
   Our military understands that part of the reason they are engaged in Iraq now is because it is the second largest source of proven oil reserves. They understand that their budgets are being tortured out of all proportion because of the rapidly escalating energy costs. They understand that our dependence on petroleum in areas that are extraordinarily volatile in the Middle East, in other parts of the world and Africa, Venezuela, and being linked to a decline in petroleum whenever that peak hits, if it hasn't already, and handcuffs them, puts them at risk, costs them money. 
   So while we are talking about greening the Capitol, empowering people in the neighborhoods to live more environmentally-sensitive lives and to be able to have policies that will reduce the threat of global warming and greenhouse gases, there is a very real and very tangible element here that is the very security of the United States and the protection of our soldiers. 
   The things that you have been talking about here, Mr. Inslee, and others, that we have talked about on Capitol Hill, if we are able to implement them for the Department of Defense, it's going to make a huge difference for the taxpayer and the safety and the military effectiveness of our soldiers.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy, as I appreciate watching the legislative process work here. Too seldom in the last 12 years have we watched this unfold in the way that it has, and I congratulate Mr. Frank, Mr. Watt, Mr. Miller, the Ranking Member Bachus, this is how the legislative process should work. 
   I will tell you, this is not a Sarbanes-Oxley moment, where Congress stalled and stalled and stalled until the problems got so great they exploded. Then Congress rushed to act; actually didn't know in many instances what people were voting on. 
   This bill has been a deliberate process. It has not been rushed. It has been bipartisan. And I must say that I feel better than at any point in the last 4 or 5 years, as I have been alarmed as Congress has been missing in action on this issue where the regulatory structures have looked the other way. 
   The big question for me, though, is where we go from here. I am pleased in the Ways and Means Committee we have been able to make some tax adjustments so that people will not be taxed on phantom ``profits'' if they end up having a loan foreclosed upon. 
   I am eager to find out if the gentleman, Mr. Miller from North Carolina, can move forward dealing with fundamental bankruptcy reform so that people who are homeowners get the same protection that would be given to a speculator in an identical home in a subdivision or identical units in a condominium tower. This is extremely critical. 
   We are talking now not just about the hundreds of thousands of people that will be affected by this legislation. Ultimately, there will be ripple effects throughout the economy, a shaken industry, and millions of innocent homeowners who are going to have their property values drop because regulators were asleep at the switch, because Congress was missing in action, and because abusive practices took place. 
   H.R. 3915 is a good start. I commend the committee and look forward to working with you as it works its way through for the refinement of this legislation and the next step.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, as a chamber, we have come a long way since August when the disgraceful ``Protect America Act'' was strong-armed into law. The RESTORE Act, a comprehensive and thoughtful overhaul of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, could not cut a more striking contrast. 
   Over the past 7 years I have been highly critical of Republican wiretapping legislation. I have voted against every effort to expand the ability of this administration to intrude in the lives and privacy of innocent citizens. 
   But this is a Democratic Congress and a Democratic bill. The RESTORE Act strikes an unprecedented balance between civil defense and civil liberties. I deeply appreciate the hard-won progress we've made on this issue and I am heartened by our leadership's determination to end a Republican legacy that so blatantly disregards the rights of ordinary Americans. 
   The bill before us will not solve every potential abuse of FISA, but it does greatly strengthen legal protections for Americans and introduces robust congressional oversight. As this issue continues to play out into the future, it is my hope that our next steps will include even stronger protections for innocent Americans, clearer legal standards for FISA to judge surveillance procedures, and explicit requirements for the destruction of unnecessary data.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, illegal logging is a scourge of poor countries and rich countries alike. It damages the environment, often very fragile ecosystems, it disrupts the lives of poor, indigenous people. It corrodes their governments through bribery and often violence. Illegal logging also hurts rich countries as our timber and lumber manufacturing industries lose to those who cheat and bribe, over a billion dollars a year in lost sales in the United States. 
   We can do something about it. Yesterday, the Natural Resources Committee passed out my illegal logging bill to give the tools for the first time, to our government, to do something about it. Later this morning, we can pass the Peru Free Trade Agreement, with not just the strongest environmental protections ever in a trade agreement, but with specific provisions to halt the illegal mahogany harvest in Peru's forests. This can be the most significant Congress ever in the global fight to end illegal logging by passing these bipartisan measures.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, while I support the efforts of Democratic leadership to fund vital programs like the Veterans Administration and health care for our serving military, I cannot support the FY08 Defense Appropriations bill. This final draft provides too much money for the wrong priorities and enables the administration to continue its tragically misguided Iraq policy. 
   I made a pledge to vote against any further funding for the Iraq war unless it is used for immediate troop redeployment. I will honor this pledge, and I will continue to fight against funding for major weapons systems that have little to do with current security threats. 
   Programs like the Future Combat System's fighting vehicles and the National Missile Defense system would be justifiable if the major threat to our security was a modern version of the Soviet Union. It is not. I applaud the Democratic cuts to the funding levels requested by the President, though we must do better. 
   Continuing to pour billions of dollars into these programs is a waste of money and a threat to our readiness. We must invest in personnel and systems that confront the real and looming threats of terrorists and rogue states. 
   This bill contains glimmers of hope that we are moving in the right direction on defense spending. But I will not vote for a bill that funds a Cold War-era military and approves any additional funding for the war in Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (FEDERAL GAS TAX HOLIDAY A BAD IDEA -- (House of Representatives - May 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
   One of the most disappointing turns in the current campaign has been the proposal of Senator Clinton and Senator McCain for the ``gas tax holiday.'' 
   One doesn't want to be cynical, but thinking back to Senator McCain's Straight Talk Express in the year 2000, it would be hard to imagine that he thought it was a good idea back then, that he wouldn't have stooped to this political trick. It wouldn't have been consistent with what he was saying and how he represented himself. 
   As far as Senator Clinton is concerned, we don't have to guess about her position in 2000. We know because her opponent in 2000 when she was first running for the Senate, our former colleague, Rick Lazio, called for suspending the 18.3 cent Federal gas tax and actually repealing the 4.3 cent per gallon surcharge that had been enacted. ``What Mrs. Clinton needs to do,'' he said, ``is get out of the motorcade, get out of fantasyland and get in contact with the issues that are affecting real New Yorkers, the prices at the pump.'' 
   It's instructive what then candidate Clinton had to say. She and her aides fired back immediately at Mr. Lazio for offering what they said was a shortsighted solution that could jeopardize money to fix highways. In fact, they handed out fliers that used quotes from Republican leaders to bolster her point that repealing the gas tax surcharge could be harmful. The Republicans discouraged such measures, the flier said, because they could diminish highway construction money. 
   Senator Clinton said, in debating Mr. Lazio: 
   ``We're totally reliant on the gas tax to do things like finishing I-86 in the Southern Tier, or the fast-ferry harbor works up in Rochester, as well as work we need to do here in the city. So you can count on me to support infrastructure,'' as she explained her opposition. And indeed she lashed out at the plan for the outright repeal of the 4.3 cent gas tax, calling it ``a bad deal for New York and a potential bonanza for the oil companies.'' 
   Well, the facts that Senator Clinton argued in 2000 are still true today. The timing, if anything, is worse, because for the first time in history, the Federal highway trust fund is going into deficit, and this would call for an additional reduction of $9 billion to $10 billion and 300,000 highway construction jobs. It actually is coming at a time when we should as a country be finding ways to invest more in infrastructure, not less. Virtually every independent expert acknowledges that as well as most people in the House and the Senate. 
   And, of course, the irony as Senator Clinton herself intimated is that this gas tax holiday is actually a holiday for the big producers, refiners and importers. They're the ones who pay the tax. The tax is charged to them. In order for any of the savings to trickle down to the pockets of motorists, the oil and gas interests would have to decide that they're going to pass their savings on to the rest of us. As Senator Clinton pointed out in 2000, it's a potential bonanza for them. There's no indication that they're looking to share. Look at what they did with record profits of $10.6 billion for ExxonMobil. Did they use that extra money to reduce prices at the pump? 
   The good news is that the American public is not buying this political trick. Even though they are aggravated at spiraling high gas prices and somebody is offering them, in a sense, free money, the American public sees through that. Fifty-one percent agree that it is a bad idea, even in the face of high gas prices. Even more tellingly, in the New York Times survey published yesterday, when the public was asked are politicians proposing this tax holiday because it's good for America or because it's good, they think, for the politicians, 70 percent said Clinton and McCain are doing this because it's good for the politicians, not for America. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope that we can get past the campaign silly season, that people explain to Senator McCain and Senator Clinton that their earlier opposition is more important today. This is one area ought to be beyond sort of the partisan political warfare: It is time for us to rebuild and renew America, to deal with the first deficit in the trust fund, and not play political games.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I recognize myself for 2 1/2 minutes. 
   It is not often I find myself disagreeing with my esteemed friend, the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, but I would like to briefly address his concerns. 
   As our esteemed chairman, Mr. Rangel, pointed out, this is a serious program that all agree needs a serious solution to avoid having people who lose their homes end up having their loss become a taxable event. Our legislation solves this. 
   Where I take modest exception to the ranking member and, in fact, had a rather spirited debate before the Rules Committee with Ranking Member Dreier that this is somehow a temporary problem and just requires a temporary solution, we are in a situation now where the majority would argue that there is never a good time to have people who lose their homes have that loss be a taxable event. Second, unlike the Bush administration thinks this is going to be solved in the next year or two, the fact is, in 2006, 20 percent of the first-lien mortgages were in the subprime market. 
   We are going to see exploding adjustable rate mortgages for years. Those people shouldn't have uncertainty if there are people who assume control who think that their loss should be a taxable event. 
   As it speaks to the pay-for, the Democrats have made a commitment that we are going to pay for our actions. We are not going to add to the deficit. This is an entirely appropriate pay-for. There was never an intent with the $500,000 per couple exclusion from capital gains on the sale of their homes to string these together. 
   I came to Congress committed to enacting that relief to protect them. But under the provisions that, as it has worked out, some extraordinarily wealthy people can string these together and have a $500,000 tax-free gain three times in 6 years. 
   Our amendment, our pay-for, gives everybody the protection for their principal home and allows them to get the capital gains exclusion to the extent that a second home is their principal home. It's reasonable, it's balanced, it's paid for. I urge its adoption. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to commend my colleague for the work that he has done on this measure, Mr. McCrery, and our leadership because at core there is bipartisan understanding and support for the elimination of what has been referred to as a phantom and unfair tax on the poor souls who lose their homes and who receive no net increase to them. 
   Where we have modest disagreement is in two specific areas: one, the bill that is before us recognizes that there is never a good time to tax American homeowners on this phantom benefit of having their loan forgiven on a foreclosed property. There no circumstances under which we could conceive that we wanted to penalize them for something that they didn't receive, so we made it permanent. Unlike the minority, unlike the Bush administration, we don't think there is ever a good reason to tax them on something that they don't receive. 
   Second, we're paying for the cost that is associated with it because, sadly, even a tax provision that makes no sense carries value, and under our rules, we need to pay for it. And what we did was not to implement any additional tax, but to clarify the benefit that is given to owners of principal residences that they have a $500,000 tax-free gain if they occupy that as their principal residence for 2 out of 5 years. That's something that we broadly agree upon. 
   Now, we've always agreed that that ought to occur to the homeowner. Now we're hearing that somehow our friends on the other side of the aisle think that an additional tax benefit, so that people could string this together over the course of 6 years and get $500,000 three times as a tax benefit, is somehow, some way a tax increase. It is not. The purpose of that tax provision was never to reward people who could game the system and string together tax increases two or three times over a relatively short period of time. 
   So we have clarified it: as long as it is their principal home, their principal residence, they can claim the exclusion. And to the extent that a second home, after they've gotten $500,000 tax free, the extent to which they occupy a second home for an additional period of time, they can claim the proportion that it is actually their principal residence. I would dare say that was the intent for the majority people of why that provision was implemented in the first place. It's reasonable, it's sound, and I would strongly suggest that that's why people in this industry, Realtors, mortgage bankers, homebuilders, support the bill that we brought forward. 
   I suggest that this bill is something that all of us ought to support. I strongly urge its passage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, it is estimated that, before this housing slump is over, 2 million homeowners will lose their homes due to skyrocketing interest rates on their mortgages. 
   Increased foreclosures have adverse effects on the values of neighboring properties. For example, research indicates that, for each foreclosed home in a given neighborhood, the prices of nearby homes could fall by 1 percent to 1.5 percent. 
   Nationally, housing prices have stopped rising. In fact, some measures of home prices have already declined, by more than 3 percent since the beginning of 2007. Some economists predict that real housing prices are likely to decline by more than 15 percent over the next 2 years. 
   We want to prevent thousands of Americans from getting hit by the double whammy of (1) losing their homes to foreclosure, and (2) getting slapped with a tax bill when the debt on their home is discharged by the lender. 
   Even taxpayers that restructure their mortgages to avert foreclosure face this risk of triggering large tax bills. 
   It doesn't seem right for individuals in this circumstance to face a tax bill when they really have no increase in their net worth. 
   As I see it, their house went down in value, and the individuals couldn't meet their mortgage requirements, resulting in foreclosure. The amount of the income that they would recognize without regard to this bill would be equal to or less than the decline in value of their home. So, absent this legislation, homeowners in this situation would be slapped with a tax liability for no net increase in wealth. 
   H.R. 3648 would correct that result so that if a person's principal residence lost value, that loss won't give rise to a tax liability.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. First of all, as the gentleman mentions, using the term ``promptly'' means that it is kicked back to the committee to an uncertain future. 
   This has been before the committee for some time. There is broad bipartisan support that we need to solve this problem. And I have listened to my friends, they haven't come forward with any reasonable suggestion about an alternative pay-for. They had an opportunity in the Rules Committee; they had an opportunity before the committee. If we follow their course, we're going to be in limbo, I don't know how long, but unnecessarily. 
   The minority has been interested in the past in making it temporary. That was the Bush administration's position; that's what Republicans argued before the Rules Committee. We don't want to put it back to an uncertain future. 
   The one proposal that has come forward today for a pay-for was itself a long-term revenue loser. Using a Roth-style approach to government employee accounts, I think they're 457s, is a long-term revenue drain which uses an accounting gimmick in the short term to have people pay a little tax so they save a whole lot of tax in the future. That will add to the deficit over time. 
   Now, contrary to what my distinguished friend from Virginia says, it does not disadvantage people. The exclusion for residential property for a prime residence was just that, it was to give people a $500,000 exclusion from capital gain on the sale of the property. It doesn't foreclose other people from stringing it forward to get more than $500,000. It just means the extent to which it's not your primary residence, you don't get a percentage increase above that. If it's your primary residence for one-third of that time, you get one-third of the benefit, in addition to $500,000 that you get with your first bite of the apple. It means you don't get two it means you don't get three in 6 years; you get one full bite, and then you get a percentage on top of that. It's reasonable; it's fiscally responsible. 
   I strongly urge the rejection of this proposal that puts this legislation in limbo. There is broad bipartisan support for the concept. The permanent support of a permanent nature of it is sound, the pay-for is reasonable. I urge rejection of the motion to recommit. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   President Bush is worried that it won't go to poor children because some families earning up to $83,000 a year will be eligible. 
   First of all, this is not a program for poor children, most of whom are already eligible for Medicaid. It is for children of working families, 90 percent of whom earn less than $40,000 a year. No one gets $83,000, because the Bush administration turned down one State's request. A few do have higher incomes because the States requested it and the Bush administration approved it.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy, as I appreciate what my colleague from Ohio said a moment ago. But with all due respect, I couldn't disagree with her more. 
   First of all, what is brought here today is not a NAFTA-type agreement. Bear in mind, this is being urged for approval by the Council of Textile Organizations, the Bush administration and the AFL-CIO. It is an 8-month extension for us to be able to move forward in an orderly fashion. 
   We have, in fact, heard concerns that have been voiced by our friend from Ohio and others. That's why the committee is hard at work. And I commend the leadership of Chairman Rangel and  Chairman Levin to be able to put together a framework on a bipartisan basis that speaks to those concerns. I am quite confident when we bring forward the FTAs that they are decidedly not NAFTA-type agreements. 
   I think the gentlelady is right, there are certain parts of this decision that were made beyond perhaps the chairman, but there are also two bodies that are at work. And our chairman has been working to be able to accommodate a complex set of issues going forward. 
   This 8-month extension ought to be welcomed because it will enable more concrete information to be available that I think will raise the comfort level of the gentlelady. It will certainly speak to the concerns that I have heard back home, and will underscore the hard work that this committee has been doing. 
   I respectfully suggest that the work that we're going to see, for example, with the environment in Peru, with illegal logging, with what's happening with the environmental sector, labor standards, these are going to provide a more complete package that is going to enable us to have trade, provide that two-way comfort level, and work for all concerns. 
   In the meantime, I would strongly recommend that we support this extension under an expedited process that will enable us to return to this floor with a more comprehensive approach, and that will enable us to move our entire agenda forward.

   It was my pleasure to be in Johannesburg in 2002 when sanitation was added to the Millennium Challenge Development Goal to create a comprehensive framework for the needs of the world's poorest. But I am saddened  that we are here today, still repeating those horrible statistics about over 1 billion who lack access to safe drinking water, more than 2 billion who lack access to sanitation. 
   I would only take exception to my good friend from Florida's comments a moment ago, because I have been told that a child dies needlessly every 15 seconds. But whether it is 20 seconds or 15 seconds, it is absolutely scandalous that in this day and age, when we know what to do, when for less than the price of a take-out pizza per year per family, the United States alone could be transformational on that. One reflects on what difference it would make, not just those children that wouldn't die needlessly. It would translate into over one-quarter billion additional days in school. It would save over $7 billion in unnecessary medical costs. It would allow one-third of a trillion working days for young people from age 15 to 39 worldwide. And, make no mistake about it, it makes a difference for those of us in the United States. 
   First of all, pollution any place in the world finds its way into the water supply and makes a difference for us. Make no mistake, that at a time when virtually no one in the world is more than 24 hours away from anybody else watching disease break forth unnecessarily, it is not just a tragedy in some remote village or some southern hemisphere megacity. It can make a difference for the health of Americans here and abroad. And when the CIA has identified urban instability and decay as one of the seven greatest causes of threats to our security, this compounds our problem with global unrest and terrorism. 
   I am pleased that we have been able to work together with Mr. Payne. In my prior tenure on the Foreign Affairs Committee, we passed the Water for the Poor Act in 2005 and acknowledged the late Mr. Lantos and former colleagues Leach, Hyde and Senator Frist. But we are not even fully implementing that legislation 3 years later. I commend the gentleman for his oversight hearing to help the Department of State to understand what is going to be necessary to fully implement this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are halfway through the International Year of Sanitation. It is time for us to reflect on what we are going to do about this problem. This isn't some remote goal that is beyond our capacity. Girl Scout troops, churches, synagogues and Rotary Clubs know what to do and in fact they are acting at a grassroots level to do something about it. We in Congress need to do our job supporting Mr. Payne with the accountability of the State Department.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. One of the most important things we can do is to work to transfer unnecessary military assistance. The United States is lavishing huge sums of money for military aid on countries like Egypt and Pakistan, where it is dubious in terms of the outcome of security for us or anybody else, but they have populations that are desperately in need of clean water and sanitation. We need to reorder our priorities to be able to achieve this goal. 
   Back in 2002 when we added sanitation, 2015 seemed like a long way away. Well, we are halfway there, in terms of time, but we are not halfway there in terms of accomplishment. I hope that this resolution will be a little nudge to us all to make sure that we do our part. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy and his leadership.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy as I appreciate his leadership. 
   I heard my friend from Missouri talk about the lack of connection to rural America. And I think that is, in fact, the case. And we are missing an opportunity with this farm bill to try to strengthen it because this farm bill continues to shortchange most farmers. It will fail to fund the majority of the environmental programs that go lacking. And most farmers will continue to get nothing, nothing from this bill. The richest 10 percent will get two-thirds to three-quarters of the total direct farm payments. 
   There are a number of things in this bill that I like, that I have been working for since the last farm bill to help provide some support for people who grow food, not just the five big commodities. I am glad that there is an increase in nutrition. But the reason the President should, and I think will, veto this bill has nothing to do with the good stuff. It is time to reform the farm bill, to reduce to $200,000 limit on AGI to qualify for subsidy. That is what the President is arguing for. That is the right thing to do. It is something that we ought to be able to have a bipartisan majority to support. 
   It will save the taxpayers money. It will enable us to fully fund the environmental programs that are so critical, particularly for small and medium-sized farmers and ranchers. We don't have to shortchange nutrition. The nutrition provisions ought to be strengthened with money we save from unneeded payments to the rich. 
   We have lots of money that is flowing to the richest farmers in America who don't need it. That's wrong. In fact, they have assumed that this bill is so egregious, I invite any of my colleagues to look at section 1619. The authors of the bill carve out an exemption to the Freedom of Information Act so that the recent Circuit Court ruling that would open this up to a spotlight is off limits.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy. 
   The committee has taken this bill as far as they can. There are some modest reforms, as they nibbled around the edges. But the fact is, with the passage of this bill, most farmers will still get no help. Most conservation needs will be unmet. And we are going to continue to give money to people who don't need it, up to $2.5 million of farm and unrelated farm income and as over the last 12 years, 75 percent of the direct payments went to just 10 percent of the largest farmers. We don't need to that. 
   To add insult to injury, section 1619 will hide information under the Freedom of Information Act so the American public won't even know the facts. This is wrong. We can do better. We can stop giving assistance to the richest of farmers. We can redirect it to further strengthen nutrition and the environment. 
   I strongly urge a rejection of the rule and the bill. And if the President has the fortitude to veto it, I hope people will join us in bipartisan support to sustain the veto.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, I support H.R. 2316 and 2317--bills that significantly reform the lobbyist-lawmaker relationship for the better. By opening the lobbying process to greater oversight, we will reaffirm our commitment to accountability and transparency in Congress. Although I am deeply frustrated that stronger reform measures were abandoned, I believe this pair of bills represents an essential step toward a more honest and open government. 
   Earlier this year, my colleague GREG WALDEN and I reintroduced H.R. 1136, the ``Ethics Reform Act of 2007,'' with provisions that tighten lobbyist disclosure and reporting. I am pleased to see similar provisions--such as quarterly disclosure requirements, electronic filing, and a public database of disclosure data--in H.R. 2316. 
   I am also pleased to see increased gift restrictions, tightened reporting requirements, and stiffened noncompliance penalties included in these bills. These are critical components of effective lobbying reform whose adoption will help to clearly delineate an appropriate boundary between lobbyists and lawmakers. 
   However, I must also voice a deep concern: these bills do not go far enough. The Senate easily passed--by 96-2--a more stringent bill which included stricter penalties and tighter lobbying restrictions on Members of Congress and their families. The House, in contrast, weakened the lobbyist, ``cool-off'' period in H.R. 2316. We can, and must, do better. With the leadership of Speaker PELOSI, I look forward to improving these bills in conference.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (IMPROVING FEDERAL FLOOD DISASTER POLICY -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, like the proverbial pig that has been swallowed by the python, the swollen surge of the Mississippi flood waters is slowly working its way down the river. The damage inflicted is not just to the homes, businesses and farms along the way, but it will have serious consequences for the environment at the mouth of the Mississippi, the so-called ``dead zone''--further erosion of topsoil along the length of the river while raising food prices across America and around the world. 
   The consensus of the scientific community is that extreme weather events like the heavy rainfalls are going to make episodes like this more frequent, but even if you do not agree with the scientific consensus, one thing is beyond dispute: The policies and practices of the Federal Government and of our State and local partners are not just contributing to the disaster but are themselves a disaster.  
   For generations now, along the riverbank, we have been increasing the amount of water in the mighty Mississippi River as we narrow its course and reduce its meandering ways, making it much shorter than it was at the time of the first European explorers. Weather events resulting from global warming and resulting from humans having put more water in the river, shortening its course or narrowing it, have a compounding effect. 
   In the State of Iowa, more than 90 percent of the wetlands, nature's natural sponges, have been filled. In vast sections of Iowa, there are tiles under many areas of the farmland, making it this massive plumbing project that is designed to reduce the power of the land to absorb and to retain water. By replacing native vegetation that has deep root systems, with corn and soybeans that don't, covering, some have said, as much as a third of the State, we further accelerate the runoff, and those relatively shallow root systems allow more precious topsoil to erode into the already Big Muddy, which in turn reduces the capacity of the waterways to carry water. All of these greatly enhance the impact of the flood. 
   It's not just our agriculture and land use policies that are a disaster but how we respond to the challenges posed by the river. From levee failures in New Orleans to the upper Mississippi lock and dam project, all along the Mississippi, the Corps of Engineers and its local and state political and civic leadership, at the behest of Congress, are investing in questionable navigation projects while ignoring the problems of the integrity of the existing levees. All of a sudden, it's news now that there are problems with the ability of these levees along the river system to provide needed protection. I have said on the floor of the House when we were debating the upper Mississippi lock and dam project, that there was questionable need since there is steady or even slightly declining barge traffic in the river, this project, the most expensive navigation project in history would be at the expense of protecting public safety. 
   At the end of the day, a critical part of the equation is restoring some of the natural balance so the inevitable floods can be handled as nature intended, into the surrounding fields and wetlands. This is illustrated by what happened when some of the levee failures reflooded farmland, relieved the pressure and thus reduced the magnitude of flooding downstream. This, obviously, needs to be built into the system. Yet there are cries now going out to remove land--106,000 acres of conservation reserve in Iowa. Now, this is a program that pays farmers to protect the environment and to enhance wildlife habitat and to provide a safety valve, that sponge effect. 
   Some in Congress are making serious proposals to take this land out of protection and to plant it with the very crops that will help make this situation worse. 
   I have worked for 10 years to reform our flood insurance program so that, instead of repeatedly putting people in harm's way, we use the money to relocate them or to flood-proof their properties, making them less susceptible to damage. We ought to extend flood insurance coverage so that all responsible property owners will protect themselves, and it will be a signal of the costs of living and of doing business in these risky areas. 
   As this disaster unfolds, there are actually letters circulating in the Senate that would eliminate the requirement of reform legislation for providing flood insurance inside these levees despite further proof positive that people need it. 
   The Federal Government needs to get its policies straight. Some of the vast sums we spend in the bloated farm bill should be redirected to pay farmers to restore the environment rather than to make it worse.  
   Our long-term investments should be to make people safer and slowly reduce support for repetitive flood loss, paying to protect and relocate rather than simply put them back in harm's way. Responsibility, common sense, and sustainable economic and environmental practices can help repair our disaster policies which make the events, which have occurred for centuries, worse and more expensive. 
   In so doing we make our communities more livable and our families safer, healthier and more economically secure.  
   Either way, the farmers will be paid. Doesn't it make sense to pay them to make things better? 
   I strongly suggest that it's time to increase the capacity of the land to absorb water, to get people out of harm's way and to do things in a way that's fair for us all.

   By addressing the critical issue of physician payment under Medicare through 2009, Congress will have the time to study and develop the systemic, sustainable reforms necessary to preserve patient access to physician services under Medicare. And the 18-month delay in implementation of the flawed competitive bidding program for Durable Medical Equipment, DMEPOS, allows Congress time to evaluate and improve this policy.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Chairman, I'd like to thank Representative ALCEE HASTINGS for bringing together, in his amendment, two important pieces of legislation for research funding and protection of habitat for pollinators--the bees, birds, bats and other animals and insects that help sustain more than two-thirds of the world's crop species. Pollinators are responsible for one out of every three mouthfuls of food eaten. 
   Despite the critical role that pollinators play for our food supply and ecosystem health, we are seeing disruptions of localized pollination systems and declines of certain species of pollinators on every continent except Antarctica. Populations of a variety of pollinator species have been declining in recent years due to loss of habitat, improper use of pesticides and herbicides, replacement of native plant species with non-native or engineered plants, and the introduction of non-native, invasive species, either by accident or through farming practices. 
   I'm pleased to see that this amendment places a greater emphasis in existing USDA conservation programs on habitat and other pollinator-beneficial best management practices to protect and enhance native and managed pollinators, which was the key component of H.R. 2913, which I introduced this Congress. 
   In addition, the amendment provides research funding to address Colony Collapse Disorder in honey bees places, an issue championed by my friend Mr. HASTINGS and his bill, H.R. 1709. 
   This amendment will help keep pollinator populations healthy and improve the viability of our food supply and our environment. I urge its adoption.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, there is a bipartisan instinct in Congress that has been evident for years. We all want to reform our farm policies in the ``next'' farm bill. That is why the bill that is coming forward from the Agriculture Committee couldn't find any way to reform the crop insurance program. Luckily, it looks as though the Rules Committee will make in order a rule that will force that upon the committee, saving up to 40 cents on the dollar. 
   There are no meaningful limitations on extraordinarily wealthy farmers. They talk about reform, but the limitation raises only $46 million a year from 3,175 farmers. And if the farmer can't get their adjusted gross income under $1 million, they ought to get a new CPA. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to just read some of the news accounts like this morning's Washington Post that talks about what is in this bill. And if you do, I think you will join with us in supporting the Kind-Flake amendment.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy and his hard work. 
   I witnessed for several hours yesterday the great challenges the Rules Committee faced, but I must confess that this rule puts a lot of us in a very difficult position. I am disappointed, to say the least. 
   This is not just a farm bill; it's the most important rural economic development bill, the most important trade bill, the most important opportunity to broaden the benefits for family farmers and ranchers, and the most important environmental bill that we will vote on this year. 
   Sadly, I will say at least that leadership did allow the amendment that I'm pleased to work with my friend, Mr. Kind, Mr. Flake and Mr. Ryan, the Fair amendment, to at least be heard, but it's only going to be heard for 20 minutes a side. They refused to allow debate on specific areas of meaningful reform, like the legislation that I had proposed to cap at $250,000 an absolute limit. I think it's a serious miscalculation. 
   This bill deserves to be fully and fairly debated. Now, I almost said I fear that minority voices would be shut out. But it's not the minority of Americans who share the views and objectives that it's time for meaningful reform. Because of the complexity, the misinformation and the powerful special interests that are involved here, it means that this shot that we have, our one shot for the next 5 years, is critical. 
   Sadly, there is always an excuse to not do all that we can do. Coddling cotton multimillionaires while talking big and delivering modestly is a failure of political will. 
   I hope at least my colleagues will vote for the Fair amendment. And I hope that the debate, as it proceeds, will be administered as fairly and as openly as possible to allow as many voices to be heard as we can ask.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy. I appreciate his leadership. Along with our friend from Arizona and from Wisconsin, we have before you a real opportunity to make a difference. 
   Now, my heart goes out to the committee. They had a tough job. They went, I think, as far as they could, given the dynamics they had. Some of the things they did I strongly support and, in fact, have worked for. Those good items are now all protected under our initiative. In fact, many of them are actually enhanced.     
   They are enhanced not by throwing money at it, but by actually having real reform; not talking about reform, not moving towards reform, but actually doing it. Our bipartisan amendment is paid for, and it does so by helping most farmers. 
   My State of Oregon is an example. Under this initiative, we will gain more than $140 million in every congressional district over the life of this effort. We do this not by new taxes and new programs; we change the dynamic. No longer will 80 percent of America's farmers and ranchers get little or nothing. No longer will we have, in this case, a sham, I'm sorry to say, payment limitation that will only affect one-tenth of a percent of America's farmers, those who are at $1 million, it will only save $45 million, which shows you that it doesn't have much impact. 
   I would say that any farmer who can't get their adjusted gross income under $1 million probably needs to look for a new CPA, not a new subsidy. We stop the lunacy in a time of record high corn prices. We are going to give them 10 more billion dollars. If we don't give them 10 more billion dollars in a time of record high corn prices, we are going to shred the safety net? I would argue, not. Have a real limit, help the budget, and, most important, help America's family farmers. 
   Pass this amendment.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I again appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy, as I appreciate her leadership on this, and that of my friend, Mr. Olver. 
   There is a difference between flexibility in green building standards and gutting the provision altogether. Having green building standards should not be merely one factor that is considered, as will be proposed by the gentlewoman's amendment later in the game. The manager's amendment provides flexibility and allows the Secretary to deal with compliance. It does not have strict LEED certification, but still retains that environmental green building standard. Frankly, the notion that we just dismiss this as merely one factor to be considered is going to be regarded in the years to come as an embarrassingly shortsighted proposal. 
   As I mentioned earlier in the debate we in Portland used HOPE VI to create an environmentally-sensitive community that actually provided twice as many housing units as had been on the site before, using HOPE VI as an anchor for more investment and as a development model. The provisions that are in the underlying bill and the manager's amendment will provide more environmentally-sensitive construction and, frankly, the costs are going to be recovered in relatively short order, as my friend from Massachusetts pointed out, in savings, not just from energy, but also water and sewer as well. 
   These costs are going up exponentially over time. Having this wired into the HOPE VI provision means that it is a better investment for the community and a better investment for the Federal Government. It's going to save the Federal Government and the tenants money over the long haul. There is absolutely no reason to water it down. 
   I strongly urge approval of the manager's amendment and rejection of the subsequent amendment.

Mr. Speaker, I find it somewhat amusing listening to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle fulminating against the notion that we would allow Delegates to participate in our deliberations of the Committee of the Whole. Obviously the people either haven't read the proposal, or they don't care about what the content is, because these are duly elected representatives that we are proposing to be able to enter into efforts only under operation as Committee of the Whole. While they are signaling their intent, how they would vote, that if at any point they provide the margin that would change the outcome, we provided for a revote. So we are protecting the integrity of the House, it is just when we are operating in the Committee of the Whole, and it is to give voice, for example, to the Republican Delegate from Puerto Rico who represents 4 million people who do pay taxes, who fight in our wars; Delegate ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, who represents full tax-paying citizens of the District of Columbia who have been disenfranchised. In effect we have a tax-paying colony of United States citizens. That is our Nation's capital. It is shameful that ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON hasn't been extended full voting status, but we will work on that ultimately by changing the Constitution. 
   Until that day comes, this represents a reasonable compromise to give voice to the men and women who are Delegates, who play an important role, including Puerto Rico, a Republican Delegate, and ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, who represents American citizens disenfranchised in the District. 
   Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today on a somewhat lighter note. While we are dealing with affairs of state, we are going to hear partisan bickering back and forth. We are going to be dealing with major issues or war and peace and global warming. We also have an opportunity this week to reinstitute a tradition that continues to unify and uplift Congress, and I am speaking about bike-partisanship. The last 15 years have signaled a renaissance in cycling--the feats of Greg LaMond and Lance Armstrong in the Tour de France; Americans using over a hundred million bicycles around the country; the landmark ISTEA legislation reauthorizing the Surface Transportation Act that since 1991 has directed $8 billion to biking and walking and trail activities, $4.5 billion in the last bill alone, another record. 
   We are working for ways to enhance the status of people who burn calories, not oil, people who take up less space on congested roadways, do not contribute to air pollution, and simplify the parking problems faced by more Americans. 
   It is not just better for the cyclists, but it is better for the motorists who don't have the cyclists competing with them. It is better for the health of Americans. We know that we are dealing with an issue of obesity in America, a lack of exercise. Think right now how many Americans are stuck in traffic on their way to ride an exercise bike at a health club. 
   Well, we have an opportunity, Mr. Speaker, by enlisting friends on both sides of the aisle to rejoin the Congressional Bicycle Caucus. I strongly urge that my colleagues respond to the invitation that is going out today along with my co-chairman, Tom Petri, a great member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, to join with us. Last session we had over 160 bike-partisan members from both parties who dealt with issues of transportation. We have done activities that involve members and staff and family. We urge fellow members to sign up now to be ready for the hundreds of cyclists that will join us for the annual Bicycle Summit in March. This is one activity that brings us together that all people can benefit from, and they will be entitled to their membership pin in the Congressional Bicycle Caucus. 
   I strongly urge that we take these steps for a healthier America, for an environmentally sensitive America, for an America where children can get to school safely on their own, and that we are able to live a little lighter on the land.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased that the Democratic majority has taken a thoughtful and bipartisan approach to this year's Intelligence Authorization bill. I have expressed my concerns about the health of our intelligence community and appreciate the work that has been done to strengthen the Inspector General, increase contractor oversight, and invest in the training of our operatives. 
   However, I am deeply troubled that this bill does not contain a prohibition on torture, which I believe is absolutely critical. Torture violates not only the laws and values of our country, but all standards of decent human conduct. I have consistently spoken out against the stonewalling and equivocation surrounding this administration's ``interrogation'' of detainees. I find it appalling that it has fallen solely to the legislative and judicial branches to set interrogation and detention standards worthy of our Nation. 
   Yet I remain hopeful that the abuses of this administration will be checked by wise and thoughtful policy. I applauded the recent ``Boumediene v. Bush'' Supreme Court ruling that guarantees Guantanamo Bay detainees the right of habeas corpus. Further, I believe that extending the rules of the Army Field Manual to U.S. intelligence personnel sends a clear signal that we have broken with and are rolling back the abuses of this administration. 
   I support a great deal of what this bill includes, yet my greatest concern is with what this bill omits. It is my hope that Congress will  come together in conference to send a message to this administration and the world at large that Americans do not approve of, and will not stand for, torture.

One that, unfortunately, will be suspiciously absent is the topic of a conference that is taking place just across the Potomac River, the third National Dialogue on Water Resources. Yet there is nothing that is more important than the discussion about water. Indeed, if you are talking about war and peace, climate change and health care, they are all directly related. 
   Water is not just a potential source of conflict, but of conflict resolution. You can actually measure water flows in quality. If the Israelies and the Palestinians can solve their water issues, who knows where it could lead. 
   Health. One-half the people in the world today who are sick are sick due to water-borne disease, almost all of which is preventable. 
   Global warming. We are concerned about global warming because of the impacts that are directly water-related: rising ocean levels, coastal erosion, storm surges, disappearing snow pack and polar ice, flooding, rainstorms; too much water too little water in the wrong places at the wrong time. Global warming is all about water. 
   It is my hope that regardless of what is discussed in the State of the Union and thereafter, that we can add this subject to the top of the list of the 110th Congress, to work with the administration and people on both sides of the aisle to build on one of the few areas of bipartisan progress that we have seen in the recent toxic atmosphere on the House floor. 
   In the 108th Congress, we were able to work to reform the flood insurance programs, before Katrina. In the 109th Congress, we had the landmark Water For the Poor Act that I was able to work on with Republicans Henry Hyde and Senator Bill Frist. 
   There are some simple steps that we can take now. I hope that Chair LOWEY and Ranking Member WOLF will fund our international water and sanitation commitments. I hope that out of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee we will update the hopelessly outmoded Corps of Engineers water principles and guidelines that are over a quarter century old and lead to bad decisions. I hope that we can continue Chair FRANK's commitment to further flood insurance reform. 
   Others are going to take more of a lift, but we can use water supply and quality in the farm bill to pay farmers to do the right thing and make a profound difference on water around the country. We can shift our frame of reference to deal with basin-wide water management; and we can use the huge value implicit in water resources to fund our crying needs. 
   At core, Madam Speaker, it is time for us to match our policies on where the water comes from, which date back to the beginning of our country and were basically frozen in place by 1950, to overlap with our water quality and environmental and health protections which have been developed largely since that time. 
   Money is actually less of a problem because, while water is priceless, we are doing silly things with it; for example, subsidizing people to grow cotton in the desert. When we have an era where for bottled water, some people are paying up to $8 a gallon or more, we are paying more than gasoline or cheap wine, there are ways that we can tap into that value. We spend too much on uncoordinated infrastructure investments with inappropriate pricing, poor planning and incremental fragmented management. 
   We have the possibility to refine those partnerships, both public and private, to bring together the Federal agencies, even Congress itself, to limit our stovepipe mentality with fewer subcommittees and more policy management. It is not really that hard. College students, farmers, local government officials, Girl Scouts and church youth groups understand these basic principles after the most basic of study. It is time for the rest of the players to catch up with them, and I hope starting with the 110th Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy in extending time. 
   I, too, am perplexed by the debate that is being advanced in terms of being able to focus on the national security implications of the threat of global warming. I sat on the committee, the Special Committee on Global Warming and Energy Independence, as we listened to three and four star admirals and generals, as we listened to the former head of the CIA talking about the defense implications for the United States of Global Warming. 
   These men were not radical environmentalists. These are respected experts who have led a lifetime of service to protecting the integrity, the defense, the security of the United States. They are deeply concerned that our dependence on foreign oil from unstable areas of the world. The overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change, global warming is a reality, led them to argue in the most strong terms that we need to be serious about it. Item after item, about the strategic implications, about what happens to defenses of the United States, to instability around the world of water-stressed areas, to new disease patterns, these are not arcane, philosophical issues. This isn't environmental fringe. This is the nuts, and bolts of the future, of our country. 
   It has already been made clear that we already have a great deal of work that is underway. What this would require is assembling it under the guise and guidance of people who are experts in national security to put it in the national security context. 
   Other major countries around the world are grappling with this. I think the Rules Committee was entirely appropriate to put what I think is a misguided amendment on the floor because I think it is time for people who care about the future of the country, who are looking at the evidence, to have an honest and thoughtful debate. 
   But to somehow dismiss this as the province of radical environmentalism or a detraction from the hard work of planning for America's security future is, I think, sadly misplaced. 
   I appreciate what the Rules Committee has done. I support the rule and look forward to the debate later.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take up where my good friend from Minnesota left off in terms of dealing with the money that is in this legislation that would help us deal with the crisis that is occurring in our Nation's forests. 
   One of the legacies, unfortunately, of the last Congress where we had a meltdown of the budget process is that these issues were left unresolved. We have eviscerated the budgets for the Department of the Interior, shifting money out of operating budgets for purposes of firefighting. This is going to help us move back in the right direction. 
   One of the other casualties was the county payments program. In the last session, the implosion of the budget process where the Republican majority and the administration could not follow through, left 4,600 school districts across the west, including a number in my State in Oregon in a lurch. 
   This legislation steps up and meets the needs. It is not extraneous. I sincerely hope the President changes his tune and withdraws his veto threat.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlelady's courtesy in permitting me to speak on this rule and on this bill. 
   I further appreciate what this represents. It has been my privilege to serve for the last 10 years on the Water Resources Subcommittee for Transportation and Infrastructure. Over that period of time, I have watched as we have focused legislation to deal with the amazing needs that face water resources around the country. 
   Unfortunately, the legislation that we have passed through this House with strong support in recent Congresses has never been able to find its way into law. I think that with this legislation, we are able to find a way to help break the impasse. 
   I would like to speak to one of the elements that was in that legislation that has been made in order by the Rules Committee, an amendment that I am offering along with my colleagues Peter Welch and Tom Petri to help bring the Corps of Engineers into the 21st century by updating the principles and guidelines under which it operates. 
   Our amendment takes a step back from the politics and controversies that have surrounded the Corps' activities over recent years. In fact, there has been some finger-pointing at the Corps, but frankly, Congress itself is part of the problem and can be part of a process that can help move this forward. 
   These principles and guidelines are used for the formulation, evaluation, and implementation of water resources projects. The current rules under which the Corps operates have not been updated since 1983. It seems hard to believe, given how important water resources are and how much we have learned about the science, about hydrology since 1983. 
   Think about it for a moment. In 1983, Ronald Reagan was President. We were dealing with the movie ``Return of the Jedi.'' A year later, the 3.5-inch floppy disk was introduced, and IBM was soon to launch the first portable computer which weighed 30 pounds. Half the people who work for me in my congressional office weren't even born in 1983. 
   Every Member of the House is aware how much has changed since 1983 in terms of technology, science, environmental policy, our national priorities, and our understanding of water resources. Yet, the Corps of Engineers and the thousands of dedicated men and women who work for them have a planning process that has not kept up. 
   It was my privilege with the former head of the Corps, General Flowers, to meet with representatives of all of the planning agencies for the Corps across the country. They understand the problems; they are striving to make some adjustments. We are still developing projects, yet they are still working under an umbrella that was based on principles and guidelines when James Watt was Secretary of the Interior. 
   This amendment is very simple. It directs the Secretary of the Army to update the principles and guidelines in consultation with all the other Federal agencies that have a stake in the process, to work with the public to deal with what we have learned over the last quarter of a century.  
   This is a very important step on addressing criticisms from the National Academy of Sciences, the OMB, the Government Accountability Office, and others. It does not impact any project that currently is approved or under way, none of the projects that are listed in the bill we have before us, but it is going to help us change the process to get at the root of a long-term problem. 
   Passing the amendment will not delay any projects or tie the hands of the Corps in any way. In fact, I am convinced that it will break the paralysis for projects in the future by making sure they are structurally, fiscally, and environmentally sound. 
   There are some projects around the country that have been delayed in recent years due not just to funding, although that is a serious issue, but due to lawsuits and other controversy. The ones that I have looked at that have met bumps in the road were in this situation in the main because they weren't properly planned and ground-truthed, as they say; and they have stirred up unnecessary controversy in some instances. 
   This amendment will make it easier to approve and construct good projects in the future. This amendment will make it easier for the House and the Senate, which in the past have been at loggerheads over principles of Corps reform. I think this is an area of common ground that will bring people together. This amendment represents a fresh break. It won't solve all of the problems of the Corps, that will await another day; but with this amendment, it gives us a chance at a new beginning for Congress to be positively involved in these issues. 
   We start by equipping the Corps with the latest science and analytic tools to bring them into the 21st century rather than tying their hands with out-of-date policies. 
   I strongly urge that each of my colleagues join with me in supporting our amendment, which is endorsed by Clean Water Action, Taxpayers for Commonsense, Republicans for Environmental Protection, the National Audubon Society, Friends of the Earth, American Rivers, the National Wildlife Federation, Environmental Defense, the League of Conservation Voters, the American Society of Civil Engineers, the people who are charged with making these projects work. 
   I deeply appreciate the progress that this represents in bringing us forward. I appreciate the Rules Committee making it in order, and look forward to being able to carry this amendment to the floor, hopefully for its approval, and being able to break the impasse surrounding water resources projects. 
   In the aftermath of the tragedy we saw with Hurricane Katrina, with the flooding that has occurred in the Northeast just in recent days, this legislation is more important than ever.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy, and I am proud of the time that I was able to work with you for 10 years on this subcommittee. 
   I rise in support of the bill. As was referenced by the Chair of the committee and the subcommittee, this is an important and complex bill with 682 projects. They are important economically. They are important environmentally. We found out less than 2 years ago how critical they are to the Nation. Hurricane Katrina revealed it can literally be a matter of life or death. 
   This legislation has been hung up since the year 2000, in part because of disagreements about the reform agenda with the Corps of Engineers. I am pleased that we have signaled an effort to try and move forward, to be able to break that impasse with this legislation, the provisions in it and others that will follow. 
   I am also pleased to have an opportunity to offer an amendment to update the principles and guidelines that would help the Corps move even closer to developing environmentally, fiscally, and structurally sound projects. 
   Let me be clear. The amendment will not impact any project currently under way or anything covered in this legislation. It would simply tell the Corps of Engineers to update their own principles and guidelines, the playbook for developing water resources projects that are over 25 years old. The National Academy of Sciences has said they are woefully out of date. And the Corps and the Congress' inability to update these principles and guidelines is one of the reasons why the Corps has drawn criticism from the Government Accountability Office, the National Academy of Sciences, and the OMB, along with internal Pentagon reviews. 
   It is one of the reasons why we have had trouble passing WRDA in the last 6 years and reconciling it with the Senate which has similar provisions. It does not affect anything in the bill currently; and I think it will be an opportunity for us not just passing the bill, but it would be a reason for the President to sign it, given the problems they have had. 
   I appreciate the hard work that has been done. I appreciate the opportunity to speak in support of the bill, and look forward to having support for the amendment for updating the principles and guidelines later in the afternoon.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, this amendment simply requires the Secretary of the Army to update the principles and guidelines used by the Army Corps of Engineers in formulating, evaluating, and implementing water resource projects. As I said on the floor earlier today, they have not been updated since 1983. It is embarrassing that the Corps is operating under guidance a quarter century old. 
   We have learned a lot in the last 25 months, as I look to my colleague from Louisiana, about Katrina and others in  terms of the Corps. Imagine how things have changed in the last 25 years. 
   Under this amendment, the Army Secretary would incorporate the latest scientific and economic knowledge, eliminate biases and disincentives, would be required to consult with the public and other Federal agencies while updating the principles and guidelines. 
   I want to be clear about what it would not do. It would not impact any project already underway or impact any project that is in the bill that has been created here today. It would not prevent the Corps from doing structural projects and would not delay any projects at all. It is why it is supported by the American Society of Civil Engineers, the professionals who actually do the work, taxpayer organizations, and environmental groups. 
   The National Academy of Sciences in a report from the year 2000 pointed out that the current principles and guidelines were state-of-the-art thinking when it was written, and some of the concepts and paradigms that underpin it are relevant today. However, in over 20 years since it has been updated and revised, it needs to be revised to reflect contemporary management paradigms; analytical methods; legislative directives; social, economic, and political realities. 
   I deeply appreciate the work with the committee's staff, the Chair and subcommittee Chair in getting this to this point.

   I deeply appreciate the words of support that have been offered here by my colleague from Wisconsin (Mr. Petri); from my distinguished chairman, Mr. Oberstar; and from the former ranking member of the Water Resources Committee, Mr. Costello. 
   I want to be clear that what was offered up by my friend, the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee, in no way undermines what I said. These principles and guidelines have not been updated. There are procedures and circulars discussed by the gentlemen from LA. They have not been incorporated into an updated, revised principle and guideline for the Corps of Engineers. 
   That is why the National Academy of Public Administration, one of the many scientific organizations to recommend updating the principles and guidelines, they released their recommendation after the circular that the gentleman from Louisiana mentioned. His information simply is not current in terms of how the Corps is operating and all the independent bodies, the Science Board, the public administrators, why the American Engineering Association, as well as taxpayers and environmental groups say it is past time to fix this situation. 
   For those of you who care about getting something actually through Congress, you ought to support this amendment. One of the hang-ups between the House and the Senate has been this issue of reform. The Senate has stronger language than this. I think it will help bridge the gap. I urge its adoption.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I voted to support H.R. 7321, the Auto Industry Financing and Restructuring Act, having determined that it was the best compromise given the current circumstances. I supported the restructuring because it meets the standards that I used in voting on previous bailout proposals. First, this is a relatively small sum compared to the trillions that have been devoted to stabilizing the financial industry. Second, the taxpayer is protected by the smaller sums and stricter controls employed in these loans. Finally, unlike the financial services industry, this legislation offers a lifeline to people making a real product. 
   Unfortunately, that real product is not of the nature and quality that Americans need and demand. The auto industry leadership is ultimately responsible for their failure. New management should be put into place, along with a new direction. It is paramount that Congress takes this opportunity to move the domestic auto industry towards greater environmental sustainability. Providing resources and direction to the automakers to accelerate the development of fuel efficient vehicles and other environmental technologies will improve the position of those companies to meet future market demands. 
   There is no doubt that a serious change in direction and downsizing is necessary. There will be significant management and labor concessions. This proposal will allow the United States to see the automakers' survival is possible. If the industry cannot follow through on their promises to rebuild and restructure, it is very unlikely that I will be supportive of subsequent efforts. This is their chance to demonstrate that they can and will make significant changes in a new and better direction. 
   Finally, I am pleased that the legislation includes a provision that protects transit agencies from the consequences of the collapse of insurer American International Group Inc. (AIG), which guaranteed many lease agreements that transit agencies entered into to pay for buses, trains and other equipment in the 1990s. During a year of record ridership, our transit agencies need these resources. For example, the transit provider in my district, Tri-Met, is reporting a 5.47 percent year to date growth in ridership--a substantial figure for such a mature transit agency. Without this provision, Tri-Met could face the loss of $200 million in FTA-approved financing.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, my Republican friends are shocked, shocked that a tax that they have ignored for 7 years is suddenly going to come into effect. Mr. Neal, Mr. Rangel, and others on our side of the aisle have been claiming this for years. Instead of specious tax cuts for a few, let's deal with the real meaningful problem: they ignored it. The red line that my friend Mr. Ryan had on his chart is the red line that is assumed by the Republican administration to justify their budget. 
   This proposal is not a tax increase. Over the next 10 years there will be exactly the same amount of money collected by the Federal Government. What is different is that there are three provisions that most Americans would say are modest technical provisions, including adjustments to carried interest rates. In exchange for that we will protect 23 million middle-class families from paying the AMT; provide 30 million homeowners with property tax relief; help 12 million children, by expanding the child tax credit; benefit 11 million families through the State and local tax deduction. That is the difference and that is why you should vote for it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy, and I couldn't agree with him more. For 12 years, our Republican friends in Congress looked the other way at this looming tax tsunami that was going to engulf every middle-income family in America with two incomes and raising their kids. They watched as the alternative minimum tax enacted in 1969 to deal with less than 200 people who didn't pay any Federal tax at all morphed into a tax which, next year, if we don't pass legislation like this, is going to subject every middle-income family with two earners with children to the alternative minimum tax, penalizing them, not for tax dodges, but for paying their taxes, for investing in retirement and charitable contributions. 
   We are dealing with this responsibly. Instead of borrowing the money, we are paying for this tax relief. We are doing it, in part, with a tax reform so that people who drive hedge fund managers to work or answer their phones will no longer be paying tax rates twice what the people who are making, not millions, not tens of millions but, in some cases, hundreds of millions of dollars a year. 
   This is a choice about priorities. My Republican friends for years have chosen to avoid the alternative minimum tax with a wide array of tax breaks. There are a few that they are talking about that we are perfectly willing to work with and extend that deal with the tax needs of working American families. We will extend them without debate, but the more elaborate, the more expensive, the ones that are concentrated for a few are going to be looked at, like carried interest for hedge fund managers. 
   We are not going to be held hostage to President Bush who used the alternative minimum tax revenues as a way to disguise the true cost of his tax-cut schemes that have helped increase the deficit and are going to be exploding in the years in the future. They had a chance to adjust it, and they didn't. This is a deliberate decision on the part of the Republicans in Congress for the last 12 years to avoid dealing with the consequences of their tax cut proposals. 
   In fact, they are the ones who scheduled them so they would be expiring at different times over the next few years, in part because the bond markets would have gone crazy if those would have been made permanent at the time and all the revenue lost, so they disguised it. Now they are paying the consequences for their sleight of hand having them go out into the future. 
   We are going to be looking at each and every one of them: do we have to have tax breaks for Paris Hilton or Warren Buffett that even Warren Buffett doesn't want because he has made billions, in some cases, on money that wasn't taxed in the first place. 
   This is an opportunity for Congress to start acting responsibly, making some needed tax reform, and to be able to show the American public that we are going to deal with the problems for tens of millions of Americans, and we are not going to continue to do it on the backs of interest that will be paid by our children for decades to come and special preventions for people who frankly should be paying the same tax rates as the rest of us.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the hard work put in by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers. For the past year we've participated in substantial and sometimes heated debate on the issue of surveillance and foreign intelligence. I appreciate the good faith efforts of our leadership, particularly Mr. HOYER, as we try to craft legislation that keeps both our liberties and our persons safe. 
   For the past seven years I have been highly critical of Republican wiretapping legislation. I voted against past efforts to expand this administration's ability to intrude in the lives of unknowing and innocent Americans. I supported the expiration of the disgraceful Protect America Act. And I remain confident that the dedicated members of the intelligence community do not need to violate the rights of Americans in order to protect them. 
   I have heard some say that the enemies of America take on many forms. To them I say: Let us be sure one of those forms is not our own government. 
   Ultimately this is a compromise that falls short. Any gains in security that may be achieved are temporary and are more than outweighed by the longer-term loss of civil liberties and oversight. Although this bill is comparatively better than the Senate's version, I am troubled by the lack of robust government oversight, the absence of meaningful court review, and the risk to American liberties. 
   Of particular concern is the granting of de facto retroactive immunity to the telecommunications companies that cooperated with the administration. A `doctor's note' from the Attorney General cannot be allowed to circumvent the entire judicial process. 
   I am equally concerned with the timeline of this bill, and strongly oppose authorizing this legislation for four years. This will extend the Bush legacy throughout the next administration and the next two sessions of Congress. Frankly I see no reason to rush into a compromise that comes up this short. The American people would be better served if we continued to debate this issue and took up a bill after we have seen the last of this administration. Americans demand and deserve protection of their basic civil rights and this can be accomplished while providing the means necessary for our intelligence community to do its job.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy. 
   You can hear the drumbeat from our friends on the other side of the aisle about the largest tax increase in American history. Well, the fact is we are today going to be able to talk about the largest tax increase in American history, but it is not contained in the Democratic budget. The largest tax increase in American history is $1.8 trillion that the President's budget anticipates as a result of the collection of the alternative minimum tax. 
   It has never been a priority of the Republicans to deal with this looming disaster. Indeed, they squandered 8 years of hard-earned Democratic surpluses, unprecedented surpluses, squandered in a heartbeat in their relentless pursuit to give tax benefits for those who need them least. 
   There are a few items in there that would have broad bipartisan agreement, the 10 percent bracket, tax credit for families, making some reasonable adjustment in the inheritance tax. But no, they were not interested in dealing with areas of agreement and then solving the alternative minimum tax. Each year, they have kicked the millionaire tax down the road. It has long since morphed into something that is not a millionaire's tax. It is going to be a tax under the President's proposal, and with the Republican priorities, it is going to be a tax on every two-income working family in America with children that have any sort of middle income. 
   They are going to be paying the alternative minimum tax. And in fact, it is going to cost them more to compute in many cases than the actual tax. They get whacked twice. 
   In 2001, in 2003, the Republicans refused to deal with this looming challenge and instead gave all sorts of tax breaks to all sorts of people and avoided solving this problem. 
   In 2004, when we had a $4 billion problem with our overseas manufacturing tax credit, that morphed into a $137 billion tax grab bag and ignored the alternative minimum tax. I put forth to the administration in our hearings in both Ways and Means and in Budget to find out where their priority was. Well, their priority is not fixing the alternative minimum tax, just a 1-year patch. They want to extend all of these tax breaks, the good and, frankly, some of the bizarre, for people like Paris Hilton. 
   Well, Madam Speaker, the Democratic alternative is focusing on what the real problem is. What we are doing in Ways and Means, we have made a commitment. Our number one priority is to solve the alternative minimum tax. Theirs, as is evidenced in their substitute, is going to take all of the potential headroom to make that challenge in solving the problem even more difficult by permanently extending all of those tax increases without any offset. 
   The Democratic alternative is responsible, it speaks to the needs of working men and women, fiscal stability, and most important, our priorities stopping the looming tax tsunami of the alternative minimum tax, which will, in fact, be the largest tax increase in American history.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy and I appreciate his calling the attention, if not to our Republican friends, but to the American public, that they can look at page four in the resolution that is before us and find what has been said is simply not true. 
   Additionally, they can keep thumbing to page 46, which deals with what our policy is, in fact. Because we do want to minimize the impact on middle America. We make it clear that we are very interested in terms of being able to support extensions, the extension of the child tax credit, the extension of the marriage penalty relief and the extension of the 10 percent individual income tax. What we are not interested in doing is buying into the grab bag of special interest tax benefits, most of which flow to the Americans who are most well off. 
   I want, if I could, to just make one point in terms of talk of the largest tax increase in American history. Well, it's coming. There is a tax tsunami that is bearing down not just on the rich, not just on the upper middle class, but on middle America, and it is called the ``alternative minimum tax.'' 
   For 6 years, Republicans in charge have had an opportunity to rebalance tax priorities in this country. My colleagues and I have called upon them to deal with permanent adjustment to the alternative minimum tax. They have refused. So now we have inherited a serious problem that is going to mean that middle America is facing the alternative minimum tax. Twenty-six million American families, 89 percent of people who earn between $75,000 and $100,000 will pay the AMT by 2010. Stopping this increase is our priority, that is what we are going to focus on, that is what we have committed to, that is what we are going to do, something that the Republican majority have failed to do in 2001, 2003, 2004.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. And I appreciate the gentleman's pointing the Concord Coalition that makes it clear that it does not call for or require a tax increase and the type of mindset we are getting from our friends on the other side that they would dismiss former Senator Warren Rudman, Republican from New Hampshire, establishing a left-wing think tank.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy. 
   I was just taken aback when I heard one of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I think from South Carolina, talk about the concern they have about being, that they weren't big spenders enough. Well, what we have seen under Republican control, where they had the executive and both branches, the spending has skyrocketed. In fact, we saw essays from Republican conservative pundits saying that probably they should have lost in the last election because they have lost control of the budget process. The greatest increase since the Great Society. 
   I think it is important to go back and look at their record. When they had complete control, spending was out of control, and the most conservative pundits said so. The facts reveal it. They may try and run away from their record at this point by attacking a balanced budget, pay-as-you-go, and focus on priorities that the American public supports, but their record does not support the assertion.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, what we are hearing this evening almost gives hypocrisy a bad name. We have our friends on the other side of the aisle somehow chastising us for not doing enough on entitlement reform when they have had 6 years of being in control. We have a situation, in spite of their collapse of the budget process last year, they couldn't put it together, collapse of the appropriations process and, quoting from the Heritage Foundation, that they presided over one of the largest run-ups in spending in American history. They somehow are looking at our budget and thinking that it is wanting. 
   Well, through their warped prism, I can understand that. Their top priority is not dealing with the tsunami of the alternative minimum tax, which they have ignored for the last 6 years, but to put $1 trillion in the hands of the top 1 percent over the next 10 years with their tax priorities. 
   As my friend Mr. Allen pointed out, this is about priorities. And, for the first time in 6 years, we are going to reverse their negative priorities dealing with the environment, one of the few areas that they could control spending. Now, bear in mind, these are the folks that gave us the rainforest in Iowa which they are now concerned about, the Bridge to Nowhere.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the advice of the Chair. 
   They cut spending for the environment, the 300 section, 16 percent; and under the leadership of Mr. Spratt and the Democrats, we are reversing it. We can't deal with all their problems in just one year, but we are making a good start with over $2.5 billion to deal with the Land and Water Conservation Fund, dealing with cleaning up of superfund sites and toxic waste. 
   But look at the details of what they offer in their alternative later. Mr. Ryan has suggested almost $19 billion of reductions in ag, transportation, and  natural resources. These are conservation, these are clean water, these are environmental protection. The contrast could not be more stark. 
   We are investing in America's environmental future. They, if their alternative were adopted, would continue the deterioration, the disinvestment, the attack on America's priorities. I would respectfully suggest that this alone ought to be a compelling argument to reject their alternative offered later and to adopt the Democratic proposal that is before us this evening.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, it is a pleasure for me to rise dealing with the underlying legislation that contains an important section to address barriers that might limit the start of and adherence to treatment services. This section also encourages direct linkages between the efforts to treat HIV/AIDS, nutrition and income security programs. 
   I applaud the chairman and ranking member for the work that they have done bringing this together, and the recognition that dealing with HIV-AIDS must be done in a holistic fashion that treats the entire person and their environment, not just the disease. 
   I have a very personal connection to this legislation now that was not present when I first started working on issues of water for the poor now that I have a daughter working in Mozambique in the Peace Corps who is dealing with these problems on a day-to-day basis. 
   This direct amendment would add safe drinking water to nutrition and income security on the list of programs for which direct linkages are encouraged. This is an important tribute to our late colleagues, Chairman Lantos and Chairman Hyde, who were so instrumental in the enactment of our Water for the Poor Act, and their insights that are bringing safe drinking is an important component of developmental sectors from health to the environment. To include safe drinking water in legislation through which we honor their memories is a small testament to their lasting legacies. 
   Including safe drinking water is critical because we cannot treat HIV/AIDS without safe drinking water. USAID has recognized in its guidance for missions carrying out these programs that people with HIV/AIDS are at increased risk for diarrheal diseases and far more likely to suffer severe and chronic complications if infected. 
   There is terrible irony in providing patients with advanced antiretroviral agents, and then asking them to use the water in a glass that may infect them with a life-threatening illness to wash down the life-saving pills. 
   To add irony, one of the complications of diarrheal illnesses is HIV-infected patients have a reduced ability to absorb antiretroviral and other medications from the gut. This poor absorption can contribute to the development of HIV strains that are resistant. In addition to the negative impact on life expectancy and quality of life, they also add significantly to the burdens on caregivers in clinics and at home and put them and other family members at risk for infection. 
   We are all a part of this in the global community. This legislation is important to tie these challenges together, not deal with it piecemeal, and to help with advancing the overall objective of this legislation. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I would like to express my deep appreciation to Chairman Payne. I appreciate the ranking member yielding time to him. I was prepared to do so, but she was able to give him more time, and that is important. 
   Congressman Payne, your laser-like focus on this with the subcommittee, your long-term advocacy, your work on the continent, is something that I find inspirational. I look forward to working with you and partnering on these issues as we move forward. 
   To the Chair and ranking member, your willingness to include this is important, and our work together to be able to focus on the whole person and to be able to deal with waterborne disease, the number one preventible cause of death and disease around the world. Half the people who are sick today anywhere in the world are sick needlessly from water-borne disease. Adding this critical amendment to your important legislation is an important step forward. I hope it is just one step that we can work on together to bring people around the world to support this critical priority. 
   As I say, I can think of no more fitting tribute to your previous predecessors as Chair of the committee, Congressman Hyde and Congressman Lantos, who worked so hard to advance this cause. I urge adoption of this amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3021, 21ST CENTURY GREEN HIGH-PERFORMING PUBLIC SCHOOL FACILITIES ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentlelady's courtesy in permitting me to speak on the bill, the work that is done by the Rules Committee in bringing this legislation before us. I am enthusiastically supportive of the rule and the underlying bill. 
   An opportunity to integrate sustainability into the neighborhood school, the building block of communities, is a double win. In the long run, this is going to save significant amounts of money at a time of skyrocketing energy prices. And the evidence is that at the green schools I've seen in my community, there's actually better performance. There's better performance on the part of the students, higher job satisfaction with the staff, and as I have seen in communities around the country where these principles are integrated into the school construction, it is a valuable learning experience for the children themselves. 
   I am particularly pleased in elements dealing with the transportation, allowing some of the facilities work to be done to help our children get to school safely on foot or cycling.     
   In 1969, so long ago that I was still in school, over half of America's children were able to get to school on their own walking or biking. By 2001, that percentage had fallen to 15 percent, and I routinely do work in other parts of the country where that percentage is under 10 percent where children can safely get to school on their own. 
   This poses an inordinate problem in terms of the costs for transportation for school districts. We're all familiar in our own communities with schools that have a rush hour around the start of school, and then there's the rush hour to commuting. It complicates lives for families, it's a problem of congestion and pollution, and with energy prices projected to continue to remain high, it costs money. 
   But with the provisions of this legislation, we're going to have resources available that compliment our Safe Routes to School legislation in the last transportation reauthorization to be able to help, once again, children to be able to walk and bike safely to school. 
   At a time when we are looking at 10 million young people of school age who are overweight, and when the projection is that by 2010, 20 percent of the school-age population will be obese, this is an opportunity to help children, particularly when one of the failures of No Child Left Behind is that there isn't a provision for physical education in our schools.  
   This is a triple win. I strongly urge support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy as I appreciate his leadership and tireless effort to help keep this alive. 
   I understand the frustration of my friend from Oregon that just spoke. He should be frustrated, because his Republican Party was in total control for 6 years with the Presidency, with both Houses of Congress, and there is a situation that he doesn't like. I understand it. I understand his frustration. If I were in his position, I would be, too. It was the Republican Congress that did not extend this program and allowed it to expire. 
   There is a simple choice before us today where we have an opportunity to deal with the needs of hundreds of thousands of rural Americans, not just in Oregon, but from 40 States around the country, or the interests of a few oil companies who are making money hand over fist, and they are making some money that they shouldn't because they are not paying what they should under the leases. 
   We have already dealt with this canard that somehow the answer is to give the oil industy access to more land to drill. Oil companies have been granted 42 million acres of which they are only using 12 million currently, so they have 30 million acres of area that they could potentially drill and they are not drilling now. Somehow we should come up with something more to give to them, allow them to have more money, ignores the issue here today. 
   I would suggest that we ought to respect the work of Mr. DEFAZIO in bringing this forward. Frankly, I was frustrated at the negative comment about Speaker PELOSI who said that, instead of pushing these people off a cliff, that she would work to cushion the blow, to help phase it down. She was trying to help instead of cutting them off. She has been helpful in moving this forward, and taking a shot at the Speaker is unfair and if you are trying to solve the problem, it is unwise. 
   It is the Republicans for 6 years that had the control, who didn't exercise it. This is a constructive alternative. I suggest that we recognize the need of these hundreds of thousands of Americans, not a few oil companies.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy, and it is a pleasure to work with him in cosponsoring this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Federal Government is the largest consumer of energy in the world. If we harness the ability of our Federal agencies in terms of what they do with energy, what they do with procurement, we have an opportunity to revolutionize the business practices in this country in a way that doesn't require a lot of new rules and regulations and fees. It is simply leading by example. 
   It has been my privilege early in my career to do work dealing with minority enterprises, with women-owned enterprises, with small business; because, as the gentleman from Vermont mentions, these are areas that are tremendously underserved, but there is a great deal of energy and vitality and it has made our economy stronger. This is the next logical addition to that portfolio of activities. 
   By giving a preference to procurement with small businesses that are environmentally sound, it is going to help nurture an explosion of new technology, of new business opportunities, and, most important, most important, it is going to help to bring these activities to scale. It is going to make best green practices more cost effective. It is going to be a better value for the taxpayer. It is the cheapest way to improve the environment. And, ultimately, it is going to strengthen our economy, because areas in the European Union, in Canada and, dare I say, even in Asia dealing with China and Japan, progress is being made. This is going to help us. It is going to give a better value to the taxpayers. It is going to jump start these. 
   I look in Portland at TerraClean, Ecos Consulting, Rejuvenation House Parts, ecological small businesses. If this is enacted, they will be able to do a better job in the future. 
   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy and leadership.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy. 
   The Medicare prescription drug program was controversial from the start in part because of the notorious way it was strong armed through the House in the middle of the night after holding the voting machines opened for hours. Our new rules will prevent that. 
   Part of the controversy was the huge cost of a new unfunded entitlement with generous, probably unnecessary, subsidies and a prohibition on bargaining for a better price. 
   This better price is important because total drug costs for seniors, premiums and drugs, are going up. A review of drug company balance sheets where advertising and profit dwarfs basic research shows room to lower prices without undue stress on their research budget or their profit. 
   Competition and bargaining power combined with the Secretary's bully pulpit can probably save billions of dollars for seniors, hundreds, perhaps thousands, for individuals because these costs, remember, for most seniors are still going up. 
   Our action today is just a first step, a signal and a tool. The program is not set in stone. We are committed to the best treatment for our seniors and all taxpayers. This is a tool for the administration that, if they will use it, can save money and improve the program. It is a start on a longer and critical process to provide cost-effective quality health care for our seniors and ultimately for all Americans.

   I would like this provision to be named after the late Debbie Murdock. She was a leader at Portland State University with whom I worked who tragically left us far too soon, to make sure that we have equipped, to have strong sustainability programs. This is the wave of the future. This is where the jobs are to be found. 
   This is what our companies need to be competitive in a world of global warming and climate change. Only 30 percent of these companies say, they have the people with the skills and information and personnel to meet the environmental, sustainability challenge. This provision will enable colleges to develop sustainability programs, and to implement those sustainability programs, to have the appropriate evaluation to know what works. 
   I hope this is the tip of the iceberg for programs we can work on in the future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, for the first time in American history, the highway trust fund is running a deficit this year. What is the solution from this administration? Well, instead of having a comprehensive approach to dealing with the shortfall, they just want to steal some money from the mass transit administration account and walk away. This will only delay the problem for 1 year, and it will push mass transit into deficit the next year, instead of a practical solution to fix the looming transportation trust fund crisis. 
   This is consistent with their consistent underinvestment in our Nation's infrastructure. It is why the American Society of Civil Engineers has rated our infrastructure a D minus, and estimates it will cost us $1.6 trillion over the next 5 years to repair water, sewer, and transportation infrastructure, a crisis not just for the Federal Government but even worse for State and local governments. 
   A hundred years ago, Teddy Roosevelt had a vision for a national conference to develop a plan to deal with the Nation's infrastructure. It is time for this Congress to revisit that concept, maybe have a transportation vision for this century.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, part of the agenda of the New Democratic Leadership was to pass the ``Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act'', which has been bottled up for years. By doing so, we are taking an important step in improving the safety of all Americans. 
   This bill brings about a positive change to our current homeland security strategy. It provides a new formula for grant funding distribution based on risks in order to remove the politics from our national security. It contains a  substantial amount of funding for improving communications interoperability among first responders, which will help Oregon as it continues to aggressively address the issue at the local level. It also provides nearly $4 billion over the next four years for rail, transit, and bus security, a matter which I have had a long standing interests. We have seen the devastating impacts of terrorism on these modes of transportation in Europe in recent years and it is crucial that we make investments to protect this infrastructure at home. 
   These changes and many others recommended by the 9/11 Commission represent an important and long overdue step forward to securing our Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment in order to highlight an important but unfortunately not well understood farmland preservation tool used by communities across the country. 
   The United States loses more than 4,000 acres of farmland and open space to development every day. Since 1945,  America has lost nearly 20 percent of its farmland. Some of the best farmland, which is close to our growing cities, is being lost to development on an ongoing basis. 
   Sadly, local governments have few tools to protect this farmland. They can issue regulations, which some feel is burdensome; they can purchase land; or they can purchase development rights from landowners to prevent development, which can be very expensive. 
   Transferrable development rights, called TDRs in the trade, are an important market-based tool used by States and cities to protect farmland, property rights, and taxpayer dollars. 
   Under a TDR program, development rights can be separated from a parcel of land and sold to a private party, usually a developer. The developer can then use these rights to develop in an urbanizing region with a high demand for development that is already served by highways, water and sewer systems, not taking out scarce farmland.     
   This creates a private market for development rights and gives farmers options. Under this system, the private sector rather than tax dollars is paying for preservation of the parcel from which rights are purchased. 
   Successful TDR programs have been in place throughout the country since 1980 and have protected tens of thousands of acres of farmland and open space. They are currently in use in over 170 communities around the country, including Montgomery and Calvert Counties in Maryland, Blue Earth County in Minnesota, and Boulder County in Colorado. My amendment would simply clarify that funding from the Farm and Ranchland Protection program, which has been very successful in preserving farmland through the purchase of conservation easements, can be used for this type of program. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's willingness to work with us on this. The beauty of the Transfer of Development Rights programs is, when they are working correctly, they don't need government funding. However, an initial grant is sometimes extraordinarily useful in getting a program started in the first place. It is why I think funding from the FRPP is important. 
   Upon the gentleman's request, I am happy to withdraw this amendment, as long as we can work to make sure that the intent, and I actually think this is the intent of the existing legislation, to work with you to clarify the language to make sure that this innovative program will help stretch the tax dollars for the Farm and Ranchland Protection Program even further. 
   Our Nation's farmers face development pressures every single day, and we need to ensure that communities are able to use all the tools available to help the farmers who want to keep farming resist development pressures. 
   I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy and look forward to working with him.

   Three simple points. First of all, this amendment does not abolish the sugar program. It just doesn't make it worse. 
   Second, every independent agency, CBO, GAO, Department of Commerce, all conclude that this is not a no-cost program to Americans. It costs them over $1 billion. 
   Third, in terms of the cost per job saved that my friend from Florida was concerned about, the Department of Commerce has pegged that at $826,000 per job. One job in sugar production for three in sugar manufacturing. It's not a good trade-off.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, after Congress has successfully completed action on the first 100 hours, we now begin a critical 100 days for the future of our engagement in Iraq, United States policy in the Middle East and our struggle against violent fundamentalism. Between now and the Memorial Day recess, 100 days for Congress to reassert itself as a coequal branch of government, as envisioned by the framers of the Constitution, to change the course in Iraq. 
   This is a decisive moment. It is time for every one of us who would be a leader to lay our cards on the table. Each must be true to our own conscience and to the responsibility of office by letting the American people know honestly and directly what we stand for and what we would do in Iraq. 
   This resolution gives clear and concise voice to the desires of the American people. It expresses support for our troops and demands that we not place more of them at risk without a reason or a plan. And I strongly support it. 
   Along with this resolution, the Congress under Speaker Pelosi's Democratic leadership has already done more to provide oversight and accountability than Republicans over the last 5 years. We have held 50 hearings on the conduct of the war, fraud and failure in reconstruction efforts, and the outrage of our troops being sent into harm's way without the equipment they need. I applaud the efforts of our leadership  on the Appropriations Committee to end the practice of giving too much to the wrong people to do the wrong thing. 
   However, these are only the first steps. We should not only oppose escalation of the war, but we should pass legislation to bring the war to an end responsibly. Investigations must be followed by specific and personal accountability for crimes that have been permitted in the conduct of this war. 
   We should use the power of the purse to ensure that funds go specifically to keep our soldiers safe, rebuild badly damaged military readiness, undertake new diplomatic efforts and support the Iraqi people, not an open-ended occupation. 
   For the last 2 years, I have been working with concerned citizens in Oregon to develop a responsible plan to end the war and provide the best hope for a better future in Iraq. Last month, I introduced comprehensive legislation, the New Direction For Iraq, H.R. 663, as a model for the kind of legislation that Congress should enact, and I am confident will enact. 
   This legislation would bring the troops home, require a comprehensive diplomatic effort, redirect reconstruction assistance, promote international efforts to disarm militias, investigate and punish war profiteering and deal with the 2 million Iraqi refugees who have been forced to flee their country, people the administration has only recently been able to recognize. 
   A word about Iran. It is a complex puzzle, more difficult than any of us imagine and one that poses real challenges. But as the President marches us closer and closer to a major provocation, maybe a new war, whether intentionally or not, Congress should not let itself be steamrolled or lied to, as it was with Iraq; Congress must assert itself with real diplomacy and a real strategy. 
   It is also time that America lived up to our ideals. No more torture, kidnapping and unauthorized wiretaps; no more lying and unnecessary secrecy; not treating the Constitution as a suggestion or using false claims about national security to score political points against those of us who have been right about this war from the beginning. 
   We must start treating the public like a partner and recognize that they are far ahead of the President and the Republican leadership. I am just frustrated to hear false analogies to the dark days of World War II or to the Civil War. We are bogged down in somebody else's civil war, and we have been doing it longer than World War II or the Civil War, with no end in sight, until now. 
   They should join us in taking this conversation to coffee shops, churches, campuses and conference rooms, working with the American people. 
   Over the next 100 days, I will continue to fight for a comprehensive plan that I am confident will come forward. It is in the honor of Travis Bradach Nall, a constituent of mine who was killed in Iraq the very day the President taunted the insurgents to ``bring it on.'' 
   For Travis and over 3,000 of his brave comrades who have given their lives, I urge support of this resolution as a critical first step to bringing this tragic war to a close.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (AMENDING THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986 TO RESTORE THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND BALANCE -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy in permitting me to speak on this critical legislation. 
   I rise in strong opposition to my friend from Arizona's assessment and in strong support for this legislation adjustment. The United States does have more and better infrastructure than any country in the world. The problem is that much of that infrastructure is fraying. It is being worn out. And it's not equal to the challenges that we have today for our own communities, much less to the international competition that we're facing around the world. We are facing a situation today with a highway trust fund that is going into deficit and it's going to be more serious over time. 
   It would be the height of irresponsibility for this Congress to fail to keep pace with the needs of those programs. As my friend, Mr. Oberstar, who knows more about this than anybody in Congress, provided the context for the trust fund, and he could go on at great length about how the general fund, for years, was robbing the highway trust fund, using that to prop up and to disguise the nature of our true deficit. 
   The fact is that uncertainty today with significant projects around the country in virtually every one of our States is going to have significant consequences in those communities if they're not cleared and move ahead. Many of these have complex funding projects. I was in southern Ohio and Kentucky this weekend where they're looking at a multi-State, multiyear project. If we have a cloud over our ability to keep these commitments, it slows and it confuses. It is going to cost jobs. It is going to cost economic activity. I think you can make an argument that it actually will end up costing the general fund money over time because of the hundreds of thousands of jobs that will be in limbo. 
   I hope to continue to work with the Ways and Means Committee and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to have a sustainable path to meet our transportation objectives in the future. Indeed, I hope to introduce legislation this summer for a water trust fund to be able to help some of those other responsibilities. 
   It is important for us not to back away from our commitment to State and local partners. Time does not permit to talk about the potential byplay where ultimately it's not going to make any difference in terms of the deficit. It's just going to unravel projects and create problems down the line. 
   Last but not least, the notion that somehow those Member-requested projects, God forbid, for street cars, for hiking paths, for bike trails that are among the most requested, the most popular, the most important, and I would daresay in a time of $4.50 a gallon gasoline and morbidly obese fourth graders, having bike and pedestrian activities not only saves energy, it's good for health. It's good for the economy of this country. 
   I would strongly urge that each and every Member support this important legislation. And, more important, that they commit themselves to work with the Ways and Means Committee and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to deal with the long-term financial and the long-term vision of how we're going to renew and rebuild America at a time of energy shortage, at a time of water stress and at a time of economic uncertainty. This is a way to make this system work better. I strongly urge its support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you, Mr. Neal, for your leadership and your courtesy. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this package as it brings much-needed reforms to the industry, supports homeowners around the country and is much needed. I think it represents a lot of good, hard work. But I must make one point, because buried in the provisions of this bill in section 3082 on page 680 is an expansion of the Gulf Opportunity Zone to two counties in Alabama.     
   One of those counties is 300 miles from the coast and doesn't have much to do with housing and has nothing to do with damage for Katrina. 
   The reason I'm speaking to it is because it is an expansion designed to provide a subsidy for National Steel Car, a Canadian rail manufacturer. A subsidy unnecessary for two reasons: because the plant in question is already under construction, and that Alabama was already under a contractual obligation to provide this subsidy if Congress did not. 
   The United States has a domestic railcar industry, with plants and facilities around the country. I put in the Record a list of the 18 factories around the United States and the four American corporate headquarters.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today we take up the final Defense Authorization bill of the Bush administration. Those who know me and know my record will understand why, although I support the progress we've made at rolling back some of the most egregious Bush defense priorities, I cannot vote for this Defense policy bill. 
   In this time of extreme economic uncertainty, we cannot afford to prop up a bloated Department of Defense. Defense Authorization bills outline priorities and benchmarks for spending, and I believe this bill proposes levels that are too high and for the wrong priorities. 
   For eight years we have seen the Defense budget balloon under President Bush and today we spend more on defense than the rest of the world combined. I have long pointed out that programs like the Future Combat System's fighting vehicles and the National Missile Defense system would be justifiable if the major threat to our security was a modern version of the Soviet Union. It is not. I applaud the Democratic cuts to the funding levels requested by the President, though we must do better. 
   As with other programs, the quantity of money spent says little about the quality of return. Indeed, investing in outdated systems makes us less secure and comes at the expense of smarter, modern defense tools. We must invest in systems that confront the real and looming threats of terrorists and rogue states. We must cultivate our personnel into a smart and agile force with a range of tools to engage the world. We must create a security strategy that recognizes the equal importance of diplomacy, development, and defense and understands the linkages between poverty, environmental health, and economic security. 
   In particular, I would like to see the Pentagon institute strong safeguards regarding the interrogation of prisoners and fully invest in the environmental restoration of past defense sites. I thank Chairman SKELTON and Ranking Member HUNTER for the progress we've made so far on these issues, and for supporting my unexploded ordnance amendment which made detection technology a priority for the Pentagon. 
   There are the beginnings of a major shift in this Defense Authorization bill. I believe that  after the upcoming election, when the nation has time to evaluate just how out-of-touch the Pentagon is, we will be able to have a more thoughtful assessment of what our Defense Department should look like and what activities it should be engaged in. I look forward to this thoughtful discussion.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (CONSOLIDATED SECURITY, DISASTER ASSISTANCE, AND CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, while there are some positive steps taken in this legislation to help those hurt by recent disasters, additional funding for cleaning up unexploded ordnance around the country, and some important funding for our veterans, I am extremely disappointed that this bill does not include an extension of the Secure Rural Schools program. The expiration of this program would be a true disaster for my state of Oregon. While the Pacific Northwest states may be the hardest hit by expiration of the program, more than 40 other states from California to Louisiana to Texas will also feel significant impacts. 
   Clackamas County, in my district, could lose nearly $12.5 million in funding that is crucial to its public and ecological health. In addition to having to lay off teachers and other school employees, other important county programs will be curtailed. Clackamas has already discontinued their road maintenance program this year. The county is also planning to close community health clinics because it is unable to continue the necessary level of funding. 
   I hope that the House leadership will figure out some way to extend this safety net for rural counties before the end of the year. 
   I also oppose this bill because it is letting our decades-long moratorium on drilling offshore expire. This means that, starting next week, the Interior Department can prepare leases for oil rigs as close as 3 miles off our coasts. 
   While I may disagree with my Republican colleagues about the environmental and economic impact of drilling on our nation's coasts, there is little disagreement about how this will impact gas prices--because it won't. 
   Even the Bush administration's own Department of Energy agrees that more drilling will make no difference for at least a decade, and even then any impact on the price at the pump would be insignificant. 
   I had hoped that we would at least be able to include provisions of the House-passed energy bill that extended the moratorium to 50 miles off shore, but it appears that even that reasonable compromise is not enough for those who want to keep America addicted to oil. 
   I don't think this is the end of the story, and I hope the new Congress and new administration will move quickly to enact sensible protections for our coastal communities. 
   Lastly, I feel that holding funding to fiscal year 2008 levels for many important domestic programs from education to health to transportation will further hurt families at a time when they are already being squeezed by higher food and energy prices and a slumping economy.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, the alternative minimum tax was introduced to the tax code in 1969 to capture a small number of millionaires who had escaped tax liability. Since that laudable beginning, however, the tax has morphed from a millionaire's tax to a middle class tax. 
   In fact, a failure to pass an alternative minimum tax patch this year will result in millions of additional families being subject to that tax. In my district alone, H.R. 7005 will prevent over 40,000 additional taxpayers from facing the AMT. 
   Nationally, the alternative minimum tax would, but for this bill, affect over 50 percent of taxpayers with incomes between $50,000 and $100,000 this year. This is a tax on nearly every middle class family--and it falls hardest on those raising a family. A 1-year patch is necessary to protect those families. 
   It is for those reasons that I reluctantly voted in favor of this legislation. However, a piecemeal, year-by-year approach that places the burden on our children's credit cards is insufficient for a challenge of this magnitude. When Congress returns to this issue, I am looking forward to permanently reforming the alternative minimum tax in a way that does not add to our national deficit.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUMENAUER. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy, as I appreciate the hard work that she and her commi ttee have done bringing forward, I think, a really terrific bill. 
   I wish to enter into colloquy with you, Madam Chair. At the end of 2005 Congress passed the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act with broad bipartisan support. At the time it was called landmark legislation. 
   Unfortunately, today it's clear that the intent and many of the legal requirements in the Water for the Poor Act are not being met by the State Department and USAID. 
   Earlier this month the State Department delivered its s econd report on the required drinking water and sanitation strategy. Unfortunately, it continues to be more of a recitation of the work they're doing, rather than a strategic, forward-looking road map to move from the current state of access to achieving the international commitment to cut in half the percentage of people without access to safe drinking water and sanitation. 
   While our legislation was specifically written so that it would improve aid quality at any level, there was also a call to increas e the amount of resources devoted to the very poor. For instance, as part of the strategy, we required an increase in the percentage of assistance going to high-priority countries, defined as countries with the greatest need, and countries in which assistance would be expected to make the greatest difference. Many, if not most of these countries would be in sub-Saharan Africa. 
   For too long the State Department has used disaster funding to artificially inflate the numbers it used to meet congressional re quirements, instead of giving the necessary focus to long-term sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation for the poor. 
   For too long, sub-Saharan Africa has gotten funding that is inversely proportional to the level of need. For too long the State Department has treated Water for the Poor Act as if it were a guideline or a suggestion, rather than a law passed by Congress and signed by the President that they're obligated to fully implement. 
   I very much appreciate the work of Chairwoman Lowey and Chairman Obey, for whom I know this is a particular interest. I deeply appreciate increasing the overall level of funding for water and sanitation to $300 million, and directing that much of it be spent pursuant to the Water for the Poor Act. 
   I hope for the opportunity, as we move forward towards conference, to work together to ensure that as much money as possible is made available to the long-term development of safe drinking water and sanitation programs in the areas of greatest need, with a strategy needed to ensure that we're make the most effective use of our AIDS dollar. 
   Most important, I hope that the Appropriations Committee will continue to help with the oversight needed to make the Water for the Poor Act fully implemented and the United States lives up to our international commitment.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. I just can't tell you how much I appreciate what you've done and this commitment. I appreciate your words and everything the committee has done to make our water investments go to the right places in the right ways for the right thi ng. 
   I am reassured that your intention that only $80 million of the $300 million level come from disaster assistance. That's an important step in making the necessary long-term investments to deal with this leading cause of preventable death in the world. 
   I'm particularly pleased by the requirement that funds be spent in accordance with the Water for the Poor Act, which was carefully crafted to provide a framework, a policy and a goal for ensuring affordable and equitable access to safe drinking wat er and sanitation for the poorest in this world. I look forward to the opportunity to continue to work with you. 
   There was, at one point, our colleague, Chairman Payne of the Africa Subcommittee was going to be here I  thought, and I apologize, I don't see him. But I know he has done outstanding work with the subcommittee. And I think between the three of us, great things could happen.

   Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, the amendment which I am offering with my good friends from Washington and New York simply shifts $50 million from military aid for Pakistan to the Emergency Refugee and Mitigation Assistance Account. It would leave $250 million in Pakistani military aid, the same level that appeared in the chairwoman's original mark. 
   In many areas of Federal spending, Congress has to make tough choices amongst important competing priorities. However, the choice between more military aid for Pakistan and assistance for refugees should be an easy one. 
   Anybody who has witnessed the news in recent weeks understands the military dictatorship in Pakistan has had serious problems in terms of its treatment of civil society. It is one of the worst nuclear proliferators, which could not occur without the knowledge of the Pakistani government. Yet it has been the third-largest recipient of military aid from the United States since 9/11, receiving $10 billion over the last 6 years. 
   Despite all that, Pakistan continues to allow the Taliban to operate in many parts of Pakistan and launch attacks against U.S. troops in Afghanistan. In fact, according to CQ Weekly, a U.S. Army officer stationed in Pakistan recently recalled watching a 2-mile-long line of Taliban fighters and suicide bombers walk across the border into Afghanistan unchallenged by Pakistani security forces. 
   Pakistan even has a ``peace agreement'' with the Taliban and other terrorists in one province along the Afghan border and agreed to slash military patrols in areas with a substantial al Qaeda presence. 
   At the same time, Pakistan's military dictator, General Musharraf, has dismissed the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and attempted to introduce restrictions on its television media. 
   Forty pro-democracy protesters recently killed by security forces; and, since 2001, over 1,000 people have disappeared. 
   On the other hand, Iraq is the fastest-growing refugee crisis in the world. There have been 4 million innocent Iraqis who have been driven from their homes by violence and threats, including tens of thousands who are at risk because they helped the United States. 
   This humanitarian crisis is rapidly becoming a regional security crisis, as Jordan and Syria are at risk of being destabilized by the millions of Iraqis they have taken in, 2 million Iraqis in Jordan and Syria. 
   Despite this, efforts to provide assistance in the region are dramatically underfunded. The United States has admitted only 70 refugees since October, only one in April and one in May. It is not getting better. It is getting worse. I think this is a blot on Congress as well as the administration, turning its back on these refugees. 
   Adding $50 million in Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance will allow assistance to reach more displaced Iraqis and help mitigate the impacts of the refugee crisis on other countries in the Middle East. This amendment offered by Mr. McDermott, Mr. Crowley and myself has the support of the United States Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, Refugees International, the U.S.-India PAC, the U.S.-India Business Alliance and others who are deeply concerned about this humanitarian crisis. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
