<DOCNO>Mr. CARNAHAN. (DRILL ACT PROMOTES DRILLING ON 311 MILLION ACRES OF OPEN LAND -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, with high gas prices crippling the American economy, this country needs a long-term energy plan to lower gas prices, make America more secure, create green jobs, and reduce global warming. 
   House Democrats support responsible drilling as part of our comprehensive strategy, but many Republicans in Washington say we need to do more drilling in our pristine oceans and wilderness areas, even though 300 million acres of public land, more than three times the size of California, are already open for leasing. They want us to give more public land to Big Oil, even though 68 million acres of land are already leased and not being developed. 
   Today, the House will consider the DRILL Act. I urge my colleagues to join us in passing this vital legislation that will speed up development of NPRA, require Big Oil to use the land they have leased or lose it, and ban foreign export of Alaskan oil to ensure our oil stays in America. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is commonsense legislation that does exactly what many are asking for, more drilling. So why don't they support a bill that requires Big Oil to drill and not just stockpile more leases?

<DOCNO>Mr. CARNAHAN. (NEW DIRECTION FOR AMERICAN AGRICULTURE -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARNAHAN. Madam Speaker, yesterday this House passed a bipartisan, veto-proof farm bill strengthening American agriculture. 
   We successfully voted to ease the strain of rising food prices and to make a substantial commitment to land conservation and to our farmers. I want to give special recognition to Chairman COLLIN PETERSON for his leadership and for his visit to Missouri to hold an agricultural forum where we have over 100,000 farms, the second most of any State in the country. 
   Since first being elected, I have been working with local schools and parents to implement a Healthy Kids Initiative. I'm proud that this farm bill helps schools provide healthy snacks to students, with over $1 billion for more nutritious, locally grown fresh fruits and vegetables. 
   And for the first time, fruit and vegetable producers, including the wine producers of Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, will benefit from more than $1.3 billion for new programs that support research, pest management, and trade promotion. 
   To make the transition from home-grown biofuels from the Midwest and away from dependence on fossil fuels from the Middle East, the bill creates new tax credits to promote the production of cellulosic biofuels. 
   Thank you, Chairman Peterson, and all those who supported this new direction for American agriculture.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARNAHAN. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of S. 5, the stem cell research act that we have gotten from the Senate. 
   This bill, first, I want to say, sets strong ethical standards to be followed that don't exist today. As the gentleman from Delaware stated, these embryos can't be created just for the purposes of research. They can only be produced for the purpose of reproduction and that are unused, that would otherwise be discarded as medical waste. They can only be donated, not sold, and only by the written consent of those involved. 
   Those are strong ethical standards that don't exist today. We need them to continue this research in an ethical way. 
   This stem cell research holds real promise to cures of so many diseases. But to unlock the full potential of this research, we must remove the artificial barriers that President Bush put in place to this research and to support the hopes of millions of Americans who work every day to survive under the burden of a life-altering diagnosis. 
   Nearly every family in this country has been touched. My own family, I had a cousin, Betty, who suffered and succumbed to MS. My grandmother and sister have suffered from cancer. In my State of Missouri, we took the extraordinary step in 2006 to vote to amend our State constitution to include protections for research and add strong ethical standards for it. 
   I also became involved in this debate because of the extraordinary men and women from my State, such as advocates like Bernie Frank of St. Louis, attorney and coordinator for the Parkinson's Action Network. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's 13 years ago but has been a fearless advocate. Advocates like Dr. Thy Huskey, assistant professor at the Washington University School of Medicine, she lives with this disease; and we want to continue to support this.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 365, the Methamphetamine Remediation Research Act of 2007. This bill will be an important tool in the methamphetamine epidemic that is sweeping across our country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Gordon for moving these bills so quickly through the Science Committee so that we may continue the antimeth initiatives in this new Congress. The bill charges the EPA with the development of health-based guidelines to assist State and local authorities in cleaning up former meth lab sites. 
   According to the 2006 National Drug Threat Survey of State and Local Law Enforcement, meth was named most often the greatest drug threat. Well, I am proud to say that my home State of Missouri has been a leader nationwide on issues such as expansion of stem cell  research and creation and implementation of the historic preservation tax credit. My State, unfortunately, has the most prevalent meth problem. 
   Based on data from 2005, Missouri had a reported staggering 2,252 meth lab incidents, the highest in the Nation. Jefferson County, in the heart of my district, has the highest number of meth lab incidents in Missouri, reporting 259 incidents in 2005 alone. 
   I have seen firsthand the negative and harmful impact of this in my district. I have met with law enforcement throughout my district and compliment them on their aggressive and innovative programs. 
   But the large amount of meth lab incidents in Missouri means that police, firefighters and other first-line responders are exposed to meth labs in the line of duty. While some States have already passed laws to require cleanup of meth labs, Missouri and many others have not. 
   This bill is vital, because we need the EPA to create these voluntary guidelines for first responders nationwide. This bill would be beneficial in determining the effects of meth exposure. In addition to creating guidelines for cleanup, the bill would also require the National Academy of Sciences to study the long-term impacts on first responders, children and property owners.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARNAHAN. Madam Speaker, President Bush and about 10 House Republicans are all that stand between 10 million children and the health care they need and deserve. I am deeply disappointed in the President's dumbfounding veto of the SCHIP bill. He reneged on his pledge he made when running for re-election in 2004. 
   The bill to reauthorize SCHIP continues coverage for 6 million kids currently covered and provides incentives for another 4 million kids who have been falling through the cracks of the health care system. The program continues to focus on low- and moderate-income families who earn too much for the Medicaid program, but can't afford private health care. 
   Madam Speaker, the big momentum behind this historic bill is growing exponentially and will not be stopped. To those blocking the SCHIP reauthorization from becoming law, I say either get on board, get out of the way, or get run over. The children's health care bill is on its way, either with or without you. 
   SCHIP supporters are even more determined than ever to get this done by the mid-November deadline. Let's all finish this job. For children's health care in America, it's fourth and goal on the 1-yard line. Working together, we can overpower anyone left blocking the way.

   Mr. CARNAHAN. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 720, the Water Quality Financing Act. 
   In my home of St. Louis, we have one of the oldest wastewater infrastructure systems in the Nation, some dating back to the Civil War. Our crumbling and overused sewer systems are an environmental and economic burden and they frequently threaten the health of the Mississippi River, one of our national treasures. During heavy rain storms, as many as 200 sewers can overflow. 
   H.R. 720 reaffirms our commitment to continue the progress of the 1972 Clean Water Act and ensures that generations to come will enjoy clean and safe water supplies. 
   By including Davis-Bacon protections in this bill, our communities will be further assisted by ensuring that our constituents who build these projects will be paid no less than prevailing wage. At a time when thousands of jobs are outsourced from our communities, these Davis-Bacon protections serve as a strong example of homesourcing. Instead of allowing outsiders to undercut the wages of our constituents, Davis-Bacon keeps these fair wages in our communities. 
   I commend Chair OBERSTAR and Chairwoman Johnson for their leadership and look forward to passing this bill in a bipartisan way.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARNAHAN. (WILLIAM ``BILL'' CLAY POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to sponsor this bill today before us, H.R. 5395, a bill to name a Missouri post office after a true champion of civil rights, Congressman William ``Bill'' Clay. Mr. Clay retired from the House of Representatives in the year 2000 after a stellar career in public service. 
   It's especially appropriate to have this tribute for him to name the Florissant, Missouri, post office in his honor that is located in Missouri's First Congressional District that he represented for 32 years in Congress, where he rose to become chairman of the House Committee on the Post Office and Civil Service and achieved the third highest rank in seniority in the entire U.S. House. 
   Mr. Clay was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and began his political career in 1959 as a member of the St. Louis Board of Aldermen, where he served until 1964. Prior to entering Congress in 1968, he also worked as a real estate broker and later as a labor coordinator. He worked for the union of St. Louis City employees from 1961 to 1964 and then with the Steamfitters Union until 1967. 
   Congressman Bill Clay is known as a true pioneer of civil rights. Throughout his tenure in Congress, he became a champion of social justice and labor rights, working on behalf of the poor and the disenfranchised. Bill Clay was co-founder of the Congressional Black Caucus. He was an author of the history of African Americans who served in Congress. And he had a famous saying, that he did not have permanent friends or permanent enemies in politics, just permanent interest. He looked out for the people that he represented, and he served them well. He's been credited with turning back racial discrimination throughout his career. He remains today an outspoken leader in our community, an accomplished author. This will be a fitting tribute to his years of dedication in public service. 
   I ask that the U.S. House of Representatives respect this living legend, this inspirational leader, Congressman William ``Bill'' Clay with this fitting tribute of naming a Missouri post office in his honor.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARNAHAN. (HARRIETT F. WOODS POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1617, which would name a post office after a true pioneer in Missouri politics and especially for women in politics, Harriett F. Woods. 
   Ms. Woods passed away in February. It would be a fitting tribute to name a post office in her honor in the very town where her storied political career began, University City, Missouri. This was also the post office that Ms. Woods used for over 50 years. 
   Her political career began in the 1960s as a member of the University City Council where she became the first woman appointed to the State Highway Commission. She was elected to the Missouri State Senate in 1976, where she sponsored an equal rights amendment to the State Constitution. While in the State Senate, she also passed landmark legislation which led to drunk driving laws and nursing home reform which became national models adopted throughout the country. 
   In 1984, she was elected Lieutenant Governor, becoming the first woman elected to statewide office in Missouri history. She was a trailblazer for women in politics even after she left elected office. She served 4 years as President of the nonpartisan National Women's Political Caucus. During her tenure, the number of women elected to Congress increased dramatically, including the historic ``Year of the Woman'' election of 1992. 
   Vivian Eveloff, Director of the nonpartisan Sue Shear Institute for Women in Public Life in St. Louis, described Ms. Woods as a strong advocate ``to encourage women of all ages, walks of life and political views to step forward and take on policymaking positions.'' 
   Harriett Woods was a role model and inspiration to young people, but especially young women. I am proud to have introduced this legislation to name her hometown post office in her honor, ensuring that her memory and inspiration will continue to be a visible part of our community. 
   The last time I saw our former Lieutenant Governor Woods was in Washington. She was here this past January. Even though she was not feeling well, she made an extraordinary effort to be here for the historic occasion of our new female U.S. Senator, Senator McCaskill, when she was sworn in, and also see the historic occasion of the first woman Speaker sworn into this House. It was very fitting she was here as part of those historic events. 
   I want to make a special thanks to the many cosponsors of this bill honoring Lieutenant Governor Woods, including nearly all women Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle and the Missouri delegation. 
   I urge all Members of this body to support the legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARNAHAN. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to be here and to be part of this debate. I wanted  to congratulate the bipartisan way in which this resolution was brought before this House with two Members of the Armed Services Committee, the chairman, IKE SKELTON from Missouri, and Republican Member JONES from North Carolina, and also Chairman Lantos of the Foreign Affairs Committee. I congratulate them in their leadership. 
   At a recent send-off of troops being redeployed from my home district in Missouri, I told the families that I would work in Congress to bring their loved ones home safe, sound and soon. However, this proposed military escalation flies in the face of that intention. 
   As we enter the fifth year of this mismanaged war in Iraq, with an ill-defined plan, it is irresponsible to think that an escalation is in the best interests of our troops. The Bush escalation plan is yet another indication that the President has failed to listen to the American public, military experts, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, and Democrat and Republican Members in this Congress. 
   Even General Colin Powell, the former Secretary of State, said, I am not persuaded that any surge of troops in Baghdad for the purposes of suppressing this communitarian violence, this civil war will work. 
   It is my solemn responsibility to act on behalf of Missouri constituents and their overwhelming desire for change. I am proud to see the new Congress has begun to systematically analyze the President's proposal regarding the war in Iraq. 
   Since the beginning of the year, we have already held 52 hearings in this Congress about the war in Iraq. Evidence this new Democratic-led Congress is exercising real oversight and demanding accountability on the Iraq war. We will continue to ask the tough questions about the President's plan, continue to insist on a new direction while always putting our troops first. 
   We have the best military in the world, and we owe our troops a clear mission. Our men and women in uniform have done their job two and three times over, and our civilian leadership must provide a clear, achievable objective so they can come home soon. 
   This Congress has a grave duty to listen and take action. Recently, the mother of a young soldier being deployed back to Iraq told me, Congressman Carnahan, I am one of those mothers who is against the war in Iraq, but my son volunteered to serve his country. Please be sure they get the support and equipment they need to come home quickly and safely. 
   That mother's heartfelt request is a powerful example of our national unity and resolve to support our troops and oppose this escalation policy that is not making the Iraq Government more self-reliant. In fact, it is using us further as a crutch. 
   It is not making the Middle East region more stable. In fact, many of our military leaders say our very presence there is fueling the insurgency, and it is not making our country safer. Today, the House begins a detailed deliberation on House Concurrent Resolution 63, which is only the beginning of this Congress's oversight of the President's strategy in Iraq. 
   This straight-forward resolution plainly expresses our support for the brave men and women who are currently serving or who have served in the Armed Forces. In my home State of Missouri, over 27,000 men and women have been deployed to serve in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraq Freedom since September 2001. 
   It is our duty as Members of Congress to ensure they have the necessary training, equipment, resources and support while in harm's way and when they return home. 
   When debate concludes this week, it is my firm hope that the result will be a bipartisan vote reflecting both our unwavering support of our troops and the reality that a fourth U.S. escalation is the wrong direction for our country. 
   As the new majority, we have the opportunity to develop a comprehensive and commonsense solution to enable us to protect our troops, maintain our obligation, and end this conflict as quickly as possible. We stand ready to provide real peace of mind for the American people by securing our homeland and changing course in Iraq. 
   Great change is possible when this Congress acts in unison with the American public. In the weeks and months ahead, this Congress will act in a bipartisan way to carefully and thoroughly examine the President's proposals and pass decisions through hearings, debate and oversight using all tools available to change the direction of this war. 
   Most importantly, we will continue to support our troops in hopes of de-escalation of the war and escalation of the political solution for Iraq. Working together, Mr. Speaker, great change is possible.

   Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, when the Democrats took control of Congress this year, we pledged that the voices of children would become a top priority for a change. This month Democrats will complete a final budget that meets our commitment to our children and abides by tough pay-as-you-go rules we reinstituted in January. 
   This new Congress has a responsibility to clean up the fiscal mess that we inherited. Deficits matter. Over the last 6 years, the choice to live beyond our means has come at a great expense to our children who will be forced to pay off that debt. The Democratic budget says, enough with deficit spending. Unlike the President's budget, ours will be balanced within the next 5 years. 
   First, we increase funding for our children's health care by $50 billion  over the next 5 years, which will allow States to ensure millions of children who are now uninsured. And then we will provide $7.9 billion over the President's budget for education funding so we can really mean it when we say, No child left behind.

   First, the legislation demands that the Iraqi Government meet benchmarks the President himself outlined earlier this year. 
   Second, the legislation calls for responsible redeployment out of Iraq at the beginning of next year. The Democratic Congress did not come up with this date out of the blue. This was in the recommendations from the Iraq Study Group. 
   Third, the supplemental includes important funding for our military that was requested by the Pentagon.

It now invests in over 1,000 local radio and television stations, providing every American with access to commercial-free educational and thought-provoking programming. 
   For years, parents in my home of St. Louis, Missouri, have turned to KETC-TV as their children's developing minds are broadened by programs like ``Sesame Street.'' These same parents depend on KWMU for in-depth news coverage of local, national and global events. 
   With its mission to provide programs which inform, enlighten and enrich the public, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting has contributed to the development of our children, the public's interest, and the understanding of our world and the implementation of a new and better communications technology. 
   As the bill was signed into law on November 7, 1967, President Lyndon Johnson so eloquently stated, ``While we work every day to produce new goods and create new wealth, we want most of all to enrich man's spirit.'' Thank you to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for doing just that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARNAHAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act 2008 for a second time. 
   Thousands of my constituents in Missouri have contacted me to share their anxiety and anger about the financial crisis we are facing. I too am angry about the current economic crisis in our country--angry about those who caused it and those who have bungled solutions. 
   Year of de-regulation of the financial markets, coupled with lax oversight by the Bush administration of these institutions, has had devastating effects on the lives of many Missourians. 
   I strongly opposed the original Bush/Paulson Bailout Plan that was basically a blank check with no accountability for an industry that made poor decisions. But the risk of taking no action is too great and too dangerous for our economy, and the financial stability of all Americans. 
   We must pass this legislation, even with its imperfections, to unlock the credit market that is essential to both individuals and businesses. Without a properly functioning credit market, small businesses, the backbone of Missouri's economy, risk not making payroll. Americans will have increasing difficulty obtaining car loans, home loans, farm loans, student loans, as well as other forms of credit upon which we all rely. 
   I have heard from many Missourians concerned about the effect of tightened money-lending standards. From the hardworking couple just about to retire who have watched the value of the retirement savings dramatically decline over the past month to the family who needs to buy a new car but cannot qualify for a loan because of the freeze in the credit market. 
   The economic downturn is also hitting our small businesses. In my hometown of St. Louis, Feld Chevrolet, a St. Louis leader for over 27 years, has shut its doors because the lender stopped financing the dealership's inventory. 
   Stories like these make it clear we have a responsibility to act before the credit crisis further undermines our economy. 
   Without decisive action, most economists have noted that the situation will only worsen, credit markets will freeze, Main Street will suffer, and Missouri families will struggle. 
   My constituents as well as yours will not be able to make basic home and car loans. Small businesses will not be able to make their payrolls, and credit card interest rates will soar. 
   The legislation before us today is a vast improvement over the original proposal put forward by the Bush administration, which gave unprecedented and unchecked authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to spend $700 billion. We have made it clear that Congress does not write blank checks to Wall Street. 
   This legislation will require the Government to develop an emergency line of credit to reduce foreclosures as it buys troubled financial assets, allows the Government to purchase other types of mortgages to unfreeze the credit market, and allows the Government to purchase certain troubled assets form pension plans to ensure individual retirement security. 
   This bipartisan proposal will help insulate the American people and Main Street from the crisis on Wall Street as we stabilize the markets. It will also, protect taxpayers by ensuring public investments reap any profits and the financial industry is responsible for any short fall and it ends excess compensation for executives of participating financial institutions. 
   Following, the House vote last Monday, the stock market plunged an historic 777 points, costing the American economy $1.2 trillion. Americans across the country saw their 401Ks, pension plans and savings account lose value. This was a loud wake up call that we must take swift and decisive action. 
   The legislation we are considering today is no longer focused on just a bailout of Wall Street; more importantly it is a buy-in so that we can turn our entire economy around and help hard working Americans. 
   In no way are we out of the woods. Times are and will continue to be difficult, but I believe passage of this bill can help us get back on track and help prevent our economy from spiraling out of control. These times will certainly demand additional steps and common sense leadership to get America back on her feet again. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill.

   Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express concern about the Air Force's award of a $35 billion contract to a foreign consortium which received over $5 billion in foreign government subsidies. 
   Of concern is the Air Force defying its own ranking system, which awarded the Boeing Corporation 98 positive discriminators and Northrop Grumman-EADS only 30, yet the tanker contract went to EADS. 
   Boeing's 767 tanker had a positive survivability rating. EADS' aircraft had a negative rating. Yet the tanker contract went to EADS. 
   Boeing has manufactured over 2,000 tankers with advanced fly-by-wire booms; EADS, zero. Yet the tanker contract went to EADS. 
   The lifecycle cost of the EADS tanker is going to be billions and billions more than that of the Boeing aircraft, yet the tanker contract went to EADS. 
   We continue to face record fuel prices, and it is critical that the Air Force's next refueling tanker meet or exceed their requirements and be as efficient as possible. An independent study has determined that the Boeing KC-767 fleet burns 24 percent less fuel than the EADS A-330s.

For an investment of just $3.50 a day, we can ensure health care for that child who would otherwise fall through the cracks because their family makes too much for Medicaid but can't afford private health insurance. 
   This small cost is significantly less than the cost we all bear when uninsured children fail to receive preventative care and end up in our emergency rooms. Yet the President and about 10 of his Republican House supporters are all that stand in the way of covering 10 million American children. 
   Our bipartisan legislation will allow children who are already eligible for the program to see the doctor of their family's choice so they don't have to resort to an emergency room for their primary care.

   Mr. CARNAHAN. Madam Speaker, in the war to fight crime in this country we need more than just rhetoric. We need results. 
   During the 1990s, thanks to the initiatives of the Clinton administration and the Democratic Congress, we significantly reduced crime nationwide after enactment of the COPS program. We put 100,000 new cops on our streets, and crime rates fell. But over the past decade, Republicans have cut the program. As a result, crime rates have increased nationwide. 
   The Police Executive Research Forum recently released a report that found violent crime rates have risen by double-digit percentages over the last 2 years. Among the cities surveyed, 71 percent had an increase in homicides, and 80 percent saw robberies rise. 
   Today, this House has an opportunity to show it is serious about protecting our neighborhoods by passing the COPS Improvement Act. This legislation will restore the strong anti-crime measures we enacted in the 1990s by providing funding to hire 50,000 new police over the next 6 years. 
   Madam Speaker, the new Democratic majority isn't just talking about keeping our Nation secure; we are producing real results.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Private First Class Andrew Habsieger, who died serving our country in Iraq. On Easter Sunday, March 23, he was one of four soldiers killed by a roadside bomb in Baghdad. He was scheduled to return home to his family in 2 weeks. Andy was just 22 years old. 
   In Festus, Missouri, friends and family remembered him as a loving child and standout high school football player. Andy proudly served the U.S. Army as an infantryman and was inspired to fight for his country after the terrible attacks of September 11. 
   On March 22, 2005, Andy wrote me requesting assistance in joining the Marine Corps because of experiencing migraines while growing up. Andy ultimately joined the Army. Looking back on his letter, I am reminded of his steely determination to serve his country. That he did. 
   The weekend Andy died marked the 4,000th American soldier killed in Iraq. My heart goes out to Andy's parents, Michael and Brenda Habsieger, as well as his brother, Jacob, who is also in the Army. We must never forget our Nation's fallen heroes. PFC Andrew Habsieger will not be forgotten and his service will inspire generations yet to come.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, Defense Secretary Gates confirmed what many of us in Congress have long suspected: the Bush administration plans to leave nearly 130,000 troops in Iraq until the day he leaves office next January. 
   The war in Iraq has been misguided from the start and mismanaged in its prosecution. It has led to a significant military readiness crisis, deteriorating conditions in Afghanistan, a readiness crisis for National Guard forces here at home, and a record low standing for us abroad. 
   This month, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau said that 88 percent of our stateside Guard units are ``very poorly equipped'' with less than half of what they needed to respond to a domestic crisis. Five years of war in Iraq is indeed straining our troop force and their equipment. Yet the Bush administration wants more of the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, this Democratic-led Congress will continue to fight to change direction in Iraq and responsibly redeploy our troops home.

House Democrats are working to pass a comprehensive energy plan that lowers prices for consumers, expands renewable energy and creates good-paying jobs here at home. 
   The old Bush-Cheney policy, written by and for the oil companies, is the gift that keeps on giving to Big Oil; more land, more public land, more taxpayer dollars and more record profits. 
   Every Representative in this House has a clear choice this month: Talk about an all-of-the-above plan, or take action. They can join with Democrats in siding with consumers struggling with energy costs, or continue to side with Big Oil. They can support a policy that will create good-paying American jobs and increase our Nation's security, or continue to argue for a drill-only plan. As T. Boone Pickens has said clearly, this is one problem we cannot drill our way out of.

   Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, an interim report last week by the White House confirmed what most observers believe, that the situation in Iraq is not improving. The Iraqi Government has failed to meet the political benchmarks endorsed by the President last January. The Iraqi security forces continue to perform below expected levels. But the President continues to ask us stubbornly to stay the course. 
   At the same time, U.S. troops are overextended, many having served multiple tours in Iraq. This is unfair to our soldiers, their families, and dangerous for our national security. As Major General John Batiste recently noted, ``Iraq is distracting America from what should be the focus ..... It is in America's best interest to rethink our national strategy, deliberately disengage from Iraq, refit and rearm the military, get serious about homeland security, and prepare to win the next phase of the struggle. 
   Last week this House voted to do exactly that. This Democratic House joins with the American people and our retired generals in demanding a new direction in Iraq. This week the Senate can join us by supporting the Levin-Reed amendment.

The Kaiser Family Foundation recently released a study that shows each time the unemployment rate increases by one percentage point, an additional 600,000 children lose their insurance. 
   Congress has worked hard to ensure that our children have access to health care coverage through the CHIP program. In strong bipartisan votes, this Congress has repeatedly sent President Bush legislation that would provide 10 million children quality health care coverage, but repeatedly, he vetoed the legislation and prevented us from reaching more children. 
   This legislation is even more important today as more Americans are losing their jobs and their health care, and yet President Bush and most Republicans in this Chamber refuse to ensure that 10 million children have access to quality health care.

   Mr. CARNAHAN. Madam Speaker, while the Bush administration has had no problem bailing out Wall Street firms at taxpayers' expense, it has opposed efforts to help ordinary homeowners. As many as 2.8 million Americans could lose their homes in the next 5 years due to the subprime mortgage crisis. Housing prices have dropped so much that homeowners' debt on their houses exceeds equity for the first time since 1945, and now more than 10 percent of homeowners have mortgage loans that are larger than the value of their homes. 
   These troubling signs have been before the administration for many months, but they have refused to bring forth a proposal to address them until yesterday, and that mainly addresses only regulatory issues. 
   Fortunately, this Congress did not follow the White House's lead. This House has already passed legislation this year that would expand affordable mortgage loan opportunities for families at risk of foreclosures. 
   Madam Speaker, this is only the beginning. We can't do this alone. The President must finally recognize there is a problem and be willing to sign these bills into law when they get to his desk.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARNAHAN. Madam Speaker, yesterday this House made the historic step of reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as SCHIP, so we can give 10 million low-income children health care. This plan not only ensures current enrollees do not lose coverage, but it will help cover 3 million additional children in low-income families who are currently eligible for the program but not yet enrolled. 
   Unfortunately, President Bush has threatened to veto the bill over and over. He instead supports his own plan which would actually result in thousands of low-income kids losing their health care coverage, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. 
   It is also important to mention that the plan we passed is fully paid for. This is in stark contrast to the over $400 billion that the President has already asked the taxpayers to spend in Iraq. In fact, for the cost of just over 3 months in Iraq, we could insure these 10 million children for 5 years without adding to our Nation's debt. 
   Madam Speaker, it is time for the President to reconsider his ill-advised veto threat and pledge to protect health coverage for America's children in need.

   During that 6-year period, Republicans controlled every branch of government. They instituted their plan that eliminated government regulation of big business. That's the Republican philosophy. Get government out of the way and let big business have their way. 
   Well, Wall Street had their way. For 6 years, large financial institutions were allowed to trade, to borrow, to loan funds to Americans and other institutions without anyone watching. That's the way Washington Republicans wanted it. Now we are seeing the results, the financial crisis on Wall Street and more pain on Main Street. 
   Today, the Bush administration wants this Congress to approve a Wall Street recovery package to the tune of $700 billion with no strings attached. We simply cannot give this administration a blank check on the backs of American taxpayers, and their children, and their grandchildren.

   I would like to thank my distinguished colleagues, Ms. Solis, Mr. Gilchrest, and Mr. Kirk for their work on this amendment. 
   One of the important pieces of this bill is The ``International Climate Cooperation Re-engagement'' section, which seeks to re-engage U.S. involvement in global climate change and will work to reduce global greenhouse emissions worldwide. 
   Our amendment will help us take another step in reducing the effects of global climate change. 
   Numerous reports have found that climate change is directly linked to, and has a disproportionate effect on, developing countries by threatening the world's water supply and contributing to global poverty. 
   In June 2007, the United Nations High Representative for Least Developed Countries issued a report stating that climate change was the one of the most severe threats facing the least developed countries of the world. 
   As one of the largest greenhouse gas emitting countries in the world, it is our responsibility to help other countries adapt to the effects of global warming. 
   This amendment will take a crucial step by requiring a report on the adaptation needs of developing countries, and developing a strategy to address those needs.

   I stand here today for my constituents in Missouri in strong support of H.R. 3 and its strong ethical standards. Stem cell research holds real promise of cures for many, many diseases we have heard about today. 
   Expanding the President's artificially restrictive policy will support the hopes of millions of Americans who struggle every day to survive under the burden of a life-altering diagnosis or a life-ending disease. Science, not politics, should determine the future of this vital research. 
   Last Congress, this House passed this legislation with extraordinary bipartisan effort. It is my sincere hope that we will not have to wait much longer before this bill becomes law. Every day we wait is another day that people suffer needlessly. We stand here with the tools in our hands to ease the pain of so many across this country. 
   Decades ago, Martin Luther King called Americans to act with fierce urgency of now. Today, it is time to act with fierce urgency on life-saving cures. Let's pass H.R. 3 and the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act again, and we all urge the President to reconsider his veto.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, today was a remarkable day in this new 110th  Congress. This House in a bipartisan way came together, under the leadership of Congresswoman Diana DeGette of Colorado and Michael Castle of Delaware, to pass a bipartisan measure with a strong vote, 253-174, a bill that would expand the stem cell research in this country and lead to great cures, cures which promise to help people turn around their lives, people that have suffered through debilitating and life-threatening diseases. 
   Stem cell research holds the promise to help those who suffer from heart disease, various cancers, diabetes, Alzheimer's, kidney disease, liver disease, Parkinson's, to name a few. 
   Breakthroughs in research are happening every day. But with the bill passed today in this new Congress, even more can be done to provide hope and lifesaving cures to the millions of Americans affected by these diseases. 
   While there are ethical issued surrounding medical research of any kind, I do not believe that we should unreasonably restrict new medical research and prevent Americans from receiving lifesaving treatments. President Bush's current restrictions are unreasonable and arbitrary. 
   I believe it is imperative that legislation concerning stem cell research contain strong ethical standards over the conduct of research, and the bill passed today provides such high standards. 
   Many people have asked me about my best day during my first term in the 109th Congress that just concluded. I can say, without question, the day was May 24, 2005, because it was a day that gave the best hope for lifesaving cures for so many. Those hopes were, unfortunately, dashed when President Bush vetoed the bill, H.R. 810 in the last Congress. 
   We have come together again, passed this bill with an even stronger bipartisan vote, and I expect it will go to the Senate and pass there again with another strong bipartisan vote. And I would urge the President to reconsider his position. So many people's lives, the quality of lives for their families depend on this research continuing. 
   This bill, as I said, contained detailed ethical standards on this type of research, and that is an important part of this legislation going forward. This issue has united Americans and actually united this Congress in powerful ways and with a strong voice. 
   My home State of Missouri has taken a lead in this debate. Expanding stem cell research is supported by 72 percent of Americans from across the political spectrum, and that goes for my home State of Missouri. This past November, Missourians came out to the polls in record numbers in support of stem cell research that holds the potential for lifesaving cures. Our State passed a ballot initiative that ensures Missourians will have access to any stem cell research and cures that are allowed under Federal law and available to other Americans. And it also included strong ethical standards for conducting that research. 
   Acting in response to the countless Americans who want a new direction in this new Congress, we have begun to respond. Today, the people's House actually acted on behalf of the American people and generations to come. Members from both sides of the aisle came together in support of the pursuit of lifesaving cures and passed H.R. 3, the Stem Cell Research Act. 
   It is my strong hope that the message of hope sent by both the American people and their Representatives will be heard by President Bush. By signing this vital legislation now into law, the President can provide the hope of potential lifesaving cures to millions of Americans.

Madam Speaker, a week ago Friday, the market dropped 400-plus points, and the Air Force announced its award of a refueling aircraft contract to foreign-based Airbus over U.S.-based Boeing. At a time when we are working on national economic stimulus plans for our sagging economy, outsourcing vital defense work and good-paying jobs raises questions that are both troubling and alarming. Their decision to reward foreign interests by spending $40 billion abroad has been ridiculed. Many today are still shaking their heads. It reminds me of a time not long ago when we were being asked to relinquish control of our ports. This latest debacle doesn't make sense, and it is not good for our country. 
   Air Force officials have agreed to move up a debriefing with Boeing officials to explain why they would outsource the construction of 179 aerial tankers abroad. Adding insult to injury, many believe the Air Force decision will end up actually buying a more costly and less capable aircraft.  
   Many Members are disturbed by what has transpired as a result of this deal. It degrades our national defense industry. It diminishes economic development opportunities and jobs here at home.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to really thank Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon for their leadership on this bill under consideration today. The Improving Head Start Act of 2007 is a very good bill, and I am pleased to be able to support it and be here today and speak on this amendment. 
   I want to inquire first, before I got into the text of this, if there are any others that wanted to speak on our side, having just gotten into the Chamber. If not, I will proceed. 
   I am presenting this amendment to H.R. 1429 based on recommendations I received from my district Head Start leaders to address the goal of maintaining quality in the Head Start program. My amendment would allow for Head Start grantees to negotiate a funded enrollment level with the HHS Secretary if funding for the program does not keep pace with inflation. 
   Over the past 3 years, Head Start and Early Head Start have experienced an estimated 8 percent real decline, adjusted for inflation, in Federal funding from fiscal year 2002 through fiscal year 2007. If this trend were to continue, the decline in funding would climb to 10 percent for Head Start programs. If President Bush's budget were to become law, the Head Start programs would suffer an 11 percent cut. 
   This decline in funding has required already efficient Head Start agencies across the country to tighten their belts even more. Sadly, local agencies are now forced to pass these cuts on to quality staff.     
   By default, agencies are unable to compete for the best and brightest of early childhood educators, thus risking the quality of Head Start programs. Our local agencies are forced to make the worst in managerial choices. As Chairman Miller and others have pointed out, we must maintain and enhance both funding and quality. 
   In my congressional district, I am proud to say that the four primary organizations responsible for administering Head Start services have successfully revitalized the program in the city of St. Louis. From 2001 to 2003, the enrolled number of children grew from about 1,000 to a full enrollment of 3,000 children. 
   Unfortunately, the compensation of St. Louis area Head Start staff has lagged behind the salaries of those in comparable positions. After consulting with some of the brightest business leaders in our area, our local agencies have taken extraordinary steps to conserve costs and maximize efficiencies. Even with these steps, agencies are unable to keep staff compensation in line with inflation increases both in wages and insurance costs. 
   Programs in St. Louis and across the country are at a serious risk of losing quality staff due to this critical situation. In fact, many of you may have agencies within your districts that have experienced worse cuts across their service lines. They have turned to cutting key staff, reducing the number of weeks they operate in a year, and reducing the number of hours they operate in a day just in order to adjust for financial constraints. We must ensure that the historic quality and strength of Head Start is not placed in jeopardy. 
   Many of us know the vast evidence demonstrating the profound difference Head Start makes both in the lives of children served and in our local communities. I know that has been talked about at great length here in presenting this bill. 
   I just want to close and say, I think all of us would agree that Head Start programs should not have the right to request reduced enrollment levels unless they have taken all appropriate steps to achieve efficiency first. I want to clarify that my amendment gives HHS the discretion to determine whether or not individual agencies have explored all possible solutions prior to requesting reduced funded enrollment. The grantee must demonstrate that any reduction in enrollment is necessary to maintain the quality of services. 
   I appreciate, again, all the efforts on this bill that have brought this forth in a bipartisan way, and appreciate the amendment being considered.

   I really want to thank Chairman Gordon, Chairman Baird and Ranking Member Ehlers for their work on this bill. Under their leadership, our committee has produced a remarkable amount of quality legislation, including this bill before the House tonight. 
   Our country's global competitiveness is directly linked to the ability of our math, science and engineering professionals to develop innovative technologies, policies and scientific breakthroughs. 
   Yet while it is important to support these professionals and their industries today, it is perhaps of even greater importance to support their professions and industries of tomorrow. 
   In order for our Nation to compete with countries around the world, we must ensure that we increase the educational opportunities for our youth to study and pursue careers in math, science and engineering, while also investing in programs to enrich the quality of these opportunities. 
   Making both research and the education of our children a national priority is not simply an investment in these fields. Our global competitiveness is directly tied to our Nation's economy and national security. 
   NSF plays a critical role in influencing our global competitiveness as it supports science and engineering across all disciplines. 
   Each year NSF supports an average of about 200,000 scientists, engineers, educators and students at universities, laboratories and field sites all over the U.S., including many great institutions in my home State of Missouri. 
   H.R. 1867 authorizes the necessary funds for NSF which will allow the agency to foster relationships between academia and industry in order to spawn U.S. competitiveness and further the Agency's traditions of education in science, technology, engineering and math, the STEM, fields. 
   I urge my colleagues to invest in the future of our children, in our country's global competitiveness and support this bill.

Mr. Speaker, during a speech at the Republican National Convention in 2004, President Bush said, ``In a new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for the government's health insurance programs.'' But instead the President, just minutes ago, vetoed health insurance for 10 million low-income children. 
   The President's objections were without merit and did not warrant a veto. The bill does not expand the CHIP program. Instead, it maintains current eligibility requirements while enrolling more uninsured children. It is not a move towards ``socialized health care.'' States will continue to receive funding through block grants, which nearly all States use. And this investment in the health care of our Nation's children is fully paid for, unlike the President's ongoing Iraq funding requests. 
   Mr. Speaker, I sincerely had hoped the President would have a change of heart and fulfill his promise to enroll children in this health care program. But he failed to do so. Now every Member of this House must vote to override the President to provide for the health care of America's children.

   I believe Members from both sides of the aisle can agree that renewable energy and energy efficiency will be a big part of our effort to wean ourselves from a dangerous reliance on foreign oil. 
   This new and developing sector of the economy will generate thousands of new jobs, high-paying green collar jobs, that will remain in America and won't be outsourced. 
   The union of renewable energy and energy efficiency with the built environment will not only generate new jobs and new technology, but it will help to immediately address global climate change. According to recent studies, the quickest and easiest way to positively affect global climate change is to design and build--or retrofit--high-performance green buildings. These buildings are energy efficient, healthy, safe, and secure. 
   Developing buildings that use renewable energy and seeking energy efficiency is a win for the economy, for the environment, and for the people who work in them.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARNAHAN. (MOMENT OF SILENCE IN MEMORY OF THE LATE HONORABLE ROBERT YOUNG, FORMER MEMBER OF CONGRESS -- (House of Representatives - October 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer words of condolence to the family and friends and colleagues of former Missouri Congressman, Robert A. Young, III. 
   Well-known for his stalwart defense of working men and women, Congressman Young left St. Louis a better place today as a result of his work in this House. Here he founded the Blue Collar Caucus and served on the Public Works Committee. 
   After serving in the Missouri legislature, he was elected to Congress in 1976 with his Missouri classmates, Ike Skelton and Dick Gephardt. His devotion to public service never wavered, from the time of his early military service in World War II, where he took part in the landing on Utah Beach on D-Day and the Battle of the Bulge, earning the Bronze Star. 
   Bob Young inspired generations of St. Louisans to seek out the American Dream, personifying the importance of his family, his union, and his community. Congressman Young will be long remembered for his efforts to turn ideas into reality. He committed himself to making sure our Nation's roadways, railways, and airways were safe for all of us, insisting that our transportation system be state-of-the-art. 
   Like the proud pipefitter he was, everyone privileged enough to know him would agree the work we do here on behalf of our Nation today must be completed, leaving no job left undone. Rightfully we pause to thank him for his service to Missouri, this House and our Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Missouri from the Second Congressional District.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARNAHAN. (SOWING THE SEEDS THROUGH SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 363, the Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Research Act. 
   I first want to thank Chairman Gordon for his leadership on the important issue of innovation, and commend our Committee's work towards investing in our research communities. 
   This past August, I invited Chairman Gordon to join me in a panel to discuss the subject of Innovation back in St. Louis. The Event was a tremendous success and sparked a conversation about competitiveness, STEM education and innovation that still continues with enthusiasm in St. Louis. 
   While this is an issue that warrants much discussion, the time has come for bold action. 
   Unfortunately, our nation's standing as the global leader in science and technology has slipped in recent years. 
   H.R. 363 will counteract this worrying trend by investing in long-term scientific research and encouraging young scientists and researchers to pursue high-risk and high-reward research. 
   Specifically, the bill administers awards to outstanding early-career researchers in academia and in nonprofit research organizations, provides graduate research assistantships in areas of national need and establishes a national coordination office to prioritize university and national research infrastructure needs. By investing in our young researchers, we invest in the ideas that will shape our country's future. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill to advance our nation's status as a leader in the global economy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Chairman, I stand today with enthusiastic support for H.R. 362, 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act. 
   I want to add my thanks to Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall for their leadership on this issue and continued commitment of our entire Science and Technology Committee and the Research and Science Education Subcommittee. 
   Last year, I received a letter from a mother in New Jersey whose 14-year-old daughter was not satisfied with her education. This young girl wanted permission from her parents to move to Beijing, China, for high school because she felt like her counterparts were getting ahead of her education here in the United States. 
   To me, this story underscores the need for our Nation to strengthen its investment in education, and it is consistent with the international statistics that we have seen of U.S. students falling behind in both the number of graduates and in academic performance with regard to science and math education.  
   In particular, America must make a major renewed commitment to education in math and science and engineering to promote innovation and technological advancement. 
   As public servants, our constituents have entrusted us with the responsibility of ensuring our educators have the tools they need to best serve our young people. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation to create a brighter future for our children, expanded support for our teachers, increased innovation in our research and technology, and a stronger competitive edge for the U.S. in the growing world marketplace.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARNAHAN. Madam Speaker, today I rise to join in those sponsoring H. Con. Res. 322, celebrating the 60th anniversary of Israel's independence. 
   On May 14, 1948, the people of Israel proclaimed the establishment of the sovereign and independent State of Israel; and just minutes later in the White House, President Harry Truman signed the order so the U.S. would also recognize this new Jewish State of Israel. 
   Since then, the U.S. has had a close and special relationship with the State of Israel, shared democratic values and common strategic interests with the people of Israel and the United States. 
   The people of Israel have fought costs of war, have fought terrorism, and diplomatic and economic boycotts, and still they remain committed to peace and security in their country and the region. 
   I have had the privilege to visit the country twice and witness the strength and resilience of the people of Israel. They are committed to freedom of speech and freedom of religion. In this thriving democracy, we need to continue that support and the commitment to the peace process, and I congratulate Israel on the 60th anniversary of their independence.

   Mr. CARNAHAN. Madam Speaker, I would like to take this time to congratulate the citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina on their 16th anniversary of independence. 
   It is an honor for me to represent the largest Bosnian-American population in the United States, as well as cochair the bipartisan Congressional Caucus on Bosnia with Congressman Chris Smith of New Jersey. Our Bosnian-American neighbors who have come to St. Louis and the other parts of the U.S. have contributed a great deal to our country. 
   I am proud that on April 7, 1992, the United States was one of the first nations to recognize the newly independent Bosnia-Herzegovina. As we honor the anniversary of their independence today, let us reaffirm our support for Bosnia's progress toward Euro-Atlantic integration and remember their long history of multi-ethnic and religious tolerance. 
   I would like to applaud their democratic orientation, and strongly encourage the further strengthening of government reforms with respect to human rights, rule of law and free market economy. 
   I once again congratulate the citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina on the anniversary of their independence, and I look forward to further collaboration between our two countries.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARNAHAN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSTRUCTION, OPERATION, AND MAINTENANCE OF ARTERIAL ROAD IN ST. LOUIS COUNTY, MISSOURI -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARNAHAN. Chairman Oberstar, thank you and Ranking Member Mica and the gentleman from Wisconsin here today for working with me  to move this important legislation along. Also, special thanks to your staff and committee staff on both sides that have been helpful in moving this legislation. On behalf of myself and the citizens the Third District in Missouri, I want to thank them all. 
   This bill, H.R. 1129, means a great deal to the congressional district I represent in Lemay, St. Louis County, Missouri. It will allow the construction, maintenance and operation of a road to a community in South St. Louis County hard hit by the great flood of 1993. This Lemay Connector Road, as it is called, is vital to the long-term recovery of that community. It will bring badly needed jobs and tax revenues to the area, support the cleanup of brownfields sites, and create new parks and recreational opportunities. 
   The transformation taking place in this area is the type communities dream about, turning environmentally contaminated idle property into hundreds of millions of dollars in economic development, thousands of new jobs, and wonderful recreational opportunities alongside a national treasure, the Mississippi River. 
   In 1993, Lemay, Missouri, just south of St. Louis, was hard hit by the flood of 1993. In the aftermath, Community Development Block Grant funds were used to acquire certain parcels of land which carried with them FEMA deed restrictions. St. Louis County has since acquired the land, but deed restrictions still apply. 
   Years ago, this area was home to businesses providing thousands of jobs for this community. Unfortunately, by-products heavily polluted the area, and since the closure of businesses, four specific sites, including the former National Lead Site, which closed in 1978, the Carondolet Coke site, which closed in 1992, the Stupp Brothers site, which closed in 1998, and the National Imaging and Mapping Agency site, closed in 1994, have since been designated as brownfields. Thankfully, clean up and redevelopment of the land will come to fruition as the Lemay connector road is built. 
   Since 1993, the Federal Government has invested more than $33 million in South St. Louis City and County region for the purpose of revitalizing these communities. In addition, the State and local community have come together to plan the redevelopment of this area. Plans include new businesses, which will generate thousands of new jobs, a bandshell, ice skating rink, bowling alley, multi-screen movie complex, a new county park with soccer and baseball fields. The proposed Lemay connector road will provide access to all this, the four abandoned brownfield sites, and complete the link to the Great Rivers Greenway regional ring of trails. 
   In 2003, the Missouri Department of Transportation conducted a federally funded survey with regard to the area and decided it was one of the top priorities for the region.     
   The planned road is authorized by this legislation and has been identified by means of an environmental assessment as the environmentally preferred route. 
   The road is considered safe by the Missouri Department of Transportation, has been endorsed by its officials, and also the local police and fire departments, because it will enable city and county to reduce first responder times. Most importantly, the planned road has the unwavering support of community leaders. 
   In addition to the public access benefits already stated, the road will include dedicated bicycle paths and sidewalks, and provide improved access to schools, community institutions and parks, and I want to name a few in the area: Hancock Place School District, Notre Dame High School, Metropolitan Sewer District, St. Louis Enterprise Center in South County, Lemay Child and Family Center, Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery, and a park and planned military history complex. In addition, park areas include the Black Forest Park, Lemay Park, and the Great Rivers regional system of interconnected parks and trails. 
   The bill costs the Federal Government nothing. The cost of the road will be incurred by the county in cooperation with local developers. This legislation has broad bipartisan support in Missouri and here in the Congress among our congressional delegation, including my Missouri colleague on the Transportation Committee, Mr. Graves. The legislation specifically authorizes the Lemay connective road to be built over deed-restricted parcels of land. 
   In an attempt to avoid the same disastrous consequences of the flood of 1993, the bill requires the county to take appropriate flood mitigation efforts upon constructing the road. It is the intent of Congress that prior to constructing the road, adjacent or nearby land of approximately equal size and value of the easement necessary to build the road, about 0.3 acres, will be designated for open space, recreational use, or wetlands management. 
   Finally, consistent with existing law, the Federal Government will not be liable for any flooding caused by the construction, maintenance and operation of the road. 
   My colleagues, this is a good bill that will have remarkably positive impacts on the Lemay community in Missouri. I urge your support and passage of H.R. 1129. 
   I want to conclude by giving special thanks to our St. Louis County executive, Charlie Dooley, and his staff in St. Louis County, and all those working with the county for their impressive work on this project. 
   I can't wait to travel on the new Lemay connector road, to take a tour of the newly opened businesses, community center, and take a bike ride along the Great Rivers Greenway.

   Mr. CARNAHAN. Madam Speaker, with record temperatures set in the first half of 2006, the need for Congress  in this country to address global warming is more pressing than ever, especially in light of the mounting scientific reports from around the world. There is no longer any real debate within the scientific community. 
   There is broad scientific consensus that global warming exists, and we must act. We still have the opportunity to reverse the negative effects of global climate change. However, this must be done both here at home and in cooperation around the world. That is why, just before Earth Day this past weekend, my colleague and I, Mark Kirk, introduced H. Con. Res 104, a bipartisan resolution expressing the need for the U.S. to participate in international agreements that address global climate change and to put this Congress on record acknowledging climate change. 
   I invite my colleagues to cosponsor this bill. There is a companion in the Senate. Please join me in taking this early step to begin addressing climate change in this country and around the world.

   Mr. CARNAHAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the energy bill that will finally take our energy policy in a new direction, and I urge the President to sign it into law. This bill makes a big step toward greater energy independence and energy security. 
   The bill includes an historic increase in fuel economy standards, the first since 1975. This increase will save American families an estimated $700 to $1,000 a year at the pump and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. We must pursue an energy policy that moves the U.S. towards energy independence, reduces the cost of gasoline to consumers, enhances the development of alternative energy, and substantially reduces threats of global warming. 
   This bill also sends a clear signal to the rest of the world that the U.S. is finally serious about getting our energy and environmental policy in order. However, we still have more work to do on this issue, and this new Congress is committed to get the job done.

This bill would expand and facilitate the use of Federal historic preservation tax credit and create a new historic preservation tax credit for our homeowners. The economic incentives created by the bill will produce historic preservation, economic growth, and spawn jobs. 
   A study of the Missouri Historic Preservation Tax Credit program, a widely respected program that expands upon the current Federal program, showed State assistance of $74 million in tax credits contributed to $267 million in Missouri income, $381 million in gross State product and 10,278 Missouri jobs. 
   The State of Missouri has led the way in creating the most utilized historic preservation tax credit in the country, and I am proud to bring my home State's successes to the Federal level. H.R. 610 will provide the economic incentive necessary to save our historic treasures, while simultaneously creating a far-reaching monetary benefit.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARNAHAN. Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate the gentleman from Georgia on his legislation, and I look forward to working with him on those efforts with many others here in the House. 
   When the American people and this Congress stand in unity, great change is possible. Last fall from every corner of our Nation, we spoke loud and clear to demand an end to the Bush administration's open-ended stay-the-course policy in Iraq and start a new direction. That unity has changed control of this very Congress, led to the departure of Secretary Rumsfeld, helped drive the bipartisan consensus behind the Iraq Study Group recommendations. 
   Yet the Bush administration, in response, proposes another escalation, a so-called surge. As I said last month on this floor, the escalation plan flies in the face of military experts, of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, Democratic and Republican leaders in this Congress, and the American public. This Congress has a solemn duty to listen and take action. 
   Recently, the mother of a young soldier being deployed back to Iraq told me, Congressman Carnahan, I am one of those mothers who is against the war in Iraq. But my son volunteered to serve his country. Please be sure they get the support and equipment they need to come home quickly and safely. 
   That mother's heartfelt request is a powerful example of our national unity and resolve to support our troops and oppose the escalation policy that is not making the Iraqi Government more self-reliant, not making the Middle East region more stable, and not making our country safer. 
   Next week, after this Iraq war has extended longer even than World War II, this Congress will have an historic, long, and thorough debate about the escalation plan. I believe the result will be a bipartisan vote reflecting the reality that a fourth U.S. escalation is the wrong direction for our country. 
   When this Congress acts in unison with the American people, great change is possible. In the weeks and months ahead, I believe this Congress will undertake its constitutional responsibilities with all seriousness and dispatch to continue this solemn debate, to exercise detailed oversight, and to use the tools available to us to change the direction of the war, to support our troops, to de-escalate the war, and to escalate the political solution in Iraq. 
   Working together, great change is possible.

   Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for H.R. 2206, the U.S. Troops Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability appropriations Act. This legislation will fund our troops, protect our veterans, and give the much needed relief to the Gulf region while sending a clear message to the Iraqi government that they will not receive a blank check. 
   However, I would like to express my displeasure that the bill includes a rescission of nearly $683 million in unobligated highway funds. The cost of the Iraq war has already taken too many lives and costs way too much money. Our nation's infrastructure is at a breaking point, and cannot afford to be subjected to further cuts. At a time when increased investment in our roadways is critical, this rescission hurts our Federal-aid highway program. Some roads in my District have been rated among the most dangerous in the country and it is critical that we fully fund highway improvements to ensure the safety of our constituents. I look forward to soon having the opportunity to vote to restore these funds.

   This new Democratic Congress has made reauthorizing WRDA a top priority. I thank Chairman Oberstar and Subcommittee Chairwoman Johnson for their work in quickly moving this bill of national significance to help protect America's waterways. 
   These projects are vital to my home State of Missouri. Our local economy is driven by use of such important routes as the Mississippi, Missouri, and Illinois Rivers. Commerce on these rivers will be greatly benefited by this bill's strong commitment to repair current locks and reconstruct new locks on the Mississippi River. 
   As a member of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, I have fought on behalf of my constituents to secure new levels of funding to help throughout our region. In particular, the bill authorizes $35 million for combined sewer overflow elimination in St. Louis. Some of our wastewater infrastructure dates back to the Lincoln administration.  
   The great flood of 1993 exposed serious flaws in the St. Louis flood wall. This bill addresses that. 
   Lastly, this bill continues the exciting progress of the Great Rivers Greenway in St. Louis City and County. By creating an aquatic ecosystem restoration, constructing bike paths, and increasing access to the Mississippi River, my constituents will gain more use of one of our national treasures. 
   These projects are important to the strength of our community and the health of our waterways. I stand in strong support of H.R. 1495.

   This close-knit community of Kirkwood, Missouri, struggles this week over the loss of loved ones. The wounded, especially Mayor Mike Swoboda, who remains hospitalized, and the chill to public servants and citizens from the violence in Kirkwood City Hall at the level of democratic government closest to the people. 
   I saw firsthand last Friday night at the Kirkwood community's candlelight vigil the way this community has come together through this tragedy, uplifted by ordinary people performing extraordinary acts of heroism, caring, and love. The hearts and prayers of all Missouri and the Nation go out to the families now grieving. 
   First, our obligation is to care for the wounded and honor the lost, who were lost while on duty in the high calling of public service. We lost two city council members, Councilwoman Connie Karr and Councilman Michael Lynch; two police officers, Officer Tom Ballman and Officer William Biggs; and Public Works Director Kenneth Yost. 
   We search our hearts and minds to understand what went wrong that terrible day this past week, to honor their public service, and to learn from this breakdown in the public square. Rightly, we come together to let them know they are not alone in their suffering. We know each and every one of them found purpose in life helping others and as public servants in the public good. One person, Dick Reeves, posted a comment on the St. Louis Post Dispatch site that impressed me and it summed up how to deal with this tragedy. He said, ``If something positive comes out of this horrific tragedy, please let it be that in the memory of these good people, each and every one of us dedicates ourselves to treating our elected officials and each other at home, work, school, play, and while driving with respect, decency, and kindness. We can do it. Let our actions be their monument.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of taking tough but absolutely necessary action to help save thousands of jobs that affect every State in our Union including my home State of Missouri. Our country is experiencing a crisis and the problems facing automakers must be fixed to help stabilize our entire economy. 
   Missouri has the second-highest number, along with Ohio, of automobile plants in the Nation just after Michigan, but the truth is this problem is much larger than the Big Three. A failure of the auto manufacturing industry not only directly affects the dealerships, parts-makers, those with existing car warranties, it also puts thousands upon thousands out of work--3.3 million nationwide after direct and indirect hits are factored. Our country is already facing historically high unemployment. We cannot afford to let our manufacturing industry fail; we cannot afford to lose 3.3 million more American jobs. 
   Missouri has already been hit hard by auto manufacturing line closures in addition to layoffs crossing all sectors of the economy. The ramifications of doing nothing would be detrimental to our Nation's already crippling economy. In my home State of Missouri, thousands of jobs are on the verge of being permanently lost. The auto industry's roots in our State's economy are far reaching. This is a necessary investment for America's future. 
   Realizing that as soon as next year, or even sooner, we could lose General Motors, Chrysler, and Ford is a main street dilemma that requires immediate attention and action by Congress. Without action, we are putting our Nations' economic and national security at risk. Make no mistake, the loss of the American automobile industry, will cripple communities throughout Missouri and throughout our Nation. 
   There have been decades of foot dragging to produce smaller more fuel-efficient vehicles right here in the U.S. while U.S. subsidiaries are producing and selling these vehicles overseas with huge success. It's time for the American people have the same opportunity to purchase these vehicles. Everyone understands that was a huge mistake and we must do everything possible to correct it. 
   In the past, loans to the industry have actually paid off for the American taxpayer, and this bill does everything possible to ensure this will happen again. This bill institutes safeguards to protect taxpayer dollars and promotes future financial and economic success for our country. If the automakers do not present a feasible restructuring plan to get back on the right track early next year they will be cut off. 
   I want to make one point clear to the auto industry: loans given to them by the American people should be used to invest in America's interests. I don't want to hear about taxpayer dollars being used to build plants overseas. We are facing record-high unemployment. We must do everything we can to put people back to work. 
   Besides the plant jobs, the auto part jobs, and the service industry jobs that are intertwined with their manufacturing, will be the shuttering of businesses that rely on the employment of tens of thousands in my home State alone, more than 3 million nationwide. 
   Bankruptcy of one or more of the Big Three poses a huge risk. Mere questions of warranty and availability of parts, could trigger the collapse of manufacturing causing deep rooted problems that affect everyone. 
   American innovation and engineering may be close to delivering the most energy efficient cars the world has ever known and the United States desperately needs. American innovation has been, is, and must continue to be the world's leader. 
   While it is evident that the Big Three have made mistakes, it's important to note that market share is not down, and overall car sales worldwide are down across the board. Other countries continue to augment their manufacturers. For years foreign manufacturers have not had to absorb escalating healthcare costs. Ironically, in the U.S. many of these foreign manufacturers enjoy a variety of tax credits and tax liability waivers. 
   I have met and consulted with a wide-range of Missouri stakeholders including the Big Three, suppliers, UAW members, and auto dealers. All of the stakeholders are going to have to make concessions to put together a sustainable plan for the future. It's important that everyone come together for the greater good. Everyone loses if our auto industry goes bankrupt. 
   This comprehensive legislation will help the struggling U.S. auto industry in the short term, while protecting millions of American jobs and taxpayers. The limited loans of $14 billion are intended to help the struggling automakers survive while they prepare plans to restructure their companies to build more competitive, fuel-efficient, and technologically advanced vehicles. 
   This country should not give up on our automotive industry. If the auto industry doesn't make real progress by early next year we can and should reevaluate leadership and if need be demand the repayment of loans sooner rather than later. 
   It's important to recognize that this problem is just one piece to a complicated economic mess. We must get the auto industry back on their feet and we must get credit in the hands of the American people so that they can receive the loans necessary to purchase the next generation of American ingenuity. 
   I'm hopeful Americans will again prove to the world that we can overcome competing interests and rally together for the common good.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARNAHAN. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARNAHAN. Madam Chairman, I am proud to rise in support of H.R. 5501, properly named after our former Chairmen Lantos and Hyde, both of whom I had the honor to serve under on the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
   I also want to thank President Bush for reaffirming his commitment to Africa in his State of the Union but also to being open to improvements in how we deliver our support in Africa. 
   I want to also add my thanks to Chairman Berman and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen for their leadership in bringing this to the floor, but especially to Chairman Berman for his great instincts to reach out and craft an achievable and better bill in this Congress in this way. 
   Today, we have an opportunity to improve the way the U.S. funds and administers these HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria programs around the world. I believe that it is important to make real changes and real progress in reauthorizing this vital life-saving program. 
   In February, I had the opportunity to travel to Ethiopia and study and investigate the effectiveness of many of these programs. The positive effect that PEPFAR has had over the last several years is quite obvious: countless lives have been saved and numerous infections have been prevented. 
   I visited health clinics in rural Ethiopia, including PMTCT, family planning, and government-supported clinics. This bill makes important steps to not just increase funding but to have a more balanced approach to integrate prevention programs. 
   While I would have liked to have seen even greater integration in these programs with family planning and prevention programs, I'm pleased with the steps the bill does take and steps that are being taken in a bipartisan way that can help this be done sooner.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARNAHAN. (HONORING THOMAS F. EAGLETON FOR 50 YEARS OF PUBLIC SERVICE -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Speaker, this evening I would like to speak about a true statesman that we have lost in our country and in my home State of Missouri. We lost, over the weekend, former U.S. Senator Thomas F. Eagleton. Not only was he a true statesman, but he had a giant heart, a powerful intellect, and a keen wit. 
   He leaves behind his wife, Barbara, whom he married in 1956, two children, son Terence and daughter Christie, three grandchildren and a brother. 
   Not long ago, friends gathered in St. Louis and celebrated 50 years since Senator Eagleton had entered public service. And he had many chapters in an amazing life. He served his country honorably in the United States Navy,  stationed at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center from 1948 to 1949, continued on to graduate with honors from Amherst College in 1951 and Harvard Law School in 1953. 
   He was admitted to the Missouri Bar in 1953; proceeded in a series of offices, beginning, he was elected as the youngest circuit attorney in the city of St. Louis in its history at the age of 27. He followed that by being elected the youngest Missouri State attorney general at the age of 31, and the youngest Lieutenant Governor of the State of Missouri by age 35. 
   He went on and in 1968 was elected to the United States Senate representing Missouri. In his first term in the United States Senate, at the age of 42, he was selected by George McGovern to be his Vice Presidential candidate. And while he was only that nominee for a few days, and he will be known as such in history, he went on to serve three terms in the United States Senate, sponsoring legislation, varied, but of great importance to our country, the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, an amendment which halted the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, and as the chief author of the Federal War Powers Act that limits the authority of the President to conduct war without congressional approval. 
   After an amazing career in public service, he came home to St. Louis, and there he gave back to his community, to new generations of people to encourage them in public service, to new generations of students. He was a professor at Washington University in St. Louis and St. Louis University where he shared his vast knowledge and experience with young people who will be our leaders of tomorrow. 
   To others in public service, myself, I am fortunate to say, included, he was a great mentor, example and friend. He never failed to promote the people and the notions that he felt strongly about. 
   In his private life in St. Louis, he was well known for acting with regard to the civic good and giving back to his community. He worked to bring the St. Louis Rams to St. Louis, and recently, in the 2006 elections, was a chief advocate for Missouri's amendment to the Stem Cell Initiative which passed by a vote of the people.     
   In downtown St. Louis, our new Federal courthouse is named after Senator Eagleton. It towers in our downtown just west of the famous St. Louis Arch. Thomas Eagleton's career and life towers in our country as a great example for all of us, whether we are involved in public service or not. 
   He was legendary for writing lengthy notes to people. I will treasure those notes that he has sent to me; those notes, that advice, that wise counsel that he shared with so many. 
   The impact that he has had on young people, their leadership for the future and what he has given to our great State and our country, he will be sorely missed but very well remembered.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARNAHAN. (DEMOCRATS ARE URGING THE RELEASE OF OIL FROM THE STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE TO LOWER GAS PRICES -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARNAHAN. Madam Speaker, with record-high gas prices filling oil companies' wallets with record profits and pinching the wallets of American consumers, why isn't President Bush taking action to bring down prices at the pump now? 
   Democrats in Congress are urging the President to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve which will increase the supply of oil in the market, send a strong message to speculators, and most importantly, reduce gas prices today. This administration has used the Petroleum Reserve in the past, as have the administrations of both President Clinton and President Bush I. The reserve is currently 97 percent full, the highest level ever, with enough oil to meet our national security needs and provide relief at the pump. 
   So why, when Americans continue to feel the squeeze of devastatingly high gas prices, does the President not take action? Madam Speaker, President Bush continues to talk about new drilling. But his own administration says it can't be done for at least another decade. 
   Let's provide relief at the pump today by opening up America's Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

<DOCNO>Mr. CARNAHAN. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--Continued -- (House of Representatives - June 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CARNAHAN. Mr. Chairman, it bears repeating, the statistics we have heard so many times about the language that is in this bill and what is not in this bill. There are at least 10 provisions in the bill that prohibit U.S. foreign assistance from being used to promote or perform abortions. In many of these countries, abortion is illegal. That could not be more clear. 
   I want to thank Chairwoman Lowey for her leadership on this bill and for including this commonsense, common ground, family planning provision to include contraceptives only, and not funding. 
   I rise today in strong support of both the Lowey amendment and of the contraceptives-only provision in the bill, and in opposition to the Smith amendment. 
   Under current U.S. policy, too many people in the developing world, especially Africa, contraceptives are in short supply, placing the health and well-being of millions of people at risk. President Bush has recognized the crisis and proposed a major Africa initiative. 
   The very specific and narrowly tailored language of Chairwoman Lowey's language allows the U.S. to provide contraceptives only so NGOs can provide contraceptives in developing countries. This provision is, as I say, a commonsense, common ground solution to a very real problem. This provision will reduce the number of unintended pregnancies, help prevent abortions and help stem the spread of disease, including HIV-AIDS. 
   The far-reaching impacts of this provision are immeasurable. This will make a substantive difference in the lives of women and families around the world by allowing them to protect themselves and plan and space their births. It will help slow rapid population growth, which results in poverty and instability. It will help stop the spread of HIV-AIDS. 
   I urge all my colleagues who are committed to family planning to oppose the Smith amendment, vote to support the Lowey amendment and the underlying bill.
